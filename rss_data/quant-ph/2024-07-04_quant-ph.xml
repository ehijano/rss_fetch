      <title>Unifying quantum spatial search, state transfer and uniform sampling on graphs: simple and exact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents a novel and succinct algorithmic framework via alternating quantum walks, unifying quantum spatial search, state transfer and uniform sampling on a large class of graphs. Using the framework, we can achieve exact uniform sampling over all vertices and perfect state transfer between any two vertices, provided that eigenvalues of Laplacian matrix of the graph are all integers. Furthermore, if the graph is vertex-transitive as well, then we can achieve deterministic quantum spatial search that finds a marked vertex with certainty. In contrast, existing quantum search algorithms generally has a certain probability of failure. Even if the graph is not vertex-transitive, such as the complete bipartite graph, we can still adjust the algorithmic framework to obtain deterministic spatial search, which thus shows the flexibility of it. Besides unifying and improving plenty of previous results, our work provides new results on more graphs. The approach is easy to use since it has a succinct formalism that depends only on the depth of the Laplacian eigenvalue set of the graph, and may shed light on the solution of more problems related to graphs.</description>

      <title>Large-scale quantum reservoir learning with an analog quantum computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning has gained considerable attention as quantum technology advances, presenting a promising approach for efficiently learning complex data patterns. Despite this promise, most contemporary quantum methods require significant resources for variational parameter optimization and face issues with vanishing gradients, leading to experiments that are either limited in scale or lack potential for quantum advantage. To address this, we develop a general-purpose, gradient-free, and scalable quantum reservoir learning algorithm that harnesses the quantum dynamics of neutral-atom analog quantum computers to process data. We experimentally implement the algorithm, achieving competitive performance across various categories of machine learning tasks, including binary and multi-class classification, as well as timeseries prediction. Effective and improving learning is observed with increasing system sizes of up to 108 qubits, demonstrating the largest quantum machine learning experiment to date. We further observe comparative quantum kernel advantage in learning tasks by constructing synthetic datasets based on the geometric differences between generated quantum and classical data kernels. Our findings demonstrate the potential of utilizing classically intractable quantum correlations for effective machine learning. We expect these results to stimulate further extensions to different quantum hardware and machine learning paradigms, including early fault-tolerant hardware and generative machine learning tasks.</description>

      <title>A Max-Flow approach to Random Tensor Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the entanglement entropy of a random tensor network (RTN) using tools from free probability theory. Random tensor networks are simple toy models that help the understanding of the entanglement behavior of a boundary region in the ADS/CFT context. One can think of random tensor networks are specific probabilistic models for tensors having some particular geometry dictated by a graph (or network) structure. We first introduce our model of RTN, obtained by contracting maximally entangled states (corresponding to the edges of the graph) on the tensor product of Gaussian tensors (corresponding to the vertices of the graph). We study the entanglement spectrum of the resulting random spectrum along a given bipartition of the local Hilbert spaces. We provide the limiting eigenvalue distribution of the reduced density operator of the RTN state, in the limit of large local dimension. The limit value is described via a maximum flow optimization problem in a new graph corresponding to the geometry of the RTN and the given bipartition. In the case of series-parallel graphs, we provide an explicit formula for the limiting eigenvalue distribution using classical and free multiplicative convolutions. We discuss the physical implications of our results, allowing us to go beyond the semiclassical regime without any cut assumption, specifically in terms of finite corrections to the average entanglement entropy of the RTN.</description>

      <title>Coherent information for CSS codes under decoherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stabilizer codes lie at the heart of modern quantum-error-correcting codes (QECC). Of particular importance is a class called Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) codes, which includes many important examples such as toric codes, color codes, and fractons. Recent studies have revealed that the decoding transition for these QECCs could be intrinsically captured by calculating information-theoretic quantities from the mixed state. Here we perform a simple analytic calculation of the coherent information for general CSS codes under local incoherent Pauli errors via diagonalization of the density matrices and mapping to classical statistical mechanical (SM) models. Our result establishes a rigorous connection between the decoding transition of the quantum code and the phase transition in the random classical SM model. It is also directly confirmed for CSS codes that exact error correction is possible if and only if the maximum-likelihood (ML) decoder always succeeds in the asymptotic limit. Thus, the fundamental threshold is saturated by the optimal decoder.</description>

      <title>Structure-inspired Ansatz and Warm Start of Variational Quantum Algorithms for Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a structure-inspired ansatz for addressing quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problems with the Variational Quantum Eigensolver. We propose a novel warm start technique that is based on imaginary time evolution, and allows for determining a set of initial parameters prioritizing lower energy states in a resource-efficient way. Using classical simulations, we demonstrate that this warm start method significantly improves the success rate and reduces the number of iterations required for the convergence of Variational Quantum Eigensolver. The numerical results also indicate that the warm start approach effectively mitigates statistical errors arising from a finite number of measurements, and to a certain extent alleviates the effect of barren plateaus.</description>

      <title>Certifying nonlocal properties of noisy quantum operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a unified framework to certify nonlocal properties of quantum channels from the correlations obtained in measurement protocols. Our approach gathers and extends fully- and semi-device independent methods for this purpose. We study the effect of different models of dephasing noise, some of which are shown to generate nonlocality and entanglement in special cases. In the extreme case of complete dephasing, the measurement protocols discussed yield particularly simple tests to certify nonlocality. These are based on the relations between bipartite quantum channels and their classical analogs: bipartite stochastic matrices defining conditional distributions.</description>

      <title>Physical consequences of gauge optimization in quantum open systems evolutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On its own, the invariance by gauge transformations of Markovian master equations has mostly played a mathematical or computational role in the evaluation of quantum open system dynamics. So far, the fixation of a particular gauge has only gained physical meaning when correlated with additional information such as the results of measurements carried on over the system or the environment in so-called quantum trajectories. Here, we show that gauge transformations can be exploited, on their own, to optimize practical physical tasks. To do so, first, we describe the inherent structure of the underlying symmetries in quantum Markovian dynamics and present a general formulation showing how they can be used to change the measurable values of physical quantities. We then analyze examples of optimization in quantum thermodynamics and, finally, we discuss the practical implementation of the optimized protocols in terms of quantum trajectories.</description>

      <title>Optimized Receiver Design for Entanglement-Assisted Communication using BPSK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of pre-shared entanglement in entanglement-assisted communication offers a superior alternative to classical communication, especially in the photon-starved regime and highly noisy environments. In this paper, we analyze the performance of several low-complexity receivers that use optical parametric amplifiers. The simulations demonstrate that receivers employing an entanglement-assisted scheme with phase-shift-keying modulation can outperform classical capacities. We present a 2x2 optical hybrid receiver for entanglement-assisted communication and show that it has a roughly 10% lower error probability compared to previously proposed optical parametric amplifier-based receivers for more than 10 modes. However, the capacity of the optical parametric amplifier-based receiver exceeds the Holevo capacity and the capacities of the optical phase conjugate receiver and 2x2 optical hybrid receiver in the case of a single mode. The numerical findings indicate that surpassing the Holevo and Homodyne capacities does not require a large number of signal-idler modes. Furthermore, we find that using unequal priors for BPSK provides roughly three times the information rate advantage over equal priors.</description>

      <title>Beyond Weak Cram\'er Rao Bound for Distributed Phases Using Multiphoton Polarization GHZ State: Exact Quantum Fisher Matrix Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum-enhanced parameter estimation is critical in various fields, including distributed sensing. In this study, we focus on estimating multiple unknown phases at different spatial nodes using multiphoton polarization-entangled states. Previous research has relied on a much weaker Cram\'er-Rao bound rather than precise bounds from exact quantum Fisher information matrices. We present exact results for the distributed sensing. We find that, due to its singular nature, direct use of the quantum Fisher information matrix is not possible. We analyze the reasons for this singularity, which has prevented the determination of quantum Cram\'er-Rao bounds. We demonstrate that not all phases in distributed sensing with multiphoton entangled states are independent. We obtain non-singular matrices by identifying and removing the redundant phase from the calculation. This allows us to derive exact quantum Cram\'er-Rao bounds, which we verify are saturated by projective measurements. These bounds enable Heisenberg-limited sensing for the average phase. Our analysis is specifically applicable to N-photon GHZ states distributed across multiple nodes. This advancement is significant as it paves the way for more precise and efficient distributed sensing, enhancing the overall capabilities of quantum sensing technologies based on N photon GHZ states.</description>

      <title>Open quantum dynamics with variational non-Gaussian states and the truncated Wigner approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a framework for simulating the open dynamics of spin-boson systems by combing variational non-Gaussian states with a quantum trajectories approach. We apply this method to a generic spin-boson Hamiltonian that has both Tavis-Cummings and Holstein type couplings, and which has broad applications to a variety of quantum simulation platforms, polaritonic physics, and quantum chemistry. Additionally, we discuss how the recently developed truncated Wigner approximation for open quantum systems can be applied to the same Hamiltonian. We benchmark the performance of both methods and identify the regimes where each method is best suited to. Finally we discuss strategies to improve each technique.</description>

      <title>Pulse Design of Baseband Flux Control for Adiabatic Controlled-Phase Gates in Superconducting Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite progress towards achieving low error rates with superconducting qubits, error-prone two-qubit gates remain a bottleneck for realizing large-scale quantum computers. Therefore, a systematic framework to design high-fidelity gates becomes imperative. One type of two-qubit gate in superconducting qubits is the controlled-phase (CPHASE) gate, which utilizes a conditional interaction between higher energy levels of the qubits controlled by a baseband flux pulse on one of the qubits or a tunable coupler. In this work, we study an adiabatic implementation of CPHASE gates and formulate the design of the control trajectory for the gate as a pulse-design problem. We show in simulation that the Chebyshev-based trajectory can, in certain cases, enable gates with leakage error lower by an average of roughly 6% when compared to the widely used Slepian-based trajectory.</description>

      <title>General Communication Enhancement via the Quantum Switch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies have shown that quantum information may be effectively transmitted by a finite collection of completely depolarizing channels in a coherent superposition of different orders, via an operation known as the quantum $\tt SWITCH$. Such results are quite remarkable, as completely depolarizing channels taken in isolation and in a definite order can only output white noise. For general channels however, little is known about the potential communication enhancement provided by the quantum $\tt SWITCH$. In this Letter, we define an easily computable quantity $\mathcal{P}_n$ associated with the quantum ${\tt SWITCH}$ of $n$ copies of a fixed channel, and we conjecture that $\mathcal{P}_n&gt;0$ is both a necessary and sufficient condition for communication enhancement via the quantum $\tt SWITCH$. In support of our conjecture, we derive a simple analytic expression for the classical capacity of the quantum $\tt SWITCH$ of $n$ copies of an arbitrary Pauli channel in terms of the quantity $\mathcal{P}_n$, which we then use to show that our conjecture indeed holds in the space of all Pauli channels. Utilizing such results, we then formulate a communication protocol involving the quantum $\tt SWITCH$ which enhances the private capacity of the BB84 channel.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scaling magnets down to where quantum size effects become prominent triggers quantum tunneling of magnetization (QTM), profoundly influencing magnetization dynamics. Measuring magnetization switching in an Fe atomic chain under a carefully tuned transverse magnetic field, we observe a non-monotonic variation of magnetization lifetimes around a level crossing, known as the diabolic point (DP). Near DPs, local environment effects causing QTM are efficiently suppressed, enhancing lifetimes by three orders of magnitude. Adjusting interatomic interactions further facilitates multiple DPs. Our study provides a deeper understanding of quantum dynamics near DPs and enhances our ability to engineer a quantum magnet.</description>

Abstract: We establish a finite-time external field-driven quantum tricycle model. Within the framework of slow driving perturbation, the perturbation expansion of heat in powers of time can be derived during the heat exchange processes. Employing the method of Lagrange multiplier, we optimize the cooling performance of the tricycle by considering the cooling rate and the figure of merit, which is the product of the coefficient of performance and cooling rate, as objective functions. Our findings reveal the optimal operating region of the tricycle, shedding light on its efficient performance.</description>

      <title>Breeding the Cat Through Superposition of Two Schrodinger Kittens Based on Coupled Waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical Schrodinger's cat (SC) is highly anticipated because of the potential of realizing fault-tolerant quantum computing, but the practical merit is only shown when the amplitude is larger than 2. However, such high-amplitude cats have not been prepared due to the limitations rooted in the existing method. Here, we demonstrate a principle that a large SC-like state can be generated by the superposition of two kittens in which two nearby coherent states interfere and grow to an enlarged coherent-like state. Further, we propose a scheme to breed the cat beyond the limitation in the former works with a high probability by realizing the superposition of two SCs in coupled waveguides. The principle and scheme demonstrated here provide a new perspective on understanding quantum superposition in phase space and a better solution for the efficient generation of SCs on chips.</description>

      <title>Generalized Gouy Rotation of Electron Vortex beams in uniform magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rotation of electron vortex beams (EVBs) presents a complex interplay of the Gouy phase characterizing free-space behavior and Landau states or Larmor rotation observed in magnetic fields. Despite being studied separately, these phenomena manifest within a single beam during its propagation in magnetic fields, lacking a comprehensive description. We address this by utilizing exact solutions of the relativistic paraxial equation in magnetic fields, termed "paraxial Landau modes". The paraxial Landau modes describe the quantum states of EVBs in magnetic fields. Our study of rotation angles demonstrates consistency with experimental data, supporting the practical presence of these modes. We provide a unified description of different regimes under generalized Gouy rotation, linking the Gouy phase to EVB rotation angles. This connection enhances our understanding of the Gouy phase and can be extended to nonuniform magnetic fields. Our theoretical analysis is validated through numerical simulations using the Chebyshev method. This work offers new insights into the dynamics of EVBs in magnetic fields and suggests practical applications in beam manipulation and beam optics of vortex particles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum teleportation is not merely a fascinating corollary of quantum entanglement, it also finds utility in quantum processing and circuit compilation. In this paper, we measure and track the entanglement and fidelity of two-qubit states prepared on a 127-qubit IBM Quantum device, as one of the qubits is teleported across 19 qubits. We design, evaluate and compare two distinct approaches to teleportation: post-selected measurement categorisation and dynamic circuit corrections based on mid-circuit measurements, and compare with direct state transportation using SWAP gates. By optimally choosing the teleportation path which exhibits the highest total negativity entanglement measure across nearest-neighbour pairs, we show the entanglement of a two-qubit graph state is sustained after at least 19 hops in teleportation using the post-selection approach and 17 hops using the dynamic circuit approach. We observe a higher level of teleported entanglement in paths determined from two-qubit negativities compared to those obtained from gate errors, demonstrating an advantage in using the negativity map over the gate error map for compiling quantum circuits.</description>

      <title>A quantum approach for optimal control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel variational quantum approach for solving a class of nonlinear optimal control problems. Our approach integrates Dirac's canonical quantization of dynamical systems with the solution of the ground state of the resulting non-Hermitian Hamiltonian via a variational quantum eigensolver (VQE). We introduce a new perspective on the Dirac bracket formulation for generalized Hamiltonian dynamics in the presence of constraints, providing a clear motivation and illustrative examples. Additionally, we explore the structural properties of Dirac brackets within the context of multidimensional constrained optimization problems.
  Our approach for solving a class of nonlinear optimal control problems employs a VQE-based approach to determine the eigenstate and corresponding eigenvalue associated with the ground state energy of a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. Assuming access to an ideal VQE, our formulation demonstrates excellent results, as evidenced by selected computational examples. Furthermore, our method performs well when combined with a VQE-based approach for non-Hermitian Hamiltonian systems. Our VQE-based formulation effectively addresses challenges associated with a wide range of optimal control problems, particularly in high-dimensional scenarios. Compared to standard classical approaches, our quantum-based method shows significant promise and offers a compelling alternative for tackling complex, high-dimensional optimization challenges.</description>

      <title>Quantum State Synthesis: Relation with Decision Complexity Classes and Impossibility of Synthesis Error Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates the relationships between quantum state synthesis complexity classes (a recent concept in computational complexity that focuses on the complexity of preparing quantum states) and traditional decision complexity classes. We especially investigate the role of the synthesis error parameter, which characterizes the quality of the synthesis in quantum state synthesis complexity classes. We first show that in the high synthesis error regime, collapse of synthesis classes implies collapse of the equivalent decision classes. For more reasonable synthesis error, we then show a similar relationships for BQP and QCMA. Finally, we show that for quantum state synthesis classes it is in general impossible to improve the quality of the synthesis: unlike the completeness and soundness parameters (which can be improved via repetition), the synthesis error cannot be reduced, even with arbitrary computational power.</description>

      <title>Low-variance observable estimation with informationally-complete measurements and tensor networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a method to provide unbiased estimators of multiple observables with low statistical error by utilizing informationally (over)complete measurements and tensor networks. The method consists of an observable-specific classical optimisation of the measurement data based on tensor networks leading to low-variance estimations. Compared to other observable estimation protocols based on classical shadows and measurement frames, our approach offers several advantages: (i) it can be optimized to provide lower statistical error, resulting in a reduced measurement budget to achieve a specified estimation precision; (ii) it scales to a large number of qubits due to the tensor network structure; (iii) it can be applied to any measurement protocol with measurement operators that have an efficient representation in terms of tensor networks. We benchmark the method through various numerical examples, including spin and chemical systems in both infinite and finite statistics scenarios, and show how optimal estimation can be found even when we use tensor-networks with low bond dimensions.</description>

      <title>A new heuristic approach for contextuality degree estimates and its four- to six-qubit portrayals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and describe a new heuristic method for finding an upper bound on the degree of contextuality and the corresponding unsatisfied part of a quantum contextual configuration with three-element contexts (i.e., lines) located in a multi-qubit symplectic polar space of order two. While the previously used method based on a SAT solver was limited to three qubits, this new method is much faster and more versatile, enabling us to also handle four- to six-qubit cases. The four-qubit unsatisfied configurations we found are quite remarkable. That of an elliptic quadric features 315 lines and has in its core three copies of the split Cayley hexagon of order two having a Heawood-graph-underpinned geometry in common. That of a hyperbolic quadric also has 315 lines but, as a point-line incidence structure, is isomorphic to the dual $\mathcal{DW}(5,2)$ of $\mathcal{W}(5,2)$. Finally, an unsatisfied configuration with 1575 lines associated with all the lines/contexts of the four-qubit space contains a distinguished $\mathcal{DW}(5,2)$ centered on a point-plane incidence graph of PG$(3,2)$. The corresponding configurations found in the five-qubit space exhibit a considerably higher degree of complexity, except for a hyperbolic quadric, whose 6975 unsatisfied contexts are compactified around the point-hyperplane incidence graph of PG$(4,2)$. The most remarkable unsatisfied patterns discovered in the six-qubit space are a couple of disjoint split Cayley hexagons (for the full space) and a subgeometry underpinned by the complete bipartite graph $K_{7,7}$ (for a hyperbolic quadric).</description>

      <title>Numerical solution of nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation by a hybrid pseudospectral-variational quantum algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The time-dependent one-dimensional nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (NLSE) is solved numerically by a hybrid pseudospectral-variational quantum algorithm that connects a pseudospectral step for the Hamiltonian term with a variational step for the nonlinear term. The Hamiltonian term is treated as an integrating factor by forward and backward Fourier transformations, which are here carried out classically. This split allows us to avoid higher-order time integration schemes, to apply a first-order explicit time stepping for the remaining nonlinear NLSE term in a variational algorithm block, and thus to avoid numerical instabilities. We demonstrate that the analytical solution is reproduced with a small root mean square error for a long time interval over which a nonlinear soliton propagates significantly forward in space while keeping its shape. We analyze the accuracy of the quantum algorithm and compare it with classical approaches. Furthermore, we investigate the influence of algorithm parameters on the accuracy of the results, including the temporal step width and the depth of the quantum circuit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Noise resilience of quantum information processing is a crucial precondition to reach the fault-tolerance threshold. While resilience to many types of noise can be achieved through suitable control schemes, resilience to amplitude noise seems to be elusive within the common harmonic approximation for the bus mode of trapped ions. We show that weak an-harmonicities admit control schemes that achieve amplitude noise-resilience consistent with state-of-the-art experimental requirements, and that the required an-harmonicities can be achieved with current standards of micro-structured traps or even the intrinsically an-harmonic Coulomb interaction.</description>

      <title>Beating Grover search for low-energy estimation and state preparation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating ground state energies of many-body Hamiltonians is a central task in many areas of quantum physics. In this work, we give quantum algorithms which, given any $k$-body Hamiltonian $H$, compute an estimate for the ground state energy and prepare a quantum state achieving said energy, respectively. Specifically, for any $\varepsilon&gt;0$, our algorithms return, with high probability, an estimate of the ground state energy of $H$ within additive error $\varepsilon M$, or a quantum state with the corresponding energy. Here, $M$ is the total strength of all interaction terms, which in general is extensive in the system size. Our approach makes no assumptions about the geometry or spatial locality of interaction terms of the input Hamiltonian and thus handles even long-range or all-to-all interactions, such as in quantum chemistry, where lattice-based techniques break down. In this fully general setting, the runtime of our algorithms scales as $2^{cn/2}$ for $c&lt;1$, yielding the first quantum algorithms for low-energy estimation breaking the natural bound based on Grover search. The core of our approach is remarkably simple, and relies on showing that any $k$-body Hamiltonian has a low-energy subspace of exponential dimension.</description>

      <title>Improved finite-size key rates for discrete-modulated continuous variable quantum key distribution under coherent attacks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuous variable quantum key distribution (CVQKD) with discrete modulation combines advantages of CVQKD, such as the implementability using readily available technologies, with advantages of discrete variable quantum key distribution, such as easier error correction procedures. We consider a prepare-and-measure CVQKD protocol, where Alice chooses from a set of four coherent states and Bob performs a heterodyne measurement, the result of which is discretised in both key and test rounds. We provide a security proof against coherent attacks in the finite-size regime, and compute the achievable key rate. To this end, we employ the generalised entropy accumulation theorem, as well as recent advances in conic optimisation, yielding improved key rates compared to previous works. At metropolitan distances, our method can provide positive key rates for the order of $10^8$ rounds.</description>

      <title>The sudden death of quantum advantage in correlation generations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As quantum error corrections still cannot be realized physically, quantum noise is the most profound obstacle to the implementations of large-scale quantum algorithms or quantum schemes. It has been well-known that if a quantum computer suffers from too strong quantum noise, its running can be easily simulated by a classical computer, making the quantum advantage impossible. Generally speaking, however, the dynamical process that how quantum noise of varying strengths from 0 to a fatal level impacts and destroys quantum advantage has not been understood well. Undoubtedly, achieving this will be extremely valuable for us to understand the power of noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers. Meanwhile, correlation generation is a precious theoretical model of information processing tasks in which the quantum advantage can be precisely quantified. Here we show that this model also provides us a valuable insight into understanding the impact of noise on quantum advantage. Particularly, we will rigorously prove that when the strength of quantum noise continuously goes up from 0, the quantum advantage gradually declines, and eventually fades away completely. Surprisingly, in some cases we observe an unexpected phenomenon we call the sudden death of the quantum advantage, i.e., when the strength of quantum noise exceeds a certain point, the quantum advantage disappears suddenly from a non-negligible level. This interesting phenomenon reveals the tremendous harm of noise to quantum information processing tasks from a new viewpoint.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Landauer principle sets a lower bound on the thermodynamic cost of qubit reset, which is only attainable for the quasistatic process. In this Letter, we explore the collective advantage of qubit reset of coherent qubits in three aspects. First, for the quasistatic process, the thermodynamic cost of collective reset is remarkably lower than parallel reset because of the reduced Hilbert space dimension due to entanglement effects. Second, for the finite-time qubit reset, we prove that the error probability fades away and per-qubit heat production tends the Landauer bound for initially continuous protocols in the thermodynamic limit. Third, we show that qubit reset performance enhances with the increase in the number of qubits. Our results, illustrated by different protocols, provide a blueprint for future quantum device fabrication.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orthogonal product sets that are locally irreducible in every bipartition have the strongest nonlocality while also need a large number of quantum states. In this paper, we construct the orthogonal product sets with strong quantum nonlocality in any possible $n$-partite systems, where $n$ is greater than three. Rigorous proofs show that these sets are locally irreducible in every $(n-1)$-partition. They not only possess stronger properties than nonlocality and fewer quantum states than the strongest nonlocal sets, but also are positive answers to the open question "how to construct different strength nonlocality of orthogonal product states for general multipartite and high-dimensional quantum systems" of Zhang et al. [{Phys. Rev. A \textbf{99}, 062108 (2019)}]. Our results can also enhance one understanding for the nonlocality without entanglement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a hardware-efficient variational quantum algorithm ansatz tailored for the trapped-ion quantum simulator, HEA-TI. We leverage programmable single-qubit rotations and global spin-spin interactions among all ions, reducing the dependence on resource-intensive two-qubit gates in conventional gate-based methods. We apply HEA-TI to state engineering of cluster states and analyze the scaling of required quantum resources. We also apply HEA-TI to solve the ground state problem of chemical molecules $\mathrm{H_{2}}$, $\mathrm{LiH}$ and $\mathrm{F_{2}}$. We numerically analyze the quantum computing resources required to achieve chemical accuracy and examine the performance under realistic experimental noise and statistical fluctuation. The efficiency of this ansatz is shown to be comparable to other commonly used variational ansatzes like UCCSD, with the advantage of substantially easier implementation in the trapped-ion quantum simulator. This approach showcases the hardware-efficient ansatz as a powerful tool for the application of the near-term quantum computer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work delivers a novel user-server authentication procedure exploiting the features of maximally entangled pairs in both an idealistic noiseless scenario and a moderately noisy one. Additionally, we leverage the specific features of our design, which are conveniently suited for inlaying it into the well known BB84 quantum communication protocol. We first define a trivial extension of our initial proposal allowing for such task (symmetric scheme) to then come up with what we denote as asymmetric scheme, better matching practicality.
  Furthermore, a realistic simulation of the user-server authentication protocol has been achieved by employing a noisy model for both transmission and storage, the latter relying on cavity-enhanced atomic-frequency comb (AFC) memories. While in a noiseless scenario our proposal is ensured to be airtight, considering a certain degree of noise poses a challenge when aiming to actually implement it. We have implemented a deep neural network to distinguish legitimate users from forgery attempts, outperforming a mere statistical approach designed for the same task. Such method achieved a success rate of 0.75 with storage times of $1$ $\mu s$ and a user-server distance of $10$ km.</description>

      <title>Accelerating quantum imaginary-time evolution with random measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum imaginary-time evolution (QITE) is a promising tool to prepare thermal or ground states of Hamiltonians, as convergence is guaranteed when the evolved state overlaps with the ground state. However, its implementation using a parameterized quantum circuit is impractical as the number of parameters $m$ increases, since each step in the evolution takes $\Theta(m^2)$ state preparations to calculate the quantum Fisher information matrix (QFIM). In this work, we accelerate QITE by rapid estimation of the QFIM, while conserving the convergence guarantees to the extent possible. To this end, we prove that if a parameterized state is rotated by a 2-design and measured in the computational basis, then the QFIM can be inferred from partial derivative cross correlations of the probability outcomes. One sample estimate costs only $\Theta(m)$ state preparations, leading to rapid QFIM estimation when a few samples suffice. The second family of estimators take greater liberties and replace QFIMs with averaged classical Fisher information matrices (CFIMs). In an extreme special case optimized for rapid (over accurate) descent, just one CFIM sample is drawn. We justify the second estimator family by proving rapid descent. Guided by these results, we propose the random-measurement imaginary-time evolution (RMITE) algorithm, which we showcase and test in several molecular systems, with the goal of preparing ground states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method to systematically identify and classify quantum optical non-classical resources based on the computational power they generate in a bosonic quantum computer. To achieve this, we establish a one-to-one correspondence between arbitrary continuous variable states in a multimode Hilbert space and single photons occupying each a single mode, which are used to define a bosonic quantum computer. Starting from a classical state in a representation that explicitly respects particle number super-selection rules, we apply universal gates to create arbitrary superposition of states with the same total particle number. The non-classicality of these states can then be directly related to the computational power they induce in the quantum computer. We also provide a correspondence between the adopted representation and the more conventional one in quantum optics, where superpositions of Fock states describe quantum optical states, and we identify how mode entanglement can lead to quantum advantage. In addition, our work contributes to establish a seamless transition from continuous to discrete properties of quantum optics while laying the grounds for a description of non-classicality and quantum computational advantage that is applicable to spin systems as well.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss how the Schrodinger equation can predict Born statistics for evolution to eigenstates when a potential energy causes the quantum system to undergo a random walk. Specifically, we show how the random walk results in a quantum state during a measurement evolving arbitrarily close to eigenstates with the expected Born probabilities. The random walk is described in terms of the time-dependent unitary matrix U(t) that has a one-to-one equivalence to the external potential in Schrodinger's equation. Assuming the analysis is correct, some interesting questions arise. Are any measurements described by such physics? Can a measurement apparatus be designed that results in measurement statistics that deviate from Born statistics while still being a reliable measurement? For quantum information systems, are there implications for qubit noise and algorithm design? This is a draft of a work in progress, and respectful questions, comments, suggestions, or interest in informal or formal collaboration are welcome.</description>

      <title>Wideband Coherent Microwave Conversion via Magnon Nonlinearity in Hybrid Quantum System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frequency conversion is a widely realized physical process in nonlinear systems of optics and electronics. As an emerging nonlinear platform, spintronic devices have the potential to achieve stronger frequency conversion. Here, we demonstrated a microwave frequency conversion method in a hybrid quantum system, integrating nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond with magnetic thin film CoFeB. We achieve a conversion bandwidth ranging from 0.1 to 12GHz, presenting an up to $\mathrm{25^{th}}$ order frequency conversion and further display the application of this method for frequency detection and qubits coherent control. Distinct from traditional frequency conversion techniques based on nonlinear electric response, our approach employs nonlinear magnetic response in spintronic devices. The nonlinearity, originating from the symmetry breaking such as domain walls in magnetic films, presents that our method can be adapted to hybrid systems of other spintronic devices and spin qubits, expanding the application scope of spintronic devices and providing a promising on-chip platform for coupling quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Tripartite GHZ Entanglement in Monitored Random Clifford Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multipartite quantum entanglement of a manybody is not well understood. Here we numerically study the amount of tripartite Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states that can be extracted from the state generated by random Clifford circuits with probabilistic single-qubit projective measurements. We find a GHZ-entangled phase where this amount is finite and a GHZ-trivial phase where no tripartite entanglement is available. The transition between them is either measurement-induced, at $p_c\approx 0.16$, or partition-induced when a party contains more than half of the qubits. We find that the GHZ entanglement can be enhanced by measurements in certain regimes, which could be understood from the perspective of quantum Internet. Effects of the measurements to the growth of GHZ entanglement are also studied.</description>

      <title>Quasi-probability distribution of work in a measurement-based quantum Otto engine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the work statistics of a measurement-based quantum Otto engine, where quantum non-selective measurements are used to fuel the engine, in a coupled spin working system (WS). The WS exhibits quantum coherence in the energy eigenbasis at the beginning of a unitary work extraction stage in presence of inter-spin anisotropic interaction. We demonstrate that the probability of certain values of stochastic work can be negative, rendering itself akin to the quasi-probability distribution found in phase space. This can be attributed to the interference terms facilitated by quantum coherence. Additionally, we establish that coherence can improve the average work in finite time. Subsequently, we compare the work distribution with a standard QOE operating between two heat baths. We find that, because of the absence of quantum coherence, the probability of stochastic work cannot be negative in a standard QOE.</description>

      <title>Quantum coarsening and collective dynamics on a programmable quantum simulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the collective quantum dynamics of nonequilibrium many-body systems is an outstanding challenge in quantum science. In particular, dynamics driven by quantum fluctuations are important for the formation of exotic quantum phases of matter \cite{altman2023quantum}, fundamental high-energy processes \cite{bauer2023highenergy}, quantum metrology \cite{degen2017sensing, li2023scrambling}, and quantum algorithms \cite{ebadi2022quantum}. Here, we use a programmable quantum simulator based on Rydberg atom arrays to experimentally study collective dynamics across a (2+1)D Ising quantum phase transition. After crossing the quantum critical point, we observe a gradual growth of correlations through coarsening of antiferromagnetically ordered domains~\cite{Samajdar2024}. By deterministically preparing and following the evolution of ordered domains, we show that the coarsening is driven by the curvature of domain boundaries, and find that the dynamics accelerate with proximity to the quantum critical point. We quantitatively explore these phenomena and further observe long-lived oscillations of the order parameter, corresponding to an amplitude (Higgs) mode \cite{pekker2015amplitude}. These observations offer a unique viewpoint into emergent collective dynamics in strongly correlated quantum systems and nonequilibrium quantum processes.</description>

      <title>Do Quantum Neural Networks have Simplicity Bias?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One hypothesis for the success of deep neural networks (DNNs) is that they are highly expressive, which enables them to be applied to many problems, and they have a strong inductive bias towards solutions that are simple, known as simplicity bias, which allows them to generalise well on unseen data because most real-world data is structured (i.e. simple). In this work, we explore the inductive bias and expressivity of quantum neural networks (QNNs), which gives us a way to compare their performance to those of DNNs. Our results show that it is possible to have simplicity bias with certain QNNs, but we prove that this type of QNN limits the expressivity of the QNN. We also show that it is possible to have QNNs with high expressivity, but they either have no inductive bias or a poor inductive bias and result in a worse generalisation performance compared to DNNs. We demonstrate that an artificial (restricted) inductive bias can be produced by intentionally restricting the expressivity of a QNN. Our results suggest a bias-expressivity tradeoff. Our conclusion is that the QNNs we studied can not generally offer an advantage over DNNs, because these QNNs either have a poor inductive bias or poor expressivity compared to DNNs.</description>

      <title>Lattices, Gates, and Curves: GKP codes as a Rosetta stone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) codes are a promising candidate for implementing fault tolerant quantum computation in quantum harmonic oscillator systems such as superconducting resonators, optical photons and trapped ions, and in recent years theoretical and experimental evidence for their utility has steadily grown. It is known that logical Clifford operations on GKP codes can be implemented fault tolerantly using only Gaussian operations, and several theoretical investigations have illuminated their general structure. In this work, we explain how GKP Clifford gates arise as symplectic automorphisms of the corresponding GKP lattice and show how they are identified with the mapping class group of suitable genus $n$ surfaces. This correspondence introduces a topological interpretation of fault tolerance for GKP codes and motivates the connection between GKP codes (lattices), their Clifford gates, and algebraic curves, which we explore in depth. For a single-mode GKP code, we identify the space of all GKP codes with the moduli space of elliptic curves, given by the three sphere with a trefoil knot removed, and explain how logical degrees of freedom arise from the choice of a level structure on the corresponding curves. We discuss how the implementation of Clifford gates corresponds to homotopically nontrivial loops on the space of all GKP codes and show that the modular Rademacher function describes a topological invariant for certain Clifford gates implemented by such loops. Finally, we construct a universal family of GKP codes and show how it gives rise to an explicit construction of fiber bundle fault tolerance as proposed by Gottesman and Zhang for the GKP code. On our path towards understanding this correspondence, we introduce a general algebraic geometric perspective on GKP codes and their moduli spaces, which uncovers a map towards many possible routes of future research.</description>

      <title>Global Out of Time Order Correlators as a Signature of Scrambling Dynamics of Local Observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Out-of-Time-Order Correlators (OTOCs) serve as a proxy for quantum information scrambling, which refers to the process where information stored locally disperses across the many-body degrees of freedom in a quantum system, rendering it inaccessible to local probes. Most experimental implementations of OTOCs to probe information scrambling rely on indirect measurements based on global observables, using techniques such as Loschmidt echoes and Multiple Quantum Coherences, via time reversal evolutions. In this article, we establish a direct connection between OTOCs with global and local observables in the context of NMR experiments, where the observable is the total magnetization of the system. We conduct a numerical analysis to quantify the differences in the evolution of both magnitudes, evaluating the excitation dynamics in spin ring systems with 8 to 16 spins, using a many-body Hamiltonian and long-range interactions. Our analysis decomposes the global echo into a sum of local echoes and cross-contributions, leading to local and global OTOCs. The results indicate that, after an initial transient period, local OTOCs determine the global ones. To confirm the equivalence, we observe that the difference between local and global OTOCs, as well as their fluctuations, becomes negligible as the system size increases. This behavior aligns with that observed in highly interacting or chaotic systems in several experiments.</description>

      <title>Quantum dynamical criticality speeds up thermodynamic entropy production</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The thermodynamics of quantum phase transitions has long been a rich area of research, providing numerous insights and enhancing our understanding of this important phenomenon. This theoretical framework has been well-developed specially because quantum phase transitions occur at equilibrium. However, its dynamical counterpart, known as dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs), takes place out-of-equilibrium, where conventional thermodynamic tools are inapplicable. In this work, we make progress in this area by connecting dynamical criticality to the second law of thermodynamics through a geometric perspective on entropy production. Our findings, along with other recent developments, suggest that dynamical criticality can lead the system to highly complex dynamics, indicating a possible pathway to thermalization.</description>

      <title>Crystal-field effects in the formation of Wigner-molecule supercrystals in moir\'e TMD superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For moir\'e bilayer TMD superlattices, full-configuration-interaction (FCI) calculations are presented that take into account both the intra-moir\'e-quantum-dot (MQD) charge-carrier Coulombic interactions, as well as the crystal-field effect from the surrounding moir\'e pockets (inter-moir\'e-QD interactions). Such FCI calculations enable an effective computational embedding strategy and allow for a complete interpretation of the counterintuitive experimental observations reported recently in the context of moir\'e TMD superlattices at integer fillings $\nu=2$ and 4. Two novel states of matter are reported: (i) a genuinely quantum-mechanical supercrystal of {\it sliding\/} Wigner molecules (WMs) for unstrained moir\'e TMD materials (when the crystal field is commensurate with the trilobal symmetry of the confining potential in each embedded MQD) and (ii) a supercrystal of {\it pinned\/} Wigner molecules when strain is involved and the crystal field is incommensurate with the trilobal symmetry of the confining potential in each embedded MQD. The case of $\nu=3$ is an exception, in that both unstrained and strained cases produce a supercrystal of pinned WMs, which is due to the congruence of intrinsic (that of the WM) and external (that of the confining potential of the MQD) $C_3$ point-group symmetries. Furthermore, it is shown that the unrestricted Hartree-Fock approach fails to describe the supercrystal of sliding WMs in the unstrained case, providing a qualitative agreement only in the case of a supercrystal of pinned WMs</description>

      <title>Local Description of Decoherence of Quantum Superpositions by Black Holes and Other Bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It was previously shown that if an experimenter, Alice, puts a massive or charged body in a quantum spatial superposition, then the presence of a black hole (or more generally any Killing horizon) will eventually decohere the superposition [arXiv:2205.06279, arXiv:2301.00026, arXiv:2311.11461]. This decoherence was identified as resulting from the radiation of soft photons/gravitons through the horizon, thus suggesting that the global structure of the spacetime is essential for describing the decoherence. In this paper, we show that the decoherence can alternatively be described in terms of the local two-point function of the quantum field within Alice's lab, without any direct reference to the horizon. From this point of view, the decoherence of Alice's superposition in the presence of a black hole arises from the extremely low frequency Hawking quanta present in Alice's lab. We explicitly calculate the decoherence occurring in Schwarzschild spacetime in the Unruh vacuum from the local viewpoint. We then use this viewpoint to elucidate (i) the differences in decoherence effects that would occur in Schwarzschild spacetime in the Boulware and Hartle-Hawking vacua; (ii) the difference in decoherence effects that would occur in Minkowski spacetime filled with a thermal bath as compared with Schwarzschild spacetime; (iii) the lack of decoherence in the spacetime of a static star even though the vacuum state outside the star is similar in many respects to the Boulware vacuum around a black hole; and (iv) the requirements on the degrees of freedom of a material body needed to produce a decoherence effect that mimics that of a black hole.</description>

Abstract: Data show that the presence of women in quantum science is affected by a number of detriments and their percentage decreases even further for higher positions. Beyond data, from our shared personal experiences as female tenured quantum physics professors, we believe that the current model of scientific leadership, funding, and authority fails to represent many of us. It is time for a real change that calls for a different kind of force and for the participation of everyone. Women for quantum calls for a joint effort and aims with this initiative to contribute to such a transformation.</description>

      <title>Density effects on the interferometry of Efimov states by modulating magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamical association of Efimov trimers in thermal gases by means of modulated magnetic fields has proven very fruitful in determining the binding energy of trimers. The latter was extracted from the number of remaining atoms, which featured oscillatory fringes stemming from the superposition of trimers with atom-dimers. Subsequent theoretical investigations utilizing the time-dependent three-body problem revealed additional association mechanisms, manifested as superpositions of the Efimov state with the trap states and the latter with atom-dimers. The three atoms were initialized in a way to emulate a thermal gas with uniform density. Here, this analysis is extended by taking into account the effects of the density profile of a semi-classical thermal gas. The supersposition of the Efimov trimer with the first atom-dimer remains the same, while the frequencies of highly oscillatory fringes shift to lower values. The latter refer to the frequencies of trimers and atom-dimers in free space since the density profile smears out the contribution of trap states.</description>

      <title>Quantum microwave photonic mixer with a large spurious-free dynamic range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As one of the most fundamental functionalities of microwave photonics, microwave frequency mixing plays an essential role in modern radars and wireless communication systems. However, the commonly utilized intensity modulation in the systems often leads to inadequate spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR) for many sought-after applications. Quantum microwave photonics technique offers a promising solution for improving SFDR in terms of higher-order harmonic distortion. In this paper, we demonstrate two types of quantum microwave photonic mixers based on the configuration of the intensity modulators: cascade-type and parallel-type. Leveraging the nonlocal RF signal encoding capability, both types of quantum microwave photonic mixers not only exhibit the advantage of dual-channel output but also present significant improvement in SFDR. Specifically, the parallel-type quantum microwave photonic mixer achieves a remarkable SFDR value of 113.6 dB.Hz1/2, which is 30 dB better than that of the cascade-type quantum microwave photonic mixer. When compared to the classical microwave photonic mixer, this enhancement reaches a notable 53.6 dB at the expense of 8 dB conversion loss. These results highlight the superiority of quantum microwave photonic mixers in the fields of microwave and millimeter-wave systems. Further applying multi-photon frequency entangled sources as optical carriers, the dual-channel microwave frequency conversion capability endowed by the quantum microwave photonic mixer can be extended to enhance the performance of multiple-paths microwave mixing which is essential for radar net systems.</description>

      <title>A Framework for Quantum Finite-State Languages with Density Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A quantum finite-state automaton (QFA) is a theoretical model designed to simulate the evolution of a quantum system with finite memory in response to sequential input strings. We define the language of a QFA as the set of strings that lead the QFA to an accepting state when processed from its initial state. QFAs exemplify how quantum computing can achieve greater efficiency compared to classical computing. While being one of the simplest quantum models, QFAs are still notably challenging to construct from scratch due to the preliminary knowledge of quantum mechanics required for superimposing unitary constraints on the automata. Furthermore, even when QFAs are correctly assembled, the limitations of a current quantum computer may cause fluctuations in the simulation results depending on how an assembled QFA is translated into a quantum circuit.
  We present a framework that provides a simple and intuitive way to build QFAs and maximize the simulation accuracy. Our framework relies on two methods: First, it offers a predefined construction for foundational types of QFAs that recognize special languages MOD and EQU. They play a role of basic building blocks for more complex QFAs. In other words, one can obtain more complex QFAs from these foundational automata using standard language operations. Second, we improve the simulation accuracy by converting these QFAs into quantum circuits such that the resulting circuits perform well on noisy quantum computers.
  Our framework is available at https://github.com/sybaik1/qfa-toolkit.</description>

      <title>A versatile quantum microwave photonic signal processing platform based on coincidence window selection technique</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum microwave photonics (QMWP) is an innovative approach that combines energy-time entangled biphoton sources as the optical carrier with time-correlated single-photon detection for high-speed RF signal recovery. This groundbreaking method offers unique advantages such as nonlocal RF signal encoding and robust resistance to dispersion-induced frequency fading. This paper explores the versatility of processing the quantum microwave photonic signal by utilizing coincidence window selection on the biphoton coincidence distribution. The demonstration includes finely-tunable RF phase shifting, flexible multi-tap transversal filtering (with up to 15 taps), and photonically implemented RF mixing, leveraging the nonlocal RF mapping characteristic of QMWP. These accomplishments significantly enhance the capability of microwave photonic systems in processing ultra-weak signals, opening up new possibilities for various applications.</description>

      <title>Hawking radiation in quantum Hall system with an expanding edge: application of anomaly method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The relationship between gravitational anomalies and Hawking radiation of black holes was revealed by Wilczek and Robinson. In this study, we apply their method to an analogue de Sitter spacetime in the quantum Hall system with an expanding edge. Because this system is chiral, there is no need to impose the condition of ingoing modes near the horizon, which was assumed in the original method. Moreover, this system is structured so that the de Sitter space is sandwiched between two flat spaces, and although the effects of the anomaly would not appear in an ordinal de Sitter spacetime, they manifest themselves as boundary conditions between the de Sitter and the flat regions. By performing calculations under these boundary conditions, we obtain the flux of Hawking radiation in the outer flat region with the Gibbons-Hawking temperature of the de Sitter horizon.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing has the potential to solve complex problems beyond the capabilities of classical computers. However, its practical use is currently limited due to early-stage quantum software engineering and the constraints of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. To address this issue, this chapter introduces the concept of serverless quantum computing with examples using QFaaS, a practical Quantum Function-as-a-Service framework. This framework utilizes the serverless computing model to simplify quantum application development and deployment by abstracting the complexities of quantum hardware and enhancing application portability across different quantum software development kits and quantum backends. The chapter provides comprehensive documentation and guidelines for deploying and using QFaaS, detailing the setup, component deployment, and examples of service-oriented quantum applications. This framework offers a promising approach to overcoming current limitations and advancing the practical software engineering of quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Interaction-induced dissipative quantum phase transition in a head-to-tail atomic Josephson junction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a dissipative phase transition in a head-to-tail Bose Josephson junction. The quantum phase transition has the same origin as the one in a resistively shunted Josephson junction, but the intrinsic momentum coupling between the Josephson mode and the bath modes enables us to observe the dissipative phase transition without any synthetic dissipation. We show that the inter-atomic interaction strength plays the role of the damping parameter. Consequently, in contrast to a resistively shunted Josephson circuit, the Bose Josephson junction can exhibit an insulating phase in a wider parameter region by increasing the repulsive interaction strength, which is robust against nonperturbative effects. We argue that tight transverse confinement of the quasi-one-dimensional atomic gas allows us to reach the insulating phase.</description>

      <title>Dielectric Fano Nanoantennas for Enabling Sub-Nanosecond Lifetimes in NV-based Single Photon Emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solid-state quantum emitters are essential sources of single photons, and enhancing their emission rates is of paramount importance for applications in quantum communications, computing, and metrology. One approach is to couple quantum emitters with resonant photonic nanostructures, where the emission rate is enhanced due to the Purcell effect. Dielectric nanoantennas are promising as they provide strong emission enhancement compared to plasmonic ones, which suffer from high Ohmic loss. Here, we designed and fabricated a dielectric Fano resonator based on a pair of silicon (Si) ellipses and a disk, which supports the mode hybridization between quasi-bound-states-in-the-continuum (quasi-BIC) and Mie resonance. We demonstrated the performance of the developed resonant system by interfacing it with single photon emitters (SPEs) based on nitrogen-vacancy (NV-) centers in nanodiamonds (NDs). We observed that the interfaced emitters have a Purcell enhancement factor of ~10, with sub-ns emission lifetime and a polarization contrast of 9. Our results indicate a promising method for developing efficient and compact single-photon sources for integrated quantum photonics applications.</description>

      <title>Integrability and dark states of the XX spin-1 central spin model in a transverse field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It was recently shown that, for central spin-1/2 and central spin-1, the XX central spin model is integrable in the presence of a magnetic field oriented perpendicular to the XY plane in which the coupling exists. In the spin-1/2 case, it was also shown, through an appropriate limit of the non-skew symmetric XXZ Richardson-Gaudin models, that it remained integrable even when the magnetic field is tilted to contain an in-plane component. Although the model has not yet been shown to explicitly belong to a known class of Richardson- Gaudin models, we show, in this work, that the spin-1 case also remains integrable in a titled magnetic field. We do so by writing explicitly the complete set of conserved charges, then showing that these operators obey polynomial relations. It is finally demonstrated numerically that dark states, for which the central spin is completely unentangled with the bath, can emerge at strong enough coupling just as they do in the central spin-1/2 model in an arbitrarily oriented magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Tensor Networks for Lattice Gauge Theories beyond one dimension: a Roadmap</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tensor network methods are a class of numerical tools and algorithms to study many-body quantum systems in and out of equilibrium, based on tailored variational wave functions. They have found significant applications in simulating lattice gauge theories approaching relevant problems in high-energy physics. Compared to Monte Carlo methods, they do not suffer from the sign problem, allowing them to explore challenging regimes such as finite chemical potentials and real-time dynamics. Further development is required to tackle fundamental challenges, such as accessing continuum limits or computations of large-scale quantum chromodynamics. In this work, we review the state-of-the-art of Tensor Network methods and discuss a possible roadmap for algorithmic development and strategies to enhance their capabilities and extend their applicability to open high-energy problems. We provide tailored estimates of the theoretical and computational resource scaling for attacking large-scale lattice gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Strong Charge-Photon Coupling in Planar Germanium Enabled by Granular Aluminium Superinductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High kinetic inductance superconductors are gaining increasing interest for the realisation of qubits, amplifiers and detectors. Moreover, thanks to their high impedance, quantum buses made of such materials enable large zero-point fluctuations of the voltage, boosting the coupling rates to spin and charge qubits. However, fully exploiting the potential of disordered or granular superconductors is challenging, as their inductance and, therefore, impedance at high values are difficult to control. Here we have integrated a granular aluminium resonator, having a characteristic impedance exceeding the resistance quantum, with a germanium double quantum dot and demonstrate strong charge-photon coupling with a rate of $g_\text{c}/2\pi= (566 \pm 2)$ MHz. This was achieved due to the realisation of a wireless ohmmeter, which allows \emph{in situ} measurements during film deposition and, therefore, control of the kinetic inductance of granular aluminium films. Reproducible fabrication of circuits with impedances (inductances) exceeding 13 k$\Omega$ (1 nH per square) is now possible. This broadly applicable method opens the path for novel qubits and high-fidelity, long-distance two-qubit gates.</description>

      <title>Simulating electron-vibron energy transfer with quantum dots and resonators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gateable semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) provide a versatile platform for analog quantum simulations of electronic many-body systems. In particular, QD arrays offer a natural representation of the interacting $\pi$-electron system of small hydrocarbons. Here we investigate the prospects for extending QD simulators to encompass also the nuclear degrees of freedom. We represent the molecular vibrational modes by single-mode microwave resonators coupled capacitively to the QDs and study the gate-tunable energy transfer from a voltage-biased triple quantum dot (TQD) system to a single damped resonator mode. We determine the QD population inversions, the corresponding charge and energy currents as well as the resonator photon number, using Lindblad master equations and lowest-order perturbation theory within Keldysh Green function formalism. Along the way, we discuss the merits and shortcomings of the two methods.A central result is the interrelation of a pronounced minimum in the charge current with a maximum in energy transfer, arising from a gate-tunable interference effect in the molecular orbitals of the TQD electron system.</description>

      <title>Controlling Plasmonic Catalysis via Strong Coupling with Electromagnetic Resonators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Plasmonic excitations decay within femtoseconds, leaving non-thermal (often referred to as "hot") charge carriers behind that can be injected into molecular structures to trigger chemical reactions that are otherwise out of reach -- a process known as plasmonic catalysis. In this Letter, we demonstrate that strong coupling between resonator structures and plasmonic nanoparticles can be used to control the spectral overlap between the plasmonic excitation energy and the charge injection energy into nearby molecules. Our atomistic description couples real-time density-functional theory self-consistently to Maxwell's equations via the radiation-reaction potential. Control over the resonator provides then an additional knob for non-intrusively enhancing plasmonic catalysis and dynamically reacting to deterioration of the catalyst -- a new facet of modern catalysis.</description>

      <title>Clifford Circuits Augmented Time-Dependent Variational Principle</title>

Abstract: The recently proposed Clifford Circuits Augmented Matrix Product States (CA-MPS) (arXiv:2405.09217) seamlessly augments Density Matrix Renormalization Group with Clifford circuits. In CA-MPS, the entanglement from stabilizers is transferred to the Clifford circuits which can be easily handled according to the Gottesman-Knill theorem. As a result, MPS needs only to deal with the non-stabilizer entanglement, which largely reduce the bond dimension and the resource required for the accurate simulation of many-body systems. In this work, we generalize CA-MPS to the framework of Time-Dependent Variational Principle (TDVP) for time evolution simulations. In this method, we apply Clifford circuits to the resulting MPS in each TDVP step with a two-site sweeping process similar as in DMRG, aiming at reducing the entanglement entropy in the MPS, and the Hamiltonian is transformed accordingly using the chosen Clifford circuits. Similar as in CA-MPS, the Clifford circuits doesn't increase the number of terms in the Hamiltonian which makes the overhead very small in the new method. We test this method in both XXZ chain and two dimensional Heisenberg model. The results show that the Clifford circuits augmented TDVP method can reduce the entanglement entropy in the time evolution process and hence makes the simulation reliable for longer time. The Clifford circuits augmented Time-Dependent Variational Principle provides a useful tool for the simulation of time evolution process of many-body systems in the future.</description>

      <title>Contextuality in the Bundle Approach, n-Contextuality, and the Role of Holonomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.14132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.14132v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Contextuality can be understood as the impossibility to construct a globally consistent description of a model even if there is local agreement. In particular, quantum models present this property. We can describe contextuality with the bundle approach, where the scenario is represented as a simplicial complex, the fibers being the sets of outcomes, and contextuality as the non-existence of global section in the measure bundle. Using the generalization to non-finite outcome fibers, we built in details the concept of measure bundle, demonstrating the Fine-Abramsky-Brandenburger theorem for the bundle formalism. We introduce a hierarchy called n-contextuality to explore the dependence of contextual behavior of a model to the topology of the scenario, following the construction of it as a simplicial complex. With it we exemplify the dependence on higher homology groups and show that GHZ models, thus quantum theory, has all levels of the hierarchy. Also, we give an example of how non-trivial topology of the scenario result an increase of contextual behavior. For the first level of the hierarchy, we construct the concept of connection through Markov operators for the measure bundle. Taking the case of equal fibers we can identify the outcomes as the basis of a vector space, that transform according to a group extracted from the connection. We thus show that contextuality has a relationship with the non-triviality of the holonomy group in the respective frame bundle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2202.08719v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Contextuality has long been associated with topological properties. In this work, such a relationship is elevated to identification in the broader framework of generalized contextuality. We employ the usual identification of states, effects, and transformations as vectors in a vector space and encode them into a tangent space, rendering the noncontextual conditions the generic condition that discrete closed paths imply null phases in valuations, which are immediately extended to the continuous case. Contextual behavior admits two equivalent interpretations in this formalism. In the geometric or intrinsic-realistic view, termed "Schr\"odinger", flat space is imposed, leading to contextual behavior being expressed as non-trivial holonomy of probabilistic functions, analogous to the electromagnetic tensor. As a modification of the valuation function, we use the equivalent curvature to connect contextuality with interference, noncommutativity, and signed measures. In the topological or participatory-realistic view, termed "Heisenberg", valuation functions must satisfy classical measure axioms, resulting in contextual behavior needing to be expressed in topological defects in events, resulting in non-trivial monodromy. We utilize such defects to connect contextuality with non-embeddability and to construct a generalized Vorob'ev theorem, a result regarding the inevitability of noncontextuality. We identify in this formalism the contextual fraction for models with outcome-determinism, and a pathway to address disturbance in ontological models as non-trivial transition maps. We also discuss how the two views for encoding contextuality relate to interpretations of quantum theory.</description>

      <title>Absence of measurement-induced entanglement transition due to feedback-induced skin effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.11241v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A quantum many-body system subject to unitary evolution and repeated local measurements with an increasing rate undergoes a measurement-induced entanglement transition from extensive (or subextensive) to area law entropy scaling. We find that certain open boundary systems under "generalized monitoring", consisting of "projective monitoring" and conditional feedback, display an anomalous late-time particle concentration on the edge, reminiscent of the "skin effect" in non-Hermitian systems. Such feedback-induced skin effect will suppress the entanglement generation, rendering the system short-range entangled without measurement-induced entanglement transition. While initially emerged in noninteracting models, such skin effect can also occur in chaotic interacting systems and Floquet quantum circuits subjected to random generalized measurements. Since the dynamics of the skin effect do not require post selection, and can be observed at the particle number level, the phenomenon is experimentally relevant and accessible in noisy intermediate-scale quantum platforms, such as trapped ions.</description>

      <title>A subpolynomial-time algorithm for the free energy of one-dimensional quantum systems in the thermodynamic limit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.14989v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a classical algorithm to approximate the free energy of local, translation-invariant, one-dimensional quantum systems in the thermodynamic limit of infinite chain size. While the ground state problem (i.e., the free energy at temperature $T = 0$) for these systems is expected to be computationally hard even for quantum computers, our algorithm runs for any fixed temperature $T &gt; 0$ in subpolynomial time, i.e., in time $O((\frac{1}{\varepsilon})^{c})$ for any constant $c &gt; 0$ where $\varepsilon$ is the additive approximation error. Previously, the best known algorithm had a runtime that is polynomial in $\frac{1}{\varepsilon}$. Our algorithm is also particularly simple as it reduces to the computation of the spectral radius of a linear map. This linear map has an interpretation as a noncommutative transfer matrix and has been studied previously to prove results on the analyticity of the free energy and the decay of correlations. We also show that the corresponding eigenvector of this map gives an approximation of the marginal of the Gibbs state and thereby allows for the computation of various thermodynamic properties of the quantum system.</description>

Abstract: The quantum simulation of magnetism in trapped-ion systems makes use of the crystal vibrations to mediate pairwise interactions between spins, which are encoded in the internal electronic states of the ions, and measured in experiments that probe the real-time dynamics. These interactions can be accounted for by a long-wavelength relativistic theory, where the phonons are described by a coarse-grained Klein-Gordon field $\phi(x)$ locally coupled to the spins that acts as a carrier, leading to an analogue of pion-mediated Yukawa interactions. In the vicinity of a structural transition of the ion crystal, one must go beyond the Klein-Gordon fields, and include additional $\lambda\phi^4$ terms responsible for phonon-phonon scattering. This leads to quantum effects that can be expressed by Feynman loop integrals that modify the range of the Yukawa-type spin interactions; an effect that could be used to probe the underlying fixed point of this quantum field theory (QFT). Unfortunately, the rigidity of the trapped-ion crystal makes it challenging to observe genuine quantum effects, such as the flow of the critical point with the quartic coupling $\lambda$. We hereby show that thermal effects, which can be controlled by laser cooling, can unveil this flow through the appearance of thermal masses in interacting QFTs. We perform self-consistent calculations that resum certain Feynman diagrams and, additionally, go beyond mean-field theory to predict how measurements on the trapped-ion spin system can probe key properties of the $\lambda\phi^4$ QFT.</description>

Abstract: It is well known that nonlocal coherence reflects nonclassical correlations better than quantum entanglement. Here, we analyze nonlocal coherence harvesting from the quantum vacuum to particle detectors adiabatically interacting with a quantum scalar field in Minkowski spacetime. We find that the harvesting-achievable separation range of nonlocal coherence is larger than that of quantum entanglement. As the energy gap grows sufficiently large, the detectors harvest less quantum coherence, while the detectors could extract more quantum entanglement from the vacuum state. Compared with the linear configuration and the scalene configuration, we should choose the model of equilateral triangle configuration to harvest tripartite coherence from the vacuum. Finally, we find a monogamous relationship, which means that tripartite l1-norm of coherence is essentially bipartite types.</description>

      <title>Increasing the Measured Effective Quantum Volume with Zero Noise Extrapolation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.15863v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum Volume is a full-stack benchmark for near-term quantum computers. It quantifies the largest size of a square circuit which can be executed on the target device with reasonable fidelity. Error mitigation is a set of techniques intended to remove the effects of noise present in the computation of noisy quantum computers when computing an expectation value of interest. Effective quantum volume is a proposed metric that applies error mitigation to the quantum volume protocol in order to evaluate the effectiveness not only of the target device but also of the error mitigation algorithm. Digital Zero-Noise Extrapolation (ZNE) is an error mitigation technique that estimates the noiseless expectation value using circuit folding to amplify errors by known scale factors and extrapolating to the zero-noise limit. Here we demonstrate that ZNE, with global and local unitary folding with fractional scale factors, in conjunction with dynamical decoupling, can increase the effective quantum volume over the vendor-measured quantum volume. Specifically, we measure the effective quantum volume of four IBM Quantum superconducting processor units, obtaining values that are larger than the vendor-measured quantum volume on each device. This is the first such increase reported.</description>

      <title>Matrix product state approximations to quantum states of low energy variance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.05200v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show how to efficiently simulate pure quantum states in one dimensional systems that have both finite energy density and vanishingly small energy fluctuations. We do so by studying the performance of a tensor network algorithm that produces matrix product states whose energy variance decreases as the bond dimension increases. Our results imply that variances as small as $\propto 1/\log N$ can be achieved with polynomial bond dimension. With this, we prove that there exist states with a very narrow support in the bulk of the spectrum that still have moderate entanglement entropy, in contrast with typical eigenstates that display a volume law. Our main technical tool is the Berry-Esseen theorem for spin systems, a strengthening of the central limit theorem for the energy distribution of product states. We also give a simpler proof of that theorem, together with slight improvements in the error scaling, which should be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Geometrically Local Quantum and Classical Codes from Subdivision</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.16104v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A geometrically local quantum code is an error correcting code situated within $\mathbb{R}^D$, where the checks only act on qubits within a fixed spatial distance. The main question is: What is the optimal dimension and distance for a geometrically local code? Recently, Portnoy made a significant breakthrough with codes achieving optimal dimension and distance up to polylogs. However, the construction invokes a somewhat advanced mathematical result that involves lifting a chain complex to a manifold. This paper bypasses this step and streamlines the construction by noticing that a family of good quantum low-density parity-check codes, balanced product codes, naturally carries a two-dimensional structure. Together with a new embedding result that will be shown elsewhere, this quantum code achieves the optimal dimension and distance in all dimensions. In addition, we show that the code has an optimal energy barrier. We also discuss similar results for classical codes.</description>

      <title>Understanding and Generalizing Unique Decompositions of Generators of Dynamical Semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04037v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We generalize the result of Gorini, Kossakowski, and Sudarshan [J. Math. Phys. 17:821, 1976] that every generator of a quantum-dynamical semigroup decomposes uniquely into a closed and a dissipative part, assuming the trace of both vanishes. More precisely, we show that given any generator $L$ of a completely positive dynamical semigroup and any matrix $B$ there exists a unique matrix $K$ and a unique completely positive map $\Phi$ such that (i) $L=K(\cdot)+(\cdot)K^*+\Phi$, (ii) the superoperator $\Phi(B^*(\cdot)B)$ has trace zero, and (iii) ${\rm tr}(B^*K)$ is a real number. The key to proving this is the relation between the trace of a completely positive map, the trace of its Kraus operators, and expectation values of its Choi matrix. Moreover, we show that the above decomposition is orthogonal with respect to some $B$-weighted inner product.</description>

      <title>Topological Discrimination of Steep to Supersteep Gap to Emergence of Tunneling in Adiabatic Quantum Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10333v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is shown that the gap that limits the speed of a quantum annealing process can take three salient morphologies: (i) the supersteep gap where both the ground and the first excited eigenenergy level curves have topologically related pairs of nearby inflection points giving both the maximum and the minimum a steep aspect, (ii) the steep gap where only the first excited eigenenergy level curve has a pair of inflection points giving its minimum a steep aspect while the maximum of the ground level does not exhibit inflection points, and (iii) the mild gap that has no related inflection points. Classification of the various singularities betrayed by the inflection points relies on the critical value curves of the quadratic numerical range mapping of the matrix H0+iH1, where H0 is the transverse field Hamiltonian and H1 the problem Hamiltonian. It is shown that the ground level is mapped to the generically smooth boundary of the numerical range, while the first excited level is mapped to an interior non-smooth critical value curve exhibiting swallow tails. The major result is that the position of the swallow tails relative to the boundary allows the supersteep versus steep discrimination, while the absence of swallow tail-boundary interaction characterizes the mild gap. As a corollary of the singularity analysis, the highly structured initial and final Hamiltonians of the Grover search create unstable singularities that break into stable swallow tails under perturbation, with the consequence of invalidating the gap scaling estimates computed around the unstable singularity. Classification of all stable singularities from a global viewpoint requires the Legendrian approach where the energy level curves become Legendrian knots in the contact space. Last but not least, it will be shown that a supersteep swallow tail previews tunneling.</description>

      <title>Fundamental mechanisms of energy exchanges in autonomous measurements based on dispersive qubit-light interaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.11870v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Measuring an observable which does not commute with the Hamiltonian of a quantum system usually modifies the mean energy of this system. In an autonomous measurement scheme, coupling the system to a quantum meter, the system's energy change must be compensated by the meter's energy change. Here, we theoretically study such an autonomous meter-system dynamics: a qubit interacting dispersively with a light pulse propagating in a one-dimensional waveguide. The phase of the light pulse is shifted, conditioned to the qubit's state along the $z$-direction, while the orientation of the qubit Hamiltonian is arbitrary. As the interaction is dispersive, photon number is conserved so that energy balance has to be attained by spectral deformations of the light pulse. Building on analytical and numerical solutions, we reveal the mechanism underlying this spectral deformation and display how it compensates for the qubit's energy change. We explain the formation of a three-peak structure of the output spectrum and we provide the conditions under which this is observable.</description>

      <title>Multiparameter critical quantum metrology with impurity probes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.16931v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum systems can be used as probes in the context of metrology for enhanced parameter estimation. In particular, the delicacy of critical systems to perturbations can make them ideal sensors. Arguably the simplest realistic probe system is a spin-1/2 impurity, which can be manipulated and measured in-situ when embedded in a fermionic environment. Although entanglement between a single impurity probe and its environment produces nontrivial many-body effects, criticality cannot be leveraged for sensing. Here we introduce instead the two-impurity Kondo (2IK) model as a novel paradigm for critical quantum metrology, and examine the multiparameter estimation scenario at finite temperature. We explore the full metrological phase diagram numerically and obtain exact analytic results near criticality. Enhanced sensitivity to the inter-impurity coupling driving a second-order phase transition is evidenced by diverging quantum Fisher information (QFI) and quantum signal-to-noise ratio (QSNR). However, with uncertainty in both coupling strength and temperature, the multiparameter QFI matrix becomes singular -- even though the parameters to be estimated are independent -- resulting in vanishing QSNRs. We demonstrate that by applying a known control field, the singularity can be removed and measurement sensitivity restored. For general systems, we show that the degradation in the QSNR due to uncertainties in another parameter is controlled by the degree of correlation between the unknown parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.18003v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The CSS code construction is a powerful framework used to express features of a quantum code in terms of a pair of underlying classical codes. Its subsystem extension allows for similar expressions, but the general case has not been fully explored. Extending previous work of Aly, Klappenecker, and Sarvepalli [quantph/0610153], we determine subsystem CSS code parameters, express codewords, and develop a Steane-type decoder using only data from the two underlying classical codes. Generalizing a result of Kovalev and Pryadko [Phys. Rev. A 88 012311 (2013)], we show that any subsystem stabilizer code can be "doubled" to yield a subsystem CSS code with twice the number of physical, logical, and gauge qudits and up to twice the code distance. This mapping preserves locality and is tighter than the Majorana-based mapping of Bravyi, Terhal, and Leemhuis [New J. Phys. 12 083039 (2010)]. Using Goursat's Lemma, we show that every subsystem stabilizer code can be constructed from two nested subsystem CSS codes satisfying certain constraints, and we characterize subsystem stabilizer codes based on the nested codes' properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03988v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-dimensional teleportation provides various benefits in quantum networks and repeaters, but all these advantages rely on the high-quality distribution of high-dimensional entanglement over a noisy channel. It is essential to consider correlation effects when two entangled qutrits travel consecutively through the same channel. In this paper, we present two strategies for enhancing qutrit teleportation in correlated amplitude damping (CAD) noise by weak measurement (WM) and environment-assisted measurement (EAM). The fidelity of both approaches has been dramatically improved due to the probabilistic nature of WM and EAM. We have observed that the correlation effects of CAD noise result in an increase in the probability of success. A comparison has demonstrated that the EAM scheme consistently outperforms the WM scheme in regard to fidelity. Our research expands the capabilities of WM and EAM as quantum techniques to combat CAD noise in qutrit teleportation, facilitating the development of advanced quantum technologies in high-dimensional systems.</description>

Abstract: We experimentally implement circuits of one and two mode operations on two motional modes of a single trapped ion. This is achieved by implementing the required displacement, squeezing, two-mode squeezing, and beamsplitter operations using oscillating electric potentials applied to the trap electrodes. The resulting electric fields drive the modes resonantly or parametrically without the need for optical forces. As a demonstration, we implement SU(2) and SU(1,1) interferometers with phase sensitivities near the Cram\'er-Rao bound. We report a maximum sensitivity of a SU(2) interferometer within $0.67(5)\,$dB of the standard quantum limit (SQL) as well as a single and two-mode SU(1,1) sensitivity of $5.9(2)\,$dB and $4.5(2)\,$dB below the SQL respectively.</description>

Abstract: Quantum simulation using synthetic quantum systems offers unique opportunities to explore open questions in many-body physics and a path for the generation of useful entangled states. Nevertheless, so far many quantum simulators have been fundamentally limited in the models they can mimic. Here, we are able to realize an all-to-all interaction with arbitrary quadratic Hamiltonian or effectively an infinite range tunable Heisenberg XYZ model. This is accomplished by engineering cavity-mediated four-photon interactions between 700 rubidium atoms in which we harness a pair of momentum states as the effective pseudo spin or qubit degree of freedom. Using this capability we realize for the first time the so-called two-axis counter-twisting model at the mean-field level. The versatility of our platform to include more than two relevant momentum states, combined with the flexibility of the simulated Hamiltonians by adding cavity tones opens rich opportunities for quantum simulation and quantum sensing in matter-wave interferometers and other quantum sensors such as optical clocks and magnetometers</description>

      <title>Stimulated emission tomography for efficient characterization of spatial entanglement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05036v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stimulated emission tomography (SET) is an excellent tool for characterizing the process of spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC), which is commonly used to create pairs of entangled photons for use in quantum information protocols. The use of stimulated emission increases the average number of detected photons by several orders of magnitude compared to the spontaneous process. In a SET measurement, the parametric down-conversion is seeded by an intense signal field prepared with specified mode properties rather than by broadband multi-modal vacuum fluctuations, as is the case for the spontaneous process. The SET process generates an intense idler field in a mode that is the complex conjugate to the signal mode. In this work we use SET to estimate the joint spatial mode distribution (JSMD) in the Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) basis of the two photons of an entangled photon pair. The pair is produced by parametric down-conversion in a beta barium borate (BBO) crystal with type-II phase matching pumped at a wavelength of 405 nm along with a 780-nm seed signal beam prepared in a variety of LG modes to generate an 842-nm idler beam of which the spatial mode distribution is measured. We observe strong idler production and good agreement with the theoretical prediction of its spatial mode distribution. Our experimental procedure should enable the efficient determination of the photon-pair wavefunctions produced by low-brightness SPDC sources and the characterization of high-dimensional entangled-photon pairs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12548v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a construction of kinetically constrained models using the Markovian quantum dynamics under strong dissipation. Engineering the Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad (GKSL) equation through classical noise, we show that strong dissipation leads to the emergent decoherence-free subspaces, within which constrained quantum many-body unitary dynamics can take place. We argue that the unitary dynamics constructed by the GKSL dynamics is more tightly constrained than that constructed by the strongly interacting Hamiltonian, where the interactions have the same form with the GKSL jump operators. As an example, we demonstrate that a one-dimensional spin system with two-site dissipation leads to the kinetically constrained "PXQ" model, which exhibits the free domain-wall motion with an additional frozen-block structure. Under a uniform magnetic field, the PXQ model shows the domain-wall localization, similar to the Wannier-Stark localization. We then couple two PXQ chains with the magnetic field by an inter-chain interaction. We discover that, while localization of the domain walls persists despite the interactions for typical parameter regimes, a non-trivial partial delocalization appears for a certain parameter line.</description>

Abstract: We entangle two co-trapped atomic barium ion qubits by collecting single visible photons from each ion through in-vacuo 0.8 NA objectives, interfering them through an integrated fiber-beamsplitter and detecting them in coincidence. This projects the qubits into an entangled Bell state with an observed fidelity lower bound of F &gt; 94%. We also introduce an ytterbium ion for sympathetic cooling to remove the need for recooling interruptions and achieve a continuous entanglement rate of 250 1/s.</description>

      <title>Floquet geometric entangling gates in ground-state manifolds of Rydberg atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00471v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose new applications of Floquet theory in Rydberg atoms for constructing quantum entangling gates in atomic ground-state manifolds. By dynamically periodically modulating the Rabi frequencies of transitions between ground and Rydberg states of atoms, error-resilient two-qubit entangling gates can be implemented in the regime of Rydberg blockade. According to different degrees of Floquet theory utilization, the fidelity of the resulting controlled gates surpasses that of the original reference, and it exhibits high robustness against Rabi error in two qubits and detuning error in the control qubit. Our method only uses encoding in the ground states, and compared to the original scheme using Rydberg state for encoding, it is less susceptible to environmental interference, making it more practical to implement. Therefore, our approach may have broader applications or potential for further expansion of geometric quantum computation with neutral atoms.</description>

Abstract: Entanglement is fundamental to quantum information science and technology, yet controlling and manipulating entanglement -- so-called entanglement engineering -- for arbitrary quantum systems remains a formidable challenge. There are two difficulties: the fragility of quantum entanglement and its experimental characterization. We develop a model-free deep reinforcement-learning (RL) approach to entanglement engineering, in which feedback control together with weak continuous measurement and partial state observation is exploited to generate and maintain desired entanglement. We employ quantum optomechanical systems with linear or nonlinear photon-phonon interactions to demonstrate the workings of our machine-learning-based entanglement engineering protocol. In particular, the RL agent sequentially interacts with one or multiple parallel quantum optomechanical environments, collects trajectories, and updates the policy to maximize the accumulated reward to create and stabilize quantum entanglement over an arbitrary amount of time. The machine-learning-based model-free control principle is applicable to the entanglement engineering of experimental quantum systems in general.</description>

      <title>High-Entanglement Capabilities for Variational Quantum Algorithms: The Poisson Equation Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10156v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The discretized Poisson equation matrix (DPEM) is vital to the field of computational fluid dynamics (CFD), and an algorithm that solves it on a quantum computer could potentially grant exponential space and time complexity speedups. However, the DPEM in 1D has been shown to have trouble being represented as a decomposition in the Pauli basis. Additionally, traditional ansatz for Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) that are used to heuristically solve linear systems (such as the DPEM) have large numbers of parameters, making them harder to train. This research attempts to resolve these problems by utilizing the IonQ Aria quantum computer capabilities that boast all-to-all connectivity of qubits. We propose a decomposition of the DPEM that is based on 2- or 3-qubit entanglement gates and is shown to have $O(1)$ terms with respect to system size, with one term having an $O(n^2)$ circuit depth and the rest having only an $O(1)$ circuit depth (where $n$ is the number of qubits defining the system size). To test these new improvements, we ran numerical simulations to examine how well the VQAs performed with varying system sizes, showing that the new setup offers an $O(n)$ scaling of the number of iterations required for convergence, providing an exponential speedup over their classical computing counterparts. This project shows that the future of computational fluid dynamics may involve quantum computers to provide significant time and space complexity speedups.</description>

Abstract: Quantum state tomography is a crucial technique for characterizing the state of a quantum system, which is essential for many applications in quantum technologies. In recent years, there has been growing interest in leveraging neural networks to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of quantum state tomography. Still, many of them did not include mixed quantum state, since pure states are arguably less common in practical situations. In this research paper, we present two neural networks based approach for both pure and mixed quantum state tomography: Restricted Feature Based Neural Network and Mixed States Conditional Generative Adversarial Network, evaluate its effectiveness in comparison to existing neural based methods. We demonstrate that our proposed methods can achieve state-of-the-art results in reconstructing mixed quantum states from experimental data. Our work highlights the potential of neural networks in revolutionizing quantum state tomography and facilitating the development of quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Parametric Light-Matter Interaction in the Single-Photon Strong Coupling Limit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02024v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Parametric coupling between harmonic oscillators has enabled exquisite measurement precision and control of linear resonators, being extensively studied, for example, in cavity optomechanics. This level of control has been made possible by using strong sideband drives, enhancing the coupling rate while also linearizing the interaction. In this article, we demonstrate a new paradigm of parametrically coupled microwave circuits replacing one linear microwave cavity with a superconducting transmon qubit. Our system utilizes photon-pressure coupling between the transmon qubit and a highly linear microwave resonator, a microwave analog of the radiation-pressure interaction. Applying a strong sideband drive results in an on-demand, non-linear Jaynes-Cummings interaction with the linear resonator. We also observe a single-photon coupling rate an order of magnitude larger than all decay rates, placing the device in the single-photon strong coupling regime. This demonstration of photon-pressure Jaynes-Cummings interactions paves the way for developing novel photon-pressure quantum information processing hardware and will enable exotic tests of quantum gravity in the future by interfacing this new platform with mechanical resonators.</description>

      <title>Generation and characterization of customized perfect Laguerre-Gaussian beams with arbitrary profiles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2202.10692v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate the generation of customized perfect Laguerre-Gaussian (PLG) beams whose intensity maxima localized around any desired curves. The principle is to act appropriate algebraic functions on the angular spectra of PLG beams. We characterize the propagation properties of these beams and compare them with non-diffraction caustic beams possessing the same intensity profiles. The results manifest that the customized-PLG beams can maintain their profiles during propagation and suffer less energy loss than the non-diffraction caustic beams, and hence are able to propagate a longer distance. This new structure beam would have potential applications in areas such as optical communication, soliton routing and steering, optical tweezing and trapping, atom optics, etc.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.05492v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Violation of the Wiedemann-Franz (WF) law in a 2D topological insulator due to Majorana bound states (MBS) is studied via the Lorenz ratio in the single-particle picture. We study the scaling of the Lorenz ratio in the presence and absence of MBS with inelastic scattering modeled using a Buttiker voltage-temperature probe. We compare our results with that seen in a quantum dot junction in the Luttinger liquid picture operating in the topological Kondo regime. We explore the scaling of the Lorentz ratio in our setup when either inelastic scattering occurs with both phase and momentum relaxation or via phase relaxation alone. This scaling differs from that predicted by the Luttinger liquid picture for both uncoupled and coupled Majorana bound states and depends on the nature of inelastic scattering.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05328v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to M\"{u}ller's theorem, the Kolmogorov complexity of a string was shown to be equal to its quantum Kolmogorov complexity. Thus there are no benefits to using quantum mechanics to compress classical information. The quantitative amount of information in classical sources is invariant to the physical model used. These consequences make this theorem arguably the most important result in the intersection of algorithmic information theory and physics. The original proof is quite extensive. This paper contains two simple proofs of this theorem. This paper also contains new bounds for quantum Kolmogorov complexity with error.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04684v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding how out-of-equilibrium states thermalize under quantum unitary dynamics is an important problem in many-body physics. In this work, we propose a statistical ansatz for the matrix elements of non-equilibrium initial states in the energy eigenbasis. The approach is inspired by the Eigenstate Thermalisation Hypothesis (ETH) but the proposed ansatz exhibits different scaling. Importantly, exponentially small cross-correlations between the observable and the initial state matrix elements determine relaxation dynamics toward equilibrium. We numerically verify scaling and cross-correlation, point out the emergent universality of the high-frequency behavior, and outline possible generalizations.</description>

      <title>A Generalized Theory for Optical Cooling of a Trapped Atom with Spin</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19153v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cooling atoms to the ground-state of optical tweezers is becoming increasingly important for high-fidelity imaging, cooling, and molecular assembly. While extensive theoretical work has been conducted on cooling in free space, fewer studies have focused on cooling in bound states. In this work, we present a unified formalism for optical cooling mechanisms in neutral atom tweezers, including resolved and unresolved sideband cooling with different trapping potentials, polarization gradient cooling, gray molasses cooling, $\Lambda$-enhanced gray molasses cooling, and Raman sideband cooling. We perform simulations and demonstrate good agreement with a simplified spin model. We derive and discuss the fundamental limits of each cooling mechanism and propose new strategies for achieving ground-state cooling in optical tweezers. Our findings provide valuable insights into optimizing cooling schemes for neutral atoms in optical tweezers, paving the way for minimizing thermal decoherence in Rydberg and molecular gates and improving efficiencies of molecular assembly.</description>

      <title>Robust Hilbert space fragmentation in group-valued loop models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19386v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a large class of models exhibiting robust ergodicity breaking in quantum dynamics. Our work is inspired by recent discussions of "topologically robust Hilbert space fragmentation," but massively generalizes in two directions: firstly from states describable as "loop-soups" to a broader class of states reminiscent of string-nets and sponges, and secondly from models restricted to square or cubic lattices, to models defined on arbitrary lattices (and even arbitrary graphs without translation invariance). Our constructions leverage a recently proposed group-theory framework [PRX 14, 021034 (2024)], and identify a host of new phenomena arising from the interplay of "group-model dynamics" and lattice structure. We make crisp connections to gauge theories, and our construction generalizes Kitaev's quantum double to infinite groups.</description>

      <title>Memory Kernel Coupling Theory: Obtain Time Correlation Function from Higher-order Moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01923v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamical observables can often be described by time correlation functions (TCFs). However, efficiently calculating TCFs for complex quantum systems is a significant challenge, which generally requires solving the full dynamics of the systems. This Letter presents the memory kernel coupling theory (MKCT), a general formalism for evaluating TCFs. The MKCT builds upon Mori's memory kernel formalism for TCFs. Our theory further decomposes the memory kernel into auxiliary kernels. Rapid decay of auxiliary kernels allows us to truncate the coupled equations of motion with high accuracy. Notably, only higher-order moments are sufficient as the input for obtaining TCFs. While this formalism is general, we carry out the numerical demonstration for a typical open quantum system--the spin-boson model.</description>
