      <title>3D simulations of convective shell Neon-burning in a massive star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.21033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.21033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The treatment of convection remains a major weakness in the modelling of stellar evolution with one-dimensional (1D) codes. The ever increasing computing power makes now possible to simulate in 3D part of a star for a fraction of its life, allowing us to study the full complexity of convective zones with hydrodynamics codes. Here, we performed state-of-the-art hydrodynamics simulations of turbulence in a neon-burning convective zone, during the late stage of the life of a massive star. We produced a set of simulations varying the resolution of the computing domain (from 1283 to 10243 cells) and the efficiency of the nuclear reactions (by boosting the energy generation rate from nominal to a factor of 1000). We analysed our results by the mean of Fourier transform of the velocity field, and mean-field decomposition of the various transport equations. Our results are in line with previous studies, showing that the behaviour of the bulk of the convective zone is already well captured at a relatively low resolution (2563), while the details of the convective boundaries require higher resolutions. The different boosting factors used show how various quantities (velocity, buoyancy, abundances, abundance variances) depend on the energy generation rate. We found that for low boosting factors, convective zones are well mixed, validating the approach usually used in 1D stellar evolution codes. However, when nuclear burning and turbulent transport occur on the same timescale, a more sophisticated treatment would be needed. This is typically the case when shell mergers occur.</description>

      <title>A Multi-wavelength, Multi-epoch Monitoring Campaign of Accretion Variability in T Tauri Stars from the ODYSSEUS Survey. I. HST FUV and NUV Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.21038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.21038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Classical T Tauri Star (CTTS) stage is a critical phase of the star and planet formation process. In an effort to better understand the mass accretion process, which can dictate further stellar evolution and planet formation, a multi-epoch, multi-wavelength photometric and spectroscopic monitoring campaign of four CTTSs (TW Hya, RU Lup, BP Tau, and GM Aur) was carried out in 2021 and 2022/2023 as part of the Outflows and Disks Around Young Stars: Synergies for the Exploration of ULYSSES Spectra (ODYSSEUS) program. Here we focus on the HST UV spectra obtained by the HST Director's Discretionary Time UV Legacy Library of Young Stars as Essential Standards (ULLYSES) program. Using accretion shock modeling, we find that all targets exhibit accretion variability, varying from short increases in accretion rate by up to a factor of 3 within 48 hours, to longer decreases in accretion rate by a factor of 2.5 over the course of 1 year. This is despite the generally consistent accretion morphology within each target. Additionally, we test empirical relationships between accretion rate and UV luminosity and find stark differences, showing that these relationships should not be used to estimate the accretion rate for individual target. Our work reinforces that future multi-epoch and simultaneous multi-wavelength studies are critical in our understanding of the accretion process in low-mass star formation.</description>

      <title>Boil-off of red supergiants: mass loss and type II-P supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.21049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.21049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mass loss mechanism of red supergiant stars is not well understood, even though it has crucial consequences for their stellar evolution and the appearance of supernovae that occur upon core-collapse. We argue that outgoing shock waves launched near the photosphere can support a dense chromosphere between the star's surface and the dust formation radius at several stellar radii. We derive analytic expressions for the time-averaged density profile of the chromosphere, and we use these to estimate mass loss rates due to winds launched by radiation pressure at the dust formation radius. These mass loss rates are similar to recent observations, possibly explaining the upward kink in mass loss rates of luminous red supergiants. Our models predict that low-mass red supergiants lose less mass than commonly assumed, while high-mass red supergiants lose more. The chromospheric mass of our models is $\sim$0.01 solar masses, most of which lies within a few stellar radii. This may explain the early light curves and spectra of type-II P supernovae without requiring extreme pre-supernova mass loss. We discuss implications for stellar evolution, type II-P supernovae, SN 2023ixf, and Betelgeuse.</description>

      <title>A Multi-wavelength, Multi-epoch Monitoring Campaign of Accretion Variability in T Tauri Stars from the ODYSSEUS Survey. II. Photometric Light Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.21071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.21071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical T Tauri Stars (CTTSs) are young, low-mass stars which accrete material from their surrounding protoplanetary disk. To better understand accretion variability, we conducted a multi-epoch, multi-wavelength photometric monitoring campaign of four CTTSs: TW Hya, RU Lup, BP Tau, and GM Aur, in 2021 and 2022, contemporaneous with HST UV and optical spectra. We find that all four targets display significant variability in their light curves, generally on days-long timescales (but in some cases year-to-year) often due to periodicity associated with stellar rotation and to stochastic accretion variability. Their is a strong connection between mass accretion and photometric variability in all bands, but the relationship varies per target and epoch. Thus, photometry should be used with caution as a direct measure of accretion in CTTSs.</description>

      <title>The Effects of Cooling on Boundary Layer Accretion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In many cases accretion proceeds from disks onto planets, stars, white dwarfs, and neutron stars via a boundary layer, a region of intense shear where gas transitions from a near-Keplerian speed to that of the surface. These regions are \textit{not} susceptible to the common magnetorotational and Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities, and instead global modes generated by supersonic shear instabilities are a leading candidate to govern transport in these regions. This work investigates the dynamics of these systems under a range of thermodynamic conditions, surveying both disk sound speeds and cooling rates. Very fast or very slow cooling has little effect on wave dynamics: in the fast-cooling limit, waves propagate in an effectively isothermal manner, and in the slow limit wave propagation is effectively adiabatic. However, when the cooling timescale is comparable to the wave period, wave damping becomes extreme. In cases with intermediate cooling rates, mass and angular momentum transport can be suppressed by orders of magnitude compared to isothermal and uncooled cases. Cooling in accretion disks leads to a preference for wavenumbers near and below the Mach number of the disk; the corresponding lower frequencies can (in non-isothermal systems) couple to gravity modes within the star, potentially causing low-frequency variability such as dwarf nova and quasi-periodic oscillations in accreting systems.</description>

      <title>Analytical models for secular descents in hierarchical triple systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Triple body systems are prevalent in nature, from planetary to stellar to supermassive black hole scales. In a hierarchical triple system, oscillations of the inner orbit's eccentricity and inclination can be induced on secular timescales. Over many cycles, the octupole-level terms in the secular equations of motion can drive the system to extremely high eccentricities via the Eccentric Kozai-Lidov (EKL) mechanism. The overall decrease in the inner orbit's pericenter distance has potentially dramatic effects for realistic systems, such as tidal disruption. We present an analytical approximation in the test particle limit to describe the step-wise eccentricity evolution of the inner orbit. We also integrate the equations of motion and present approximations in both the test particle limit and in the general case to describe the overall octupole-level time evolution of the eccentricity. The analytical approximations are compared to numerical simulations to show that the models accurately describe the form and timescale of the secular descent from large distances to a close-encounter distance (e.g., the Roche limit). By circumventing the need for numerical simulations to obtain the long-term behavior, these approximations can be used to readily estimate descent timescales for populations of systems. We demonstrate by calculating rates of EKL-driven migration for Hot Jupiters in stellar binaries.</description>

      <title>Using the COSMIC Population Synthesis Code to Investigate How Metallicity Affects the Rates of Interacting Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use COSMIC, a galaxy population synthesis code, to investigate how metallicity affects the rate of formation of massive stars with a closely orbiting compact object companion, the suggested progenitors of radio loud long gamma-ray bursts. We present the evolution time of these systems at different metallicities, and how the formation rates of these systems are anti-correlated with metallicity. In particular, these systems occur about 10 times more frequently in at metallicities between $Z = 2\times 10^{-4}$ and $2 \times 10^{-3}$, compared to those between $Z = 2\times 10^{-3}$ and $2 \times 10^{-2}$. This work serves as a prerequisite to predicting the global rates of these systems as a function of redshift, ultimately giving crucial insight into our understanding of the progenitors of long gamma-ray bursts and their evolution over cosmic time.</description>

      <title>Supernova Neutrinos: flavour conversion mechanisms and new physics scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A core-collapse supernova (SN) releases almost all of its energy in the form of neutrinos, which provide a unique opportunity to probe the working machinery of a SN. These sites are prone to neutrino-neutrino refractive effects, which can lead to fascinating collective flavour oscillations among neutrinos. This causes rapid neutrino flavour conversions deep inside the SN even for suppressed mixing angles, with intriguing consequences for the explosion mechanism as well as nucleosynthesis. We review the physics of collective oscillations of neutrinos -- both slow and fast, along with the well-known resonant flavour conversion effects, and discuss the current state-of-the-art of the field. Furthermore, we discuss how neutrinos from a SN can be used to probe novel particle physics properties, extreme values of which are otherwise inaccessible in laboratories.</description>

      <title>Class-Based Time Series Data Augmentation to Mitigate Extreme Class Imbalance for Solar Flare Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time series data plays a crucial role across various domains, making it valuable for decision-making and predictive modeling. Machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) have shown promise in this regard, yet their performance hinges on data quality and quantity, often constrained by data scarcity and class imbalance, particularly for rare events like solar flares. Data augmentation techniques offer a potential solution to address these challenges, yet their effectiveness on multivariate time series datasets remains underexplored. In this study, we propose a novel data augmentation method for time series data named Mean Gaussian Noise (MGN). We investigate the performance of MGN compared to eight existing basic data augmentation methods on a multivariate time series dataset for solar flare prediction, SWAN-SF, using a ML algorithm for time series data, TimeSeriesSVC. The results demonstrate the efficacy of MGN and highlight its potential for improving classification performance in scenarios with extremely imbalanced data. Our time complexity analysis shows that MGN also has a competitive computational cost compared to the investigated alternative methods.</description>

      <title>Poynting flux transport channels formed in polar cap regions of neutron star magnetospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pair cascades in polar cap regions of neutron stars are considered to be an essential process in various models of coherent radio emissions of pulsars. The cascades produce pair plasma bunch discharges in quasi-periodic spark events. The cascade properties, and therefore also the coherent radiation, depend strongly on the magnetospheric plasma properties and vary significantly across and along the polar cap. It is furthermore still uncertain from where the radio emission emanates in polar cap region.
  We investigate the generation of electromagnetic waves by pair cascades and their propagation in the polar cap for three representative inclination angles of a magnetic dipole, $0^\circ$, $45^\circ$, and $90^\circ$.
  2D particle-in-cell simulations that include quantum-electrodynamic pair cascades are used in a charge limited flow from the star surface.
  We found that the discharge properties are strongly dependent on the magnetospheric current profile in the polar cap and that transport channels for high intensity Poynting flux are formed along magnetic field lines where the magnetospheric currents approach zero and where the plasma cannot carry the magnetospheric currents. There, the parallel Poynting flux component is efficiently transported away from the star and may eventually escape the magnetosphere as coherent radio waves. The Poynting flux decreases faster with the distance from the star in regions of high magnetospheric currents.
  Our model shows that no process of energy conversion from particles to waves is necessary for the coherent radio wave emission. Moreover, the pulsar radio beam does not have a cone structure, but rather the radiation generated by the oscillating electric gap fields directly escapes along open magnetic field lines in which no pair creation occurs.</description>

      <title>Unravelling the asphericities in the explosion and multi-faceted circumstellar matter of SN 2023ixf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a detailed investigation of photometric, spectroscopic, and polarimetric observations of the Type II SN 2023ixf. The early detection of highly-ionized flash features, rapid ascent in ultraviolet flux coupled with the blueward shift in near-ultraviolet colors and temperature provides compelling evidence for a delayed shock breakout from a confined dense circumstellar matter (CSM) enveloping the progenitor star. The temporal evolution of polarization in the SN 2023ixf phase revealed three distinct peaks in polarization evolution at 1.4 d, 6.4 d, and 79.2 d, indicating an asymmetric dense CSM, an aspherical shock front and clumpiness in the low-density extended CSM, and an aspherical inner ejecta/He-core. SN 2023ixf displayed two dominant axes, one along the CSM-outer ejecta and the other along the inner ejecta/He-core, showcasing the independent origin of asymmetry in the early and late evolution. The argument for an aspherical shock front is further strengthened by the presence of a high-velocity broad absorption feature in the blue wing of the Balmer features in addition to the P-Cygni absorption post 16 d. Hydrodynamical light curve modeling indicated a progenitor mass of 10 solar mass with a radius of 470 solar radius, explosion energy of 2e51 erg, and 0.06 solar mass of 56Ni. The modeling also indicated a two-zone CSM: a confined dense CSM extending up to 5e14 cm, with a mass-loss rate of 1e-2 solar mass per year, and an extended CSM spanning from 5e14 cm to 1e16 cm with a mass-loss rate of 1e-4 solar mass per year. The early nebular phase observations display an axisymmetric line profile of [OI] and red-ward attenuation of the emission of Halpha post 125 days, marking the onset of dust formation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17715v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we search the OGLE-IV outer Galactic bulge fields for short-period variable objects. The investigation focuses on unexplored timescales roughly below one hour in an area containing about 700 million stellar sources down to approximately I=20 mag. We concentrate mainly on Blue Large-Amplitude Pulsators (BLAPs), which represent a recently discovered enigmatic class of short-period hot subluminous stars. We find 33 BLAPs in the period range from 7.5 to 66.5 min. Thirty-one of them are new discoveries, which increases the number of known stars of this class to over one hundred. Additional eighteen objects with pulsation-like light curve shapes and periods ranging from 17.3 to 53.7 min are presented. Very likely, these are $\delta$ Sct/SX Phe-type stars, but some of them could be pulsating hot subdwarfs or BLAPs. We also report on the detection of five eclipsing binary systems with orbital periods between 61.2 and 121.9 min and three mysterious variable objects with I-band amplitudes larger than 0.9 mag. A spectroscopic follow-up would help in the final classification of the variables.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Disentangling for Spectroscopic Surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19391v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A suite of spectroscopic surveys is producing vast sets of stellar spectra with the goal of advancing stellar physics and Galactic evolution by determining their basic physical properties. A substantial fraction of these stars are in binary systems, but almost all large-survey modeling pipelines treat them as single stars. For sets of multi-epoch spectra, spectral disentangling is a powerful technique to recover or constrain the individual components' spectra of a multiple system. So far, this approach has focused on small samples or individual objects, usually with high resolution ($R \gtrsim 10.000$) spectra and many epochs ($\gtrsim 8$). Here, we present a disentangling implementation that accounts for several aspects of few-epoch spectra from large surveys: that vast sample sizes require automatic determination of starting guesses; that some of the most extensive spectroscopic surveys have a resolution of only $\approx 2,000$; that few epochs preclude unique orbit fitting; that one needs effective regularisation of the disentangled solution to ensure resulting spectra are smooth. We describe the implementation of this code and show with simulated spectra how well spectral recovery can work for hot and cool stars at $R \approx 2000$. Moreover, we verify the code on two established binary systems, the ``Unicorn'' and ``Giraffe''. This code can serve to explore new regimes in survey disentangling in search of massive stars with massive dark companions, e.g. the $\gtrsim 200,000$ hot stars of the SDSS-V survey.</description>

Abstract: The chemical evolution of an exoplanetary Venus-like atmosphere is dependent upon the ultraviolet to near ultraviolet (FUV-NUV) radiation ratio from the parent star, the balance between CO$_{2}$ photolysis and recombination via reactions that depend on the water abundance, and various catalytic chemical cycles. In this study, we use a three-dimensional (3-D) model to simulate conditions for a Venus-like exoplanet orbiting the M-dwarf type star GJ 436 by varying the star/planet distance and considering the resultant effects on heating/cooling and dynamics. The simulation includes the middle and upper atmosphere (&lt;40 mbar). Overall, these model comparisons reveal that the impact of extreme ultraviolet to ultraviolet (EUV-UV) heating on the energy balance shows both radiative and dynamical processes are responsible for driving significant variations in zonal winds and global temperature profiles at &lt; 10$^{-5}$ mbar. More specifically, CO$_{2}$ 15-${\mu}$m cooling balances EUV/UV and Near InfraRed (NIR) heating at altitudes below 10$^{-7}$ mbar pressure with a strong maximum balance for pressures at ~10$^{-5}$ mbar, thus explaining the invariance of the temperature distribution at altitudes below 10$^{-5}$mbar pressure for all cases. Our model comparisons also show that moderate changes in NIR heating result in relatively small changes in neutral temperature in the upper atmosphere, and virtually no change in the middle atmosphere. However, with larger changes in the NIR heating profile, much greater changes in neutral temperature occur in the entire upper and middle atmosphere studied.</description>
