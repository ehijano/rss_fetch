      <title>A Modal Analysis of Electromagnetic Fields Coupling into an Open-Ended Waveguide Mounted on a Finite Flange: Evaluation of a Rectangular Waveguide with a Square Flange</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a modal analysis based on the reciprocity theorem to calculate the coupled/penetrated fields into an open-ended waveguide mounted on a finite flange. Although there is no limitation on the geometry and type of the external source, an infinitesimal dipole is chosen to produce a plane wave incident to the waveguide aperture. The proposed method relates the amplitude of each penetrated mode into the waveguide to the far-field radiation components of that mode from the waveguide aperture. The accuracy of the final result depends on the accuracy of the calculated radiated fields. The radiated field components are calculated considering the reflected fields due to the aperture and the diffracted fields due to the flange edges. For the first time, the impact of a finite flange on the penetrated fields into a waveguide is discussed comprehensively. The geometry of a rectangular waveguide mounted on a thick square flange is selected to be evaluated. The effects of changing the main parameters of the geometry on the penetrated fields are discussed rigorously in various examples. Our results are compared with 3D full-wave simulations, and an excellent agreement was found between the results while our analytical approach showing a 60 times faster performance. In addition, we compared our results with the measurement reported in a previous study.</description>

      <title>Radiative Cooling and Thermoregulation of Vertical Facades with Micropatterned Directional Emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a micropatterned directional emitter ({\mu}DE) with an ultrabroadband, azimuthally selective and tailorable emittance across the thermal wavelengths and over wide angles. The {\mu}DE can enable a novel and passive seasonal thermoregulation of buildings by reducing summertime terrestrial radiative heat gain, and wintertime loss. We show several types of {\mu}DE, such as metallic and white variants, made using low-cost materials and scalable manufacturing techniques that are already in large-scale use. Furthermore, we show that its directional emittance can be geometrically tailored to sky-view factors in different urban scenarios. Outdoor experiments show that {\mu}DEs stay up to 1.53{\deg}C cooler than traditional building envelopes when exposed to direct sunlight on summer days and up to 0.46{\deg}C warmer during winter nights. Additionally, {\mu}DEs demonstrate significant cooling powers of up to 40 Wm-2 in warm conditions and heating powers of up to 30 Wm-2 in cool conditions, relative to typical building envelopes. Building energy models show that {\mu}DEs can achieve all-season energy savings similar to or higher than those of cool roofs. Collectively, our findings show {\mu}DEs as highly promising for thermoregulating buildings.</description>

      <title>Flame Transfer Function Measurement of a Hydrogen-Blended Sequential Combustor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The flame transfer function (FTF) relates acoustic perturbations and the coherent heat release rate response. This frequency-dependent function governs the thermoacoustic stability of a combustor. The FTF measurement is therefore of great interest for predicting the stability of the a practical combustor connected to the engine's compressor and turbine. In this study, the flame transfer function of the sequential flame of an atmospheric constant pressure sequential combustor (CPSC) is experimentally measured. The thermal power of both the first- and second-stage flames is kept constant and their ratio is fixed at 1:1. The effects of hydrogen blending in the first and second stage fuel mixture on the sequential FTF are analyzed. The FTF of the sequential flame is fitted with a distributed time delay (DTD) model with two pulses. The trends of the model parameters obtained are consistent with the chemiluminescence OH* of the sequential flame.</description>

      <title>Collinear Optical Two-Dimensional Coherent Spectroscopy with Fluorescence Detection at 5 kHz Repetition Rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy (2DCS) is a powerful ultrafast spectroscopic technique that can greatly benefit from the unique features of a femtosecond laser operating at a kHz repetition rate. However, isolating specific nonlinear signal in the collinear geometry, especially with a kHz laser, presents challenges. We present an experimental implementation of optical 2DCS in a collinear geometry using a femtosecond laser operating at a 5 KHz repetition rate. The desired nonlinear signal is selectively extracted in the frequency domain by lock-in detection. Both pump-probe and optical 2DCS experiments were conducted on a rubidium vapor. The signal-to-noise ratio of pump-probe and 2DCS spectra was characterised under various experimental parameters. The study highlights the importance of the lock-in reference frequency in overcoming the limitations imposed by low repetition rates, thereby paving the way for the application of collinear optical 2DCS in material systems requiring kHz femtosecond lasers.</description>

      <title>Acoustic Pancharatnam-Berry Geometric Phase Induced by Transverse Spin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Common wisdom believes that the Pancharatnam-Berry (PB) geometric phase is absent in acoustics due to the spin-0 nature of sound waves. We theoretically and experimentally demonstrate that the PB phase can emerge in surface sound waves (SSWs) carrying transverse spin. The phase differs for the SSWs propagating in opposite directions due to spin-momentum locking. We further realize acoustic PB metasurfaces for nearly arbitrary wavefront manipulation. Our work provides the missing piece of acoustic geometric phases, offering new insights into the fundamental properties of sound waves and opening a new avenue for sound manipulation based on the PB phase.</description>

      <title>Designing and analyzing microwave photonic spectral domain filters based on transversal filtering with optical microcombs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microwave transversal filters, which are implemented based on the transversal filter structure in digital signal processing, offer a high reconfigurability for achieving a variety of signal processing functions without changing hardware. When implemented using microwave photonic (MWP) technologies, also known as MWP transversal filters, they provide competitive advantages over their electrical counterparts, such as low loss, large operation bandwidth, and strong immunity to electromagnetic interference. Recent advances in high performance optical microcombs provide compact and powerful multiwavelength sources for MWP transversal filters that require a larger number of wavelength channels to achieve high performance, allowing for the demonstration of a diverse range of filter functions with improved performance and new features. Here, we present a comprehensive performance analysis for microcomb based MWP spectral filters based on the transversal filter approach. First, we investigate the theoretical limitations in the filter spectral response induced by finite tap numbers. Next, we analyze the distortions in the filter spectral response resulting from experimental error sources. Finally, we assess the influence of input signals bandwidth on the filtering errors. These results provide a valuable guide for the design and optimization of microcomb-based MWP transversal filters for a variety of applications.</description>

      <title>Lift-off free catalyst for metal assisted chemical etching of silicon in vapour phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metal-assisted chemical etching of silicon is a promising method for fabricating nanostructures with a high aspect ratio. To define a pattern for the catalyst, lift-off processes are commonly used. The lift-off step however is often a process bottle neck due to low yield, especially for smaller structures. To bypass the lift-off process, other methods such as electroplating can be utilized. In this paper, we suggest an electroplated bi-layer catalyst for vapour phase metal-assisted chemical etching as an alternative to the commonly utilised lift-off process. Samples were successfully etched in vapour, and resulting structures had feature sizes down to 10 nm.</description>

      <title>Microwave-optics entanglement via coupled opto- and magnomechanical microspheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microwave-optics entanglement plays a crucial role in building hybrid quantum networks with quantum nodes working in the microwave and optical frequency bands. However, there are limited efficient ways to produce such entanglement due to the large frequency mismatch between the two regimes. Here, we present a new mechanism to prepare microwave-optics entanglement based on a hybrid system of two coupled opto- and magnomechanical microspheres, i.e., a YIG sphere and a silica sphere. The YIG sphere holds a magnon mode and a vibration mode induced by magnetostriction, while the silica sphere supports an optical whispering-gallery mode and a mechanical mode coupled via an optomechanical interaction. The two mechanical modes are close in frequency and directly coupled via physical contact of the two microspheres. We show that by simultaneously activating the magnomechanical (optomechanical) Stokes (anti-Stokes) scattering, stationary entanglement can be established between the magnon and optical modes via mechanics-mechanics coupling. This leads to stationary microwave-optics entanglement by further coupling the YIG sphere to a microwave cavity and utilizing the magnon-microwave state swapping. Our protocol is within reach of current technology and may become a promising new approach for preparing microwave-optics entanglement, which finds unique applications in hybrid quantum networks and quantum information processing with hybrid quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Robust characterization of photonic integrated circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photonic integrated circuits (PICs) offer ultra-broad optical bandwidths that enable unprecedented data throughputs for signal processing applications. Dynamic reconfigurability enables compensation of fabrication flaws and fluctuating external environments, tuning for adaptive equalization and training of optical neural networks. The initial step in PIC reconfiguration entails measuring its dynamic performance, often described by its frequency response. While measuring the amplitude response is straightforward, e.g. using a tunable laser and optical power meter, measuring the phase response presents challenges due to various factors, including phase variations in test connections and instrumentation limitations. To address these challenges, a universal and robust characterization technique is proposed, which uses an on-chip reference path coupled to the signal processing core (SPC), with a delay larger or smaller than the total delay across the signal processing paths. A Fourier transform of the chip's power response reveals the SPC's impulse response. The method is more robust against low reference-path power and imprecise delays. Experiments using a finite-impulse-response (FIR) structure demonstrate rapid SPC training, overcoming thermal crosstalk and device imperfections. This approach offers a promising solution for PIC characterization, facilitating expedited physical parameter training for advanced applications in communications and optical neural networks.</description>

      <title>Material Hardness Descriptor Derived by Symbolic Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.12880v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hardness is a materials' property with implications in several industrial fields, including oil and gas, manufacturing, and others. However, the relationship between this macroscale property and atomic (i.e., microscale) properties is unknown and in the last decade several models have unsuccessfully tried to correlate them in a wide range of chemical space. The understanding of such relationship is of fundamental importance for discovery of harder materials with specific characteristics to be employed in a wide range of fields. In this work, we have found a physical descriptor for Vickers hardness using a symbolic-regression artificial-intelligence approach based on compressed sensing. SISSO (Sure Independence Screening plus Sparsifying Operator) is an artificial-intelligence algorithm used for discovering simple and interpretable predictive models. It performs feature selection from up to billions of candidates obtained from several primary features by applying a set of mathematical operators. The resulting sparse SISSO model accurately describes the target property (i.e., Vickers hardness) with minimal complexity. We have considered the experimental values of hardness for binary, ternary, and quaternary transition-metal borides, carbides, nitrides, carbonitrides, carboborides, and boronitrides of 61 materials, on which the fitting was performed. The found descriptor is a non-linear function of the microscopic properties, with the most significant contribution being from a combination of Voigt-averaged bulk modulus, Poisson's ratio, and Reuss-averaged shear modulus. Results of high-throughput screening of 635 candidate materials using the found descriptor suggest the enhancement of material's hardness through mixing with harder yet metastable structures (e.g., metastable VN, TaN, ReN$_2$, Cr$_3$N$_4$, and ZrB$_6$ all exhibit high hardness).</description>

      <title>Fundamental charge noise in electro-optic photonic integrated circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.15404v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding thermodynamical measurement noise is of central importance for electrical and optical precision measurements from mass-fabricated semiconductor sensors, where the Brownian motion of charge carriers poses limits, to optical reference cavities for atomic clocks or gravitational wave detection, which are limited by thermorefractive and thermoelastic noise due to the transduction of temperature fluctuations to the refractive index and length fluctuations. Here, we discover that unexpectedly charge carrier density fluctuations give rise to a novel noise process in recently emerged electro-optic photonic integrated circuits. We show that Lithium Niobate and Lithium Tantalate photonic integrated microresonators exhibit an unexpected Flicker type (i.e. $1/f^{1.2}$) scaling in their noise properties, significantly deviating from the well-established thermorefractive noise theory. We show that this noise is consistent with thermodynamical charge noise, which leads to electrical field fluctuations that are transduced via the strong Pockels effects of electro-optic materials. Our results establish electrical Johnson-Nyquist noise as the fundamental limitation for Pockels integrated photonics, crucial for determining performance limits for both classical and quantum devices, ranging from ultra-fast tunable and low-noise lasers, Pockels soliton microcombs, to quantum transduction, squeezed light or entangled photon-pair generation. Equally, this observation offers optical methods to probe mesoscopic charge fluctuations with exceptional precision.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10274v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum technologies are advancing from fundamental research in specialized laboratories to practical applications in the field, driving the demand for robust, scalable, and reproducible system integration techniques. Ceramic components can be pivotal thanks to high stiffness, low thermal expansion, and excellent dimensional stability under thermal stress. We explore lithography-based additive manufacturing of technical ceramics especially for miniaturized physics packages and electro-optical systems. This approach enables functional systems with precisely manufactured, intricate structures and high mechanical stability while minimizing size and weight. It facilitates rapid prototyping, simplifies fabrication and leads to highly integrated, reliable devices. As an electrical insulator with low outgassing and high temperature stability, printed technical ceramics such as Al2O3 and AlN bridge a technology gap in quantum technology and offer advantages over other printable materials. We demonstrate this potential with CerAMRef, a micro-integrated rubidium D2 line optical frequency reference on a printed Al2O3 micro-optical bench and housing. The frequency instability of the reference is comparable to laboratory setups while the volume of the integrated spectroscopy setup is only 6 ml. We identify potential for future applications in compact atomic magnetometers, miniaturized optical atom traps, and vacuum system integration.</description>

Abstract: Our proposed spin valve prototype showcases a sophisticated design featuring a two-dimensional graphene bilayer positioned between layers of ${CrBr}_3$ ferromagnetic insulators. In this model, proximity coupling plays a pivotal role, influencing the magnetization orientations of the graphene layers and significantly impacting the \textit{in-plane} conductivity of the ${CrBr}_3$ layers. In this present work, we position the graphene bilayer between two layers of the ferromagnetic insulator ${CrBr}_3$ to establish this configuration. Using density functional theory, we conduct detailed computations to analyze the electronic structure of this sandwiched system. Our findings reveal a notable finite gap at specific \textit{k}-points, particularly evident in the antiparallel configuration of the magnetizations. This finding represents a significant advancement in spintronics, underscoring the potential of our spin valve prototype to drive innovation in electronic device technologies.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Boosted Entropy-Engineered Synthesis of stable Nanometric Solid Solution CuCo Alloys for Efficient Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00142v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nanometric solid solution alloys are utilized in a broad range of fields, including catalysis, energy storage, medical application, and sensor technology. Unfortunately, the synthesis of these alloys becomes increasingly challenging as the disparity between the metal elements grows, due to differences in atomic sizes, melting points, and chemical affinities. This study utilized a data-driven approach incorporating sample balancing enhancement techniques and multilayer perceptron (MLP) algorithms to improve the model's ability to handle imbalanced data, significantly boosting the efficiency of experimental parameter optimization. Building on this enhanced data processing framework, we developed an entropy-engineered synthesis approach specifically designed to produce stable, nanometric copper and cobalt (CuCo) solid solution alloys. Under conditions of -0.425 V (vs. RHE), the CuCo alloy exhibited nearly 100% Faraday efficiency (FE) and a high ammonia production rate of 232.17 mg h-1 mg-1. Stability tests in a simulated industrial environment showed that the catalyst maintained over 80% FE and an ammonia production rate exceeding 170 mg h-1 mg-1 over a testing period of 120 hours, outperforming most reported catalysts. To delve deeper into the synergistic interaction mechanisms between Cu and Co, in situ Raman spectroscopy was utilized for realtime monitoring, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations further substantiated our findings. These results not only highlight the exceptional catalytic performance of the CuCo alloy but also reflect the effective electronic and energy interactions between the two metals.</description>

      <title>Polarization-controlled non-Hermitian metasurfaces for ultra-sensitive terahertz sensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00579v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs), where eigenvalues and eigenstates coalesce, offer significant advantages in sensor design. However, the extreme sensitivity near EPs poses significant challenges due to fabrication errors and system noises, which degrade sensing performance. To address this, we introduce a novel approach leveraging the polarization degrees of freedom to achieve controllable EPs. By expressing tunable polarization as equivalent gain, we establish a direct relation between the polarization and the phase of the coupled system, and achieve the polarization-controlled singularity even post-fabrication. The polarization angle can be utilized as a sensing index, which enables indirect and accurate measurement near the EPs. The theoretical approach is experimentally validated using a general design of THz non-Hermitian metasurface sensors. Our results indicate that this method enhances robustness and sensitivity, opening new avenues for practical applications in ultra-sensitive sensing.</description>

Abstract: A unique sample independent 3D self calibration methodology is tested on a unique optical coherence tomography and multi-spectral scanning laser ophthalmoscope (OCT-SLO) hybrid system. Operators visual cognition is replaced by computer vision using the proposed novel fully automatic AI-driven system design. Sample specific automatic contrast adjustment of the beam is achieved on the pre-instructed region of interest. The AI model deduces infrared, fluorescence, and visual spectrum optical alignment by estimating pre-instructed features quantitatively. The tested approach, however, is flexible enough to utilize any apt AI model. Relative comparison with classical signal-to-noise-driven automation is shown to be 200 percent inferior and 130 percent slower than the AI-driven approach. The best spatial resolution of the system is found to be (a) 2.41 microns in glass bead eye phantom, 0.76 with STD 0.46 microns in the mouse retina in the axial direction, and (b) better than 228 line pair per millimeter (lp per mm) or 2 microns for all three spectrums, i.e., 488 nm, 840 nm, and 520 to 550 nm emission in coronal, frontal or x-y plane. Intelligent automation reduces the possibility of developing cold cataracts (especially in mouse imaging) and patient-associated discomfort due to delay during manual alignment by facilitating easy handling for swift ocular imaging and better accuracy. The automatic novel tabletop compact system provides true functional 3D images in three different spectrums for dynamic sample profiles. This is especially useful for photodynamic imaging treatment.</description>
