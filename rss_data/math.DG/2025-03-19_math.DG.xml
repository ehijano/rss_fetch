      <title>Randers metrics with compatible linear connections: a coordinate-free approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Randers space is a differentiable manifold equipped with a Randers metric. It is the sum of a Riemannian metric and a one-form on the base manifold. The compatibility of a linear connection with the metric means that the parallel transports preserve the Randers norm of tangent vectors. The existence of such a linear connection is not guaranteed in general. If it does exist then we speak about a generalized Berwald Randers metric. In what follows we give a necessary and sufficient condition for a Randers metric to be a generalized Berwald metric and we describe some distinguished compatible linear connections. The method is based on the solution of constrained optimization problems for tensors that are in one-to-one correspondence to the compatible linear connections. The solutions are given in terms of explicit formulas by choosing the free tensor components to be zero. Throughout the paper we use a coordinate-free approach to keep the geometric feature of the argumentation as far as possible.</description>

      <title>On the topology of manifolds with positive intermediate curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate a conjecture relating the topology of a manifold's universal cover with the existence of metrics with positive $m$-intermediate curvature. We prove the result for manifolds of dimension $n\in\{3,4,5\}$ and for most choices of $m$ when $n=6$. As a corollary, we show that a closed, aspherical 6-manifold cannot admit a metric with positive $4$-intermediate curvature.</description>

      <title>Navigating the Space of Compact CMC Hypersurfaces in Spheres, Part I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we describe a family of embedded hypersurfaces with constant mean curvature (CMC) in the $(n+1)$-dimensional unit sphere. In the process, we provide evidence for new CMC embedded examples. In particular, for some examples with $H=0$, we verify Yau's conjecture stating that among the embedded, non-totally umbilical minimal hypersurfaces in spheres, the Clifford hypersurfaces have the least area.</description>

      <title>On $\mathcal{D}^+_J$ operator on higher dimensional almost K\"{a}hler manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we define $\mathcal{D}^+_J$ operator that is a generalized $\partial\bar{\partial}$ operator on higher dimensional almost K\"{a}hler manifolds. In terms of $\mathcal{D}^+_J$ operator, we study $\bar{\partial}$-problem in almost K\"{a}hler geometry and the generalized Monge-Amp\`{e}re equation on almost K\"{a}hler manifolds. Similarly to the K\"{a}hler case, we obtain $C^\infty$ a priori estimates for the solution of the generalized Monge-Amp\`{e}re equation on the almost K\"{a}hler manifold $(M,\omega,J)$ depended only on $\omega$ and $J$. Then as done in K\"{a}hler geometry, we study Calabi conjecture for almost K\"{a}hler manifolds. Finally, we will pose some questions in almost K\"{a}hler geometry.</description>

      <title>Quasi-coherent sheaves and D-modules in Derived Differential Supergeometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Derived geometry provides powerful tools to handle non-transverse intersections and singular moduli problems arising in geometry and theoretical physics. While derived algebraic geometry has been extensively developed, classical field theories -- formulated as variational problems involving sections of smooth fiber bundles over manifolds -- naturally require the language of differential geometry, infinite-dimensional analysis (e.g., Fr\'echet manifolds), and additional geometric structures on spacetime, such as smooth metrics. Moreover, field theories incorporating fermionic matter fields necessitate extending the framework to include supermanifolds. This article is the first in a sequence aimed at rigorously modeling the derived space of solutions to the field equations of Lagrangian gauge theories as derived $\Ci$-stacks.
  While this article does not explicitly discuss physics or field theory, it develops foundational aspects of derived differential geometry which are useful in their own right and contribute to the further development of the field. Moreover, these results provide essential groundwork for subsequent papers rigorously constructing derived spaces of solutions to Euler-Lagrange equations. We establish foundational results extending existing work on derived manifolds into supergeometric and infinite-dimensional contexts, and explicitly relate these constructions to differential operators and PDE theory. This paper an excerpt from a larger manuscript currently in preparation and is made available now to disseminate key foundational developments.</description>

      <title>Young measure relaxation gaps for controllable systems with smooth state constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we tackle the problem of the existence of a gap corresponding to Young measure relaxations for state-constrained optimal control problems. We provide a counterexample proving that a gap may occur in a very regular setting, namely for a smooth controllable system state-constrained to the closed unit ball, provided that the Lagrangian density (i.e., the running cost) is non-convex in the control variables. The example is constructed in the setting of sub-Riemannian geometry with the core ingredient being an unusual admissible curve that exhibits a certain form of resistance to state-constrained approximation. Specifically, this curve cannot be approximated by neighboring admissible curves while obeying the state constraint due to the intricate nature of the dynamics near the boundary of the constraint set. Our example also presents an occupation measure relaxation gap.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents new sufficient conditions for the absence of a gap corresponding to Young measure and occupation measure relaxations for constrained optimal control problems. Unlike existing conditions, these sufficient conditions do not rely on convexity of the Lagrangian or the set of admissible velocities. We use these conditions to derive new bounds for the size of the relaxation gap.</description>

      <title>Coercivity and Gamma-convergence of the $p$-energy of sphere-valued Sobolev maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider sequences of maps from an $(n+m)$-dimensional domain into the $(n-1)$-sphere, which satisfy a natural $p$-energy growth, as $p$ approaches $n$ from below. We prove that, up to subsequences, the Jacobians of such maps converge in the flat topology to an integral $m$-current, and that the $p$-energy Gamma-converges to the mass of the limit current.
  As a corollary, we deduce that the Jacobians of $p$-energy minimizing maps converge to an integral $m$-current that is area-minimizing in a suitable cobordism class, depending on the boundary datum. Moreover, we obtain new estimates for the minimal $p$-energy of maps with prescribed singularities.</description>

      <title>Rigidity results for the capillary overdetermined problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we obtain rigidity results for bounded positive solutions of the general capillary overdetermined problem \begin{equation}
  \left\{ \begin{array} {ll} \mathrm{div} \left(\frac{\nabla u}{\sqrt{1+|\nabla u|^2}}\right) + f(u) = 0 &amp; \mbox{in }\; \Omega,\\[1mm]
  u= 0 &amp; \mbox{on }\; \partial \Omega,\\[1mm] \partial_{\nu} u=\kappa &amp;\mbox{on }\; \partial \Omega, \end{array}\right. \end{equation} where $f$ is a given $C^1$ function in $\mathbb{R}$, $\nu$ is the exterior unit normal, $\kappa$ is a constant and $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ is a $C^1$ domain. Our main theorem states that if $n=2, \kappa\neq 0$, $\partial \Omega$ is unbounded and connected, $|\nabla u|$ is bounded and there exists a nonpositive primitive $F$ of $f$ such that $F(0)\geq \left(1+\kappa^2\right)^{-\frac12} -1$, then $\Omega$ must be a half-plane and $u$ is a parallel solution. In other words, under our assumptions, if a capillary graph has the property that its mean curvature depends only on the height, then it is the graph of a one dimensional function. We also prove the boundedness of the gradient of solutions of the above problem when $f'(u) &lt;0$. Moreover we study a Modica type estimate for the above overdetermined problem that allows us to prove that, unless $\Omega$ is a half-space, the mean curvature of $\partial \Omega$ is strictly negative under the assumption that $\kappa\neq 0$ and there exists a nonpositive primitive $F$ of $f$ such that $F(0)\geq \left(1+\kappa^2\right)^{-\frac12} -1$. Our results have an interesting physical application to the classical capillary overdetermined problem, i.e., the case where $f$ is linear.</description>

      <title>On the conformal volume of 2-tori</title>

      <description>arXiv:1507.01485v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This note (originally from 2015) provides a proof of a 1985 conjecture of Montiel and Ros concerning the conformal volume of tori. This updated version adds a proof of the claim made in Remark 5 about the value of the conformal volume of tori in the cases not covered by the conjecture of Montiel and Ros. Originally, I did not think that this claim was of enough interest to warrant including the (somewhat involved) proof, but time has shown otherwise. (Also, the proof included here is shorter than my original proof; instead, it relies on a MAPLE computation.)</description>

      <title>The smallest Laplace eigenvalue of homogeneous 3-spheres</title>

      <description>arXiv:1801.04259v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish an explicit expression for the smallest non-zero eigenvalue of the Laplace--Beltrami operator on every homogeneous metric on the 3-sphere, or equivalently, on SU(2) endowed with left-invariant metric. For the subfamily of 3-dimensional Berger spheres, we obtain a full description of their spectra. We also give several consequences of the mentioned expression. One of them improves known estimates for the smallest non-zero eigenvalue in terms of the diameter for homogeneous 3-spheres. Another application shows that the spectrum of the Laplace--Beltrami operator distinguishes up to isometry any left-invariant metric on SU(2). It is also proved the non-existence of constant scalar curvature metrics conformal and arbitrarily close to any non-round homogeneous metric on the 3-sphere. All of the above results are extended to left-invariant metrics on SO(3), that is, homogeneous metrics on the 3-dimensional real projective space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2106.10078v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a Chern-Weil map for the Gel'fand-Fuks characteristic classes of Haefliger-singular foliations, those foliations defined by smooth Haefliger structures with dense regular set. Our characteristic map constructs, out of singular geometric structures adapted to singularities, explicit forms representing characteristic classes in de Rham cohomology. The forms are functorial under foliation morphisms. We prove that the theory applies, up to homotopy, to general smooth Haefliger structures: subject only to obvious necessary dimension constraints, every smooth Haefliger structure is homotopic to a Haefliger-singular foliation, and any morphism of Haefliger structures is homotopic to a morphism of Haefliger-singular foliations. As an application, we provide a generalisation to the singular setting of the classical construction of forms representing the Godbillon-Vey invariant.</description>

Abstract: We express the $q$-th Gauss-Bonnet-Chern mass of an immersed submanifold of Euclidean space as a linear combination of two terms: the total $(2q)$-th mean curvature and the integral, over the entire manifold, of the inner product between the $(2q+1)$-th mean curvature vector and the position vector of the immersion. As a consequence, we obtain, for each $q$, a geometric inequality that holds whenever the positive mass theorem (for the $q$-th Gauss-Bonnet-Chern mass) holds.</description>

Moreover, we also characterize the properties of the nodal lines of the eigenfunctions of the Witten-Laplacian on smooth Riemannian $2$-manifolds. Besides, for a Riemann surface with genus $g$, an upper bound for the multiplicity of closed eigenvalues of the Witten-Laplacian can be provided.</description>

      <title>Positive biorthogonal curvature on $S^2 \times T^2$ via affine connection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11914v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the long-standing problem of the existence of a Riemannian metric on $S^2\times T^2$ with strictly positive biorthogonal curvature in a weaker framework by extending it to affine connections on the product $S^2 \times T^2$ endowed with the standard Riemannian metric. Our result shows that it is possible to consider an affine connection with non-zero torsion, such that the strictly positive biorthogonal curvature condition can be satisfied.</description>

      <title>Analytic diffeomorphisms of the circle and topological Riemann-Roch theorem for circle fibrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10517v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the group $\mathcal G$ which is the semidirect product of the group of analytic functions with values in ${\mathbb C}^*$ on the circle and the group of analytic diffeomorphisms of the circle that preserve the orientation. Then we construct the central extensions of the group $\mathcal G$ by the group ${\mathbb C}^*$. The first central extension, so-called the determinant central extension, is constructed by means of determinants of linear operators acting in infinite-dimensional locally convex topological $\mathbb C$-vector spaces. Other central extensions are constructed by $\cup$-products of group $1$-cocycles with the application to them the map related with algebraic $K$-theory. We prove in the second cohomology group, i.e. modulo of a group $2$-coboundary, the equality of the $12$th power of the $2$-cocycle constructed by the first central extension and the product of integer powers of the $2$-cocycles constructed above by means of $\cup$-products (in multiplicative notation). As an application of this result we obtain the new topological Riemann-Roch theorem for a complex line bundle $L$ on a smooth manifold $M$, where $\pi :M \to B$ is a fibration in oriented circles. More precisely, we prove that in the group $H^3(B, {\mathbb Z})$ the element $12 \, [ {\mathcal Det} (L)]$ is equal to the element $6 \, \pi_* ( c_1(L) \cup c_1(L))$, where $[{\mathcal Det} (L)]$ is the class of the determinant gerbe on $B$ constructed by $L$ and the determinant central extension.</description>

      <title>Holographic M-Brane Super-Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09921v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over a decade before the modern formulation of AdS/CFT duality, Duff et al. had observed a candidate microscopic explanation by identifying the CFT fields with fluctuations of probe p-branes stretched out in parallel near the horizon of their own black brane incarnation. A profound way to characterize these and more general probe p-brane configurations, especially for M5-branes, is expected to be as "super-embeddings" of their super-worldvolumes into target super-spacetime - but no concrete example of these had appeared in the literature. Here we fill this gap by constructing the explicit holographic super-embeddings of probe M5-branes and M2-branes into their corresponding super-AdS backgrounds.</description>

      <title>Reduction of Poisson manifolds with Hamiltonian Lie algebroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10969v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reduction theorem for Poisson manifolds with Hamiltonian Lie algebroids is presented. The notion of compatibility of a momentum section is introduced to the category of Hamiltonian Lie algebroids over Poisson manifolds. It is shown that a compatible momentum section is a Lie algebra homomorphism, and then the quotient space of the zero level set of a compatible momentum section proves to be a Poisson manifold.</description>
