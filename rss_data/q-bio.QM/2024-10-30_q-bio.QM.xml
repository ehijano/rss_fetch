      <title>Enhancing EHR Systems with data from wearables: An end-to-end Solution for monitoring post-Surgical Symptoms in older adults</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mobile health (mHealth) apps have gained popularity over the past decade for patient health monitoring, yet their potential for timely intervention is underutilized due to limited integration with electronic health records (EHR) systems. Current EHR systems lack real-time monitoring capabilities for symptoms, medication adherence, physical and social functions, and community integration. Existing systems typically rely on static, in-clinic measures rather than dynamic, real-time patient data. This highlights the need for automated, scalable, and human-centered platforms to integrate patient-generated health data (PGHD) within EHR. Incorporating PGHD in a user-friendly format can enhance patient symptom surveillance, ultimately improving care management and post-surgical outcomes. To address this barrier, we have developed an mHealth platform, ROAMM-EHR, to capture real-time sensor data and Patient Reported Outcomes (PROs) using a smartwatch. The ROAMM-EHR platform can capture data from a consumer smartwatch, send captured data to a secure server, and display information within the Epic EHR system using a user-friendly interface, thus enabling healthcare providers to monitor post-surgical symptoms effectively.</description>

      <title>osl-ephys: A Python toolbox for the analysis of electrophysiology data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe OHBA Software Library for the analysis of electrophysiological data (osl-ephys). This toolbox builds on top of the widely used MNE-Python package and provides unique analysis tools for magneto-/electro-encephalography (M/EEG) sensor and source space analysis, which can be used modularly. In particular, it facilitates processing large amounts of data using batch parallel processing, with high standards for reproducibility through a config API and log keeping, and efficient quality assurance by producing HTML processing reports. It also provides new functionality for doing coregistration, source reconstruction and parcellation in volumetric space, allowing for an alternative pipeline that avoids the need for surface-based processing, e.g., through the use of Fieldtrip. Here, we introduce osl-ephys by presenting examples applied to a publicly available M/EEG data (the multimodal faces dataset). osl-ephys is open-source software distributed on the Apache License and available as a Python package through PyPi and GitHub.</description>

      <title>Going Beyond H&amp;E and Oncology: How Do Histopathology Foundation Models Perform for Multi-stain IHC and Immunology?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study evaluates the generalisation capabilities of state-of-the-art histopathology foundation models on out-of-distribution multi-stain autoimmune Immunohistochemistry datasets. We compare 13 feature extractor models, including ImageNet-pretrained networks, and histopathology foundation models trained on both public and proprietary data, on Rheumatoid Arthritis subtyping and Sjogren's Disease detection tasks. Using a simple Attention-Based Multiple Instance Learning classifier, we assess the transferability of learned representations from cancer H&amp;E images to autoimmune IHC images. Contrary to expectations, histopathology-pretrained models did not significantly outperform ImageNet-pretrained models. Furthermore, there was evidence of both autoimmune feature misinterpretation and biased feature importance. Our findings highlight the challenges in transferring knowledge from cancer to autoimmune histopathology and emphasise the need for careful evaluation of AI models across diverse histopathological tasks. The code to run this benchmark is available at https://github.com/AmayaGS/ImmunoHistoBench.</description>

      <title>Can Large Language Models Replace Data Scientists in Clinical Research?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data science plays a critical role in clinical research, but it requires professionals with expertise in coding and medical data analysis. Large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential in supporting medical tasks and performing well in general coding tests. However, these tests do not assess LLMs' ability to handle data science tasks in medicine, nor do they explore their practical utility in clinical research. To address this, we developed a dataset consisting of 293 real-world data science coding tasks, based on 39 published clinical studies, covering 128 tasks in Python and 165 tasks in R. This dataset simulates realistic clinical research scenarios using patient data. Our findings reveal that cutting-edge LLMs struggle to generate perfect solutions, frequently failing to follow input instructions, understand target data, and adhere to standard analysis practices. Consequently, LLMs are not yet ready to fully automate data science tasks. We benchmarked advanced adaptation methods and found two to be particularly effective: chain-of-thought prompting, which provides a step-by-step plan for data analysis, which led to a 60% improvement in code accuracy; and self-reflection, enabling LLMs to iteratively refine their code, yielding a 38% accuracy improvement. Building on these insights, we developed a platform that integrates LLMs into the data science workflow for medical professionals. In a user study with five medical doctors, we found that while LLMs cannot fully automate coding tasks, they significantly streamline the programming process. We found that 80% of their submitted code solutions were incorporated from LLM-generated code, with up to 96% reuse in some cases. Our analysis highlights the potential of LLMs, when integrated into expert workflows, to enhance data science efficiency in clinical research.</description>

      <title>LLMs are Highly-Constrained Biophysical Sequence Optimizers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently shown significant potential in various biological tasks such as protein engineering and molecule design. These tasks typically involve black-box discrete sequence optimization, where the challenge lies in generating sequences that are not only biologically feasible but also adhere to hard fine-grained constraints. However, LLMs often struggle with such constraints, especially in biological contexts where verifying candidate solutions is costly and time-consuming. In this study, we explore the possibility of employing LLMs as highly-constrained bilevel optimizers through a methodology we refer to as Language Model Optimization with Margin Expectation (LLOME). This approach combines both offline and online optimization, utilizing limited oracle evaluations to iteratively enhance the sequences generated by the LLM. We additionally propose a novel training objective -- Margin-Aligned Expectation (MargE) -- that trains the LLM to smoothly interpolate between the reward and reference distributions. Lastly, we introduce a synthetic test suite that bears strong geometric similarity to real biophysical problems and enables rapid evaluation of LLM optimizers without time-consuming lab validation. Our findings reveal that, in comparison to genetic algorithm baselines, LLMs achieve significantly lower regret solutions while requiring fewer test function evaluations. However, we also observe that LLMs exhibit moderate miscalibration, are susceptible to generator collapse, and have difficulty finding the optimal solution when no explicit ground truth rewards are available.</description>

      <title>tttrlib: modular software for integrating fluorescence spectroscopy, imaging, and molecular modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17252v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce software for reading, writing and processing fluorescence single-molecule and image spectroscopy data and developing analysis pipelines that unifies various spectroscopic analysis tools. Our software can be used for processing multiple experiment types, e.g., for time-resolved single-molecule (sm) spectroscopy, laser scanning microscopy, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, and image correlation spectroscopy. The software is file format agnostic, processes and outputs multiple time-resolved data formats. Thereby our software eliminates the need for data conversion and mitigates data archiving issues.</description>

      <title>Multiple Gaussian process models based global sensitivity analysis and efficient optimization of in vitro mRNA transcription process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11976v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The in vitro transcription (IVT) process is a critical step in RNA production. To ensure the efficiency of RNA manufacturing, it is essential to optimize and identify its key influencing factors. In this study, multiple Gaussian Process (GP) models are used to perform efficient optimization and global sensitivity analysis (GSA). Firstly, multiple GP models were constructed using the data from multiple experimental replicates, accurately capturing the complexities of the IVT process. Then GSA was conducted to determine the dominant reaction factors, specifically the concentrations of reactants NTP and Mg across all data-driven models. Concurrently, a multi-start optimization algorithm was applied to these GP models to identify optimal operational conditions that maximize RNA yields across all surrogate models. These optimized conditions are subsequently validated through additional experimental data.</description>

      <title>The Inertial Spin Model of flocking with position-dependent forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06368v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an extension to the ISM of flocking and swarming. The model has been introduced to explain certain dynamic features of swarming (second sound, a lower than expected dynamic critical exponent) while preserving the mechanism for onset of order provided by the Vicsek model. The ISM has only been formulated with an imitation (``ferromagnetic'') interaction between velocities. Here we show how to add position-dependent forces in the model, which allows to consider effects such as cohesion, excluded volume, confinement and perturbation with external position-dependent field, and thus study this model without periodic boundary conditions. We study numerically a single particle with an harmonic confining field and compare it to a Brownian harmonic oscillator and to a harmonically confined active Browinian particle, finding qualitatively different behavior in the three cases.</description>
