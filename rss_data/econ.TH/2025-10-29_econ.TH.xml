      <title>Strategic Learning with Asymmetric Rationality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper analyzes the dynamic interaction between a fully rational, privately informed sender and a boundedly rational, uninformed receiver with memory constraints. The sender controls the flow of information, while the receiver designs a decision-making protocol, modeled as a finite-state machine, that governs how information is interpreted, how internal memory states evolve, and when and what decisions are made. The receiver must use the limited set of states optimally, both to learn and to create incentives for the sender to provide information. We show that behavior patterns such as information avoidance, opinion polarization, and indecision arise as equilibrium responses to asymmetric rationality. The model offers an expressive framework for strategic learning and decision-making in environments with cognitive and informational asymmetries, with applications to regulatory review and media distrust.</description>

      <title>The Role of Mathematical Folk Puzzles in Developing mathematical Thinking and Problem-Solving Skills</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper covers a variety of mathematical folk puzzles, including geometric (Tangrams, dissection puzzles), logic, algebraic, probability (Monty Hall Problem, Birthday Paradox), and combinatorial challenges (Eight Queens Puzzle, Tower of Hanoi). It also explores modern modifications, such as digital and gamified approaches, to improve student involvement and comprehension. Furthermore, a novel concept, the "Minimal Dissection Path Problem for Polyominoes," is introduced and proven, demonstrating that the minimum number of straight-line cuts required to dissect a polyomino of N squares into its constituent units is $\mathrm{N}-1$. This problem, along with other puzzles, offers practical classroom applications that reinforce core mathematical concepts like area, spatial reasoning, and optimization, making learning both enjoyable and effective.</description>

      <title>A Characterization of Egalitarian and Proportional Sharing Principles: An Efficient Extension Operator Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Some well-known solutions for cooperative games with transferable utility (TU-games), such as the Banzhaf value, the Myerson value, and the Aumann-Dreze value, fail to satisfy efficiency, although they possess other desirable properties. This paper proposes a new approach to restore efficiency by extending any underlying solution to an efficient one, through what we call an efficient extension operator. We consider novel axioms for an efficient extension operator and characterize the egalitarian surplus sharing method and the proportional sharing method in a unified manner. These results can be considered as new justifications for the f-ESS values and the f-PS values introduced by Funaki and Koriyama (2025), which are generalizations of the equal surplus sharing value and the proportional sharing value. Our results offer an additional rationale for the values with an arbitrary underlying solution. As applications, we develop an efficient-fair extension of the solutions for the TU-games with communication networks and its variant for TU-games with coalition structures.</description>

      <title>Preference Learning with Response Time: Robust Losses and Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22820v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the integration of response time data into human preference learning frameworks for more effective reward model elicitation. While binary preference data has become fundamental in fine-tuning foundation models, generative AI systems, and other large-scale models, the valuable temporal information inherent in user decision-making remains largely unexploited. We propose novel methodologies to incorporate response time information alongside binary choice data, leveraging the Evidence Accumulation Drift Diffusion (EZ) model, under which response time is informative of the preference strength. We develop Neyman-orthogonal loss functions that achieve oracle convergence rates for reward model learning, matching the theoretical optimal rates that would be attained if the expected response times for each query were known a priori. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that for linear reward functions, conventional preference learning suffers from error rates that scale exponentially with reward magnitude. In contrast, our response time-augmented approach reduces this to polynomial scaling, representing a significant improvement in sample efficiency. We extend these guarantees to non-parametric reward function spaces, establishing convergence properties for more complex, realistic reward models. Our extensive experiments validate our theoretical findings in the context of preference learning over images.</description>

      <title>Matchings Under Biased and Correlated Evaluations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a two-institution stable matching model in which candidates from two distinct groups are evaluated using partially correlated signals that are group-biased. This extends prior work (which assumes institutions evaluate candidates in an identical manner) to a more realistic setting in which institutions rely on overlapping, but independently processed, criteria. These evaluations could consist of a variety of informative tools such as standardized tests, shared recommendation systems, or AI-based assessments with local noise. Two key parameters govern evaluations: the bias parameter $\beta \in (0,1]$, which models systematic disadvantage faced by one group, and the correlation parameter $\gamma \in [0,1]$, which captures the alignment between institutional rankings. We study the representation ratio, i.e., the ratio of disadvantaged to advantaged candidates selected by the matching process in this setting. Focusing on a regime in which all candidates prefer the same institution, we characterize the large-market equilibrium and derive a closed-form expression for the resulting representation ratio. Prior work shows that when $\gamma = 1$, this ratio scales linearly with $\beta$. In contrast, we show that the representation ratio increases nonlinearly with $\gamma$ and even modest losses in correlation can cause sharp drops in the representation ratio. Our analysis identifies critical $\gamma$-thresholds where institutional selection behavior undergoes discrete transitions, and reveals structural conditions under which evaluator alignment or bias mitigation are most effective. Finally, we show how this framework and results enable interventions for fairness-aware design in decentralized selection systems.</description>

      <title>Teacher transfers: equalizing deficits across schools</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18708v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Right to Free and Compulsory Education Act (2009) (RTE) of the Government of India prescribes student-teacher ratios for state-run schools. One method advocated by the Act to achieve its goals is the redeployment of teachers from surplus to deficit (in teacher strength) schools. We consider a model where teachers can either remain in their initially assigned schools or be transferred to a deficit school in their acceptable set. The planner's objective is specified in terms of the post-transfer deficit vector that can be achieved. We show that there exists a transfer whose post-transfer deficit vector Lorenz dominates all achievable post-transfer deficit vectors. We provide a two-stage algorithm to derive the Lorenz-dominant post-transfer deficit vector, and show that this algorithm is strategy-proof for teachers.</description>
