      <title>A double explosive Kuramoto transition in hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study aims to develop a generalised concept that will enable double explosive transitions in the forward and backward directions or a combination thereof. We found two essential factors for generating such phase transitions: the use of higher-order (triadic) interactions and the partial adaptation of a global order parameter acting on the triadic coupling. A compromise between the two factors may result in a double explosive transition. To reinforce numerical observations, we employed the Ott--Antonsen ansatz. We observed that for a wide class of hypergraphs, combining two elements can result in a double explosive transition.</description>

      <title>Master Stability Functions in Complex Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synchronization is an emergent phenomenon in coupled dynamical networks. The Master Stability Function (MSF) is a highly elegant and powerful tool for characterizing the stability of synchronization states. However, a significant challenge lies in determining the MSF for complex dynamical networks driven by nonlinear interaction mechanisms. These mechanisms introduce additional complexity through the intricate connectivity of interacting elements within the network and the intrinsic dynamics, which are governed by nonlinear processes with diverse parameters and higher dimensionality of systems. Over the past 25 years, extensive research has focused on determining the MSF for pairwise coupled identical systems with diffusive coupling. Our literature survey highlights two significant advancements in recent years: the consideration of multilayer networks instead of single-layer networks and the extension of MSF analysis to incorporate higher-order interactions alongside pairwise interactions.
  In this review article, we revisit the analysis of the MSF for diffusively pairwise coupled dynamical systems and extend this framework to more general coupling schemes. Furthermore, we systematically derive the MSF for multilayer dynamical networks and single-layer coupled systems by incorporating higher-order interactions alongside pairwise interactions. The primary focus of our review is on the analytical derivation and numerical computation of the MSF for complex dynamical networks. Finally, we demonstrate the application of the MSF in data science, emphasizing its relevance and potential in this rapidly evolving field.</description>

      <title>Self-Organized Pattern Formation in Geological Soft Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Geological materials are often seen as the antithesis of soft; rocks are hard. However, during the formation of minerals and rocks, all the systems we shall discuss, indeed geological materials in general, pass through a stage where they are soft. This occurs either because they are at a high temperature -- igneous or metamorphic rock -- or because they are at a lower temperature but in the presence of water -- sedimentary rock. For this reason it is useful to introduce soft-matter concepts into the geological domain. There is a universality in the diverse instances of geological patterns that may be appreciated by looking at the common aspect in their formation of having passed through a stage as soft matter.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Process Phase Interpolation for estimating the asymptotic phase of a limit cycle oscillator from time series data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03290v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rhythmic activity commonly observed in biological systems, occurring from the cellular level to the organismic level, is typically modeled as limit cycle oscillators. Phase reduction theory serves as a useful analytical framework for elucidating the synchronization mechanism of these oscillators. Essentially, this theory describes the dynamics of a multi-dimensional nonlinear oscillator using a single variable called asymptotic phase. In order to understand and control the rhythmic phenomena in the real world, it is crucial to estimate the asymptotic phase from the observed data. In this study, we propose a new method, Gaussian Process Phase Interpolation (GPPI), for estimating the asymptotic phase from time series data. The GPPI method first evaluates the asymptotic phase on the limit cycle and subsequently estimates the asymptotic phase outside the limit cycle employing Gaussian process regression. Thanks to the high expressive power of Gaussian processes, the GPPI is capable of capturing a variety of functions. Furthermore, it is easily applicable even when the dimension of the system increases. The performance of the GPPI is tested by using simulation data from the Stuart-Landau oscillator and the Hodgkin-Huxley oscillator. The results demonstrate that the GPPI can accurately estimate the asymptotic phase even in the presence of high observation noise and strong nonlinearity. Additionally, the GPPI is demonstrated as an effective tool for data-driven phase control of a Hodgkin-Huxley oscillator. Thus, the proposed GPPI will facilitate the data-driven modeling of the limit cycle oscillators.</description>
