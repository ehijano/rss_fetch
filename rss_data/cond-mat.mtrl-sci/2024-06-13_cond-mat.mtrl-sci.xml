      <title>Ultra-fast Oxygen Conduction in Sill\'en Oxychlorides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Oxygen ion conductors are crucial for enhancing the efficiency of various clean energy technologies, including fuel cells, batteries, electrolyzers, membranes, sensors, and more. In this study, LaBi2O4Cl is identified as an ultra-fast oxygen conductor from the MBi2O4X (M=rare-earth element, X=halogen element) family, discovered by a structure-similarity analysis of &gt;60k oxygen-containing compounds. Ab initio studies reveal that LaBi2O4Cl has an ultra-low migration barrier of 0.1 eV for oxygen vacancy, significantly lower than 0.6-0.8 eV for interstitial oxygen. Frenkel pairs are the dominant defects in intrinsic LaBi2O4Cl, facilitating notable oxygen diffusion primarily through vacancies at higher temperatures. LaBi2O4Cl with extrinsic oxygen vacancies (2.8%) exhibits a conductivity of 0.3 S/cm at 25{\deg}C, maintains a 0.1 eV diffusion barrier up to 1100{\deg}C, and transitions from extrinsic to mixed extrinsic and intrinsic behavior as the Frenkel pair concentration increases at higher temperatures. Experimental results on synthesized LaBi2O4Cl and Sr-doped LaBi2O4Cl demonstrate comparable or higher oxygen conductivity than YSZ and LSGM below 400 {\deg}C, with lower activation energies. Further experimental optimization of LaBi2O4Cl, including aliovalent doping and microstructure refinement, could significantly enhance its performance and efficiency, facilitating fast oxygen conduction approaching room temperature.</description>

      <title>Quantum embedding study of strain and charge induced Stark effects on the NV$^{-}$ center in diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The NV$^{-}$ color center in diamond has been demonstrated as a powerful nanosensor for quantum metrology, due to the sensitivity of its optical and spin properties to external electric, magnetic, and strain fields. In view of these applications, we use quantum embedding to derive a many-body description of strain and charge induced Stark effects on the NV$^{-}$ center. We quantify how strain longitudinal to the axis of NV$^{-}$ shifts the excited states in energy, while strain with a component transverse to the NV axis splits the degeneracies of the $^{3}E$ and $^{1}E$ states. The largest effects are for the optically relevant $^{3}E$ manifold, which splits into $E_{x}$ and $E_{y}$ with transverse strain. From these responses we extract strain susceptibilities for the $E_{x/y}$ states within the quasi-linear regime. Additionally, we study the many-body dipole matrix elements of the NV$^{-}$ and find a permanent dipole 1.64 D at zero strain, which is $\sim 30 \%$ smaller than that obtained from recent density functional theory calculations. We also determine the transition dipole between the $E_{x}$ and $E_{y}$ and how it evolves with strain.</description>

      <title>Coexistence of ferroelectric and ferrielectric phases in ultrathin antiferroelectric PbZrO3 thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Whereas ferroelectricity may vanish in ultra-thin ferroelectric films, it is expected to emerge in ultra-thin anti-ferroelectric films, sparking people's interest in using antiferroelectric materials as an alternative to ferroelectric ones for high-density data storage applications. Lead Zirconate (PbZrO3) is considered the prototype material for antiferroelectricity, and indeed previous studies indicated that nanoscale PbZrO3 films exhibit ferroelectricity. The understanding of such phenomena from the microstructure aspect is crucial but still lacking. In this study, we fabricated a PbZrO3 film with thicknesses varying from 5 nm to 80 nm. Using Piezoresponse Force Microscopy, we discovered the film displayed a transition from antiferroelectric behaviour in the thicker areas to ferroelectric behaviour in the thinner ones, with a critical thickness between 10 and 15 nm. In this critical thickness range, a 12 nm PZO thin film was chosen for further study using aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy. The investigation showed that the film comprises both ferroelectric and ferrielectric phases. The ferroelectric phase is characterized by polarisation along the pseudocubic [011] projection direction. The positions of Pb, Zr, and O were determined using the integrated differential phase contrast method. This allowed us to ascertain that the ferroelectric PbZrO3 unit cell is half the size of that in the antiferroelectric phase on the ab plane. The observed unit cell is different from the electric field-induced ferroelectric rhombohedral phases. Additionally, we identified a ferrielectric phase with a unique up-up-zero-zero dipole configuration. The finding is crucial for understanding the performance of ultrathin antiferroelectric thin films and the subsequent design and development of antiferroelectric devices.</description>

      <title>Theory for Tunnel Magnetoresistance Oscillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The universal oscillation of the tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) ratio as a function of the insulating barrier thickness in crystalline magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) is a long-standing unsolved problem in condensed matter physics. To explain this, we here introduce a superposition of wave functions with opposite spins and different Fermi momenta, based on the fact that spin-flip scattering near the interface provides a hybridization between majority- and minority-spin states. In a typical Fe/MgO/Fe MTJ, we solve the tunneling problem and show that the TMR ratio oscillates with a period of $\sim3\,$\r{A} by varying the MgO thickness, consistent with previous and present experimental observations.</description>

      <title>High-temperature threshold of damage of SiC by swift heavy ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07963v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At ambient conditions, SiC is known to be resistant to irradiation with swift heavy ions (SHI) decelerating in the electronic stopping regime. However, there is no experimental data on the SiC irradiation at elevated temperatures. To investigate this problem, we evaluate the stability of SiC to SHI impacts at high temperatures up to 2200 K. We apply the combination of the Monte-Carlo code TREKIS-3, describing excitation of the electronic and atomic systems using temperature-dependent scattering cross-sections, with molecular-dynamic modeling of the lattice response to the excitation. We demonstrate that increasing irradiation temperature increases the energy transferred to the atomic lattice from the excited electronic system. This material heating leads to formation of a stable nanometric damaged core along the trajectory of 710 MeV Bi ion when the irradiation temperature overcomes the threshold of ~1800 K. In this case, a chain of nanometric voids along the ion trajectory forms due to the mass transport from the track core by edge dislocations. Voids of larger sizes appear at higher irradiation temperatures. At lower irradiation temperatures, the damaged regions recrystallize completely within ~100 ps after the ion passage.</description>

      <title>Vacancy-induced pseudo-gap formation in antiferromagnetic Cr$_{0.86}$ZnSb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structural defects are important for both solid-state chemistry and physics, as they can have a significant impact on chemical stability and physical properties. Here, we identify a vacancyinduced pseudo-gap formation in antiferromagnetic Cr$_{0.86}$ZnSb. Cr$_{1-x}$ZnSb alloys were studied combining efforts of density functional theory (DFT) calculations and experimental methods to elucidate the effect of vacancies. Detailed analyses (X-ray powder and single crystal diffraction, transmission and secondary scanning electron microscopy) of Cr$_{1-x}$ZnSb, $0&lt;x&lt;0.20$, prompts Cr$_{0.86}$ZnSb as the only stable compound, crystallizing with the MnAlGe-type structure. From DFT calculations, an antiferromagnetic spin configuration of Cr local magnetic moments was found to be favorable for both, the perfectly stoichiometric compound CrZnSb, as well as for Cr$_{0.875}$ZnSb. Magnetic order is observed experimentally for Cr$_{0.86}$ZnSb by temperature- and field-dependent magnetization measurements, revealing a magnetic phase transition near 220 K, which is corroborated by zero-field muon spin relaxation studies. Thermoelectric transport properties exhibit distinct maxima in the temperature-dependent Seebeck coefficient and electrical resistivity at around 190 K. Analyzing the measured data on the basis of a triple parabolic band model and DFT simulations, their characteristic features are traced back to a pseudo-gap in the electronic structure arising from a particular vacancy arrangement.</description>

      <title>Emergence of non-uniform strain induced exciton species in homo- and heterobilayer transition metal dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Full control of excitons in 2D materials is an important step to exploit them for applications. Straintronics is one method that can be used to effectively control the movement of excitons. Unfortunately, the effects of non-uniform strain in 2D materials are not yet well understood theoretically, although these strain fields can be present in experiments in the form of wrinkles, bubbles, and folds, or even explicitly applied to 2D materials through pre-patterned surfaces. The effects of these non-uniform strain fields on multilayers are even less studied due to the sheer size of these systems. In the present investigation, we study wrinkles that form in homo- and heterobilayers of 2D transition metal dichalcogenides using density functional theory. We show that the non-uniform strain leads to the formation of interlayer excitons in homobilayers of $ \mathrm WSe_2 $ and to exciton localization in heterobilayers of $ \mathrm WSe_2$-$ \mathrm MoSe_2$. Our results also reveal that the spin angular momentum is changed due to the mixing of in- and out-of-plane states which can explain the brightening of the formerly dark excitonic states under strain. Our results will pave the way towards a full understanding of the strain-control of excitons in 2D materials.</description>

      <title>Defect-related Anomalous Mobility of Small polarons in Oxides: the Case of Congruent Lithium Niobate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polarons play a major role in the description of optical, electrical and dielectrical properties of several ferroelectric oxides. The motion of those particles occur by elementary hops among the material lattice sites. In order to compute macroscopic transport parameters such as charge mobility, normal diffusion laws are generally assumed. In this paper we show that when defect states able to trap the polarons for long times are considered, significant deviations from the normal diffusion behaviour arise. As an example of this behavior, we consider here the case of lithium niobate (LN), a prototypical system, having interacting polaron types. Our analysis considers the case of a stoichiometric LN containing a certain concentration of small electron polarons hopping on regular Nb sites and compares it to the material in congruent composition, which is characterized by a large concentration of antisite defects. While in the first case the charge carriers are free polarons hopping on a regular Nb sublattice, in the second case a fraction of polarons is trapped on antisite defects. Thus a range of different hopping possibilities arises, depending on the type of starting and destination sites. We develop a formalism encompassing all these microscopic processes in the framework of a switching diffusion model which can be well approximated by a mobile-immobile transport model providing explicit expressions for the polaron mobility. Starting from the Marcus-Holstein model for the polaron hopping frequency we verify by means of a Monte Carlo approach the diffusion/mobility of the different polarons showing that, while free polarons obey the laws for normal diffusion as expected, bound polarons follow an anomalous diffusion behaviour and that in the case of the congruent crystal where mixed free and bound polaron transport is involved, our expressions indeed provide a satisfactory description.</description>

      <title>Deep learning of optical spectra of semiconductors and insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite its potential, optical spectrum prediction for crystalline materials has been largely overlooked in machine learning for materials science. Here we present a proof of concept by creating a ab initio database of 9,915 dielectric tensors of semiconductors and insulators calculated in the independent particle approximation, and subsequently training graph attention neural networks to predict the dielectric function and refractive index. Our study shows that accurate prediction of optical spectra is possible using only the crystal structure and a database of about 10^4 materials.</description>

      <title>An efficient strategy to construct general machine learning potentials for high-entropy ceramics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations powered by machine learning potentials (MLPs) have become an effective way to investigate complex systems. However, the construction of transferable MLPs with broad elemental applicability for HECs remains a challenge due to the vast compositional space. Taking high-entropy carbides (HECs) as the model, we propose a strategy to efficiently construct general neuroevolution potentials (NEPs) for HECs with up to ten principal elements based on carbides with low entropy. The trained NEP exhibits high accuracy and transferability for 3-10HECs with low testing errors of 15.7 meV/atom and 301 meV/{\AA} for energy and force, respectively. Moreover, the accuracy, generalization, and reliability of our established NEP are further validated through the accurate predictions on structural, mechanical, and thermal properties of HECs with the comparison to first-principles calculations, experimental measurements, or the rule of mixture. Our work provides an efficient solution to developing general MLPs for high-entropy ceramics.</description>

      <title>An accurate and transferable machine learning interatomic potential for equimolar and non-equimolar high-entropy diborides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials have become a powerful tool to achieve molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with the accuracy of ab initio methods while beyond their length and timescale limitations. Here, we develop an efficient moment tensor potential (MTP) for high-entropy diborides (HEBs) based on unary and binary diborides with Ti-V-Cr-Zr-Nb-Mo-Hf-Ta-W principal elements. Notably, the trained MTP exhibits exceptional generalization across both equimolar and non-equimolar HEBs, with testing errors in energy and force of 2.6 meV/atom and 155 meV/{\AA} for equimolar HEBs, and 3.7 meV/atom and 172 meV/{\AA} for non-equimolar HEBs, respectively, indicating its remarkable accuracy and transferability. The reliability of the established MTP is further confirmed by a comparative analysis with first-principles calculations, where our MTP accurately reproduces the structural and mechanical properties of various HEBs. The work presents a significant advancement in the simulation of high-entropy ceramics with enhanced efficiency and accuracy.</description>

      <title>Kink-Helium Interactions in Tungsten: Opposing Effects of Assisted Nucleation and Hindered Migration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Point defects such as interstitial atoms are known to be attracted to screw dislocations. Understanding these interaction mechanisms is key to predicting the plasticity of real materials. Using a potential derived from ab initio calculations of helium in tungsten, we find that the binding of a helium atom to dislocation kinks is significantly more favorable than to a straight dislocation. This preference directly translates to a reduction in the kink pair nucleation energy, provided that the mechanism proceeds through a helium-stabilised kink. It is lowered from 1.64 eV (in the pure metal) to 0.51 eV when helium binds to the right kink. However, binding also has a competing effect whereby the kinks are unable to migrate. This hindering aspect becomes more relevant as the helium concentration increases.</description>

      <title>Visualization of atomic structures on faceted and non-flat surfaces by difference-of-gaussians approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detailed analysis of scanning probe microscopy (SPM) data acquired for tilted and non-flat surfaces is usually complicated due to presence of large number of surface areas tilted by large/variable angles relative to the scanning plane. As a consequence, standard methods of elimination of global/local slope by a plane subtraction or numerical differentiation seems to be ineffective. We demonstrate that simple difference-of-gaussians procedure provides us output data corresponding to a projection of considered surface onto scanning plane without undesirable modifications of contrast. This method allows us to minimize small-scale noise, finite slopes of SPM image along both fast and slow scanning directions and eliminate surface rippling. This method can be applied both for fast 'on-the-fly' visualization of experimental data and more detailed analysis, including high precision determination of lattice parameters and angles between translations vectors in different surface domains. In order to estimate geometrical distortions related to the difference-of-gaussians approach, we compare this method with direct image rotation in 3D space.</description>

      <title>Effect of Cr Segregation on Grain Growth in Nanocrystalline {\alpha}-Fe Alloy: A Multiscale Modelling Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a multiscale modelling framework that integrates density functional theory (DFT) with a phase-field model (PFM) to explore the intricate dynamics of grain growth in nanocrystalline {\alpha}-Fe single-phase alloy in the presence of chromium (Cr) segregation. We begin our study by validating our simulation results for equilibrium segregation in stationary GB with Mclean isotherm. Polycrystal simulations featuring nanocrystalline grains at different temperatures reveal that the grain growth kinetics depends on the ratio of Cr diffusivity to intrinsic GB mobility. In the absence of segregation, the relationship between the square of average grain size (d 2
) and time (t) demonstrates a linear correlation. We observe that the d 2 vs. t plot exhibits a consistent linear trend up to a threshold grain size, independent of Cr segregation at GB. However, when Cr is segregated at GB, a deviation from this linear trend with a decreasing slope is evident within the temperature range of 700K to 900K beyond the threshold size. This threshold grain size decreases with increasing temperature. Notably, at 1000K, the deviation from the linear trend is observed from the initial stages of grain growth with segregation, albeit with a linear trend exhibiting a smaller slope. We also present an analytical formulation based on Cahn solute drag theory to predict grain growth behaviour in the presence of solute segregation and our simulation results well aligned this analytical formulation.</description>

      <title>Observing formation and evolution of dislocation cells during plastic deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During plastic deformation of metals and alloys, dislocations self-organise in cells, which subsequently continuously decrease in size. How and when these processes take place has remained elusive, because observations of the structural dynamics in the bulk have not been feasible. We here present X-ray diffraction microscopy movies of the structural evolution during tensile deformation of a mm-sized aluminium (111) single crystal. The formation and subsequent development of 40,000 cells are visualised. We reveal that cells form in a stochastic and isotropic manner already at 1% strain. We show that the cell size and dislocation density distributions are log-normal and bi-modal Gaussian distributions, respectively, throughout. This insight leads to an interpretation of the formation and evolution steps in terms of universal stochastic multiplicative processes. This work will guide dislocation dynamics modelling, as it provides unique results on cell formation.</description>

      <title>Materials for Quantum Technologies: a Roadmap for Spin and Topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This Roadmap provides an overview of the critical role of materials in exploiting spin and topology for next-generation quantum technologies including computing, sensing, information storage and networking devices. We explore the key materials systems that support spin and topological phenomena and discuss their figures of merit. Spin and topology-based quantum technologies have several advantages over their classical, charged-based counterparts, including non-volatility, faster data processing speeds, higher integration densities and lower power consumption. We discuss the main challenges facing the field, identify strategies to overcome them, and provide a realistic outlook on future possibilities of spin-based and topological materials in quantum technology applications.</description>

      <title>Coherent Erbium Spin Defects in Colloidal Nanocrystal Hosts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate nearly a microsecond of spin coherence in Er3+ ions doped in cerium dioxide nanocrystal hosts, despite a large gyromagnetic ratio and nanometric proximity of the spin defect to the nanocrystal surface. The long spin coherence is enabled by reducing the dopant density below the instantaneous diffusion limit in a nuclear spin-free host material, reaching the limit of a single erbium spin defect per nanocrystal. We observe a large Orbach energy in a highly symmetric cubic site, further protecting the coherence in a qubit that would otherwise rapidly decohere. Spatially correlated electron spectroscopy measurements reveal the presence of Ce3+ at the nanocrystal surface that likely acts as extraneous paramagnetic spin noise. Even with these factors, defect-embedded nanocrystal hosts show tremendous promise for quantum sensing and quantum communication applications, with multiple avenues, including core-shell fabrication, redox tuning of oxygen vacancies, and organic surfactant modification, available to further enhance their spin coherence and functionality in the future.</description>

      <title>Single MoS2-flake as a high TCR non-cryogenic bolometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR) of a bolometer can be tuned by modifying the thermal conductance of an absorbing materials since they sense radiations via the temperature change in the absorber. However, the thermal conductance of the absorber can be reduced by engineering the appropriate thermal isolation, which can be an ultimate solution towards making a highly sensitive thermal detector. Here, we have developed an atomically thin 2D bolometer detector made up of a mechanically transferred suspended multilayer-MoS2 flake, eliminating the use of challenging thin-film fabrication process. The strength of our detector lies on the two factors: its large surface-to-volume window to absorb the radiations; the suspended configuration which prevents the heat dissipation through the substrate and therefore reduces the thermal conductance. The bolometric response of the detector is tested in both modes, via the photoresponse and the thermal response. The prototype is found to exhibit a very high TCR ~ -9.5%/K with the least achievable thermal noise-equivalent power (NEP) ~ 0.61 pWHz-1/2, in ambient conditions at 328 K.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Nernst Effect in Ferromagnetic Weyl Semimetal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a three-dimensional Dirac semimetal the time reversal symmetry (TRS) or the inversion symmetry (IS) is not broken. With either of these symmetries broken, the Dirac points in the three-dimensional band structure split up into pairs of so-called Weyl points. The ferromagnetic Weyl semimetals (FMWSM), such as Co3Sn2S2, feature pairs of Weyl points characterized by the opposite chiralities. In this communication we study FMWSM based on TRS broken continuum and lattice Hamiltonians. The latter one is more realistic and represents Co3Sn2S2. These models include all essential ingredients leading to the formation of a pair of Weyl nodes and tilted Weyl cones. Our analysis shows a large anomalous Nernst conductivity which is unlocked due to the divergent Berry curvature - a local manifestation of the geometric properties of electronic wavefunctions - at Weyl points.</description>

      <title>A computational materials science paradigm for a Course-based Undergraduate Research Experience (CURE)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Course-based Undergraduate Research Experiences (CUREs) bring the excitement of research into the classroom to improve learning and the sense of belonging in the field. They can reach more students, earlier in their studies, than typical undergraduate research. Key aspects are: students learn and use research methods, give input into the project, generate new research data, and analyze it to draw conclusions that are not known beforehand. CUREs are common in other fields but have been rare in materials science and engineering. I propose a paradigm for computational material science CUREs, enabled by web-based simulation tools from nanoHUB.org that require minimal computational skills. After preparatory exercises, students each calculate part of a set of closely related materials, following a defined protocol to contribute to a novel class dataset which they analyze, and also calculate an additional property of their choice. This approach has been used successfully in several class projects.</description>

      <title>Chiral edge transport along domain walls in magnetic topological insulator nanoribbons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum anomalous Hall insulators are topologically characterized by non-zero integer Chern numbers, the sign of which depends on the direction of the exchange field that breaks time-reversal symmetry. This feature allows the manipulation of the conducting chiral edge states present at the interface of two magnetic domains with opposite magnetization and opposite Chern numbers. Motivated by this broad understanding, the present study investigates the quantum transport properties of a magnetized $Bi_2Se_3$ topological insulator nanoribbon with a domain wall oriented either parallel or perpendicular to the transport direction. Employing an atomistic tight-binding model and a non-equilibrium Green's function formalism, we calculate the quantum conductance and explore the nature of the edge states. We elucidate the conditions leading to exact conductance quantization and identify the origin of deviations from this behavior. Our analysis shows that although the conductance is quantized in the presence of the horizontal domain wall, the quantization is absent in the perpendicular domain wall case. Furthermore, the investigation of the spin character of the edge modes confirms that the conductance in the horizontal domain wall configuration is spin polarized. This finding underscores the potential of our system as a simple three dimensional spin-filter device.</description>

      <title>Protected gap closing and reopening in topological-insulator Josephson junctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the seminal proposal by Fu and Kane, the superconducting proximity effect was predicted to transform the surface state of a topological insulator (TI) into a topological superconductor, forming a nonchiral 1D Majorana state within a linear Josephson junction on the TI surface. The hallmark of this 1D Majorana state is a robust gap closing as a function of the superconducting phase difference $\varphi$ across the junction, which alternates in and out of the topological phase. These topological phase-transitions occur at $\varphi = (2n+1)\pi$ with integer $n$, leading to a $4\pi$-periodicity of the ground state. While the $4\pi$-periodicity has been indirectly inferred in the AC Josephson effect, the direct observation of the 1D Majorana state in a TI Josephson junction has remained contentious. Here, we report the direct observation of topological phase-transitions in a TI Josephson junction, where the local density of states is probed via tunnel contacts and $\varphi$ is controlled by a flux loop. The observed transitions are independent of the chemical potential, reinforcing their topological origin. Under an applied perpendicular magnetic field, Josephson vortices form, making $\varphi$ position-dependent. In this case, the gap closing occurs locally at the Josephson vortex cores where $\varphi = (2n+1)\pi$, which we also observe. Our findings provide direct confirmation of the Fu-Kane proposal and robust evidence for the emergence of topological superconductivity in a TI Josephson junction.</description>

      <title>Invariant multiscale neural networks for data-scarce scientific applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Success of machine learning (ML) in the modern world is largely determined by abundance of data. However at many industrial and scientific problems, amount of data is limited. Application of ML methods to data-scarce scientific problems can be made more effective via several routes, one of them is equivariant neural networks possessing knowledge of symmetries. Here we suggest that combination of symmetry-aware invariant architectures and stacks of dilated convolutions is a very effective and easy to implement receipt allowing sizable improvements in accuracy over standard approaches. We apply it to representative physical problems from different realms: prediction of bandgaps of photonic crystals, and network approximations of magnetic ground states. The suggested invariant multiscale architectures increase expressibility of networks, which allow them to perform better in all considered cases.</description>

      <title>$\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge field and topological chirality from Umklapp scattering in twisted graphite</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spinless systems exhibit unique topological characteristics compared to spinful ones, stemming from their distinct algebra. Without chiral interactions typically linked to spin, an intriguing yet unexplored interplay between topological and structural chirality may be anticipated. Here we show examples of spinless topological chirality solely from structural chirality in two types of twisted graphite. In a 3D helical structure, we find a chiral Weyl semimetal phase where bulk topology and chiral surface states are both determined by the screw direction. And in a 3D periodic structure formed with alternating twisting angle signs, a higher-order Dirac semimetal with chiral hinge states is discovered. Underlying these novel topological states is the Umklapp scattering that captures the chirality of the twisted interfaces, leading effectively to a sign-flipped chiral interlayer hopping, thereby introducing $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge field that alters the symmetry algebra. Our findings point to a new pathway for engineering topological chirality.</description>

Abstract: Semi-Dirac materials in 2D present an anisotropic dispersion relation, linear along one direction and quadratic along the perpendicular one. This study explores the topological properties and the influence of disorder in a 2D semi-Dirac Hamiltonian. Anisotropic edge states appear only in one direction. Their topological protection can be rigorously founded on the Zak phase of the one-dimensional reduction of the semi-Dirac Hamiltonian, parametrically depending on one of the momenta. In general, only a single value of the momentum is topologically protected so these systems can be considered as high order momentum topological insulators. We explore the dependence on the disorder of the edge states and the robustness of the topological protection in these materials. We also explore the consequences of the high order topological protection in momentum space for the transport properties in a two-terminal configuration.</description>

      <title>Tailoring wetting properties of organic hole-transport interlayers for slot-die coated perovskite solar modules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The use of self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) with anchoring groups was considered as an effective approach for interface engineering in perovskite solar cells with metal oxide charge transporting layers. However, the coating of SAM layers in PSMs by means of a slot-die is a challenging process due to the low viscosity of the solutions and the low wettability of the films. In this study, we integrate a triphenylamine-based polymer, pTPA-TDP, blended with SAM based on 5-[4-[4-(diphenylamino) phenyl] thiophene-2-carboxylic acid (TPATC), to address the challenges of uniform slot-die coating and interface passivation in large-area modules. We fabricated p-i-n oriented PSMs on 50x50 mm2 substrates (12-sub-cells) with NiO hole transport layer (HTL) and organic interlayers for surface modification. Wetting angle mapping demonstrated that ununiform regions of the slot-die coated SAM have hydrophobicity with contact angle values up to 90{\deg}, causing fluctuations in absorber thickness and the presence of macro-defects at buried interfaces. The incorporation of the blended interlayer to NiO/perovskite junction homogenized the surface wettability (contact angle=40{\deg}) and mitigated lattice strain in the absorber. This enabled the effective use of SAM properties on a large-area surface, improving energy level alignment and enhancing the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the modules from 13.98% to 15.83% and stability (ISOS-L-2, T80 period) from 500-1000 hours to 1630 hours. Investigation of PSMs upon cooling till -5 {\deg}C showed that the PCE increased by +0.19%/{\deg}C for samples with NiO HTL, while using SAM and blended interlayers raised the coefficient to ~0.40%/{\deg}C due to changes in activation energy and trap contributions to device performance across a wide temperature range.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) offer an efficient, inexpensive alternative to current photovoltaic technologies, with the potential for manufacture via high-throughput coating methods. However, challenges for commercial-scale solution-processing of metal-halide perovskites include the use of harmful solvents, the expense of maintaining controlled atmospheric conditions, and the inherent instabilities of PSCs under operation. Here, we address these challenges by introducing a high volatility, low toxicity, biorenewable solvent system to fabricate a range of 2D perovskites, which highly effective precursor phases for subsequent transformation to alpha-formamidinium lead triiodide (FAPbI3), fully processed under ambient conditions. PSCs utilising our FAPbI3 reproducibly show remarkable stability under illumination and elevated temperature (ISOS-L-2) and "damp heat" (ISOS-D-3) stressing, surpassing other state-of-the-art perovskite compositions. We determine that this enhancement is a consequence of the 2D precursor phase crystallisation route, which simultaneously avoids retention of residual low-volatility solvents (such as DMF and DMSO) and reduces the rate of degradation of FA+ in the material. Our findings highlight both the critical role of the initial crystallisation process in determining the operational stability of perovskite materials, and that neat FA+-based perovskites can be competitively stable despite the inherent metastability of the alpha-phase.</description>

Abstract: The distorted phases of monolayer 1T-MoS$_2$ have distinct electronic properties, with potential applications in optoelectronics, catalysis, and batteries. We theoretically investigate the use of Ni-doping to generate distorted 1T phases, and find not only the ones usually reported but also two further phases (${3} \times {3}$ and ${4} \times {4}$), depending on the concentration and the substitutional or adatom doping site. Corresponding pristine phases are stable after dopant removal, which might offer a potential route to experimental synthesis. We find large ferroelectric polarizations, most notably in ${3} \times {3}$ which -- compared to the recently measured 1T$''$ -- has 100 times greater ferroelectric polarization, a lower energy, and a larger bandgap. Doped phases include exotic multiferroic semimetals, ferromagnetic polar metals, and improper ferroelectrics with only in-plane polarization switchable. The pristine phases have unusual multiple gaps in the conduction bands, with possible applications for intermediate band solar cells, transparent conductors, and nonlinear optics.</description>

Abstract: We extend the Feynman variational method applied to the parabolic-band Fr\"ohlich (continuum) large polaron~\cite{Feynman1955} to a Holstein (lattice) small polaron, with a parabolic-band. This new theory shows a discrete localisation as a function of coupling strength. Having build the theory with the same quasi-particle Lagrangian as the 1955 work, we can directly use the FHIP~\cite{Feynman1962} response theory to calculate DC mobility and complex conductivity. We show that we can take matrix elements from electronic structure calculations on real materials, by modelling charge-carrier mobility in crystalline Rubrene. Good agreement is found to measurement, with a predicted mobility of $\mu = 47.72$~\si{cm^2 V^{-1} s^{-1}} at $300$~\si{K}.</description>

Abstract: The properties of $\mathrm{MoS_2}$ can be tuned or optimized through doping. In particular, Ni doping has been shown to improve the performance of $\mathrm{MoS_2}$ for various applications, including catalysis and tribology. To enable investigation of Ni-doped $\mathrm{MoS_2}$ with reactive molecular dynamics simulations, we developed a new ReaxFF force field to describe this material. The force field parameters were optimized to match a large set of density-functional theory (DFT) calculations of 2H-$\mathrm{MoS_2}$ doped with Ni, at four different sites (Mo-substituted, S-substituted, octahedral intercalation, and tetrahedral intercalation), under uniaxial, biaxial, triaxial, and shear strain. The force field was evaluated by comparing ReaxFF- and DFT-relaxed structural parameters, the tetrahedral/octahedral energy difference in doped 2H, energies of doped 1H and 1T monolayers, and doped 2H structures with vacancies. We demonstrated the application of the force field with reactive simulations of sputtering deposition and annealing of Ni-doped $\mathrm{MoS_2}$ films. Results show that the developed force field can successfully model the phase transition of Ni-doped $\mathrm{MoS_2}$ from amorphous to crystalline. The newly developed force field can be used in subsequent investigations to study the properties and behavior of Ni-doped $\mathrm{MoS_2}$ using reactive molecular dynamics simulations.</description>

      <title>Flexible, Model-Agnostic Method for Materials Data Extraction from Text Using General Purpose Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.04914v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate and comprehensive material databases extracted from research papers are crucial for materials science and engineering, but their development requires significant human effort. With large language models (LLMs) transforming the way humans interact with text, LLMs provide an opportunity to revolutionize data extraction. In this study, we demonstrate a simple and efficient method for extracting materials data from full-text research papers leveraging the capabilities of LLMs combined with human supervision. This approach is particularly suitable for mid-sized databases and requires minimal to no coding or prior knowledge about the extracted property. It offers high recall and nearly perfect precision in the resulting database. The method is easily adaptable to new and superior language models, ensuring continued utility. We show this by evaluating and comparing its performance on GPT-3 and GPT-3.5/4 (which underlie ChatGPT), as well as free alternatives such as BART and DeBERTaV3. We provide a detailed analysis of the method's performance in extracting sentences containing bulk modulus data, achieving up to 90% precision at 96% recall, depending on the amount of human effort involved. We further demonstrate the method's broader effectiveness by developing a database of critical cooling rates for metallic glasses over twice the size of previous human curated databases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.08643v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we present a ready-to-use symmetry invariant expansion form of the eight-band k.p Hamiltonian for inorganic and organic metal halide perovskites (CsPbX$_3$ and MAPbX$_3$ with $X = \{$Cl, Br, I$\}$). We use the k.p model to calculate the electronic band structures for perovskite materials of cubic and pseudo-cubic phase. In order to find respective parameters, the band structures of considered materials were obtained within state-of-the-art density functional theory and used next as targets to adjust the k.p bands and determine the values of k.p parameters. The calculated band structures were used to obtain the material gain for bulk crystals (CsPbCl$_3$, CsPbBr$_3$, CsPbI$_3$, MAPbCl$_3$, MAPbBr$_3$ and MAPbI$_3$) which is compared with the material gain in well-established III-V semiconductors. It was found that for these perovskites a positive material gain appears at lower carrier density than for the reference materials (GaAs and InP). We demonstrate that from the point of view of the electronic band structure, the studied perovskites are very promising gain medium for lasers.</description>

      <title>General-purpose machine-learned potential for 16 elemental metals and their alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04732v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine-learned potentials (MLPs) have exhibited remarkable accuracy, yet the lack of general-purpose MLPs for a broad spectrum of elements and their alloys limits their applicability. Here, we present a feasible approach for constructing a unified general-purpose MLP for numerous elements, demonstrated through a model (UNEP-v1) for 16 elemental metals and their alloys. To achieve a complete representation of the chemical space, we show, via principal component analysis and diverse test datasets, that employing one-component and two-component systems suffices. Our unified UNEP-v1 model exhibits superior performance across various physical properties compared to a widely used embedded-atom method potential, while maintaining remarkable efficiency. We demonstrate our approach's effectiveness through reproducing experimentally observed chemical order and stable phases, and large-scale simulations of plasticity and primary radiation damage in MoTaVW alloys. This work represents a significant leap towards a unified general-purpose MLP encompassing the periodic table, with profound implications for materials science.</description>

      <title>Computation of the expectation value of the spin operator $\hat{S}^2$ for the Spin-Flip Bethe-Salpeter Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17719v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spin-flip methods applied to excited-state approaches like the Bethe-Salpeter Equation allow access to the excitation energies of open-shell systems, such as molecules and defects in solids. The eigenstates of these solutions, however, are generally not eigenstates of the spin operator $\hat{S}^2$. Even for simple cases where the excitation vector is expected to be, for example, a triplet state, the value of $\langle \hat{S}^2 \rangle$ may be found to differ from 2.00; this difference is called ``spin contamination.'' The expectation values $\langle \hat{S}^2 \rangle$ must be computed for each excitation vector, to assist with the characterization of the particular excitation and to determine the amount of spin contamination of the state. Our aim is to provide for the first time in the spin-flip methods literature a comprehensive resource on the derivation of the formulas for $\langle \hat{S}^2 \rangle$ as well as its computational implementation. After a brief discussion of the theory of the Spin-Flip Bethe-Salpeter Equation and some examples further illustrating the need for calculating $\langle \hat{S}^2 \rangle$, we present the derivation for the general equation for computing $\langle \hat{S}^2 \rangle$ with the eigenvectors from an SF-BSE calculation, how it is implemented in a Python script, and timing information on how this calculation scales with the size of the SF-BSE Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Approaching Periodic Systems in Ensemble Density Functional Theory via Finite One-Dimensional Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17742v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ensemble Density Functional Theory (EDFT) is a generalization of ground-state Density Functional Theory (GS DFT), which is based on an exact formal theory of finite collections of a system's ground and excited states. EDFT in various forms has been shown to improve the accuracy of calculated energy level differences in isolated model systems, atoms, and molecules, but it is not yet clear how EDFT could be used to calculate band gaps for periodic systems. We extend the application of EDFT toward periodic systems by estimating the thermodynamic limit with increasingly large finite one-dimensional ``particle in a box'' systems, which approach the uniform electron gas (UEG). Using ensemble-generalized Hartree and Local Spin Density Approximation (LSDA) exchange-correlation functionals, we find that corrections go to zero in the infinite limit, as expected for a metallic system. However, there is a correction to the effective mass, with results comparable to other calculations on 1D, 2D, and 3D UEGs, which indicates promise for non-trivial results from EDFT on periodic systems.</description>

      <title>Interplay between alloying and tramp element effects on temper embrittlement in bcc iron: DFT and thermodynamic insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02186v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The details of the temper embrittlement mechanism in steels caused by impurities are unknown. Especially from an atomistic point of view, there are still open questions regarding their interactions with alloying elements such as Ni, Cr, and Mo. Therefore, we used density functional theory to investigate the segregation and co-segregation behavior and the resulting influence on the cohesion of three representative tilt grain boundaries in iron. The results are implemented in a multi-site and multi-component kinetic and thermodynamic model for grain boundary segregation, to gain insights into the temporal and final grain boundary coverage. Our results show that the segregation tendency of As, Sb, and Sn is stronger than that of the alloying elements and significantly mitigates the grain boundary cohesion. Depending on the GB type, interactions between Sb and Sn vary from negligible to strongly attractive, which increases the likelihood of co-segregation. The cohesion-weakening effect is further amplified when elements such as Sb, Sn, and As co-segregate, compared to their individual segregation. In contrast, the co-segregation of Ni and Cr does not significantly increase the enrichment of impurities at grain boundaries, and their impact on cohesion is found to be negligible. The ability of Mo to mitigate reversible temper embrittlement is primarily attributed to its cohesion-enhancing effect and its capability to repel tramp elements from GBs, rather than scavenging them within the bulk, as suggested by previous literature.</description>

      <title>Effect of Strain on the Band Gap of Monolayer MoS$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06020v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Monolayer $\mathrm{MoS_2}$ under strain has many interesting properties and possible applications in technology. A recent experimental study examined the effect of strain on the bandgap of monolayer $\mathrm{MoS_2}$ on a mildly curved graphite surface, reporting that under biaxial strain with a Poisson's ratio of 0.44, the bandgap decreases at a rate of 400 meV/% strain. In this work, we performed density functional theory (DFT) calculations for a free-standing $\mathrm{MoS_2}$ monolayer, using the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) PBE, the hybrid functional HSE06, and many-body perturbation theory with the GW approximation using PBE wavefunctions (G0W0@PBE). We found that under biaxial strain with the experimental Poisson's ratio, the bandgap decreases at rates of 63 meV/% strain (PBE), 73 meV/% strain (HSE06), and 43 meV/% strain (G0W0@PBE), which are significantly smaller than the experimental rate. We also found that PBE predicts a similarly smaller rate (90 meV/% strain) for a different Poisson's ratio of 0.25. Spin-orbit correction (SOC) has little effect on the gap or its strain dependence. Additionally, we observed a semiconductor-to-metal transition under an equal tensile biaxial strain of 10% and a transition from a direct to an indirect bandgap, consistent with previous theoretical work.</description>

      <title>Localized Orbital Scaling Correction with Linear Response in Materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07351v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Density functional theory (DFT) is a powerful tool for quantum-mechanical calculations, but practical calculations suffer systematic errors like incorrect charge densities and total energies in molecular dissociation, underestimated band gaps in bulk materials, and poor energy level alignment at interfaces. These problems are due to delocalization error. The localized orbital scaling correction (LOSC) removes delocalization error in molecules effectively, but screening of the Hartree-exchange-correlation response is necessary to correct it in materials. We introduce LOSC with system-dependent linear-response screening (lrLOSC), which effectively corrects delocalization error in semiconductors and insulators. After correcting for electron-phonon effects, the band gaps of eleven test systems are predicted with a mean absolute error of 0.28 eV, comparable to self-consistent $GW$. This method represents a significant step forward in correcting densities and total energies across system sizes and solving the band gap and energy level alignment problems entirely within the DFT framework.</description>

      <title>Nematicity and Orbital Depairing in Superconducting Bernal Bilayer Graphene with Strong Spin Orbit Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.00742v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superconductivity (SC) is a ubiquitous feature of graphite allotropes, having been observed in Bernal bilayers[1], rhombohedral trilayers[2], and a wide variety of angle-misaligned multilayers[3-6]. Despite significant differences in the electronic structure across these systems, supporting the graphite layer on a WSe$_2$ substrate has been consistently observed to expand the range of SC in carrier density and temperature[7-10]. Here, we report the observation of two distinct superconducting states (denoted SC$_1$ and SC$_2$) in Bernal bilayer graphene with strong proximity-induced Ising spin-orbit coupling. Quantum oscillations show that while the normal state of SC$_1$ is consistent with the single-particle band structure, SC$_2$ emerges from a nematic normal state with broken rotational symmetry. Both superconductors are robust to in-plane magnetic fields, violating the paramagnetic limit; however, neither reach fields expected for spin-valley locked Ising superconductors. We use our knowledge of the Fermi surface geometry of SC$_1$ to argue that superconductivity is limited by orbital depairing arising from the imperfect layer polarization of the electron wavefunctions. Finally, a comparative analysis of transport and thermodynamic compressibility measurements in SC$_2$ shows that the proximity to the observed isospin phase boundaries, observed in other rhombohedral graphene allotropes, is likely coincidental, constraining theories of unconventional superconducting pairing mechanisms in theses systems.</description>

      <title>Coexistence of Superconductivity and Superionicity in Li$_2$MgH$_{16}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.04875v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study superconductivity in the superionic phase of the clathrate hydride Li$_2$MgH$_{16}$, where hydrogen ions diffuse among the lattice formed by lithium and magnesium ions. By employing the stochastic path-integral approach, we non-perturbatively take into account the effects of quantum diffusion and anharmonic vibrations. Our calculations reveal strong electron-ion coupling ($\lambda(0)$ = 3.7) and a high superconducting transition temperature ($T_c$) of 277 K under 260 GPa, at which the material is still superionic. $T_c$ is significantly suppressed compared with the result $T_c$ = 473 K obtained from the conventional approach based on the harmonic approximation. Our study, based on a first-principles approach applicable to superionic systems, indicates that the superconductivity and superionicity can coexist in Li$_2$MgH$_{16}$.</description>

      <title>Distance dependence of the energy transfer mechanism in WS$_2$-graphene heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.02716v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report on the mechanism of energy transfer in van der Waals heterostructures of the two-dimensional semiconductor WS$_2$ and graphene with varying interlayer distances, achieved through spacer layers of hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). We record photoluminescence and reflection spectra at interlayer distances between 0.5 nm and 5.8 nm (0-16 hBN layers). We find that the energy transfer is dominated by states outside the light cone, indicative of a F\"orster transfer process, with an additional contribution from a Dexter process at 0.5 nm interlayer distance. We find that the measured dependence of the luminescence intensity on interlayer distances above 1 nm can be quantitatively described using recently reported values of the F\"orster transfer rates of thermalized charge carriers. At smaller interlayer distances, the experimentally observed transfer rates exceed the predictions and furthermore depend on excess energy as well as on excitation density. Since the transfer probability of the F\"orster mechanism depends on the momentum of electron-hole pairs, we conclude that at these distances, the transfer is driven by non-thermalized charge carrier distributions.</description>

Abstract: We develop a framework for on-the-fly machine learned force field molecular dynamics simulations based on the multipole featurization scheme that overcomes the bottleneck with the number of chemical elements. Considering bulk systems with up to 6 elements, we demonstrate that the number of density functional theory calls remains approximately independent of the number of chemical elements, in contrast to the increase in the smooth overlap of atomic positions scheme.</description>

      <title>Visualizing uniform lattice-scale pair density wave in single-layer FeSe/SrTiO3 films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05693v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Typical BCS superconductors are microscopically homogeneous in real space governed by the coherent Cooper pairs with high phase stiffness of superfluid density, which is characterized by a coherence length. However, a periodic oscillation of superconducting order parameter may develop driven by breaking the time-reversal or translational invariance. To date, such modulated orders were specific to each material systems, with a periodicity much larger than the lattice constant. Here we report the direct observation of a uniform lattice-scale pair density wave (PDW) in single-layer FeSe/SrTiO3 films, enforced by peculiar interfacial structure of crystal symmetries breaking. Our spectroscopic imaging scanning tunneling microscopy unravels a spatial modulation of Cooper-pairing gap within a single unit-cell, depending on inequivalent atomic sites. Prominent periodic variation of superfluid density is visualized via Josephson current by a superconducting tip, indicating a real-space oscillation of phase stiffness. Such a lattice-scale superconducting modulation, which coexists with a larger length scale of PDW order, indicates the lattice-scale variation of both pairing strength and phase stiffness. Our findings provide new insights into the intertwined density-wave orders of quasiparticle character in correlated electronic systems, and provoke future studies on the unconventional pairing interaction and phase stiffness in the two-dimensional limit.</description>
