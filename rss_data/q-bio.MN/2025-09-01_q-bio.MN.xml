      <title>Mutual Information Rate -- Linear Noise Approximation and Exact Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient information processing is crucial for both living organisms and engineered systems. The mutual information rate, a core concept of information theory, quantifies the amount of information shared between the trajectories of input and output signals, and enables the quantification of information flow in dynamic systems. A common approach for estimating the mutual information rate is the Gaussian approximation which assumes that the input and output trajectories follow Gaussian statistics. However, this method is limited to linear systems, and its accuracy in nonlinear or discrete systems remains unclear. In this work, we assess the accuracy of the Gaussian approximation for non-Gaussian systems by leveraging Path Weight Sampling (PWS), a recent technique for exactly computing the mutual information rate. In two case studies, we examine the limitations of the Gaussian approximation. First, we focus on discrete linear systems and demonstrate that, even when the system's statistics are nearly Gaussian, the Gaussian approximation fails to accurately estimate the mutual information rate. Second, we explore a continuous diffusive system with a nonlinear transfer function, revealing significant deviations between the Gaussian approximation and the exact mutual information rate as nonlinearity increases. Our results provide a quantitative evaluation of the Gaussian approximation's performance across different stochastic models and highlight when more computationally intensive methods, such as PWS, are necessary.</description>

      <title>MicroLabVR: Interactive 3D Visualization of Simulated Spatiotemporal Microbiome Data in Virtual Reality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microbiomes are a vital part of the human body, engaging in tasks like food digestion and immune defense. Their structure and function must be understood in order to promote host health and facilitate swift recovery during disease. Due to the difficulties in experimentally studying these systems in situ, more research is being conducted in the field of mathematical modeling. Visualizing spatiotemporal data is challenging, and current tools that simulate microbial communities' spatial and temporal development often only provide limited functionalities, often requiring expert knowledge to generate useful results. To overcome these limitations, we provide a user-friendly tool to interactively explore spatiotemporal simulation data, called MicroLabVR, which transfers spatial data into virtual reality (VR) while following guidelines to enhance user experience (UX). With MicroLabVR, users can import CSV datasets containing population growth, substance concentration development, and metabolic flux distribution data. The implemented visualization methods allow users to evaluate the dataset in a VR environment interactively. MicroLabVR aims to improve data analysis for the user by allowing the exploration of microbiome data in their spatial context.</description>
