      <title>Tuition too high? Blame competition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a feedback theory that includes reinforcing and balancing feedback effects that emerge when colleges compete for reputation, applicants, and tuition revenue. The feedback theory is replicated in a formal duopoly model consisting of two competing colleges. An independent ranking entity determines the relative order of the colleges. College applicants choose between the two colleges based on the rankings and the financial aid offered by the colleges. Contrary to the conventional wisdom that competition lowers prices and benefits consumers, our simulations show that competition between academic institutions for resources and reputation leads to tuition escalation that negatively affects students and their families. Four of the five scenarios -- rankings, a capital campaign, facilities improvements, and an excellence campaign -- increase college tuition, institutional debt, and expenditures per student; only the scenario of ignoring the rankings decreases these measures. By referring to the feedback structure of academic competition, the article makes several recommendations for controlling tuition inflation. This article contributes to the literature on the economics of higher education and illustrates the value of feedback economics in developing economic theory.</description>

      <title>Regression Equilibrium in Electricity Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Renewable power producers participating in electricity markets build forecasting models independently, relying on their own data, model and feature preferences. In this paper, we argue that in renewable-dominated markets, such an uncoordinated approach to forecasting results in substantial opportunity costs for stochastic producers and additional operating costs for the power system. As a solution, we introduce Regression Equilibrium--a welfare-optimal state of electricity markets under uncertainty, where profit-seeking stochastic producers do not benefit by unilaterally deviating from their equilibrium forecast models. While the regression equilibrium maximizes the private welfare, i.e., the average profit of stochastic producers across the day-ahead and real-time markets, it also aligns with the socially optimal, least-cost dispatch solution for the system. We base the equilibrium analysis on the theory of variational inequalities, providing results on the existence and uniqueness of regression equilibrium in energy-only markets. We also devise two methods for computing the regression equilibrium: centralized optimization and a decentralized ADMM-based algorithm that preserves the privacy of regression datasets.</description>

      <title>Generative AI Enhances Team Performance and Reduces Need for Traditional Teams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in generative artificial intelligence (AI) have transformed collaborative work processes, yet the impact on team performance remains underexplored. Here we examine the role of generative AI in enhancing or replacing traditional team dynamics using a randomized controlled experiment with 435 participants across 122 teams. We show that teams augmented with generative AI significantly outperformed those relying solely on human collaboration across various performance measures. Interestingly, teams with multiple AIs did not exhibit further gains, indicating diminishing returns with increased AI integration. Our analysis suggests that centralized AI usage by a few team members is more effective than distributed engagement. Additionally, individual-AI pairs matched the performance of conventional teams, suggesting a reduced need for traditional team structures in some contexts. However, despite this capability, individual-AI pairs still fell short of the performance levels achieved by AI-assisted teams. These findings underscore that while generative AI can replace some traditional team functions, more comprehensively integrating AI within team structures provides superior benefits, enhancing overall effectiveness beyond individual efforts.</description>

      <title>Effects of Daily Exercise Time on the Academic Performance of Students: An Empirical Analysis Based on CEPS Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11484v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper examines the effects of daily exercise time on the academic performance of junior high school students in China, with an attempt to figure out the most appropriate daily exercise time for students from the perspective of improving students' test scores. By dividing the daily exercise time into five sections to construct a categorical variable in a linear regression model as well as using another model to draw intuitive figures, I find that spending both too little and too much time on physical activity every day would have adverse impacts on students' academic performance, with differences existing in the impacts by gender, grade, city scale, and location type of the school. The findings of this paper carry implications for research, school health and education policy and physical and general education practice. The results also provide recommendations for students, parents and teachers.</description>

      <title>Empirical Evidence for the New Definitions in Financial Markets and Equity Premium Puzzle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.03468v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study presents empirical evidence to support the validity of new definitions in financial markets. The author develops a new method to determine investors' risk attitudes in financial markets. The risk attitudes of investors in US financial markets from 1889-1978 are analyzed and the results indicate that equity investors who invested in the composite S&amp;P 500 index were risk-averse in 1977. Conversely, risk-free asset investors who invested in US Treasury bills were found to exhibit not enough risk-loving behavior, which can be considered a type of risk-averse behavior. These findings suggest that the new definitions in financial markets accurately reflect the behavior of investors and should be considered in investment strategies.</description>

      <title>Proofs for the New Definitions in Financial Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.03003v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Constructing theorems can help to determine the shape of certain utility curves that make up the new definitions in financial markets. The aim of this study was to present proofs for these theorems. Basic thoughts of new alternative definitions emerge from the decision-making under uncertainty in economics and finance. Shape of the certain utility curve is central to standard definitions in determining risk attitudes of investors. Shape alone determines risk behavior of investors in standard theory. Although the terms risk-averse, risk-loving, and risk-neutral are equivalent to strict concavity, strict convexity, and linearity, respectively, in standard theory, strict concavity or strict convexity, or linearity are valid for certain new definitions, not being the same as standard theory. Hence, it can be stated that new alternative definitions are broader than standard definitions from the viewpoint of shape. For instance, the certain utility curve of a risk-averse investor can be strictly concave or strictly convex, or linear in alternative definitions.</description>

      <title>Intergenerational Equitable Climate Change Mitigation: Negative Effects of Stochastic Interest Rates; Positive Effects of Financing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07614v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Today's decisions on climate change mitigation affect the damage that future generations will bear. Discounting future benefits and costs of climate change mitigation is one of the most critical components of assessing efficient climate mitigation pathways. We extend the DICE model with stochastic discount rates to reflect the uncertain nature of discount rates. Stochastic rates give rise to a stochastic mitigation strategy, resulting in all model quantities becoming stochastic.
  We show that the classical calibration of the DICE model induces intergenerational inequality: future generations have to bear higher costs relative to GDP. Further, we show that considering stochastic discount rates and stochastic abatement policies, which can be interpreted as successive re-calibration, increases intergenerational inequality (and adds additional risks). Motivated by this, we consider additional financing risks by investigating two modifications of DICE. We find that allowing financing of abatement costs and considering non-linear financing effects for large damages improves intergenerational effort sharing. To conclude our discussion of options to improve intergenerational equity in an IAM, we propose a modified optimization to keep costs below 3% of GDP, resulting in more equal distribution of efforts between generations.</description>

      <title>STEER: Assessing the Economic Rationality of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09552v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is increasing interest in using LLMs as decision-making "agents." Doing so includes many degrees of freedom: which model should be used; how should it be prompted; should it be asked to introspect, conduct chain-of-thought reasoning, etc? Settling these questions -- and more broadly, determining whether an LLM agent is reliable enough to be trusted -- requires a methodology for assessing such an agent's economic rationality. In this paper, we provide one. We begin by surveying the economic literature on rational decision making, taxonomizing a large set of fine-grained "elements" that an agent should exhibit, along with dependencies between them. We then propose a benchmark distribution that quantitatively scores an LLMs performance on these elements and, combined with a user-provided rubric, produces a "STEER report card." Finally, we describe the results of a large-scale empirical experiment with 14 different LLMs, characterizing the both current state of the art and the impact of different model sizes on models' ability to exhibit rational behavior.</description>
