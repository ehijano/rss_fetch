      <title>Fast hydrogen atom diffraction through monocrystalline graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report fast atom diffraction through single-layer graphene using hydrogen atoms at kinetic energies from 150 to 1200 eV. High-resolution images reveal overlapping hexagonal patterns from coexisting monocrystalline domains. Time-of-flight tagging confirms negligible energy loss, making the method suitable for matter-wave interferometry. The diffraction is well described by the eikonal approximation, with accurate modeling requiring the full 3D interaction potential from DFT. Simpler models fail to reproduce the data, highlighting the exceptional sensitivity of diffraction patterns to atom-surface interactions and their potential for spectroscopic applications.</description>

      <title>Josephson diode effect in nanowire-based Andreev molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting systems exhibit non-reciprocal current transport under certain conditions of symmetry breaking, a phenomenon known as the superconducting diode effect. This effect allows for perfect rectification of supercurrent, and has received considerable research interest. We report the observation of the Josephson diode effect (JDE) in nanowire-based Andreev molecules, where the time-reversal and spatial-inversion symmetries of a Josephson junction (JJ) can be nonlocally broken by coherently coupling to another JJ. The JDE can be controlled using both non-local phase and gate voltages. Notably, the non-local phase can induce a sign reversal of the diode efficiency, a manifestation of regulating the probabilities of double elastic cotunneling and double-crossed Andreev reflection. Additionally, the diode efficiency can be further modulated by local and non-local gate voltages, exhibiting a central-peak feature in the gate-voltage space. Our theoretical calculations of the energy spectrum and the Josephson currents align well with the experimental results. These results demonstrate the non-local regulation of the JDE in Andreev molecules, offering significant implications for the control of multi-JJ devices and the development of advanced superconducting devices.</description>

      <title>Realization and characterization of an all-bands-flat electronic lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct an electronic all-bands-flat (ABF) lattice and experimentally generate compact localized states (CLSs) therein. The lattice is a diamond (rhombic) chain and implemented as a network of capacitors and inductors, as well as voltage inverters (using operational amplifiers) in order to introduce a \(\pi\)-phase flux within each diamond. The network's normal modes split into three flat bands, and the corresponding CLSs can be excited in isolation via a two-node driving at the flat band frequencies. We also examine the role of the lattice edges and their interaction with the CLSs. Finally, we compare the experimental results to tight-binding predictions and obtain very good agreement. This analysis paves the way for further experimental implementations of ABF systems in electric networks, especially with an eye towards exploring their interplay with nonlinearity.</description>

      <title>The properties of the nitrogen-vacancy center in milled chemical vapor deposition nanodiamonds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluorescent nanodiamonds (FNDs) containing negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV-) centers are vital for many emerging quantum sensing applications from magnetometry to intracellular sensing in biology. However, developing a scalable fabrication method for FNDs hosting color centers with consistent bulk-like photoluminescence (PL) and spin coherence properties remains a highly desired but unrealized goal. Here, we investigate optimized ball milling of single-crystal diamonds produced via chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and containing 2 ppm of substitutional nitrogen and 0.3 ppm of NV- to achieve this goal. The NV charge state, PL lifetime, and spin properties of bulk CVD diamond samples are directly compared to milled CVD FNDs and commercial high-pressure high-temperature (HPHT) FNDs. We find that on average, the relative contribution of the NV- charge state to the total NV PL is lower and the NV PL lifetime is longer in CVD FNDs compared to HPHT FNDs, both likely due to the lower Ns0 concentration in CVD FNDs. The CVD bulk and CVD FNDs on average show similar average T1 spin relaxation times of 3.2 $\pm$ 0.7 ms and 4.7 $\pm$ 1.6 ms, respectively, compared to 0.17 $\pm$ 0.01 ms for commercial HPHT FNDs. Our results demonstrate that ball milling of CVD diamonds enables the large-scale fabrication of NV ensembles in FNDs with bulk-like T1 spin relaxation properties.</description>

      <title>Magnetic brightening of light-like excitons in a monolayer semiconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenides, such as WSe$_2$, are direct gap, multi-valley semiconductors. Long-range electron-hole exchange interactions mix the valleys, yielding dispersion relations for massive ($\propto Q^2$) as well as light-like ($\propto Q$) excitons. We report magneto-photoluminescence spectroscopy of excitons in the monolayer semiconductor WSe$_2$ to $B = \pm25$T. The magnetic field-dependent line shape of the neutral exciton reveals the emergence of a new blue-detuned emission peak in both field orientations. Analyzing the distinct magnetic field-dependent shifts of both peaks facilitates the identification of the emergent feature as a spin-singlet with a significantly smaller reduced exciton mass as compared to the neutral exciton. The intensity of the emergent feature increases with magnetic field according to $\propto B^2$, as expected for a linear dispersion relation. The density-dependent diamagnetic shift ratios of both features follow the expected density dependence of the electron-hole exchange interactions. We interpret our observations within a picture of magnetic-field-induced coupling between the bright massive and quasi dark light-like exciton, leading to its brightening.</description>

      <title>Generalized Brillouin Zone Fragmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Generalized Brillouin Zone (GBZ) encodes how lattice momentum is complex-deformed due to non-Hermitian skin accumulation, and has proved essential in restoring bulk-boundary correspondences. However, we find that generically, the GBZ is neither unique nor well-defined if more than one skin localization direction or strength exists, even in systems with no asymmetric hoppings. Instead, open boundary condition (OBC) eigenstates become complicated superpositions of multiple competing skin modes from "fragments" of all possible GBZs solutions. We develop a formalism that computes the fragmented GBZ in a scalable manner, with fragmentation extent quantified through our newly-defined composition IPR and spectral relative entropy. GBZ fragmentation is revealed to fundamentally challenge the notion of discontinuous phase transitions, since topological winding contributions from different GBZ fragments can "melt away" at different rates. Phenomenologically, GBZ fragmentation also leads to edge localization in all observables in energetically weighted ensembles such as thermal ensembles. This contrasts with conventional GBZs where the skin localization completely cancels in biorthogonal expectations. Occurring universally in multi-mode non-Hermitian media, as we concretely demonstrate with photonic crystal simulations, GBZ fragmentation points towards a new paradigm that is essential for understanding the band structure and the topological and dynamical properties of diverse generic non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <title>Dislocation-mediated short-range order evolution during thermomechanical processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermomechanical processing alters the microstructure of metallic alloys through coupled plastic deformation and thermal exposure, with dislocation motion driving plasticity and microstructural evolution. Our previous work showed that the same dislocation motion both creates and destroys chemical short-range order (SRO), driving alloys into far-from-equilibrium SRO states. However, the connection between this dislocation-mediated SRO evolution and processing parameters remains largely unexplored. Here, we perform large-scale atomistic simulations of thermomechanical processing of equiatomic TiTaVW to determine how temperature and strain rate control SRO via competing creation ($\Gamma$) and annihilation ($\lambda$) rates. Using machine learning interatomic potentials and information-theoretic metrics, we quantify that the magnitude and chemical character of SRO vary systematically with these parameters. We identify two regimes: a low-temperature regime with weak strain-rate sensitivity, and a high-temperature regime in which reduced dislocation density and increased screw character amplify chemical bias and accelerate SRO formation. The resulting steady-state SRO is far-from-equilibrium and cannot be produced by equilibrium thermal annealing. Together, these results provide a mechanistic and predictive link between processing parameters, dislocation physics, and SRO evolution in chemically complex alloys.</description>

      <title>A blueprint for experiments exploring the Poincar\'e quantum recurrence theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum form of the Poincar\'e recurrence theorem stipulates that a system with a time-independent Hamiltonian and discrete energy levels returns arbitrarily close to its initial state in a finite time. Qubit systems, being highly isolated from their dissipative surroundings, provide a possible experimental testbed for studying this theoretical construct. Here we investigate a $N$-qubit system, weakly coupled to its environment. We present quantitative analytical and numerical results on both the revival probability and time, and demonstrate that the system indeed returns arbitrarily close to its initial state in a time exponential in the number of qubits $N$. The revival times become astronomically large for systems with just a few tens of qubits. Given the lifetimes achievable in present-day superconducting multi-qubit systems, we propose a realistic experimental test of the theory and scaling of Poincar\'e revivals.</description>

      <title>Overcoming Quantum Resistivity Scaling in Nanoscale Interconnects Using Delafossite PdCoO2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continued scaling into the sub 7 nm regime exacerbates quantum limited resistivity in Cu interconnects. We evaluated layered PdCoO2 and explicitly benchmarked it against Cu to identify mechanisms that maintain conductivity under confinement. Using a momentum resolved relaxation time formalism derived from the conductivity tensor, we link k and energy resolved velocities, life times, and mean free paths (MFPs) to thickness dependent resistivity for films and wires. PdCoO2 exhibits quasi 2D transport with high inplane velocities and strongly anisotropic MFPs (15 nm inplane, 3 nm outofplane near EF), whereas Cu shows an isotropic 22 nm MFP. Under identical boundary conditions including a realistic 2 nm liner/diffusion barrier for Cu, PdCoO2 displays suppressed boundary scattering and a much slower resistivity increase from bulk down to sub 30 nm, preserving near bulk conductivity and remaining viable at 2 nm. Thickness trends reveal dual slope changes in PdCoO2 (35 nm and 7 nm) set by anisotropic MFPs, contrasting with the single characteristic scale of Cu (40 nm). The calculated bulk values and scaling curves track available measurements for both materials. These results establish PdCoO2 as a scalable interconnect that outperforms Cu under quantum confinement and provide a quantitative framework to screen layered conductors for next generation nanoelectronic interconnects.</description>

      <title>Observation of relativistic domain wall motion in amorphous ferrimagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Domain walls in magnetic materials are sine-Gordon solitons characterized by relativistic kinematics, with the maximum spin-wave group velocity setting a limit for the domain wall speed and hence the highest operation frequency of magnetic devices. This relativistic regime has been observed only in crystalline iron-garnet ferrimagnets but is in general expected in many magnetic materials. In particular, amorphous rare-earth -- transition metal ferrimagnets should exhibit relativistic effects because of their ultrafast magnetic dynamics. However, no evidence for these effects has been reported in these technologically relevant materials. Here, we show that the relativistic regime can be attained in easy-to-engineer amorphous ferrimagnetic alloys. In GdFeCo we observe a saturation of the current-induced domain wall velocity that is indicative of a maximum spin-wave speed of the order of 2 km/s. Our observations indicate that relativistic dynamics are not exclusive to ferrimagnetic garnets but also exist in rare-earth -- transition-metal ferrimagnets, which provide a robust material platform for future magnetic devices operating at the ultimate speed limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.02384v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop an analytical model for calculation of optical spectra for metal nanostructures of arbitrary shape supporting localized surface plasmons (LSPs). For plasmonic systems with characteristic size below the diffraction limit, we obtain an explicit expression for optical polarizability that describes the lineshape of optical spectra solely in terms of the metal dielectric function and LSP frequency. The amplitude of the LSP spectral band is determined by the effective system volume that, for long-wavelength LSPs, can significantly exceed the physical volume of metal nanostructure. Within the quasistatic approach, we derive the exact LSP Green's function and establish general spectral properties of LSPs, including the distribution and oscillator strength of the LSP states. These results can be used to model or interpret the experimental spectra of plasmonic nanostructures and to tune their optical properties for various applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07943v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our microscopic understanding of the integer quantum Hall effect is still incomplete. For decades, there has been a controversial discussion about "where the current flows" if the Hall resistance is quantized. Here, we qualitatively analyze the current density distribution in a Hall bar based on the screening properties of a two-dimensional electron system in the quantum Hall regime. Beyond previous publications, we include a closed loop persistent current that exists inside a Hall bar if the Hall resistance is quantized. We find, that the persistent current density decreases with increasing Hall voltage. Accounting for this dependence, we find, that the current flows in the opposite directions along opposite edges of the Hall bar, while the imposed current flows unidirectionally and only on the side of the Hall bar connected with its higher electrical potential edge.</description>

Abstract: We present mumax+, an extensible GPU-accelerated micromagnetic simulator with a Python user interface, to address the challenges posed by current magnetism research into systems with complex magnetic ordering and interfaces. It is a general solver for the space- and time-dependent evolution of the magnetization and related vector quantities, using finite difference discretization. Here, we present its application and design and discuss features not available in \mumaxthree{}, such as the modeling of antiferromagnets with magnetoelastic coupling. As an illustration of its capabilities, we use \mumaxp{} to simulate state of the art magnetic systems. Specifically, we demonstrate the current induced domain wall motion in a polycrystalline antiferromagnet, we simulate the working principle of a strain-driven antiferromagnetic racetrack memory and we reproduce experimentally observed domain structures in a non-collinear antiferromagnet.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian Hopf insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15154v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hopf insulators represent a unique class of topological insulators that exist exclusively in two-band systems and are inherently unstable upon the inclusion of additional bands. Meanwhile, recent studies have shown that non-Hermiticity gives rise to distinctive complex-energy gap structures, known as point gaps, and associated topological phases with no analogs in Hermitian systems. However, non-Hermitian counterparts of Hopf insulators have remained largely elusive. Here, we generally classify topological phases of two-band non-Hermitian systems based on the homotopy theory and uncover Hopf-type point-gap topology present only for two bands. Specifically, we reveal such Hopf-type point-gap topology for three-dimensional systems with chiral symmetry (class AIII) and four-dimensional systems with no symmetry (class A). Explicitly constructing prototypical models from the Hermitian Hopf insulator, we further demonstrate that these non-Hermitian topological phases lead to anomalous point-gapless boundary states spectrally detachable from the bulk bands.</description>

      <title>Theory of spin Seebeck effect activated by acoustic chiral phonons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23083v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically explore the generation of spin current driven by a temperature gradient in a junction between a chiral insulator and a normal metal. Based on the gyromagnetic response induced by microscopic acoustic-phonon-mediated lattice rotation, we derive a formula for the spin current when a finite temperature difference is imposed between two ends of the sample. We clarify how the phonon-mediated spin current depends on the sample geometry, the thermal conductivity, the heat conductance at the interface, and the average temperature. Our formulation provides a microscopic foundation for the chiral-phonon-activated spin Seebeck effect without relying on magnetism or spin-orbit interactions.</description>

      <title>Observation of terahertz spin-Hall magnetoresistance in the model system $Y_3Fe_5O_{12}|Pt$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02498v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the observation of spin Hall magnetoresistance (SMR) in prototypical bilayers of ferrimagnetic yttrium iron garnet (YIG) and platinum in the frequency range from 0 THz to as high as 1.5 THz. The effect exhibits a strong low-pass behavior: It decreases by approximately 75% from 0 THz to 0.2 THz and vanishes at 1.5 THz. Based on a dynamic model of SMR, we can consistently explain the measured frequency dependence by a competition of the transverse coherent and longitudinal incoherent spin-torque contributions to the spin current. Our analysis suggests that the nonzero response time of the magnon chemical potential is responsible for the increased out-flow of incoherent magnons through the YIG|Pt interface at high frequencies and, consequently, for the dramatic spectral decay of the SMR. These results establish THz SMR as a powerful probe of ultrafast interfacial spinmagnon coupling.</description>

      <title>Universal relations between thermoelectrics and noise in mesoscopic transport across a tunnel junction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05413v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a unified theory of weakly probed differential observables for currents and noise in transport experiments. Our findings uncover a set of universal transport relations between thermoelectric and noise properties of a system probed through a tunnel contact, with the Wiedemann-Franz law being just one example of such universality between charge and heat currents. We apply this theory to various quantum dot systems, including multichannel Kondo, quantum Hall and Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev quantum dots, and demonstrate that each of the microscopic theories is characterized by a set of universal relations connecting conductance and thermoelectrics with noise. Violations of these relations indicate additional energy scales emerging in a system.</description>

      <title>Observing Differential Spin Currents by Resonant Inelastic X-ray Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05796v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Controlling spin currents, i.e., the flow of spin angular momentum, in small magnetic devices is the principal objective of spin electronics, a main contender for future energy efficient information technologies. Surprisingly, a pure spin current has never been measured directly since the associated electric stray fields and/or shifts in the non-equilibrium spin-dependent distribution functions are too small for conventional experimental detection methods optimized for charge transport. Here we report that resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) can bridge this gap by measuring the spin current carried by magnons -- the quanta of the spin wave excitations of the magnetic order -- in the presence of temperature gradients across a magnetic insulator. This is possible due to the sensitivity of the momentum- and energy-resolved RIXS intensity to minute changes in the magnon distribution under non-equilibrium conditions. We use the Boltzmann equation in the relaxation time approximation to extract transport parameters, such as the magnon lifetime at finite momentum, essential for the realization of magnon spintronics.</description>

      <title>Edgetronics in 2D Altermagnet via Real-Space-Spin Coupling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10451v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The coupling between real-space coordinates and spin (r-s) provides an alternative route to achieve efficient spin manipulation in spintronics beyond the conventional momentum-spin (k-s) coupling paradigm. Here we demonstrate an unexpected manifestation of one-dimensional (1D) r-s coupling in two-dimensional (2D) altermagnetic second-order topological insulators, where the spin-split floating edge states - energetically isolated within the bulk band gap - emerge and exhibit both Neel-vector-dependent and electrically tunable behaviors. The 1D edge-spin r-s coupling ensures carrier transport to be exclusively carried by the edge states with quantized spin conductance, giving rise to an unconventional edge tunnel magnetoresistance (edge-TMR) effect that can be switched On or Off. As a proof of concept, we computationally design an edge-TMR device based on Cr2Se2O monolayer to demonstrate its edge transportation and controllability via the Neel order or electric field. Our findings propose a general prototype altermagnetic device for next-generation low-dimensional spintronics.</description>

      <title>Bulk photovoltaic effects in the Haldane model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12414v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) refers to the direct current generation in a noncentrosymmetric material under illumination and can be applied to solar energy technology. BPVE includes injection and shift currents, led by the change of velocity and displacement of wave packet during optical transitions, respectively. We derive the constraints on the conductivity tensors imposed by mirror-time ($\mathcal{MT}$) symmetry for two-dimensional systems. For the Haldane model, we show that linearly polarized light can induce shift and injection currents, which vanish under circularly polarized light as constrained by the three-fold rotation and $\mathcal{MT}$ symmetry. Additionally, due to the presence of $\mathcal{MT}$ symmetry, a separation of responses is observed in the Haldane model: one direction exhibits a time-reversal symmetry-allowed response, whereas another manifests a parity-time symmetry-allowed response. Across the topological phase transition, the injection current does not change sign, whereas shift current shows a sign flip. The vector field of the Hermitian connection in the Brillouin zone possesses vortices in the topological phase, but not in the trivial phase. Furthermore, we calculate the related quantum geometry, including Berry curvature, quantum metric and Hermitian connection, and demonstrate the microscopic quantum origin of the BPVE.</description>

      <title>A Robust Large-Period Discrete Time Crystal and its Signature in a Digital Quantum Computer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.11560v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Discrete time crystals (DTCs) are novel out-of-equilibrium quantum states of matter which break time translational symmetry. DTCs have been extensively realized in experiments, particularly their subclass that is characterized by period-doubling dynamics due to its natural occurrence in a system of periodically driven two-level, e.g., spin-1/2, particles. The realization of DTCs beyond period-doubling, including their generalizations termed discrete quasicrystals has also been made in recent years, though such experiments typically involve higher spin particles. Constructing and observing DTCs beyond period-doubling in systems of two-level particles are generally still considered an open challenge due to the latter's $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry that natively only leads to period-doubling. In this work, we developed an intuitive interacting system of two-level particles (qubits) that supports the more non-trivial period-quadrupling DTCs ($4T$-DTCs). Remarkably, by utilizing a variational algorithm, we are able to observe clear signatures of such $4T$-DTCs in a quantum processor despite the presence of considerable noise and the small number of available qubits. Our findings extend the landscape of time crystalline behavior by demonstrating a distinct realization of time crystallinity beyond standard period-doubling dynamics with qubits (two-level particles) on a NISQ-era digital quantum computer, as well as the potential of existing noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices for simulating exotic non-equilibrium quantum states of matter.</description>

      <title>Tunable superconducting diode effect in a topological nano-SQUID</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16569v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A Josephson diode passes current with zero resistance in one direction but is resistive in the other direction. While such an effect has been observed in several platforms, a large and tunable Josephson diode effect has been rare. Here we report that a simple device consisting of a topological-insulator (TI) nanowire side-contacted by superconductors to form a lateral Josephson junction presents a large diode effect with the efficiency $\eta$ reaching 0.3 when a parallel magnetic field $B_{||}$ is applied. Interestingly, the sign and the magnitude of $\eta$ is tunable not only by $B_{||}$ but also by the back-gate voltage. This diode effect can be understood by modeling the system as a nano-SQUID, in which the top and bottom surfaces of the TI nanowire each form a line junction and $B_{||}$ creates a magnetic flux to thread the SQUID loop. This model further shows that the observed diode effect marks the emergence of topological superconductivity in TI-nanowire-based Josephson junction.</description>

Abstract: ABACUS (Atomic-orbital Based Ab-initio Computation at USTC) is an open-source software for first-principles electronic structure calculations and molecular dynamics simulations. It mainly features density functional theory (DFT) and is compatible with both plane-wave basis sets and numerical atomic orbital basis sets. ABACUS serves as a platform that facilitates the integration of various electronic structure methods, such as Kohn-Sham DFT, stochastic DFT, orbital-free DFT, and real-time time-dependent DFT, etc. In addition, with the aid of high-performance computing, ABACUS is designed to perform efficiently and provide massive amounts of first-principles data for generating general-purpose machine learning potentials, such as DPA models. Furthermore, ABACUS serves as an electronic structure platform that interfaces with several AI-assisted algorithms and packages, such as DeePKS-kit, DeePMD, DP-GEN, DeepH, DeePTB, etc.</description>

      <title>Deterministic Mechanical Wigner Negativity via Nonlinear Cavity Quantum Optomechanics in the Unresolved-Sideband Regime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01942v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-Gaussian quantum states of mechanical motion exhibiting Wigner negativity offer promising capabilities for quantum technologies and tests of fundamental physics. Within the field of cavity quantum optomechanics, deterministic preparation of nonclassical mechanical states with such Wigner negativity is a highly sought goal but is challenging as the intracavity interaction Hamiltonian is linear in mechanical position. Here, we show that, despite this form of interaction, by utilizing the nonlinearity of the cavity response with mechanical position, mechanical Wigner negativity can be prepared deterministically in the unresolved-sideband regime, without additional nonlinearities, nonclassical drives, or conditional measurements. In particular, we find that Wigner negativity can be prepared with an optical pulse, even without single-photon strong coupling, and the negativity persists in the steady state of a continuously driven system. Our results deepen our understanding of cavity-enhanced radiation pressure and establish a pathway for deterministic preparation of nonclassical mechanical states in the unresolved sideband regime.</description>

Abstract: We present a first principles investigation of strain-driven vacancy clustering in aluminum. Specifically, we perform Kohn-Sham density functional theory calculations to study the influence of hydrostatic strains on clustering in tri-, quad-, and heptavacancies. We find that compressive strains are a key driving force for vacancy aggregation, particularly for collapse of clusters on the (111) plane, consistent with prior experimental observations of vacancy clusters on this plane. Notably, we find that the heptavacancy on the (111) plane collapses to form a prismatic dislocation loop for hydrostatic compressive strains exceeding 5\%, highlighting the critical role of such strains in prismatic dislocation loop nucleation in aluminum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19580v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gauge theories compose a large class of interacting conformal field theories in 3d, among which an outstanding category is critical Chern-Simons-matter theories. In this paper, we focus on one of the simplest instances: one complex critical scalar coupled to $\mathrm{U}(1)_2$ Chern-Simons gauge field. It is theoretically interesting as it is conjectured to exhibit dualities between four simple Lagrangian descriptions, but also practically important as it describes the transition between Kalmeyer-Laughlin chiral spin liquid (or $\nu=1/2$ bosonic Laughlin state) and trivially gapped phase. Using the fuzzy sphere regularisation, we realise this theory as a transition on the spherical lowest Landau level between a $\nu_f=2$ fermionic integer quantum Hall state and a $\nu_b=1/2$ bosonic fractional quantum Hall state. We show that this transition is continuous and has emergent conformal symmetry. By studying the operator spectrum, we show that there exists only one relevant singlet with scaling dimension $\Delta_S=1.52(18)$. We also discuss other higher operators and the consequences of our results.</description>

      <title>Observation of Purcell Effect in Electrically Coupled Cavity-Magnet System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02946v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the observation of the Purcell effect in a cavity-metallic magnet hybrid system using electric-field-mediated coupling. In this configuration, microwave-induced axial currents in the microwire induce circular magnetic fields that drive the ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) of the magnetized microwire. Field-dependent transmission and reflection spectroscopies reveal a clear cavity perturbation consistent with the Purcell regime, in which the magnetic loss rate exceeds the light-matter coupling strength. Despite the small magnetic volume ($\sim 10^{-13}\,\text{m}^3$), measurements performed at both room temperature and $T = 7$ mK show coupling rates as high as $g/2pi = 56$ MHz, one order of magnitude stronger than the one expected from conventional coupling at the magnetic antinode. Time-domain ringdown measurements directly show the magnetic-field-dependent modification of the cavity photon lifetime, in agreement with theoretical predictions. These results establish a versatile approach for coupling microwave fields to metallic magnets via geometric and electric-field-mediated interactions, opening new opportunities for hybrid cavity-magnet systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07870v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many important quantities in quantum information science, such as entropy and entanglement, are non-linear functions of the density matrix and cannot be expressed as operator observables. Standard open-system approaches evolve only a single copy of the density matrix, making it impossible to track the dynamics of such quantities. A formalism proposed by some of the present authors addressed this challenge by evolving multiple virtual replicas, but was limited to the weak-coupling regime. Here, we extend this approach to strong coupling between a quantum system and classical environments. The resulting multi-replica master equation enables direct evaluation of entropy flow and related metrics in strongly hybridized quantum-classical systems. Our results show that quantum coherence and hybridization jointly suppress net entropy transfer, creating a thermodynamic bottleneck. This framework provides a general tool for studying entropy dynamics and guiding the design of more robust, resource-efficient quantum hardware.</description>
