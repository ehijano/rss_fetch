      <title>Counterfactual Explanations for MITL Violations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MITL is a temporal logic that facilitates the verification of real-time systems by expressing the critical timing constraints placed on these systems. MITL specifications can be checked against system models expressed as networks of timed automata. A violation of an MITL specification is then witnessed by a timed trace of the network, i.e., an execution consisting of both discrete actions and real-valued delays between these actions. Finding and fixing the root cause of such a violation requires significant manual effort since both discrete actions and real-time delays have to be considered. In this paper, we present an automatic explanation method that eases this process by computing the root causes for the violation of an MITL specification on the execution of a network of timed automata. This method is based on newly developed definitions of counterfactual causality tailored to networks of timed automata in the style of Halpern and Pearl's actual causality. We present and evaluate a prototype implementation that demonstrates the efficacy of our method on several benchmarks from the literature.</description>

      <title>A Syntactic Approach to Computing Complete and Sound Abstraction in the Situation Calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Abstraction is an important and useful concept in the field of artificial intelligence. To the best of our knowledge, there is no syntactic method to compute a sound and complete abstraction from a given low-level basic action theory and a refinement mapping. This paper aims to address this issue.To this end, we first present a variant of situation calculus,namely linear integer situation calculus, which serves as the formalization of high-level basic action theory. We then migrate Banihashemi, De Giacomo, and Lesp\'erance's abstraction framework to one from linear integer situation calculus to extended situation calculus. Furthermore, we identify a class of Golog programs, namely guarded actions,that is used to restrict low-level Golog programs, and impose some restrictions on refinement mappings. Finally, we design a syntactic approach to computing a sound and complete abstraction from a low-level basic action theory and a restricted refinement mapping.</description>

      <title>Dung's Argumentation Framework: Unveiling the Expressive Power with Inconsistent Databases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The connection between inconsistent databases and Dung's abstract argumentation framework has recently drawn growing interest. Specifically, an inconsistent database, involving certain types of integrity constraints such as functional and inclusion dependencies, can be viewed as an argumentation framework in Dung's setting. Nevertheless, no prior work has explored the exact expressive power of Dung's theory of argumentation when compared to inconsistent databases and integrity constraints. In this paper, we close this gap by arguing that an argumentation framework can also be viewed as an inconsistent database. We first establish a connection between subset-repairs for databases and extensions for AFs, considering conflict-free, naive, admissible, and preferred semantics. Further, we define a new family of attribute-based repairs based on the principle of maximal content preservation. The effectiveness of these repairs is then highlighted by connecting them to stable, semi-stable, and stage semantics. Our main contributions include translating an argumentation framework into a database together with integrity constraints. Moreover, this translation can be achieved in polynomial time, which is essential in transferring complexity results between the two formalisms.</description>

      <title>Formal Quality Measures for Predictors in Markov Decision Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In adaptive systems, predictors are used to anticipate changes in the systems state or behavior that may require system adaption, e.g., changing its configuration or adjusting resource allocation. Therefore, the quality of predictors is crucial for the overall reliability and performance of the system under control. This paper studies predictors in systems exhibiting probabilistic and non-deterministic behavior modelled as Markov decision processes (MDPs). Main contributions are the introduction of quantitative notions that measure the effectiveness of predictors in terms of their average capability to predict the occurrence of failures or other undesired system behaviors. The average is taken over all memoryless policies. We study two classes of such notions. One class is inspired by concepts that have been introduced in statistical analysis to explain the impact of features on the decisions of binary classifiers (such as precision, recall, f-score). Second, we study a measure that borrows ideas from recent work on probability-raising causality in MDPs and determines the quality of a predictor by the fraction of memoryless policies under which (the set of states in) the predictor is a probability-raising cause for the considered failure scenario.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Real-Time Framework for Efficient Fussell-Vesely Importance Evaluation Using Virtual Fault Trees and Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Fussell-Vesely Importance (FV) reflects the potential impact of a basic event on system failure, and is crucial for ensuring system reliability. However, traditional methods for calculating FV importance are complex and time-consuming, requiring the construction of fault trees and the calculation of minimal cut set. To address these limitations, this study proposes a hybrid real-time framework to evaluate the FV importance of basic events. Our framework combines expert knowledge with a data-driven model. First, we use Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM) to build a virtual fault tree that captures the relationships between basic events. Unlike traditional fault trees, which include intermediate events, our virtual fault tree consists solely of basic events, reducing its complexity and space requirements. Additionally, our virtual fault tree considers the dependencies between basic events rather than assuming their independence, as is typically done in traditional fault trees. We then feed both the event relationships and relevant data into a graph neural network (GNN). This approach enables a rapid, data-driven calculation of FV importance, significantly reducing processing time and quickly identifying critical events, thus providing robust decision support for risk control. Results demonstrate that our model performs well in terms of MSE, RMSE, MAE, and R2, reducing computational energy consumption and offering real-time, risk-informed decision support for complex systems.</description>

      <title>The structure of rough sets defined by reflexive relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For several types of information relations, the induced rough sets system RS does not form a lattice but only a partially ordered set. However, by studying its Dedekind-MacNeille completion DM(RS), one may reveal new important properties of rough set structures. Building upon D. Umadevi's work on describing joins and meets in DM(RS), we previously investigated pseudo-Kleene algebras defined on DM(RS) for reflexive relations. This paper delves deeper into the order-theoretic properties of DM(RS) in the context of reflexive relations. We describe the completely join-irreducible elements of DM(RS) and characterize when DM(RS) is a spatial completely distributive lattice. We show that even in the case of a non-transitive reflexive relation, DM(RS) can form a Nelson algebra, a property generally associated with quasiorders. We introduce a novel concept, the core of a relational neighborhood, and use it to provide a necessary and sufficient condition for DM(RS) to determine a Nelson algebra.</description>

      <title>Security Engineering in IIIf, Part II -- Refinement and Noninterference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we add a second part to the process of Security Engineering to the Isabelle Insider and Infrastructure framework (IIIf) [31,16] by addressing an old difficult task of refining Information Flow Security (IFC). We address the classical notion of Noninterference representing absolute security in the sense of absence of information flows to lower levels. This notion is known to be not preserved by specification refinements in general, a phenomenon known as "refinement paradox" [33]. We use a solution for this problem that has been given by Morgan [33] for the refinement calculus for sequential program specifications and generalize it to general specifications of Infrastructures with actors, decentralization and policies in the IIIf. As a running example to illustrate the problem, the concepts and the solution, we use an example of a Flightradar system specification [20].</description>

      <title>Recursive Aggregates as Intensional Functions in Answer Set Programming: Semantics and Strong Equivalence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper shows that the semantics of programs with aggregates implemented by the solvers clingo and dlv can be characterized as extended First-Order formulas with intensional functions in the logic of Here-and-There. Furthermore, this characterization can be used to study the strong equivalence of programs with aggregates under either semantics. We also present a transformation that reduces the task of checking strong equivalence to reasoning in classical First-Order logic, which serves as a foundation for automating this procedure.</description>

      <title>The Relational Quotient Completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Taking a quotient roughly means changing the notion of equality on a given object, set or type. In a quantitative setting, equality naturally generalises to a distance, measuring how much elements are similar instead of just stating their equivalence. Hence, quotients can be understood quantitatively as a change of distance.
  In this paper, we show how, combining Lawvere's doctrines and the calculus of relations, one can unify quantitative and usual quotients in a common picture. More in detail, we introduce relational doctrines as a functorial description of (the core of) the calculus of relations. Then, we define quotients and a universal construction adding them to any relational doctrine, generalising the quotient completion of existential elementary doctrine and also recovering many quantitative examples. This construction deals with an intensional notion of quotient and breaks extensional equality of morphisms. Then, we describe another construction forcing extensionality, showing how it abstracts several notions of separation in metric and topological structures. Combining these two constructions, we get the extensional quotient completion, whose essential image is characterized through the notion of projective cover. As an application, we show that, under suitable conditions, relational doctrines of algebras arise as the extensional quotient completion of free algebras. Finally, we compare relational doctrines to other categorical structures where one can model the calculus of relations.</description>

      <title>Rewriting Consistent Answers on Annotated Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We embark on a study of the consistent answers of queries over databases annotated with values from a naturally ordered positive semiring. In this setting, the consistent answers of a query are defined as the minimum of the semiring values that the query takes over all repairs of an inconsistent database. The main focus is on self-join free conjunctive queries and key constraints, which is the most extensively studied case of consistent query answering over standard databases. We introduce a variant of first-order logic with a limited form of negation, define suitable semiring semantics, and then establish the main result of the paper: the consistent query answers of a self-join free conjunctive query under key constraints are rewritable in this logic if and only if the attack graph of the query contains no cycles. This result generalizes an analogous result of Koutris and Wijsen for ordinary databases, but also yields new results for a multitude of semirings, including the bag semiring, the tropical semiring, and the fuzzy semiring. We also show that there are self-join free conjunctive queries with a cyclic attack graph whose certain answers under bag semantics have no polynomial-time constant-approximation algorithm, unless P = NP.</description>

      <title>A Theory of Formalisms for Representing Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There has been a longstanding dispute over which formalism is the best for representing knowledge in AI. The well-known "declarative vs. procedural controversy" is concerned with the choice of utilizing declarations or procedures as the primary mode of knowledge representation. The ongoing debate between symbolic AI and connectionist AI also revolves around the question of whether knowledge should be represented implicitly (e.g., as parametric knowledge in deep learning and large language models) or explicitly (e.g., as logical theories in traditional knowledge representation and reasoning). To address these issues, we propose a general framework to capture various knowledge representation formalisms in which we are interested. Within the framework, we find a family of universal knowledge representation formalisms, and prove that all universal formalisms are recursively isomorphic. Moreover, we show that all pairwise intertranslatable formalisms that admit the padding property are also recursively isomorphic. These imply that, up to an offline compilation, all universal (or natural and equally expressive) representation formalisms are in fact the same, which thus provides a partial answer to the aforementioned dispute.</description>

      <title>A Variable Occurrence-Centric Framework for Inconsistency Handling (Extended Version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a syntactic framework for analyzing and handling inconsistencies in propositional bases. Our approach focuses on examining the relationships between variable occurrences within conflicts. We propose two dual concepts: Minimal Inconsistency Relation (MIR) and Maximal Consistency Relation (MCR). Each MIR is a minimal equivalence relation on variable occurrences that results in inconsistency, while each MCR is a maximal equivalence relation designed to prevent inconsistency. Notably, MIRs capture conflicts overlooked by minimal inconsistent subsets. Using MCRs, we develop a series of non-explosive inference relations. The main strategy involves restoring consistency by modifying the propositional base according to each MCR, followed by employing the classical inference relation to derive conclusions. Additionally, we propose an unusual semantics that assigns truth values to variable occurrences instead of the variables themselves. The associated inference relations are established through Boolean interpretations compatible with the occurrence-based models.</description>

      <title>Revelations: A Decidable Class of POMDPs with Omega-Regular Objectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) form a prominent model for uncertainty in sequential decision making. We are interested in constructing algorithms with theoretical guarantees to determine whether the agent has a strategy ensuring a given specification with probability 1. This well-studied problem is known to be undecidable already for very simple omega-regular objectives, because of the difficulty of reasoning on uncertain events. We introduce a revelation mechanism which restricts information loss by requiring that almost surely the agent has eventually full information of the current state. Our main technical results are to construct exact algorithms for two classes of POMDPs called weakly and strongly revealing. Importantly, the decidable cases reduce to the analysis of a finite belief-support Markov decision process. This yields a conceptually simple and exact algorithm for a large class of POMDPs.</description>

      <title>An extended type system with lambda-typed lambda-expressions (extended version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.06488</link>
      <description>arXiv:1803.06488v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the type system $\mathtt{d}$, an extended type system with lambda-typed lambda-expressions. It is related to type systems originating from the Automath project. $\mathtt{d}$ extends existing lambda-typed systems by an existential abstraction operator as well as propositional operators. $\beta$-reduction is extended to also normalize negated expressions using a subset of the laws of classical negation, hence $\mathtt{d}$ is normalizing both proofs and formulas which are handled uniformly as functional expressions. $\mathtt{d}$ is using a reflexive typing axiom for a constant $\tau$ to which no function can be typed. Some properties are shown including confluence, subject reduction, uniqueness of types, strong normalization, and consistency. We illustrate how, when using $\mathtt{d}$, due to its limited logical strength additional axioms must be added both for negation and for the mathematical structures whose deductions are to be formalized. Several appendices deal with extensions and variations of the proposed system.</description>

      <title>A Fully Abstract Model of PCF Based on Extended Addressing Machines</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.13756v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extended addressing machines (EAMs) have been introduced to represent higher-order sequential computations. Previously, we have shown that they are capable of simulating -- via an easy encoding -- the operational semantics of PCF, extended with explicit substitutions. In this paper we prove that the simulation is actually an equivalence: a PCF program terminates in a numeral exactly when the corresponding EAM terminates in the same numeral. It follows that the model of PCF obtained by quotienting typable EAMs by a suitable logical relation is adequate. From a definability result stating that every EAM in the model can be transformed into a PCF program with the same observational behavior, we conclude that the model is fully abstract for PCF.</description>

Abstract: Causal reasoning is one of the primary bottlenecks that Large Language Models (LLMs) must overcome to attain human-level intelligence. Recent studies indicate that LLMs display near-random performance on reasoning tasks. To address this, we introduce the Causal Chain of Prompting ($\text{C}^2\text{P}$), a reasoning framework that aims to equip current LLMs with causal reasoning capabilities as the first framework of its kind operating autonomously without relying on external tools or modules during both the causal learning and reasoning phases. To evaluate the performance of $\text{C}^2\text{P}$, we first demonstrate that reasoning accuracy improved by over $30.7\%$ and $25.9\%$ for GPT-4 Turbo and LLaMA 3.1, respectively, when using our framework, compared to the same models without $\text{C}^2\text{P}$ on a synthetic benchmark dataset. Then, using few-shot learning of the same LLMs with $\text{C}^2\text{P}$, the reasoning accuracy increased by more than $20.05\%$ and $20.89\%$, respectively, with as few as ten examples, compared to the corresponding LLMs without $\text{C}^2\text{P}$ on the same dataset. To evaluate $\text{C}^2\text{P}$ in realistic scenarios, we utilized another benchmark dataset containing natural stories across various fields, including healthcare, medicine, economics, education, social sciences, environmental science, and marketing. The results show improved reasoning when $\text{C}^2\text{P}$ is applied, compared to cases where our framework is not used, which often leads to random and hallucinated responses. By showing the improved performance of few-shot learned GPT-4 Turbo and LLaMA 3.1 with $\text{C}^2\text{P}$, we demonstrate the generalizability of our framework.</description>
