      <title>Information Criteria Fail for Dynamical Systems: Sampling Rate and Dimension Dependence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Information criteria such as Akaike's (AIC) and Bayes' (BIC) are widely used for model selection in physics and beyond, quantifying the tradeoff between model complexity and goodness-of-fit to enforce parsimony. However, their derivation assumes uncorrelated samples, an assumption systematically violated by dynamical systems data. Here, through analysis of simple but representative dynamical models -- exponential decay, harmonic oscillation, and chaos -- we demonstrate that model selection depends sensitively on sampling rate and system dimensionality. We derive explicit formulas predicting when standard information criteria fail that should be adaptable to many real-world scenarios, enabling experimentalists to design sampling protocols that avoid pathological regimes.</description>

      <title>Projectivity in topological dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study projectivity in the category of $G$-flows and affine $G$-flows for Polish groups $G$. We also introduce the notion of \emph{proximally irreducible} extensions between affine $G$-flows. Using this we provide a characterization of extreme amenability, strong amenability, and amenability for closed subgroups $H \leq G$ in terms of certain ``dynamical irreducibility'' properties of the Samuel compactification of $G/H$. We then apply this to answer an open question of Zucker by proving a structure theorem for when the universal minimal proximal flow of $G$ is metrizable or contains a comeager orbit.</description>

      <title>Surface homeomorphisms with big rotation set</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article consists in applications of [arXiv:2511.14232] in the case of homemomorphisms of higher genus surfaces whose homological rotation set is big enough -- a class of dynamics that is open. We first prove a structure theorem for the rotation set of such homeomorphisms: it is a finite union of convex sets, we get an optimal bound for the number of such pieces. This bound can be improved in the case of transitive (in this case the rotation set is convex) and non-wandering dynamics (and for such homeomorphisms we get the existence of a family of invariant essential open sets). We also get boundedness of deviations for homeomorphisms with big rotation set and some consequences of it, including a answer to Boyland's conjecture in our framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a minimal subshift \((X^{*},\sigma)\) that serves as an open proximal extension of its maximal equicontinuous factor. We establish that every point in this subshift is multiply recurrent minimal. This work solves an open problem raised by Huang, Shao and Ye regarding the existence of minimal PI-systems such that each point is multiply minimal.</description>

      <title>Judicial Sentencing Prediction Based on Hybrid Models and Two-Stage Learning Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The investigation of legal judgment prediction (LJP), such as sentencing prediction, has attracted broad attention for its potential to promote judicial fairness, making the accuracy and reliability of its computation result an increasingly critical concern. In view of this, we present a new sentencing model that shares both legal logic interpretability and strong prediction capability by introducing a two-stage learning algorithm. Specifically, we first construct a hybrid model that synthesizes a mechanism model based on the main factors for sentencing with a neural network modeling possible uncertain features. We then propose a two-stage learning algorithm: First, an adaptive stochastic gradient (ASG) algorithm is used to get good estimates for the unknown parameters in the mechanistic component of the hybrid model. Then, the Adam optimizer tunes all parameters to enhance the predictive performance of the entire hybrid model. The asymptotic convergence of the ASG-based adaptive predictor is established without requiring any excitation data conditions, thereby providing a good initial parameter estimate for prediction. Based on this, the fast-converging Adam optimizer further refines the parameters to enhance overall prediction accuracy. Experiments on a real-world dataset of intentional injury cases in China show that our new hybrid model combined with our two-stage ASG-Adam algorithm, outperforms the existing related methods in sentencing prediction performance, including those based on neural networks and saturated mechanism models.</description>

      <title>Chemical systems with chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three-dimensional polynomial dynamical systems (DSs) can display chaos with various properties already in the quadratic case with only one or two quadratic monomials. In particular, one-wing chaos is reported in quadratic DSs with only one quadratic monomial, while two-wing and hidden chaos in quadratic DSs with only two quadratic monomials. However, none of the reported DSs can be realized with chemical reactions. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we investigate chaos in chemical dynamical systems (CDSs) - a subset of polynomial DSs that can model the dynamics of mass-action chemical reaction networks. To this end, we develop a fundamental theory for mapping polynomial DSs into CDSs of the same dimension and with a reduced number of non-linear terms. Applying this theory, we show that, under suitable robustness assumptions, quadratic CDSs, and cubic CDSs with only one cubic, can display a rich set of chaotic solutions already in three dimensions. Furthermore, we construct some relatively simple three-dimensional examples, including a quadratic CDS with one-wing chaos and three quadratics, a cubic CDS with two-wing chaos and one cubic, and a quadratic CDS with hidden chaos and five quadratics.</description>

Abstract: For a smooth expanding circle map, we show that the empirical distribution of Lyapunov exponents of periodic points of any fixed period is close to normal, with an error that decreases as the period grows.

      <title>Polynomially effective equidistribution for certain unipotent subgroups in quotients of semisimple Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove an effective equidistribution theorem for orbits of certain unipotent subgroups in arithmetic quotients of semisimple Lie groups with a polynomial error term. This provides the first infinite family of examples where effective equidistribution, with polynomial error rate, of non-horospherical unipotent subgroups in semisimple quotients is obtained.
  As applications, we obtain effective estimate on distribution of lattice orbits on homogeneous spaces, as well as an effective version of the Oppenheim conjecture for indefinite quadratic forms with a polynomial error rate in all dimension $d \geq 3$. We also prove a sub-modularity inequality for irreducible representation of connected algebraic group, which is crucial to our proof and is of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Hausdorff Measure and Dimension with Examples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This document offers a concise introduction to the mathematical theory and practical application of the Hausdorff Measure and Dimension. The primary objective is to clarify and rigorously detail the two most common methods used for calculating the dimension of a set, ensuring all calculation details are transparent for the reader.
  The paper first establishes the theoretical groundwork by reviewing the definitions of the Hausdorff measure, proving the dimensional invariance under changes to the shape of the covering sets, and confirming the dimensional property of open sets. It then introduces the two main methodologies.
  The first is the Lower and Upper Bound Estimation, which uses the relationship between the measure $H^s(A)$ and the dimension $\dim_{H}(A)$. This method emphasizes the use of the Mass Distribution Principle for establishing the lower bound, which is essential when the Lebesgue measure of the set is zero. The second, more computationally efficient method is the Similarity Dimension Method, introduced via the definitions of Similitudes, Iterated Function Systems (IFS), and the Moran-Hutchinson Theorem.
  Both methodologies are applied rigorously to classic examples: the Unit Square (yielding dimension $2$) and the Cantor Set (yielding the fractional dimension $\log 2 / \log 3$). The paper serves as a detailed, step-by-step guide intended to make the application of these fundamental fractal geometry concepts clearer and easier to understand.</description>

      <title>Embeddings of mapping tori for end-periodic graph maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: End-periodic homotopy equivalences of infinite, locally finite graphs serve as dimension-one analogs of the end-periodic automorphisms traditionally defined on infinite-type surfaces. We demonstrate that if $\Gamma$ is an infinite graph with finitely many ends, and $g \colon \Gamma \to \Gamma$ is end-periodic, then its mapping torus $Z_g$ admits a flowline-preserving homotopy equivalence with a finite 2-complex. With additional hypotheses on $g$, this compactified mapping torus subsequently embeds in the mapping torus of a homotopy equivalence on a finite-rank graph via a $\pi_1$-injective, flow-preserving map. We prove that every mapping class of $\Gamma$ arising from an end-periodic homotopy equivalence contains a representative whose mapping torus realizes such an embedding.</description>

      <title>On Entropic Characterization of Symmetry Breaking in Dynamical Systems I: Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop an entropy based framework for analyzing symmetry breaking in dynamical systems. Information transfer, which measures the directional exchange of entropy between observables, provides a quantitative early indicator of symmetry loss. For local spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB), we show that as a symmetric equilibrium approaches instability, trajectories exhibit pronounced critical slowing down accompanied by a rise in Shannon entropy. This establishes a direct link between symmetry loss, slowing down, and entropy growth. We further characterize the entropy discontinuity associated with global symmetry breaking (GSSB) through an ergodic decomposition viewpoint. Numerical examples illustrate that entropy and information transfer measures serve as reliable precursors and diagnostics of symmetry breaking transitions.</description>

      <title>Nonholonomic Robot Parking by Feedback -- Part I: Modular Strict CLF Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been known in the robotics literature since about 1995 that, in polar coordinates, the nonholonomic unicycle is asymptotically stabilizable by smooth feedback, even globally. We introduce a modular design framework that selects the forward velocity to decouple the radial coordinate, allowing the steering subsystem to be stabilized independently. Within this structure, we develop families of feedback laws using passivity, backstepping, and integrator forwarding. Each law is accompanied by a strict control Lyapunov function, including barrier variants that enforce angular constraints. These strict CLFs provide constructive class KL convergence estimates and enable eigenvalue assignment at the target equilibrium. The framework generalizes and extends prior modular and nonmodular approaches, while preparing the ground for inverse optimal and adaptive redesigns in the sequel paper.</description>

      <title>RLS Framework with Segmentation of the Forgetting Profile and Low Rank Updates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This report describes a new regularization approach based on segmentation of the forgetting profile in sliding window least squares estimation. Each segment is designed to enforce specific desirable properties of the estimator such as rapidity, desired condition number of the information matrix, accuracy, numerical stability, etc. The forgetting profile is divided in three segments, where the speed of estimation is ensured by the first segment, which employs rapid exponential forgetting of recent data.The second segment features a decline in the profile and marks the transition to the third segment, characterized by slow exponential forgetting to reduce the condition number of the information matrix using more distant data. Condition number reduction mitigates error propagation, thereby enhancing accuracy and stability. This approach facilitates the incorporation of a priori information regarding signal characteristics (i.e., the expected behavior of the signal) into the estimator. Recursive and computationally efficient algorithm with low rank updates based on new matrix inversion lemma for moving window associated with this regularization approach is developed. New algorithms significantly improve the approximation accuracy of low resolution daily temperature measurements obtained at the Stockholm Old Astronomical Observatory, thereby enhancing the reliability of temperature predictions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish sharp algebraic criteria for the $L^{p}$-integrability, for $p = 1, 2, \infty$, of a natural generalization of the Siegel transform to the setting of rational representations of semisimple algebraic $\mathbb{Q}$-groups, extending Siegel's analytic work in the geometry of numbers.
  As an application, we derive an effective asymptotic formula for the number of rational approximations of bounded height to almost every real point on a rank-one flag variety at the Diophantine exponent. The argument combines the integrability criterion with effective equidistribution estimates for translated orbits of maximal compact subgroups, a result of independent interest.</description>

Abstract: Excitable neuromorphic circuits are physical models of event behaviors: their continuous-time trajectories consist of sequences of discrete events. This paper explores the possibility of extracting a discrete-event model out of the physical continuous-time model.

      <title>Inner Functions, Composition Operators, Symbolic Dynamics and Thermodynamic Formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.16063v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we use thermodynamic formalism to study the dynamics of inner functions $F$ acting on the unit disk. If the Denjoy-Wolff point of $F$ is in the open unit disk, then without loss of generality, we can assume that $F(0) = 0$ so that 0 is an attracting fixed point of $F$ and the Lebesgue measure on the unit circle is invariant under $F$. Utilizing the connection between composition operators, Aleksandrov-Clark measures and Perron-Frobenius operators, we develop a rudimentary thermodynamic formalism which allows us to prove the Central Limit Theorem and the Law of Iterated Logarithm for Sobolev multipliers and H\"older continuous observables.
  Under the more restrictive, but natural hypothesis that $F$ is a one component inner function, we develop a more complete thermodynamic formalism which is sufficient for orbit counting, assuming only the $(1+\varepsilon)$ integrability of $\log|F'|$. As one component inner functions admit countable Markov partitions of the unit circle, we may work in the abstract symbolic setting of countable alphabet subshifts of finite type. Due to the very weak hypotheses on the potential, we need to pay close attention to the regularity of the complex Perron-Frobenius operators $\mathcal L_s$ with $\text{Re }s &gt; 1$ near the boundary.
  Finally, we discuss inner functions with a Denjoy-Wolff point on the unit circle. We assume a parabolic type behavior of $F$ around this point and we introduce the class of parabolic one component inner functions. By making use of the first return map, we deduce various stochastic laws and orbit counting results from the aforementioned abstract symbolic results.</description>

      <title>Rauzy fractals of random substitutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06732v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a theory of Rauzy fractals for random substitutions, which are a generalisation of deterministic substitutions where the substituted image of a letter is determined by a Markov process. We show that a Rauzy fractal can be associated with a given random substitution in a canonical manner, under natural assumptions on the random substitution. Further, we show the existence of a natural measure supported on the Rauzy fractal, which we call the Rauzy measure, that captures geometric and dynamical information. We provide several different constructions for the Rauzy fractal and Rauzy measure, which we show coincide, and ascertain various analytic, dynamical and geometric properties. While the Rauzy fractal is independent of the choice of (non-degenerate) probabilities assigned to a given random substitution, the Rauzy measure captures the explicit choice of probabilities. Moreover, Rauzy measures vary continuously with the choice of probabilities, thus provide a natural means of interpolating between Rauzy fractals of deterministic substitutions. Additionally, we highlight connections between Rauzy fractals and Rauzy measures of random substitutions and related S-adic systems.</description>

      <title>Assouad spectrum of Gatzouras-Lalley carpets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07168v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the fine local scaling properties of a class of self-affine fractal sets called Gatzouras-Lalley carpets. More precisely, we establish a formula for the Assouad spectrum of all Gatzouras-Lalley carpets as the concave conjugate of an explicit piecewise-analytic function combined with a simple parameter change. Our formula implies a number of novel properties for the Assouad spectrum not previously observed for dynamically invariant sets; in particular, the Assouad spectrum can be a non-trivial differentiable function on the entire domain $(0,1)$ and can be strictly concave on open intervals. Our proof introduces a general framework for covering arguments using techniques developed in the context of multifractal analysis, including the method of types from large deviations theory and Lagrange duality from optimisation theory.</description>

      <title>Open dynamical systems with a moving hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02336v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given an integer $b\ge 3$, let $T_b: [0,1)\to [0,1); x\mapsto bx\pmod 1$ be the expanding map on the unit circle. For any $m\in\mathbb{N}$ and $\omega=\omega^0\omega^1\ldots\in(\left\{0,1,\ldots,b-1\right\}^m)^\mathbb{N_0}$ let \[ K^\omega=\left\{x\in[0,1): T_b^n(x)\notin I_{\omega^n}~\forall n\geq 0\right\},\] where $I_{\omega^n}$ is the $b$-adic basic interval generated by $\omega^n$. Then $K^\omega$ is called the survivor set of the open dynamical system $([0,1),T_b,I_\omega)$ with respect to the sequence of holes $I_\omega=\left\{I_{\omega^n}: n\geq 0\right\}$. We show that the Hausdorff and lower box dimensions of $K^\omega$ always conincide, and the packing and upper box dimensions of $K^\omega$ also coincide. Moreover, we give sharp lower and upper bounds for the dimensions of $K^\omega$, which can be calculated explicitly. For any admissible $\alpha\leq \beta$ there exist infinitely many $\omega$ such that $\dim_H K^\omega=\alpha$ and $\dim_P K^\omega=\beta$. As applications we study badly approximable numbers in Diophantine approximation. For an arbitrary sequence of balls $\left\{B_n\right\}$, let $K\left(\left\{B_n\right\}\right)$ be the set of $x\in[0,1)$ such that $T_b^n(x)\notin B_n$ for all but finitely many $n\geq 0$. Assuming $\lim_{n\to\infty}\operatorname{diam} \left(B_n\right)$ exists, we show that $\dim_H K\left(\left\{B_n\right\}\right)=1$ if and only if $\lim_{n\to\infty}\operatorname{diam} \left(B_n\right)=0$. For any positive function $\phi$ on $\mathbb{N}$, let $E\left(\phi\right)$ be the set of $x\in[0,1)$ satisfying $|T_b^n (x)-x|\geq \phi(n)$ for all but finitely many $n$. If $\lim_{n\to\infty}\phi(n)$ exists, then $\dim_H E(\phi)=1$ if and only if $\lim_{n\to\infty}\phi(n)=0$. Our results can be applied to study joint spectral radius of matrices. We show that the finiteness property for the joint spectral radius of associated adjacency matrices holds true.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06233v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of \emph{mostly nonuniform sectional
  expanding} (MNUSE) for singular flows which encompasses the
  notions of sectional hyperbolicity, asymptotically sectional and
  multisingular hyperbolicity. We exhibit an example of a $C^1$
  nonuniformly sectional hyperbolic set satisfying MNUSE, which is
  neither sectional hyperbolic nor asymptotically sectional
  hyperbolic.
  Moreover, under some smoothness assumptions together with, either
  the dimension or the sign of Lyapunov exponents along the central
  subbundle, we show that attracting MNUSE sets support a physical/SRB
  measure. This measure is unique if the dynamics is transitive.</description>

      <title>Ergodic averages for sparse corners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27627v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a framework for the study of the limiting behavior of multiple ergodic averages with commuting transformations when all iterates are given by the same sparse sequence; this enables us to partially resolve several longstanding problems. First, we address a special case of the joint intersectivity question of Bergelson, Leibman, and Lesigne by giving necessary and sufficient conditions under which the multidimensional polynomial Szemer\'edi theorem holds for length-three patterns. Second, we show that for two commuting transformations, the Furstenberg averages remain unchanged when the iterates are taken along sparse sequences such as $[n^c]$ for a positive noninteger $c$, advancing a conjecture of the first author. Third, we extend a result of Chu on popular common differences in linear corners to polynomial and Hardy corners. Lastly, we answer open problems of Le, Moreira, and Richter concerning decomposition results for double correlation sequences. Our toolbox includes recent degree lowering and seminorm smoothing techniques, the machinery of magic extensions of Host, and novel structured extensions motivated by works of Tao and Leng. Combined, these techniques reduce the analysis to settings where the Host-Kra theory of characteristic factors and equidistribution on nilmanifolds yield a family of striking identities from which our main results follow.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.10042v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gluing is a cut and paste construction where the dynamics of a map in a given domain is replaced by a different one, under the condition that the two agree along the gluing curve. Here we consider two polynomials with a finite super-attracting fixed point of the same degree. We prove that any two such non-renormalizable polynomials can be glued into a rational map along the Jordan boundary of the immediate basin of the super-attracting fixed point.</description>

      <title>Spectral characterization of shadowing for linear operators on Hilbert spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12272v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study one of the fundamental notions in dynamical systems, the shadowing of invertible (bounded and linear) operators on a Hilbert space. Although the problem of finding a spectral characterization for shadowing has been in the focus of the research for a long time, spectral criteria are available only for rather special classes of invertible operators. In this paper, we give a complete spectral characterization for the shadowing of an arbitrary invertible operator $T$ on a complex Hilbert space. It is shown that $T$ has the shadowing property if and only if its right spectrum is disjoint from the unit circle in the complex plane. As a consequence, the shadowing property for $T$ is equivalent to the uniform expansivity of its adjoint operator.</description>

      <title>Designing topological cluster synchronization patterns with the Dirac operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20837v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Designing stable cluster synchronization patterns is a fundamental challenge in nonlinear dynamics of networks with great relevance to understanding neuronal and brain dynamics. So far, cluster synchronization has been studied exclusively in a node-based dynamical approach, according to which oscillators are associated only with the nodes of the network. Here, we propose a topological synchronization dynamics model based on the use of the Topological Dirac operator, which allows us to design cluster synchronization patterns for topological oscillators associated with both nodes and edges of a network. In particular, by modulating the ground state of the free energy associated with the dynamical model, we construct topological cluster synchronization patterns. These are aligned with the eigenstates of the Topological Dirac Equation that provide a very useful decomposition of the dynamical state of node and edge signals associated with the network. We use linear stability analysis to predict the stability of the topological cluster synchronization patterns and provide numerical evidence of the ability to design several stable topological cluster synchronization states on real connectome data, random graphs, and on stochastic block models.</description>

      <title>Threshold dynamics in time-delay systems: polynomial $\beta$-control in a pressing process and connections to blow-up</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07268v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses a press control problem in straightening machines with small time delays due to system communication. To handle this, we propose a generalized $\beta$-control method, which replaces conventional linear velocity control with a polynomial of degree $\beta \ge 1$. The resulting model is a delay differential equation (DDE), for which we derive basic properties through nondimensionalization and analysis. Numerical experiments suggest the existence of a threshold initial velocity separating overshoot and non-overshoot dynamics, which we formulate as a conjecture. Based on this, we design a control algorithm under velocity constraints and confirm its effectiveness. We also highlight a connection between threshold behavior and finite-time blow-up in DDEs. This study provides a practical control strategy and contributes new insights into threshold dynamics and blow-up phenomena in delay systems.</description>

      <title>Synchronisation in two-dimensional damped-driven Navier-Stokes turbulence: insights from data assimilation and Lyapunov analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16920v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In Navier--Stokes (NS) turbulence, large-scale turbulent flows inevitably determine small-scale flows. Previous studies using data assimilation with the three-dimensional NS equations indicate that employing observational data resolved down to a specific length scale, $\ell^{3D}_{\ast}$, enables the successful reconstruction of small-scale flows. Such a length scale of `essential resolution of observation' for reconstruction $\ell^{3D}_{\ast}$ is close to the dissipation scale in three-dimensional NS turbulence. % Here we study the equivalent length scale in {\it two}-dimensional NS turbulence, $\ell^{2D}_{\ast}$, and compare with the three-dimensional case. Our numerical studies using data assimilation and conditional Lyapunov exponents reveal that, for Kolmogorov flows with Ekman drag, the length scale $\ell^{2D}_{\ast}$ is actually close to the forcing scale, substantially larger than the dissipation scale. Furthermore, we discuss the origin of the significant relative difference between the length scales, $\ell^{2D}_{\ast}$ and $\ell^{3D}_{\ast}$, based on inter-scale interactions, `cascades' and orbital instabilities in turbulence dynamics.</description>
