      <title>Constraints on Bose-Einstein condensate stars as neutron stars models from new observational data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We evaluate the feasibility of Bose-Einstein condensate stars (BECS) as models for the interior of neutron stars. BECS are compact objects composed of bosons, formed through the spin-parallel pairing of neutrons. Here, we utilize the astronomical data from GW170817, XMMU J173203.3-344518 (the lightest neutron star known), and a novel lower limit on neutron star core heat capacity to scrutinize the compatibility of BECS with these recent observations of neutron stars. Our specific focus is to constrain the values of the scattering length $a$, a parameter determining the strength of particle interactions in the model. Our analysis suggests that if the stars involved in GW170817 were BECSs, the scattering length of their constituent bosons should fall within the $4$ to $10$ fm range. Additionally, at a scattering length of $a\sim 3.1-4$ fm, stars with mass and radius characteristics akin to XMMU J173203.3-344518 are identified. Moreover, we find that the heat capacity depends of the mass and temperature of BECS, and surpasses the established lower bound for neutron star cores when $a&gt;2-5$ fm. In summary, our results endorse BECS models with $a\sim 4$ fm, providing neutron star observables in robust agreement with diverse observations and contributing to the ongoing understanding of neutron star interiors.</description>

      <title>A prototype station of the IceCube-Gen2 Surface Array at the Pierre Auger Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of extensive air showers using radio antennas has evolved into a mature technique, complementing particle detector arrays by providing sensitivity to the longitudinal development of the showers and enabling an independent determination of the cosmic-ray energy. Both the Pierre Auger Observatory in Argentina and the IceCube Neutrino Observatory at the South Pole have been undergoing upgrades, including the integration of radio antennas. The next-generation neutrino detector IceCube-Gen2 will also feature a surface array for PeV-EeV cosmic-ray detection, consisting of scintillation detectors and radio antennas. Prototype stations for this upgrade have been in operation for several years at both, the South Pole and the Auger Observatory, enabling cross-checks and potentially a cross-calibration of the energy scales between the two experiments. In this contribution, we present an analysis of air showers observed with the radio antennas of the IceCube-Gen2 prototype station, coinciding with detections by the water-Cherenkov detectors of the densest part of the Pierre Auger Observatory's surface array, featuring a 433 m spacing.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the spread of nuclear masses in ultra-high-energy cosmic rays based on the Phase I hybrid data from the Pierre Auger Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analysis of the correlation between the depth of the maximum of air-shower profiles and the signal in water-Cherenkov stations in events registered simultaneously by the fluorescence and surface detectors of the Pierre Auger Observatory. The analysis enables us to place constraints on the spread of nuclear masses in ultra-high-energy cosmic rays with a minor impact from the experimental systematic uncertainties and uncertainties in air-shower simulations. Due to this unique feature, the correlation analysis has previously allowed us to exclude all pure and proton-helium compositions near the ankle in the cosmic-ray energy spectrum at 5$\sigma$ confidence level. The same property makes the correlation analysis an effective tool for testing the consistency of predictions of the post-LHC hadronic interaction models, including their latest versions such as EPOS LHC-R, QGSJet-III-01, Sibyll${}^\bigstar$ and Sibyll 2.3e. In this work, the correlation analysis using the Phase I hybrid data from the Pierre Auger Observatory is presented. The analysis uses the newest generation of hadronic interaction models and covers an extended energy range around the ankle in the cosmic-ray spectrum.</description>

      <title>Continued Rapid Radio Brightening of the Tidal Disruption Event AT2018hyz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present ongoing radio observations of the tidal disruption event (TDE) AT2018hyz, which was first detected in the radio at 972 days after disruption, following multiple non-detections from earlier searches. The new observations presented here span approximately 1370-2160 days and 0.88-240 GHz. We find that the light curves continue to rise at all frequencies during this time period, following a power law of about F ~ t^3 (compared to F_nu ~ t^5.7 at 972-1400 days), and reaching a peak luminosity of L~ 10^40 erg/s, comparable to the luminosity of the relativistic TDE Swift 1644+57 on the same timescale. The multi-frequency data indicate that the peak frequency does not significantly evolve over the 1030-day span of our observations, while the peak flux density increases by an order of magnitude. The observed behavior is consistent with two possible scenarios: (i) a delayed spherical outflow launched about 620 days post-disruption with a velocity of ~0.3c and an energy of ~10^50 erg, and (ii) a highly off-axis (~80-90 deg) relativistic jet with a Lorentz factor of Gamma ~8 and E_K ~ 10^52 erg. Continued radio observations to capture the light curve peak, as well as VLBI observations, could distinguish between these scenarios.</description>

      <title>The GROND GRB sample: II. Fireball parameters for four GRB afterglows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Afterglows of GRBs are, in general, well described by the fireball model. Yet, deducing the full set of model parameters from observations without prior assumptions has been possible for only a handful of GRBs. With GROND, a 7-channel simultaneous optical and near-infrared imager at the 2.2m telescope of the Max-Planck Society at ESO/La Silla, a dedicated gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglow observing program was performed between 2007 and 2016.
  Here, we combine GROND observations of four particularly well-sampled GRBs with public Swift/XRT data and partly own sub-mm and radio data to determine the basic fireball afterglow parameters.
  We find that all four bursts exploded into a wind environment. We are able to infer the evolution of the magnetic field strength from our data, and find evidence for its origin through shock amplification of the magnetic field of the circumburst medium.</description>

      <title>Hiding Out at the Low End: No Gap and a Peak in the Black-Hole Mass Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the existence of a gap in the mass spectrum of compact objects formed from stellar collapse, between the heaviest neutron stars and the lightest black holes, has been a matter of significant debate. The presence or absence of a mass gap has implications for the supernova mechanism, as well as being a fundamental property of the compact object mass function. In X-ray binaries containing black holes a gap is observed, but it is not known whether this is representative of a true gap in the mass function or due to selection effects or systematic biases in mass estimation. Binary black hole mergers detected from gravitational waves in the GWTC-3 transient catalog furnish a large sample of several tens of low-mass black holes with a well-understood selection function. Here we analyze the \nevts{} GWTC-3 merger events (along with GW230529\_181500) with at least one black hole ($3 \, M_\odot &lt; m_1$) and chirp masses below those of a $20\,M_\odot$--$20\,M_\odot$ merger ($\mathcal{M} &lt; 17.41 M_{\odot}$) to uncover the structure of the low-mass black hole mass function. Using flexible parameterized models for the mass function, we find, similar to existing studies, a sharp peak in the mass function at $m \simeq (8-10 M_{\odot})$. We observe a steady decline in the merger rate to lower masses, but by less than an order of magnitude in total, and find that the first percentile of black hole masses in our most flexible model is $m_{1\%} =3.13^{+0.18}_{-0.04}$. In other words, this sample of low-mass black holes is not consistent with the existence of a mass gap.</description>

      <title>XRISM Spectroscopy of Accretion-Driven Wind Feedback in NGC 4151</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hottest, most ionized, and fastest winds driven by accretion onto massive black holes have the potential to reshape their host galaxies. Calorimeter-resolution X-ray spectroscopy is the ideal tool to understand this feedback mode, as it enables accurate estimates of physical characteristics needed to determine the wind's kinetic power. We report on a photoionization analysis of five observations of the Seyfert-1.5 galaxy NGC 4151, obtained with XRISM/Resolve in 2023 and 2024. In the Fe K band, individual spectra require as many as six wind absorption components. Slow "warm absorbers" (WAs, $v_{\mathrm{out}} \sim 100 - 1000~\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}$), very fast outflows (VFOs, $v_{\mathrm{out}} \sim 10^3~{\rm km}~{\rm s}^{-1} - 10^4~{\rm km}~{\rm s}^{-1}$), and ultra-fast outflows (UFOs, $v_{\mathrm{out}} \sim 10^4~{\rm km}~{\rm s}^{-1} - 10^5~{\rm km}~{\rm s}^{-1}$ or $0.033 - 0.33~c$) are detected simultaneously, and indicate a stratified, multiphase wind. Fast and variable emission components suggest that the wind is axially asymmetric. All of the wind components have mass flow rates comparable to or in excess of the mass accretion rate, though the slowest zones may be "failed" winds that do not escape. Two UFO components have kinetic luminosities that exceed the theoretical threshold of $L_{kin} \geq 0.5\% L_{Edd}$ necessary to strip the host bulge of gas and halt star formation, even after corrections for plausible filling factors. The bulk properties of the observed winds are consistent with magnetocentrifugal driving, where the density depends on radius as $n \propto r^{-1.5}$, but radiative driving and other mechanisms may also be important. Numerous complexities and variability require further analysis.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Dainotti Relation in Gamma-Ray Bursts through Multipolar Electromagnetic Radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Dainotti relation empirically connects the isotropic plateau luminosity ($L_X$) in gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) X-ray afterglows to the rest-frame time at which the plateau ends ($T_a^*$), enabling both the standardization of GRBs and their use as cosmological probes. However, the precise physical mechanisms underlying this correlation remain an active area of research. Although magnetars, highly magnetized neutron stars, have been proposed as central engines powering GRB afterglows, traditional dipole spin-down radiation models fail to account for the full diversity of observed behaviors. This limitation necessitates a more comprehensive framework. We propose that multipolar magnetic field emissions from magnetars offer a plausible explanation for the Dainotti relation. Unlike simple dipole fields, higher-order multipolar configurations enable more complex energy dissipation processes. The coexistence of multiple components can plausibly explain the range of afterglow decay indices found from a sample of 238 GRBs with plateau features from the Swift-XRT database up to the end of December 2024, the majority of which deviate from the dipolar prediction of $\alpha = -2$, and more crucially, the spin-down physics yields a link between $L_X$ and $T_a^*$ in a way that preserves the Dainotti correlation with a slope of $b = - 1$, independent of the specific multipole order. Moreover, we find that the inclusion of higher order multipoles can explain the range of plateau energies found in the Dainotti relations. Thus, a unified picture emerges in which multipolar fields are able to reproduce both the slope and the normalization of the correlation.</description>

      <title>A Necessary Condition for the Submergence of Proto-Neutron Star Magnetic Fields by Supernova Fallback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Central compact objects (CCOs) are a subclass of neutron stars with a dipole magnetic field strength considerably weaker than those of radio pulsars and magnetars. One possible explanation for such weak magnetic fields in the CCOs is the hidden magnetic field scenario, in which supernova fallback submerges the magnetosphere of a proto-neutron star beneath a newly formed crust. However, the fallback mass and timescale required for this submergence process remain uncertain. We perform one-dimensional general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the supernova fallback onto a magnetized proto-neutron star, while considering neutrino cooling. In our simulations, the infalling material compresses the magnetic field and drives a strong shock. The shock initially expands outward, but eventually stalls and recedes as neutrino cooling becomes significant. After the shock stalls, the gas density above the magnetosphere increases rapidly, potentially leading to the formation of a new crust. To understand the shock dynamics, we develop semi-analytic models that describe the resulting magnetospheric and shock radii when the shock stalls. By comparing the fallback time scale with the shock stalling time scale, corresponding to the waiting time for the new crust formation, we derive a necessary condition for the submergence of the PNS magnetic field. Our results will provide guidance for investigating the diversity of young isolated neutron stars through multidimensional simulations.</description>

      <title>Application of interpretable data-driven methods for the reconstruction of supernova neutrino energy spectra following fast neutrino flavor conversions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutrinos can experience fast flavor conversions (FFCs) in highly dense astrophysical environments, such as core-collapse supernovae and neutron star mergers, potentially affecting energy transport and other processes. The simulation of fast flavor conversions under realistic astrophysical conditions requires substantial computational resources and involves significant analytical challenges. While machine learning methods like Multilayer Perceptrons have been used to accurately predict the asymptotic outcomes of FFCs, their 'black-box' nature limits the extraction of direct physical insight. To address this limitation, we employ two distinct interpretable machine learning frameworks-Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) and Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy)-to derive physically insightful models from a FFC simulation dataset. Our analysis reveals a fundamental trade-off between predictive accuracy and model simplicity. The KANs demonstrates high fidelity in reconstructing post-conversion neutrino energy spectra, achieving accuracies of up to $90\%$. In contrast, SINDy uncovers a remarkably concise, low-rank set of governing equations, offering maximum interpretability but with lower predictive accuracy. Critically, by analyzing the interpretable model, we identify the number density of heavy-lepton neutrinos as the most dominant factor in the system's evolution. Ultimately, this work provides a methodological framework for interpretable machine learning that supports genuine data-driven physical discovery in astronomy and astrophysics, going beyond prediction alone.</description>

      <title>Updated Earth Tomography Using Atmospheric Neutrinos at IceCube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The IceCube Neutrino Observatory has observed a sample of high purity, primarily atmospheric, muon neutrino events over 11 years from all directions below the horizon, spanning the energy range 500 GeV to 100 TeV. While this sample was initially used for an eV-scale sterile neutrino search, its purity and spanned parameter space can also be used to perform an earth tomography. This flux of neutrinos traverses the earth and is attenuated in varying amounts depending on the energy and traversed column density of the event. By parameterizing the earth as multiple constant--density shells, IceCube can measure the upgoing neutrino flux as a function of the declination, yielding an inference of the density of each shell. In this talk, the latest sensitivities of this analysis and comparisons with the previous measurement are presented. In addition, the analysis procedure, details about the data sample, and systematic effects are also explained. This analysis is one of the latest, weak-force driven, non-gravitational, measurements of the earth's density and mass.</description>

      <title>The Heavy Element Enrichment History of the Universe from Neutron Star Mergers with Habitable Worlds Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding where elements were formed has been a key goal in astrophysics for nearly a century, with answers involving cosmology, stellar burning, and cosmic explosions. Since 1957, the origin of the heaviest elements (formed via the rapid neutron capture process; r-process) has remained a mystery, identified as a key question to answer this century by the US National Research Council. With the advent of gravitational wave astronomy and recent measurements by the James Webb Space Telescope we now know that neutron star mergers are a key site of heavy element nucleosynthesis. We must now understand the heavy element yield of these events as well as mapping when these mergers occurred back through cosmic time, currently thought to peak when the universe was half its current age. This requires an extremely sensitive ultraviolet, optical, and infrared telescope which can respond rapidly to external discoveries of neutron star mergers. We here describe how the Habitable Worlds Observatory can provide the first complete answer to one of the questions of the century.</description>

Abstract: The combined data of Fluorescence and Surface Detectors of the Pierre Auger Observatory has recently provided the strongest constraints on the validity of predictions from current models of hadronic interactions. The unmodified predictions of these models on the depth of shower maximum ($X_\text{max}$) and the hadronic part of the ground signal are unable to accurately describe the measured data at a level of more than 5$\sigma$ in the energy range 3-10 EeV. This inconsistency has been shown to originate not only from the predicted amount of muons at the ground level, but also from the predicted scale of $X_\text{max}$, which must be adjusted to better match the observed data. The resulting deeper $X_\text{max}$ scales of the models imply a heavier mass composition to be interpreted from the $X_\text{max}$ measurements. We show the results of the test with an updated data set of the Pierre Auger Observatory, studying also the energy evolution of the fitted modification parameters and new versions of the models of hadronic interactions. Additionally, we discuss the phenomenological consequences of the deeper $X_\text{max}$ scale of models on the interpretation of the features of the energy spectrum and the muon problem in air-shower modelling.</description>

      <title>The Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System (VERITAS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The VERITAS observatory, located in southern Arizona, is engaged in an exploration of the gamma-ray sky at energies above 85 GeV. Observations of Galactic and extragalactic sources in the TeV band provide clues to the highly energetic processes occurring in these objects, and could provide indirect evidence for the origin of cosmic rays and the sites of particle acceleration in the Universe. In this chapter, we describe the VERITAS telescopes and their operation, as well as analysis procedures, and present results from scientific observations, which include extragalactic science, Galactic physics, and studies of fundamental physics and cosmology.</description>

      <title>Supernova-induced binary-interaction-powered supernovae: a model for SN2022jli</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present 3D hydrodynamical modelling of supernova-induced binary-interaction-powered supernovae; a scenario proposed for the peculiar type Ic supernova SN2022jli. In this scenario, supernova ejecta of a stripped-envelope star impacts a close-by stellar companion, temporarily inflating the envelope. The expanded envelope engulfs the neutron star, causing strong mass accretion at super-Eddington rates. Feedback from the accretion powers the supernova light curve with periodic undulations. Our simulations capture key features of SN2022jli, both the overall decline and the superimposed undulations of the light curve. Based on our parameter study, we find that (i) the accretion feedback should be sufficiently geometrically confined and the eccentricity of the post-supernova binary orbit should be $0.7\lesssim e\lesssim0.9$ to sustain a high accretion rate, and (ii) the viewing angle should be close to edge-on to match the low undulation amplitude ($\Delta L/L\sim0.1$) of SN2022jli. Different combinations of parameters could account for other supernovae like SN2022mop, SN2009ip and SN2015ap. We also discuss possible explanations for other key features of SN2022jli such as the $\gamma$-ray detection at $\sim200~\mathrm{d}$ and the rapid optical drop at $\sim250~\mathrm{d}$. Finally, we speculate on the future evolution of the system and its relation to existing neutron star binaries.</description>

      <title>Phase Transition and Nuclear Symmetry Energy from Neutron Star Observations -- In Light of PSR J0614--3329</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The possible occurrence of a first-order hadron-quark phase transition (FOPT) in neutron-star interiors remains an open question. Whether such a transition can be directly tested with improved observations is a key challenge. Here, we incorporate the latest constraints, especially a new NICER radius measurement for PSR J0614--3329, into a nonparametric Gaussian Process (GP) EOS framework that explicitly includes a first-order transition. We find a Bayes factor of $B\approx2.3$ when comparing models with and without an explicit phase transition, marginally favoring its presence. At $68\%$ credibility, the transition onset density $n_{\rm PT}$ is either below $2\,n_s$ (corresponding to masses $\lesssim1\,M_\odot$, with density jump $\Delta n\sim0.5\,n_s$) or, more prominently, above $4\,n_s$ (near the central density of the heaviest NS, with $\Delta n\sim3\,n_s$), where $n_s$ represents the nuclear saturation density. In addition, by using symmetry-energy expansion at low densities ($&lt;1.1\,n_s$), we infer a slope parameter $L=40.2^{+19.3}_{-14.3}$ MeV, in good agreement with nuclear-experiment values. Intriguingly, $L$ correlates positively with the radius difference between $1.4\,M_\odot$ and $2.0\,M_\odot$ stars.</description>

      <title>Anisotropy of core-collapse supernovae effected by AGN disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active galactic nucleus (AGN) disk provide dense environments to influence on the star formation, evolution, and migration. In AGN disks, pressure gradients and migration accelerations could create the anisotropy of the core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) when the massive stars explode at the end of their lives. In this study, we construct the equilibrium equations by considering the above two factors and then compute the light curves for three types of progenitor stars at different locations of AGN disks for the different supermassive black hole (SMBH) masses, accretion efficiencies, explosion energies, and masses of ejecta. The results show that the migration acceleration has more significant effects on the anisotropic explosions than the pressure gradients of the AGN disks. The anisotropic luminosities are pronounced at large radii, and massive SMBHs would suppress the anisotropy and reduce the total luminosity.</description>

      <title>SRG/ART-XC All-Sky X-ray Survey: Sensitivity Assessment Based on Aperture Photometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Spectrum-Roentgen-Gamma (SRG) observatory continues to operate successfully in orbit at the Lagrange point L2. The Mikhail Pavlinsky ART-XC telescope has demonstrated high efficiency in conducting X-ray surveys both over large sky regions and the entire celestial sphere. A recently published source catalog, based on data from the first four and partially completed fifth sky scans, contains 1,545 objects detected in the 4-12 keV energy range. In this work, using the same sky survey data, we assess the sensitivity to point source detection across the celestial sphere based on X-ray aperture photometry - that is, we calculate the upper flux limit in the 4-12 keV band at any given significance level. The method is implemented using both Poisson statistics and Bayesian inference, with consistent results between the two approaches. This information is important for studying variable and transient X-ray sources, as well as sources that are not detected with sufficient statistical significance in the ART-XC all-sky survey. The ART-XC upper limit service is available at https://www.srg.cosmos.ru/uplim.</description>

      <title>Quasi-periodic variation during a fast X-ray outburst of a high-mass X-ray binary MAXI 0709-159 / LY CMa observed by NICER</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on a quasi-periodic variation at $\sim1$ Hz during a fast X-ray outburst of a high-mass X-ray binary MAXI J0709$-$159 / LY CMa observed by the Neutron-star interior composition explorer (NICER). The new X-ray transient MAXI J0709$-$159 was discovered on 2022 January 25. Due to the transient X-ray behavior characterized by the short (a few hours) outburst duration, rapid ($\lesssim$ 1 s) variability with spectral change, and large luminosity swing from $10^{32}$ erg s$^{-1}$ to $10^{37}$ erg s$^{-1}$, the object was considered likely to be a supergiant X-ray binary with a neutron star (NS) categorized as a Supergiant Fast X-ray Transient (SFXT). Follow-up NICER and NuSTAR observations confirmed that the position of the new X-ray object is consistent with a Be star, LY CMa, which has been also identified as a B supergiant. We analyzed the NICER data obtained from 3 hours to 6 days after the discovery. The light curve reveals that the X-ray activity continued for $\sim7$ hours in sparse short flares, each lasting $\lesssim 100$ seconds, and the luminosity instantaneously reached up to $\sim 1\times 10^{38}$ erg s$^{-1}$. The light-curve and spectral features reasonably agree with those expected from accretion of a clumpy stellar-wind onto a magnetized NS. The variability power spectrum during the brightest flare shows a broad peak at $1.1$ Hz resembling a quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO). If the QPO is attributed to the Keplerian orbital frequency at the inner edge of a transient accretion disk truncated by the NS magnetosphere, the NS surface magnetic field is estimated to be $\sim 10^{12}$ G.</description>

      <title>A double dipole geometry for PSR~J0740+6620</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Millisecond pulsars are known to show complex radio pulse profiles and polarisation position angle evolution with rotational phase. Small scale surface magnetic fields and multipolar components are believed to be responsible for this complexity due to the radiation mechanisms occurring close to the stellar surface but within the relatively small light-cylinder compared to the stellar radius. In this work, we use the latest NICER phase aligned thermal X-ray pulse profile of PSR~J0740+6620 combined with radio and $\gamma$-ray pulse profiles and radio polarisation to deduce the best magnetic field configuration that can simultaneously reproduce the light-curves in these respective bands. We assume a polar cap model for the radio emission and use the rotating vector model for the associated polarisation, a striped wind model for the $\gamma$-ray light-curves and rely on the NICER collaboration results for the hot spot geometry. We demonstrate that an almost centred dipole can account for the hot spot location with a magnetic obliquity of $\alpha \approx 51 \deg$ and a line of sight inclination angle of $\zeta \approx 82 \deg$. However, with this geometry, the hot spot areas are three times too large. We found a better solution consisting of two dipoles located just below the surface in approximately antipodal positions. Our double dipole model is able to reproduce all the salient radio and $\gamma$-ray characteristics of PSR~J0740+6620 including radio polarisation data. A double dipole solution is more flexible than an off-centred dipole because of two independent magnetic axes and could hint at a magnetic field mostly concentrated within the crust and not in the core.</description>

      <title>Search for Ultra-High-Energy Neutrinos at the Pierre Auger Observatory: New Triggers, Methods, and Constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Pierre Auger Observatory has the capability to identify neutrino-induced extensive air showers above $10^{17}$ eV by using its large Surface Detector (SD) array. Data from the Observatory have been used to set some of the most stringent upper limits to the neutrino flux in the ultra-high energy (UHE) range. The data have also been used for follow-up detection of transient events in the context of multi-messenger astrophysics. In mid-2013, two additional SD triggers (Time-over-Threshold-deconvolved (ToTd) and Multiplicity-of-Positive Steps (MoPS)) were shown to increase the detection capability for the neutrino-induced air showers in the energy regime below $10^{19}$ eV by a factor of 5-10. This contribution will give an overview of the ongoing work regarding the searches for UHE neutrinos at the Pierre Auger Observatory. The impact of the ToTd and MoPS triggers for neutrino search in the zenith angle range of $60^{\circ} &lt; \theta &lt; 75^{\circ}$ is discussed. A novel neutrino identification method, which integrates these triggers, is applied to observational data to look for neutrino-like events using a $\textit{blind}$ search strategy. New constraints to point-like sources of UHE neutrinos will be presented for the angular range explored.</description>

      <title>Unlocking Gravity and Gravitational Waves with Radio Pulsars: Advances and Challenges</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pulsars, the cosmic lighthouses, are strongly self-gravitating objects with core densities significantly exceeding nuclear density. Since the discovery of the Hulse--Taylor pulsar 50 years ago, binary pulsar studies have delivered numerous stringent tests of General Relativity (GR) in the strong-field regime as well as its radiative properties -- gravitational waves (GWs). These systems also enable high-precision neutron star mass measurements, placing tight constraints on the behaviour of matter at extreme densities. In addition, pulsars act as natural detectors for nanohertz GWs, primarily from supermassive black hole binaries, culminating in the first reported evidence of a stochastic GW background in 2023. In this article, I review key milestones in pulsar research and highlight some of contributions from my own work. After a brief overview of the gravity experiments in \S 1, I review the discovery of pulsars -- particularly those in binaries -- and their critical role in gravity experiments (\S 2) that laid the foundation for recent advances. In \S 3, I present the latest efforts on GR tests using the Double Pulsar and a pioneer technique to constrain the dense matter equation of state. \S 4 demonstrates the potential of binary pulsars on testing alternative theories to GR. Advances in nanohertz GW detection with pulsar timing arrays are discussed in \S 5. I outline some of the current challenges in \S 6 and conclude with final remarks in \S 7.</description>

      <title>Numerical simulations of jet launching and breakout from collapsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulate the entire GRB dynamics since its production until the jet's break-out from the star envelope is computationally expensive. In this work, we aim to investigate jet production at the black hole horizon and its subsequent evolution beyond the envelope boundary. We perform 2.5-dimensional GRMHD simulations using, as initial conditions, remapped massive star progenitors previously evolved with a state-of-the-art stellar evolutionary codes. Specifically, we adopt the Wolf-Rayet star models 12TH and 16TI from the Woosley \&amp; Heger framework, and we evolve our own Long GRB progenitor with the MESA code. A dipolar magnetic field is imposed, with variations in field strength to explore its influence. We find that the jets are magnetically dominated, with their thermal and kinetic components remaining comparable during propagation through the stellar envelope. The cocoon is thermally dominated in most cases. Jet launching is successful when the magnetic field has a dipolar configuration and spin $a=0.9$, in contrast, a hybrid magnetic field does not result in jet formation. We observe disk formation in cases without a magnetized jet, however, the formation of a well-defined funnel is not evident and the expansion of such wind does not break the star for longer times. Our simulations show that a collapsar launches a successful, relativistic jet only when a strong, large-scale dipolar field, driving a magnetically arrested disk. Such jets collimate, accelerate, and break out of progenitor stars in $1.5\lesssim t\lesssim3.5$ s, while weaker or non-magnetised flows stall inside the star. The resulting jets have luminosities of $L_{j}\sim10^{49}$--$10^{53}\,$erg\,s$^{-1}$ and the final energy structure reveals that magnetisation distribution and progenitor stratification as the key determinants of jet structure and success.</description>

      <title>Data production and Monte Carlo simulations for the Pierre Auger Observatory</title>

Abstract: The Pierre Auger Observatory consists of 1660 water-Cherenkov detectors (WCDs) and 27 fluorescence telescopes, covering a surface of 3000 km2 in the province of Mendoza, Argentina. After almost two decades, Auger Phase I has ended the data taking and has already delivered many outstanding physics results. The Auger Observatory is currently running in Phase II, with upgraded detectors for enhanced data of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs). During Phase I, several engineering detectors were developed and tested. Some of those developments led to new detectors, which are now part of the upgraded Observatory. For Phase II, the WCDs were upgraded with a surface-scintillator detector, a radio detector, a small photomultiplier, and an upgraded electronics board, facilitating mass-sensitive measurements for source identification of UHECRs. Moreover, an underground muon detector allows for a direct measurement of the muon content of air showers. The Offline framework is the main software for the event reconstruction and detector simulation at the Pierre Auger Observatory. It is continuously being developed to accommodate changes in the detector and new algorithms. It allows the running of various applications, which are made up of individual modules, either on raw data or simulations on an event-by-event basis. Large productions of shower and detector reference libraries are done with CORSIKA 7 and Offline on the European Grid Infrastructure (EGI) using the Virtual Organization Auger. Various air-shower geometries (up to 89 degrees in zenith) were considered, as well as several primary particles (from light to ultra-heavy nuclei, photons, and neutrinos), hadronic interaction models and detector configurations for Phase I and Phase II. In this contribution, we present the actual efforts and updates on software for data production and reference Monte Carlo simulations for Auger data analysis.</description>

      <title>A Method for Testing Diffusive Shock Acceleration and Diffusion Propagation of 1-100 TeV Cosmic Electron with Multi-wavelength Observation of Geminga Halo and Pulsar Wind Nebula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusive shock acceleration and diffusion propagation are essential components of the standard cosmic ray model. These theories are based on extensive observations of high-energy solar processes, providing substantial direct evidence in the MeV energy range. Although the model is widely and successfully used to explain high-energy cosmic phenomena, direct validation has been elusive. The multi-wavelength spectra and angular profile measurements of the Geminga pulsar wind nebula and its pulsar halo, particularly the precise spectral observations by HAWC and LHAASO-KM2A in recent years, offer a rare opportunity to test these theories with cosmic rays energies between 1 TeV and several hundred TeV. These observations are expected to elevate the direct testing of theoretical models from multi-MeV to sub-PeV energies. In this work, a method is developed to test the diffusive shock acceleration and diffusion propagation model between one and several hundred TeV energies through the latest spectral and morphological data of the Geminga region from HAWC and Fermi-LAT. Our results show that the theories of diffusive shock acceleration and diffusion propagation are consistent with experimental observations. However, the published morphological data adopted rather wide energy bins and currently do not allow a high precision test of the inferred energy dependent diffusion coefficient by observed energy spectra with DSA theory. It is anticipated that future HAWC and LHAASO-KM2A observations will yield higher-precision results, and the confirmation of a rapidly increasing diffusion coefficient above 100 TeV would serve as important evidence supporting the diffusive shock acceleration and diffusion propagation theory.</description>

      <title>Measurement and Interpretation of UHECR Mass Composition at the Pierre Auger Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Pierre Auger Observatory has driven the field of ultra-high-energy cosmic ray (UHECR) physics, producing several groundbreaking observations over the last 20 years. One of the most striking findings has been the complex evolution of UHECR mass composition, as revealed by detailed analyses of observables such as the depth of shower maximum ($X_{\rm max}$) and the muon content of showers. As more data are collected and sophisticated analyses are undertaken, not only are new fine details emerging, but the general picture of UHECR mass composition is becoming increasingly robust. This contribution presents recent results on the mass composition of UHECRs derived from surface, fluorescence, and radio detectors. Together with other key findings from the Observatory, these results converge to present a coherent picture of UHECR mass composition, effectively ruling out proton dominance and challenging the interpretation of the observed flux features as purely proton-induced propagation effects. To finish the contribution, we compare the $X_{\rm max}$ data from the southern and northern equatorial bands of the exposure of the Pierre Auger Observatory fluorescence detector to evaluate the possibility of changes in composition as a function of declination.</description>

      <title>Study of solar activity with AERA at the Pierre Auger Observatory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar activity events release vast amounts of energy, including radio waves, X-rays, ultraviolet radiation, and energetic particles, which interact with the ionosphere of the Earth and can disrupt radio wave propagation, affecting radio communications. They can either enhance reflections, improving long-distance terrestrial communications, or cause signal degradation and absorption, respectively, depending on whether the increased ionization affects the upper or lower layers of the ionosphere. In the first case, the solar cycle modulates the Maximum Usable Frequency (MUF), the highest frequency usable for radio communication between two Earth-based points. The Auger Engineering Radio Array (AERA) of the Pierre Auger Observatory was developed to measure the radio emission from extensive air showers in the $30-80$ MHz band. We examine the impact of solar activity on AERA data collected over approximately 11 years. We report the detection of different types of solar radio bursts and we investigate how increased solar radiation - particularly in the X-ray and extreme ultraviolet bands - also affects measurements in the AERA energy band. Our results show a remarkable correlation between the MUF and the broadband noise observed in the $30-40$ MHz frequency range. Radio blackouts are also observed in AERA spectrograms in coincidence with those reported by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Additionally, we performed a search for temporal coincidences between AERA data and independent observations of solar radio burst events from the e-CALLISTO network and the SWAVES instrument. These findings highlight the complex interplay between solar activity and radio wave propagation, which is also relevant for cosmic-ray detection.</description>

      <title>Improving Gamma-ray Source Search with Image Processing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The analysis of HAWC data is done using a likeihood-based systematic multi-source search procedure utilizing the threeML software package and the HAL Plugin. This approach was inspired by the extended source search described in the Fermi-LAT Extended Source Search Catalog. The pipeline to search for point sources and extended sources within the region of interest (ROI) is described in the recent HAWC papers. This procedure is computationally intensive and often requires multiple days to produce a final model for a region. Often this approach misses fainter sources, which need to be added manually later. This blind search could be complemented by providing a method to seed source locations, which can be assessed and evaluated by likelihood analysis, thereby significantly reducing the computational time and resources spent on finding a model.</description>

      <title>Stellar properties indicating the presence of hyperons in neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe distinctive stellar features indicating the presence of hyperons in neutron stars. A strongly negative curvature of the mass-radius relation R(M) is characteristic of hyperons, which can be determined from measurements of neutron stars with three different masses. Similarly, a reduced second derivative of the tidal deformability as function of mass $\lambda(M)$ points to hyperonic degrees of freedom in NS matter. The slopes of such curves R(M) and \lambda(M) can distinguish a hyperonic equation of state from purely nucleonic models if they appear increased (decreased for \lambda(M)) relative to the maximum mass of neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Emission properties of 5 pulsars in the death-valley and implications on death line models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the framework of the coherent curvature radiation model of pulsar radio emission, charged particles responsible for the radio emission are generated on the polar cap in the localized pair cascade processes called sparks. When a pulsar can no longer sustain the sparking process on its polar cap, the coherent radio emission from the pulsar stops, and the pulsar is called dead. In this work, we revisit the pulsar death phenomena under two popular voltage gap models: vacuum voltage gap and partially screened voltage gap. We notice that a dying pulsar resorts to a single spark on the polar cap to sustain the pair production under both voltage gap frameworks. The presence of only one spark on the polar cap has important implications for the radio emission properties of the pulsar. We study the emission properties of five pulsars close to the lower boundary on the $P-\dot{P}$ plane of the current pulsar population, as these pulsars are expected to be dying. We find that the dying pulsars in our sample and the normal pulsar population have very similar emission properties. We show that the majority of pulsars in the pulsar death valley, including five pulsars in our sample, show evidence of multiple sparks as opposed to what is expected from single spark death line models.</description>

      <title>New full-sky studies of the distribution of ultra-high-energy cosmic-ray arrival directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ground-based full-sky studies of the angular distribution of arrival directions of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays require combining data from different observatories, such as the Pierre Auger Observatory (Auger) and the Telescope Array (TA), because no single array can cover all declinations. A working group comprising members from the Auger and TA collaborations has been tasked with performing such studies for more than a decade and has found several indications of full-sky anisotropies. Here, we update the results for the large- and medium-scale anisotropy analyses using the latest data from TA, which include corrections for daily and yearly atmospheric effects in data for large-scale anisotropies and looser selection criteria in data for medium-scale anisotropies. We extend the latter one by considering two more galaxy catalogues, consisting of jetted or all AGNs. Finally we also introduce a new angular harmonic space analysis that allows us to measure both the auto-correlation and cross-correlation with all catalogues for all multipoles independently ($\ell_\text{max} = 20$ in this work) and scanning the energy threshold.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic Energy Extraction from Kerr Black Holes: Ab-Initio Calculations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The possibility of extracting energy from a rotating black hole via the Blandford-Znajek mechanism represents a cornerstone of relativistic astrophysics. We present general-relativistic collisionless kinetic simulations of Kerr black-hole magnetospheres covering a wide range in the black-hole spin. Considering a classical split-monopole magnetic field, we can reproduce with these ab-initio calculations the force-free electrodynamics of rotating black holes and measure the power of the jet launched as a function of the spin. The Blandford-Znajek luminosity we find is in very good agreement with analytic calculations and compatible with general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics simulations via a simple rescaling. These results provide strong evidence of the robustness of the Blandford-Znajek mechanism and accurate estimates of the electromagnetic luminosity to be expected in those scenarios involving rotating black holes across the mass scale.</description>

      <title>RHINE: R-process Heating Implementation in hydrodynamic simulations with NEural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutron-rich outflows in neutron-star mergers (NSMs) or other explosive events can be subject to substantial heating through the release of rest-mass energy in the course of the rapid neutron-capture (r-) process. This r-process heating can potentially have a significant impact on the dynamics determining the velocity distribution of the ejecta, but due to the complexity of detailed nuclear networks required to describe the r-process self-consistently, hydrodynamic models of NSMs often neglect r-process heating or include it using crude parametrizations. In this work, we present a conceptually new method, RHINE, for emulating the r-process and concomitant energy release in hydrodynamic simulations via machine-learning algorithms. The method requires the evolution of only a few additional quantities characterizing the composition, of which the nuclear rates of change are obtained at each location and time step from neural networks trained by a large set of trajectories from full nuclear-network calculations. The scheme is tested by comparing spherically symmetric wind simulations and long-term simulations of NSMs using RHINE with post-processing results from nucleosynthesis calculations, where we find very good agreement. In our NSM models on average about 2.3MeV, 0.7MeV, and 2.1MeV are released per baryon in dynamical ejecta, NS-torus ejecta, and black-hole (BH) torus ejecta, respectively. The strongest velocity boost is observed for BH-torus ejecta, which also become 40% more massive with r-process heating. The nucleosynthesis yields are only mildly affected by r-process heating, but the kilonova gets significantly brighter once the BH-torus ejecta become visible. RHINE can be readily implemented in existing hydrodynamics codes using pre-trained machine-learning data and routines for source-term prediction that we provide online.</description>

      <title>Bringing the Norma Dark Cloud to Light in X-rays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The filamentary dark cloud complex in Norma reveals signs of active low-mass star formation including protostars, H-alpha emission line stars, Herbig Haro objects, and the eruptive FU Orionis-like star V346 Nor. We present results of the first pointed X-ray observations of the Norma dark cloud, focusing on the westernmost Sandqvist 187 region. Chandra detected 75 X-ray sources and a complementary XMM-Newton observation detected 92 sources within the Chandra field-of-view, of which 46 are cross-matched to Chandra, yielding 121 unique X-ray sources. We present a catalog of X-ray sources along with basic X-ray properties and candidate IR and optical counterparts. Existing near-IR photometry reveals several X-ray sources with color excesses as typical of young stars with disks. Gaia parallaxes single out foreground stars and X-ray sources with distances of 500 - 1000 pc that are probable cloud members. The known emission line stars Sz 136 and Sz 137 were detected but V346 Nor was not. Interestingly, the optical and IR counterparts of the brightest Chandra source are not known with certainty but the prime suspects are very faint. Thus, the nature of the object responsible for the bright X-ray emission remains speculative. The X-ray observations presented here will serve as a pathfinder for identifying and characterizing the young stellar population in the Norma dark cloud.</description>

      <title>Little Red Dots As Late-stage Quasi-stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We argue that the "Little Red Dots" (LRDs) discovered with the James Webb Space Telescope are quasi-stars in their late stages of evolution. Quasi-stars are hypothetical objects predicted to form following the core collapse of supermassive stars, and consist of black holes accreting from massive envelopes at a super-Eddington rate. We show that models of late-stage quasi-stars, with black hole masses exceeding $\sim 10\%$ of the total, predict thermal and radiative properties that are insensitive to both black hole and envelope mass, and spectrally resemble LRDs. Specifically, we show that they are likely to exhibit reddish colors, a strong Balmer break, and possess conditions favorable to the production of Balmer lines that are broadened by electron scattering. Their huge electron column densities suppress any X-rays. Late-stage quasi-stars, with black hole masses $\gtrsim 10^6 M_\odot$, should dominate the overall quasi-star population. Their short predicted lifetimes (tens of Myr), coupled with the high observed comoving density of LRDs, suggest that most or all supermassive black holes go through a quasi-star/LRD phase during their formation and growth.</description>

      <title>Combining (post-)Newtonian ideas with quasi-equilibrium (QE) sequence analysis for black hole-neutron star (BHNS) gravitational wave events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we present quasi equilibrium models of black hole-neutron star (BHNS) binaries with mass and spin values compatible with parameter estimates derived from gravitational radiation events GW200105 and GW200115, events consistent with the merger of BHNSs. Using the FUKA initial data framework, we determine the location of ISCO (Innermost Stable Circular Orbit) and radius of mass shedding. In most of the cases studied here the innermost stable orbit is located at larger separations. This is consistent with the fact that for those two events no electromagnetic counterparts have been observed since it is believed that the NS will enter into the plunge phase in a short time once the separation of the components of the binary will be smaller of ISCO. In analogy with classical binaries, we have associated to these QE sequences a Newtonian and Post Newtonian Roche Lobe analysis to verify whether the NS is filling its Roche Lobe before approaching the ISCO. For selected configurations explored here, the location of ISCO and of the orbit at which mass shedding occurs are at separation smaller than the last converged solution of our sequences. Our analysis shows that in such cases the neutron star is filling its Roche lobe suggesting that mass transfer might occur well before encountering the last stable orbit, and this should happen in catastrophic way in order to prevent any electromagnetic emissions. If this is the case, we are suggestion a third fate of the neutron star beyond the plunge or tidal disruption ones.</description>

      <title>Calibration and Performance of the Surface Scintillator Detector of the Pierre Auger Observatory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Pierre Auger Observatory has led to significant advances in our understanding of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays. These new insights have driven a major upgrade of the Observatory, known as AugerPrime, through which the experiment has entered its Phase II, a new period of data collection. A key part of the upgrade is adding surface scintillator detectors (SSD) on top of the existing water-Cherenkov detectors (WCD). The main goal is to leverage their different responses to the electromagnetic and muonic shower components, enhancing the reconstruction of the primary cosmic-ray mass. In this contribution, we present the methods that involve analyzing peak and charge distributions of atmospheric muons for accurate calibration during extensive air-shower event reconstruction, along with the development of a rate-based algorithm for independent calibration. We also show the performance of the SSDs with Phase-II data, including PMT reliability and stability of key parameters, such as gain and signal-to-noise ratio.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Networks for Photon Searches with the Underground Muon Detector of the Pierre Auger Observatory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultra-high-energy photons have long been sought as tracers of the most energetic processes in the Universe. Several sources can contribute to a diffuse photon flux, including interactions of cosmic rays with Galactic matter and radiation fields, as well as more exotic scenarios such as the decay of super-heavy dark matter. Regardless of their origin, the expected flux is extremely low, making direct detection impractical and thereby requiring indirect detection by extensive ground-based detector arrays. In this contribution, we present a novel method for photon-hadron discrimination in the energy range of $50$ to $300\,\text{PeV}$ based on deep learning algorithms. Our approach relies on information from both the Surface Detector (SD) and the Underground Muon Detector (UMD) of the Pierre Auger Observatory. The SD consists of an array of water-Cherenkov detectors. It is used to measure the electromagnetic and muonic components of extensive air showers at ground level. Meanwhile, the UMD is composed of buried scintillator modules. It is sensitive to air-shower muons with energies above ${\sim}1\,\text{GeV}$, enhancing the identification of muon-poor air showers as initiated by photon primaries. Our method represents air-shower events as graphs, and consequently, the network architecture is composed of graph attention layers. We assess the performance of the method on a data subset and discuss the implications of unblinding the full current dataset, as well as the prospects of the increasing data volume expected in the coming years, particularly in terms of sensitivity to various diffuse fluxes from theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>Eccentric Accretion Disks in Active Galactic Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active galactic nuclei (AGNs), among the universe's most luminous objects, radiate across the entire electromagnetic spectrum. They are powered by gravitational energy released from material feeding central supermassive black holes (SMBHs). However, current AGN theory remains largely phenomenological, relying on envisioned structures beyond accretion disks to produce broad optical emission lines (broad line regions, BLRs) and X-ray emission (corona). It struggles to explain accretion disk sizes, optical line diversity, BLR radial inflows/outflows, and crucially, rapid X-ray and optical variability (line width, line shape, inflow/outflow switch, emitting region) on timescales significantly shorter than disk accretion. Here we show that moderately eccentric flows around SMBHs-formed via circumnuclear gas accretion or tidal disruption events-generate eccentricity cascades in the BLRs (from 0.8 to 0.2 outwards), explaining multi-wavelength emission and variability. The flows' non-axisymmetric temperature structures explain dust sublimation asymmetries, different BLR components and their radial motions. The innermost BLR links to the SMBH vicinity through highly eccentric streams producing soft X-rays at periapsis. General relativistic precession further compresses these flows, generating a hard X-ray continuum near the SMBHs. Precession of the eccentric flow drives optical/X-ray variability, reproducing the observed X-ray power spectral density and occasional X-ray quasi-periodic eruptions. We thus propose eccentric accretion disks as a physical AGN model unifying the elusive BLRs and X-ray corona. This model enables detailed anatomy of AGNs and maximises their potential as cosmological standard candles.</description>

      <title>The Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection (GRAND) Collaboration -- Contributions to the 39th International Cosmic Ray Conference (ICRC 2025)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection (GRAND) is an envisioned observatory of ultra-high-energy particles of cosmic origin, with energies in excess of 100 PeV. GRAND uses large surface arrays of antennas to look for the radio emission from extensive air showers that are triggered by the interaction of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays, gamma rays, and neutrinos in the atmosphere or underground. In particular, for ultra-high-energy neutrinos, the future final phase of GRAND aims to be sensitive enough to detect them in spite of their plausibly tiny flux. Three prototype GRAND radio arrays have been in operation since 2023: GRANDProto300, in China, GRAND@Auger, in Argentina, and GRAND@Nan\c{c}ay, in France. Their goals are to field-test the GRAND detection units, understand the radio background to which they are exposed, and develop tools for diagnostic, data gathering, and data analysis. This list of contributions to the 39th International Cosmic Ray Conference (ICRC 2025) presents an overview of GRAND, in its present and future incarnations, and a first look at data collected by GRANDProto300 and GRAND@Auger, including the first cosmic-ray candidates detected by them.</description>

      <title>Probing Right Handed Neutrino assisted Reheating with Gravitational Waves and Leptogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a non-instantaneous reheating period in the early Universe, where the inflaton field decays exclusively to right-handed neutrinos (RHNs). The subsequent decay of these RHNs into Standard Model particles not only drives the transition to a radiation-dominated era but also generates the baryon asymmetry of the Universe via leptogenesis. In this typical reheating scenario, gravitational waves (GWs) can be produced during inflaton decay, both through bremsstrahlung and inflaton scattering processes. While GW production via bremsstrahlung dominates near the end of the reheating phase, inflaton scattering leads to a non-negligible GW contribution near the maximum temperature of the Universe. The combined GW spectrum from both decay and scattering processes lies within the sensitivity range of proposed resonant cavity experiments. This framework thus offers a compelling and unified approach to addressing neutrino mass generation, the baryon asymmetry of the Universe via leptogenesis, and probing the dynamics of a non-instantaneous reheating era.</description>

      <title>Composition of Scalar Mesons and Their Effects on Nuclear Matter Properties in an Extended Linear Sigma Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been argued that the iso-scalar and iso-vector mesons play significant roles in nuclear matter and neutron star structures. We improve the extended linear sigma model with baryons, proposed in our previous work, by introducing the flavor structures constructed from antisymmetric tensors of chiral representations to study these physics. The parameter space of this model is refined with well-reproduced nuclear matter properties at saturation density by the lowest order Lagrangian, ensuring consistency with vacuum results, such as $f_\pi \approx 134 \, \text{MeV}$. The anticipated plateau-like behaviors of the symmetry energy are predicted at intermediate densities, which is crucial for the consistency of GW170817 and the neutron skin thickness of $\text{Pb}^{208}$. Subsequently, neutron star structures are calculated using several parameter sets, and the results for the nuclear matter properties at saturation density align with empirical values. It is found that the neutron star structures are sensitive to the couplings between the iso-vector $a_0$ meson and nucleons and the four-vector meson couplings: small values of both are favorable. Meanwhile, nuclear matter properties at saturation density favor larger values of the latter and are not sensitive to the former. This signifies the statistical significance of neutron star observations when obtaining realistic chiral effective field theories or models at various densities. The parameter set favored by neutron star observations also aligns the behavior of the sound velocity with the conformal limit at high densities relevant to cores of massive stars. It is hoped that the results of this work can guide future studies on the relationship between the microscopic symmetry of strong interactions and macroscopic phenomena.</description>

      <title>Astro-COLIBRI: Empowering Citizen Scientists in Multi-Messenger Astrophysics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the era of real-time astronomy, citizen scientists play an increasingly important role in the discovery and follow-up of transient astrophysical phenomena. From local astronomical societies to global initiatives, amateur astronomers contribute valuable observational data that complement professional efforts. Astro-COLIBRI facilitates these contributions by providing a user-friendly platform that integrates real-time alerts, data visualization tools, and collaborative features to support astronomers at all levels.
  The Astro-COLIBRI Citizen Science Program provides engagement opportunities across multiple scales. At the grassroots level, we collaborate with local astronomy clubs, equipping them with accessible tools for transient event monitoring. National and international networks, such as RAPAS in France, leverage Astro-COLIBRI's real-time capabilities for coordinated observations. On a global scale, we actively participate in high-impact citizen science and capacity building initiatives, including the International Astronomical Union (IAU) Citizen Science Program and the "Open Universe" initiative led by the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs (UNOOSA). These collaborations enhance the accessibility of real-time astrophysical data and foster inclusive participation in cutting-edge astronomy.
  In this contribution, we will present the Astro-COLIBRI Citizen Science Program, highlighting its technical framework, community impact, and case studies of successful amateur contributions. We will showcase how our platform facilitates the rapid exchange of information between professional and amateur astronomers, democratizing access to multi-messenger astrophysics and enabling the global community to contribute meaningfully to time-domain discoveries.</description>

Abstract: The transport of non-thermal particles across a large-scale magnetic field in the presence of magnetised turbulence has been a long-standing issue in high-energy astrophysics. Of particular interest is the dependence of the parallel and perpendicular mean free paths $\lambda_{\parallel}$ and $\lambda_{\perp}$ on rigidity $\mathcal{R}$. We have revisited this important issue with a view to applications from the transport of Galactic cosmic rays to acceleration at astrophysical shocks. We have run test particle simulations of cosmic ray transport in synthetic, isotropic Kolmogorov turbulence at unprecedentedly low reduced rigidities $\rg/\Lc \simeq 10^{-4}$, corresponding to $\mathcal{R} \simeq 10 \, \text{TV}$ for a turbulent magnetic field of $\Brms = 4 \, \mu\text{G}$ and correlation length $\Lc = 30 \, \text{pc}$. Extracting the (asymptotic) parallel and perpendicular mean free paths $\lambda_{\parallel}$ and $\lambda_{\perp}$, we have found $\lambda_{\parallel} \propto (\rg/\Lc)^{1/3}$ as expected for a Kolmogorov turbulence spectrum. In contrast, $\lambda_{\perp}$ has a faster dependence on $\rg/\Lc$ for $10^{-2} \lesssim \rg/\Lc \lesssim 1$, but for $\rg/\Lc \ll 10^{-2}$, also $\lambda_{\perp} \propto (\rg/\Lc)^{1/3}$. Our results have important implications for the transport of Galactic cosmic rays.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.05882v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The transport of high-energy particles in the presence of small-scale, turbulent magnetic fields is a long-standing issue in astrophysics. Analytical theories on transport perpendicular to the large-scale magnetic field disagree with numerical simulations at rigidities where the particles' gyroradii are slightly smaller than the correlation length of turbulence. At the same time, extending the numerical simulations to lower rigidities has proven computationally prohibitive. We present an analytical model for the perpendicular transport, based on (1) initial particle transport along field lines, (2) the transport of field lines and (3) the eventual decorrelation of particles from field lines. Transport parallel to the large-scale field is governed by pitch-angle scattering and so for times larger than the inverse pitch-angle diffusion coefficient, particles spatially diffuse in the parallel direction. Our results suggest that perpendicular diffusion occurs when particles have displaced in the perpendicular direction by a few correlation lengths of turbulence. We have tested the analytical theory by running a large suite of test particle simulations at unprecedentedly low rigidities, making extensive use of graphical processing units (GPUs). Our numerical results exhibit a non-standard rigidity-dependence for the perpendicular diffusion coefficient at intermediate rigidities. At the lowest rigidities, the standard rigidity-dependence is recovered. The simulated diffusion coefficients are nicely reproduced by our analytical model. We have traced the non-standard rigidity-dependence to a subdiffusive phase in the field line transport. Our study confirms our understanding of the escape of cosmic rays from the Galactic halo and its rigidity-dependence. [abridged]</description>

      <title>Cosmic Ray Diffusion in the Turbulent Interstellar Medium: Effects of Mirror Diffusion and Pitch Angle Scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12146v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cosmic rays (CRs) interact with turbulent magnetic fields in the intestellar medium, generating nonthermal emission. After many decades of studies, the theoretical understanding of their diffusion in the ISM continues to pose a challenge. This study numerically explores a recent prediction termed "mirror diffusion" and its synergy with traditional diffusion mechanism based on gyroresonant scattering. Our study combines 3D MHD simulations of star-forming regions with test particle simulations to analyze CR diffusion. We demonstrate the significance of mirror diffusion in CR diffusion parallel to the magnetic field, when the mirroring condition is satisfied. Our results support the theoretical expectation that the resulting particle propagation arising from mirror diffusion in combination with much faster diffusion induced by gyroresonant scattering resembles a Levy-flight-like propagation. Our study highlights the necessity to reevaluate the diffusion coefficients traditionally adopeted in the ISM based on gyroresonant scattering alone. For instance, our simulations imply a diffusion coefficient $\sim10^{27}cm^2/s$ for particles with a few hundred TeV within regions spanning a few parsecs around the source. This estimate is in agreement with gamma-ray observations, which shows the relevance of our results for understanding of diffuse gamma-ray emission in star-forming regions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02478v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of extended $\gamma$-ray sources usually assumes symmetric diffusion of cosmic rays. However, recent observations of multiple sources near single pulsars and significant offsets between TeV halo centroids and their parent pulsars suggest that this assumption is overly simplistic. In this Letter, we demonstrate that asymmetric propagation of cosmic rays near their accelerators may create multiple TeV sources instead of a single symmetric source. This mechanism also explains the large offsets between TeV halo centroids and their pulsars. We demonstrate that several perplexing detected sources can be naturally explained without invoking additional invisible accelerators.</description>

      <title>A fast X-ray transient from a weak relativistic jet associated with a type Ic-BL supernova</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02315v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Massive stars end their lives as core-collapse supernovae, amongst which some extremes are broad-lined type Ic supernovae from Wolf-Rayet stars associated with long-duration gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs) having powerful relativistic jets. Their less-extreme brethren make unsuccessful jets that are choked inside the stars, appearing as X-ray flashes or low-luminosity GRBs. On the other hand, there exists a population of extragalactic fast X-ray transients (EFXTs) with timescales ranging from seconds to thousands of seconds, whose origins remain obscure. Here, we report the discovery of the bright X-ray transient EP240414a detected by the Einstein Probe (EP), which is associated with the type Ic supernova SN 2024gsa at a redshift of 0.401. The X-ray emission evolution is characterised by a very soft energy spectrum peaking at $&lt; 1.3$ keV, which makes it different from known LGRBs, X-ray flashes, or low-luminosity GRBs. Follow-up observations at optical and radio bands revealed the existence of a weak relativistic jet that interacts with an extended shell surrounding the progenitor star. Located on the outskirts of a massive galaxy, this event reveals a new population of explosions of Wolf-Rayet stars characterised by a less powerful engine that drives a successful but weak jet, possibly owing to a progenitor star with a smaller core angular momentum than in traditional LGRB progenitors.</description>

      <title>Ultra-High-Energy Cosmic Rays from Neutrino-Emitting Tidal Disruption Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19047v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the Ultra-High-Energy Cosmic Ray (UHECRs) production in Tidal Disruption Events (TDEs) in the light of recent neutrino-TDE associations. We use an isotropically emitting source-propagation model, which has been developed to describe the neutrino production in AT2019dsg, AT2019fdr, and AT2019aalc. These TDEs have strong dust echoes in the infrared range, which are potentially linked with the neutrino production. A mechanism where neutrinos originate from cosmic ray scattering on infrared photons implies cosmic rays in the ultra-high energy range, thus suggesting a natural connection with the observed UHECR. We extrapolate the three TDE associations to a population of neutrino- and UHECR-emitting TDEs, and postulate that these TDEs power the UHECRs. We then infer the source composition, population parameters, and local rates that are needed to describe UHECR data. We find that UHECR data point towards a mix of light to mid-heavy injection isotopes, which could be found, e.g., in oxygen-neon-magnesium white dwarfs, and to a contribution of at least two groups of TDEs with different characteristics, dominated by AT2019aalc-type events. The required local TDE rates of ${\mathcal O}(10^2)~\mathrm{Gpc^{-3} \, yr^{-1}}$, however, are more indicative of the disruption of main sequence stars. We propose an enhanced efficiency in the acceleration of heavier nuclei that could address this discrepancy. The predicted diffuse neutrino fluxes suggest a population of astrophysical neutrino sources that can be observed by future radio neutrino detection experiments. The derived source parameters are consistent with those expected from the individual neutrino observations.</description>

      <title>Polarized multiwavelength emission from pulsar wind - accretion disk interaction in a transitional millisecond pulsar</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13260v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transitional millisecond pulsars (tMSPs) bridge the evolutionary gap between accreting neutron stars in low-mass X-ray binaries and millisecond radio pulsars. These systems exhibit a unique subluminous X-ray state characterized by the presence of an accretion disk and rapid switches between high and low X-ray emission modes. The high mode features coherent millisecond pulsations spanning from the X-ray to the optical band. We present multiwavelength polarimetric observations of the tMSP PSR J1023+0038 aimed at conclusively identifying the physical mechanism powering its emission in the subluminous X-ray state. During the high mode, we detect polarized emission in the 2-6 keV energy range, with a polarization degree of 12% +/- 3% and a polarization angle of -2deg +/- 9deg (1sigma) measured counterclockwise from the North celestial pole towards East. At optical wavelengths, we find a polarization degree of 1.41% +/- 0.04% and a polarization angle aligned with that in the soft X-rays, suggesting a common physical mechanism operating across these bands. Remarkably, the polarized flux spectrum matches the pulsed emission spectrum from optical to X-rays. The polarization properties differ markedly from those observed in other accreting neutron stars and isolated rotation-powered pulsars and are also inconsistent with an origin in a compact jet. Our results provide direct evidence that the polarized and pulsed emissions both originate from synchrotron radiation at the shock formed where the pulsar wind interacts with the inner regions of the accretion disk.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics and collisionality in firehose-susceptible high-$\beta$ plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13663v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the evolution of collisionless plasmas that, due to their macroscopic evolution, are susceptible to the firehose instability, using both analytic theory and hybrid-kinetic particle-in-cell simulations. We establish that, depending on the relative magnitude of the plasma $\beta$, the characteristic timescale of macroscopic evolution, and the ion-Larmor frequency, the saturation of the firehose instability in high-$\beta$ plasmas can result in three qualitatively distinct thermodynamic (and electromagnetic) states. By contrast with the previously identified `ultra-high-beta' and `Alfv\'en-inhibiting' states, the newly identified `Alfv\'en-enabling' state, which is realised when the macroscopic evolution time $\tau$ exceeds the ion-Larmor frequency by a $\beta$-dependent parameter, can support linear Alfv\'en waves and Alfv\'enic turbulence because the magnetic tension associated with the plasma's macroscopic magnetic field is never completely negated by anisotropic pressure forces. We characterise these states in detail, including their saturated magnetic-energy spectra. The effective collision operator associated with the firehose fluctuations is also described; we find it to be well approximated in the Alfv\'en-enabling state by a simple quasilinear pitch-angle scattering operator. The box-averaged collision frequency is $\nu_{\rm eff} \sim \beta/\tau$, in agreement with previous results, but certain sub-populations of particles scatter at a much larger (or smaller) rate depending on their velocity in the direction parallel to the magnetic field. Our findings are essential for understanding low-collisionality astrophysical plasmas including the solar wind, the intracluster medium of galaxy clusters and black-hole accretion flows. We show that all three of these plasmas are in the Alfv\'en-enabling regime of firehose saturation and discuss the implications of this result.</description>

      <title>The cosmic-ray sea explains the diffuse Galactic gamma-ray and neutrino emission from GeV to PeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18268v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The LHAASO collaboration has recently released the spectrum and the angular distribution of the $\gamma$-ray Galactic diffuse emission from 1 TeV to 1 PeV measured with the Kilometer-2 Array (KM2A) and Water Cherenkov Detector Array (WCDA). We show that these data are in remarkably good agreement with a set of models that assume the emission to be produced by the Galactic population of cosmic rays if its spectral shape traces that measured by CALET and DAMPE as well as KASCADE at higher energies. No extra-components besides the CR sea is needed to explain LHAASO results. Accounting for unresolved sources, we consistently reproduce Tibet AS$\gamma$ as well as a wide set of $\gamma$-ray data at lower energy. To do this, we consider two different transport setups: a conventional one and a $\gamma$-optimized spatial-dependent one (a development of the widely adopted KRA$_\gamma$ model). We demonstrate that both setups are compatible with LHAASO results. However, the latter is preferred if one takes into account Fermi-LAT gamma-ray data and neutrino measurements. In fact, we also compute the associated Galactic neutrino diffuse emission finding that the contribution from sources cannot be dominant and showing that spatial-dependent propagation models closely match the ANTARES and IceCube best fits for the Galactic Center Ridge and the Galactic Plane emissions. We argue that our $\gamma$-optimized model should be used as a template for future analyses of upcoming data from the Global Neutrino Network.</description>

      <title>Investigating the correlation between ZTF TDEs and IceCube high-energy neutrinos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09426v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Investigating the correlation between the TDE population and IceCube neutrinos could help us better understand whether TDEs could be potential high-energy neutrino emitters. In this paper, we perform a systematic search for TDEs that are associated with neutrinos in a sample including 143 IceCube neutrino alert events and 52 TDEs classified by the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) - Bright Transient Survey (BTS). Furthermore, considering that the TDEs/TDE candidates reported as potential IceCube neutrino emitters are all accompanied by infrared (IR) echo emissions, we further select the TDEs with IR echoes from these 52 TDEs as a subsample to examine the correlation with neutrinos. Based on the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) mission database, seven TDEs are identified as having IR echoes. Then we employ Monte Carlo simulations to quantify the correlation between the TDE sample/subsample and IceCube neutrinos. Finally, after considering spatial and temporal criteria, the seven TDEs with IR echoes show the most significant correlation at a 2.46$\sigma$ confidence level. If we tentatively further take the time delay factor into account, the correlation enhances to a 2.66$\sigma$ confidence level. The correlation is primarily contributed by two TDEs: AT2019dsg and AT2019azh. The latter's association with a neutrino alert, IC230217A, is newly reported in this work. We discussed the possible physical connection between AT2019azh and the neutrino event IC230217A.</description>

      <title>Accelerating LISA inference with Gaussian processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21871v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Source inference for deterministic gravitational waves is a computationally demanding task in LISA. In a novel approach, we investigate the capability of Gaussian Processes to learn the posterior surface in order to reconstruct individual signal posteriors. We use GPry, which automates this reconstruction through active learning, using a very small number of likelihood evaluations, without the need for pretraining. We benchmark GPry against the cutting-edge nested sampler nessai, by injecting individually three signals on LISA noisy data simulated with Balrog: a white dwarf binary (DWD), a stellar-mass black hole binary (stBHB), and a super-massive black hole binary (SMBHB). We find that GPry needs $\mathcal O(10^{-2})$ fewer likelihood evaluations to achieve an inference accuracy comparable to nessai, with Jensen-Shannon divergence $D_{\scriptscriptstyle \mathrm{JS}} \lesssim 0.01$ for the DWD, and $D_{\scriptscriptstyle \mathrm{JS}} \lesssim 0.05$ for the SMBHB. Lower accuracy is found for the less Gaussian posterior of the stBHB: $D_{\scriptscriptstyle \mathrm{JS}} \lesssim 0.2$. Despite the overhead costs of GPry, we obtain a speed-up of $\mathcal O(10^2)$ for the slowest cases of stBHB and SMBHB. In conclusion, active-learning Gaussian process frameworks show great potential for rapid LISA parameter inference, especially for costly likelihoods, enabling suppression of computational costs without the trade-off of approximations in the calculations.</description>

      <title>High-Energy Neutrino Emission from a Radiatively Inefficient Accretion Flow with a three-dimensional GRMHD Simulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22891v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The high-energy particle production in the accretion flow onto black holes can be a key physics to explain the high-energy neutrino background. While the single-zone approximation has been commonly adopted in studies of the high-energy neutrino emission around black holes, the effects of the global plasma structure may be non-negligible. We carry out the first computations of cosmic-ray acceleration and high-energy neutrino emission via the hadronuclear ($pp$) interaction in global radiatively inefficient accretion flows and outflows around a supermassive black hole, using three-dimensional general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulation data. The Fokker-Planck equation for cosmic-ray protons is solved with a phenomenological model for the energy diffusion coefficient to express the turbulent acceleration in the sub-grid scale. The inhomogeneous and time variable structure of the accretion flow leads to a variety of particle energy distribution. The spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of neutrinos emitted from the entire region are flatter than those calculated under the single-zone approximation. In our model, the neutrino emission originating from cosmic rays advected with the outflow rather than the inflow predominates the SEDs. Such galactic nuclei can be significant sources of cosmic rays in those galaxies.</description>

Abstract: By consideration of the Compact object HESS J1731-347 as a hybrid twin compact star, i.e., a more compact star than its hadronic twin of the same mass, its stellar properties are derived. Besides showing that the properties of compact stars in this work are in good agreement with state-of-the-art constraints both from measurements carried out in laboratory experiments as well as by multi-messenger astronomy observations, the realization of an early strong hadron-quark first order phase transition as implied by the twins is discussed.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Inference from Polarized Light Curves of Sagittarius A*</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01114v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Polarimetric light curves of Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*) sometimes exhibit loops in the Stokes $Q$ and $U$ plane over time, often interpreted as orbiting hotspot motion. In this work, we apply the differential geometry of planar curves to develop a new technique for estimating polarimetric rotation rates. Applying this technique to 230 GHz light curves of Sgr A*, we find evidence of clockwise motion not only during a post-flare period on 2017 April 11th, as previously discovered, but also during the quiescent days imaged by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). The data exhibit a clockwise fraction of $0.65 \pm 0.09$ and an overall $Q-U$ rotation rate of $-2.6 \pm 0.6 \ \mathrm{deg}\,t_g^{-1}$. We analyze a library of General Relativistic Magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations and find that face-on, clockwise-rotating models with strong magnetic fields are most likely to be consistent with the observations. These results are consistent with EHT and GRAVITY Collaboration studies, and indirectly support an interpretation in which the polarized image of Sgr A* has been rotated by an external Faraday screen. This technique offers a novel probe of event horizon scale dynamics that complements dynamical reconstructions.</description>

      <title>Detection of X-ray Polarization in the Hard State of IGR J17091-3624: Spectro-Polarimetric Study with IXPE and NuSTAR Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16402v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The class-transition Galactic X-ray binary IGR~J17091--3624 was simultaneously monitored by the \textit{IXPE} and \textit{NuSTAR} satellites. We present a detailed spectro-polarimetric study of the source using data from both satellites covering the period from March~7--10, 2025. A polarimetric analysis in the $2$--$8$~keV band using a model-independent method reveals a significant detection of polarization degree (PD) of $(11.3\pm2.35)\%$ at a polarization angle (PA) of $82^\circ.7\pm5^\circ.96$ (significant at $&gt;4\sigma$). The model-dependent polarization analysis using the \texttt{polconst} and \texttt{polpow} models yields consistent values of PD and PA. In both methods, an energy-dependent increasing trend of PD is observed. In the $6$--$8$~keV band, a maximum PD of $(29.9\pm8.46)\%$ (significant at $&gt;3\sigma$) is detected at a PA of $88^\circ.0\pm8^\circ.15$ ($&gt;3\sigma$). The joint spectral analysis using \textit{IXPE} and \textit{NuSTAR} data in the $2$--$70$~keV band was performed with four different sets of phenomenological and physical models. Our results indicate a strong dominance of non-thermal photons originating from a `hot' Compton cloud, suggesting that the source was in a hard spectral state. Spectral fitting with the physical {\fontfamily{qcr}\selectfont kerrbb} and {\fontfamily{qcr}\selectfont TCAF} models provides an estimate of the black hole mass $M_{\rm BH} = 14.8^{+4.7}_{-3.4}~M_\odot$ and dimensionless spin parameter $a^* \sim 0.54$. The requirement of a higher hydrogen column density in the spectral fit of the second \textit{NuSTAR} observation is attributed to the obscuration of non-thermal photons during the dip phase, likely caused by the presence of wind accreted from the companion star.</description>

      <title>Puzzling Variation of Gamma Rays from the Sun over the Solar Cycle Revealed with Fermi-LAT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06348v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The steady-state gamma-ray emission from the Sun is thought to consist of two emission components due to interactions with Galactic cosmic rays: (1) a hadronic disk component, and (2) a leptonic extended component peaking at the solar edge and extending into the heliosphere. The flux of these components is expected to vary with the 11-year solar cycle, being highest during solar minimum and lowest during solar maximum, as it varies with the cosmic-ray flux. No study has yet analyzed the flux variation of each component over solar cycles.
  In this work, we measure the temporal variations of the flux of each component over 15 years of Fermi Large Area Telescope observations and compare them with the sunspot number and Galactic cosmic-ray flux from AMS-02 near Earth.
  We find that the flux variation of the disk anticorrelates with the sunspot number and correlates with cosmic-ray protons, as expected, confirming its emission mechanism. In contrast, the extended component exhibits a more complex variation: despite an initial anticorrelation with the sunspot number, we find neither anticorrelation with the sunspot number nor correlation with cosmic-ray electrons over the full 15-year period. This most likely suggests that cosmic-ray transport and modulation in the inner heliosphere are unexpectedly complex and may differ for electrons and protons or, alternatively, that there is an additional, unknown component of gamma rays or cosmic rays.
  These findings impact space weather research and emphasize the need for close monitoring of Cycle 25 and the ongoing polarity reversal.</description>

      <title>Gamma/hadron discriminant variables in application to high-energy cosmic-ray air showers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04546v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Identification of primary cosmic rays on an event-by-event basis is a much-desired capability of cosmic-ray observatories. Several cosmic-ray air-shower experiments use so-called photon tags for gamma hadron primary particle discrimination. These photon tag variables are derived from the total signals measured by an array of detectors and are correlated with the total number of muons in the air shower. In this work, variables based on time distribution of signals in detectors (trace-based discriminant variables) are studied and compared to total-signal-based variables. This study relies on simulated high-energy cosmic-ray air showers with energies around 10^17.5eV. Since the variables discussed are derived from total signals and their time traces, which can be directly measured in real data, they are suitable for use as discriminant variables in the real ground-based cosmic ray experiments.</description>

      <title>CHIME/FRB Discovery of an Unusual Circularly Polarized Long-Period Radio Transient with an Accelerating Spin Period</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05139v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the discovery of CHIME J1634+44, a Long Period Radio Transient (LPT) unique for two aspects: it is the first known LPT to emit fully circularly polarized radio bursts, and it is the first LPT with a significant spin-up. Given that high circular polarization ($&gt;90$\%) has been observed in FRB~20201124A and in some giant pulses of PSR~B1937+21, we discuss the implications of the high circular polarization of CHIME J1634+44 and conclude its emission mechanism is likely to be ``pulsar-like''. While CHIME J1634+44 has a pulse period of 841 s, its burst arrival patterns are indicative of a secondary 4206 s period, probably associated with binary activity. The timing properties suggest it has a significantly negative period derivative of $\dot{P}=-9.03(0.11)\times 10^{-12}$ s s$^{-1}$. Few systems have been known to spin-up, most notably transitional millisecond pulsars and cataclysmic binaries, both of which seem unlikely progenitors for CHIME J1634+44. If the period was only associated with the spin of the object, then the spin up is likely generated by accretion of material from a companion. If, however, the radio pulse period and the orbital period are locked, as appears to be the case for two other LPTs, the spin up of CHIME J1634+44 could be driven by gravitational wave radiation.</description>

      <title>Imaging-spectroscopy diagnosis of the giant sloshing spiral in the Virgo cluster with the Einstein Probe Follow-up X-ray Telescope</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07412v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We performed deep X-ray observations of the Virgo cluster using the Einstein Probe Follow-up X-ray Telescope (EP-FXT) with a total exposure of 295 ks. Leveraging the large field of view (FoV) and low particle background of EP-FXT, the image reveals a giant spiral feature connecting the cold fronts in the northwest and southeast, forming a coherent structure consistent with earlier results from XMM-Newton and Suzaku. We also present two-dimensional maps of temperature, metallicity, and entropy across the Virgo Cluster, covering a FoV of approximately 28.5 arcmin. These maps clearly show a spiral structure with high density, low temperature, high metallicity, and low entropy. The results support a scenario where the spiral morphology arises from gas sloshing driven by a minor merger. Additionally, EP-FXT temperature measurements agree well with XMM-Newton data within uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Circular polarization of fast radio bursts by asymmetric erosion in longitudinally magnetized plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07561v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetars are likely to be the origin of all fast radio bursts. The recent detection of circularly polarized bursts suggests that they might be generated deep inside magnetar magnetospheres. However, the mechanism behind the circular polarization remains uncertain. Here, we study the propagation of an intense radio pulse in a longitudinally magnetized electron-dominant plasma by particle-in-cell simulations. When the field strength of the radio pulse exceeds the background magnetic field, it can excite a nonlinear plasma wakefield and continually erodes due to energy transfer to the wake. Along the magnetic field, the plasma wakefield launched by the right-circularly polarized pulse is much stronger and more nonlinear than that by the left-circularly polarized pulse. Hence, the erosion rates of the two circularly polarized modes are significantly different. We discover that this asymmetric erosion can generate circularly polarized modes from a linearly polarized pulse at relativistic intensities, even when the cyclotron frequency is much higher than the radio frequency. Finally, we present a proof-of-principle simulation to demonstrate the generation of circularly polarization by this magneto-induced asymmetric erosion in the nonuniform environment of magnetar magnetospheres.</description>

      <title>Detecting Intermediate-mass Black Holes Using Miniature Pulsar Timing Arrays in Globular Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08201v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Theoretical models predict that intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) exist in globular clusters (GCs), but observational evidence remains elusive. Millisecond pulsars (MSPs), which are abundant in GCs and have served as precise probes for gravitational waves (GWs), offer a unique opportunity to detect potential IMBH binaries in GCs. Here, we consider the possibility of using multiple MSPs in a GC to form a miniature pulsar timing array (PTA), so as to take advantage of their correlated timing residuals to search for potential IMBH binaries in the same cluster. Our semi-analytical calculations reveal that nearby IMBH binaries around MSPs in GCs could induce microsecond-level timing residuals. In GCs like $\omega$ Centauri and M15, favorable configurations are found which could lead to the detection of binaries with mass ratios $q\gtrsim0.1$ and orbital periods of a few days. We estimate that future higher-precision timing programs could achieve $100$-nanosecond sensitivity, substantially expanding the searchable parameter space and establishing mini-PTAs as powerful detectors of IMBHs.</description>

      <title>Einstein Probe discovery of the short period intermediate polar EP J115415.8-501810</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08304v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The X-ray transient source EP240309a/EP\,J115415.8$-$501810 was first detected by the Wide-Field X-ray Telescope (WXT) on board Einstein Probe (EP) during the commissioning phase. Subsequent optical observations confirmed it as a Cataclysmic Variable of the intermediate polar type with a 238.2\,s spinning white dwarf in a $\sim$3.76\,hr orbit. We report on the source discovery and follow-up studies made with the Follow-up X-ray Telescope (FXT) of EP. A periodic variation of 231\,s is detected in the 0.3$-$2\,keV band, while no obvious pulsation appears in the 2$-$10\,keV band. The spectral analysis shows that the X-ray emission could be described by an absorbed bremsstrahlung model with $kT$\textgreater\,11\,keV. The partial covering absorption, with an hydrogen column density $N_H$ = 2.0$\times 10^{22}\,\rm cm^{-2}$ and covering fraction around 0.9, is much larger than the interstellar absorption along the line of sight. According to the distance $d = 309.5$\,pc obtained from Gaia parallax, we estimate that the luminosity of this source in the 0.3$-$10\,keV range is $\sim 2\times10^{32}$\,erg\,s$^{-1}$. In addition, phase-resolved spectral analysis reveals that the detected periodic variation is mainly caused by the change in the absorption column density. In this scenario the spin modulation arises due to absorption from the pre-shock accretion flow of the X-ray emitting pole, while the optical radiation is modulated at the orbital side band ($\omega_{\rm spin} - \Omega_{\rm orbit}$) due to reprocessing in regions within the binary system. Due to its unusual transient behaviour for an intermediate polar, we have also searched for radio signals similar to those observed in the new class of long period transients. We derived upper limits with ASKAP (200--300\,$\mu$Jy\,beam$^{-1}$ between 800--1500 MHz) and MWA (40--90\,mJy\,beam$^{-1}$ between 80--300 MHz).</description>

      <title>Stability of relativistic tidal response against small potential modification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.04551v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The tidal response of compact objects in an inspiraling binary system is measured by a set of tidal Love and dissipation numbers imprinted in the gravitational waveforms. While a four-dimensional black hole in vacuum within General Relativity has vanishing Love numbers, a black hole in alternative theories of gravity can acquire non-vanishing Love numbers. The dissipation numbers may quantify Planckian corrections at the horizon scale. These properties will allow a test of classical theories of gravity in the strong-field regime with gravitational-wave observation. Since black holes are not in the exact vacuum environment in astrophysical situations, the following question arises: can the environment affect the tidal response? In this paper, we investigate the stability of the tidal response of a Schwarzschild black hole for frequency-dependent tidal-field perturbations against a small modification of the background. Our analysis relies on the scattering theory, which overcomes difficulties in computing the relativistic tidal Love numbers. The tidal Love and dissipation numbers can be understood from the property of sufficiently low-frequency scattering waves. We show that the tidal Love numbers are sensitive to the property of the modification. Therefore, we need careful consideration of the environment around the black hole in assessing the deviation of the underlying theory of gravity from General Relativity with the Love numbers. The modification has less impact on the dissipation numbers, indicating that quantifying the existence of the event horizon with them is not spoiled. We also demonstrate that in a composite system, i.e., a compact object with environmental effects, the Love and dissipation numbers are approximately determined by the sum of the numbers of each component.</description>

      <title>Extracting linear and nonlinear quasinormal modes from black hole merger simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.04489v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In general relativity, when two black holes merge they produce a rotating (Kerr) black hole remnant. According to perturbation theory, the remnant emits "ringdown" radiation: a superposition of exponentials with characteristic complex frequencies that depend only on the remnant's mass and spin. While the goal of the black hole spectroscopy program is to measure the quasinormal mode frequencies, a knowledge of their amplitudes and phases is equally important to determine which modes are detectable, and possibly to perform additional consistency checks. Unlike the complex frequencies, the amplitudes and phases depend on the properties of the binary progenitors, such as the binary mass ratio and component spins. In this paper we develop a fitting algorithm designed to reliably identify the modes present in numerical simulations and to extract their amplitudes and phases. We apply the algorithm to over 500 binary black hole simulations from the public SXS numerical relativity simulation catalog, and we present fitting formulas for the resulting mode amplitudes and phases as functions of the properties of the progenitors. Crucially, our algorithm allows for the extraction of not only prograde fundamental modes and overtones, but also retrograde modes and second-order modes. We unveil interesting relations for the amplitude ratios of different modes. The fitting code and interactive versions of some of the plots are publicly available. The results presented in this paper can be updated as more and better simulations become available.</description>

      <title>Cosmic-Ray Feedback from Supernovae in a Parker-Unstable Medium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12249v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Supernova energy drives interstellar medium (ISM) turbulence and can help launch galactic winds. What difference does it make if $10\%$ of the energy is initially deposited into cosmic rays? To answer this question and study cosmic-ray feedback, we perform galactic patch simulations of a stratified ISM. We compare two magnetohydrodynamic and cosmic ray (MHD+CR) simulations, which are identical except for how each supernova's energy is injected. In one, $10\%$ of the energy is injected as cosmic-ray energy. In the other case, energy injection is strictly thermal and kinetic. We find that cosmic-ray injections drive a faster, hotter, and more massive outflow long after the injections occur. Both simulations show the formation of cold clouds (with a total mass fraction $&gt;50\%$) through the Parker instability and thermal instability. The Parker instability simultaneously produces high mass loading factors $\eta &gt; 10^3$ as it requires few supernovae. We also show how the Parker instability naturally leads to a decorrelation of cosmic-ray pressure and gas density. This decorrelation leads to a significant decrease in the calorimetric fraction for injected cosmic rays, but it depends on having a highly resolved magnetic field.</description>

Abstract: According to the giant impact theory, the Moon formed through accreting the debris disk produced by a collision between Theia and the proto-Earth, and the predicted lunar orbital inclination relative to the Earth's equatorial plane is about within one degree when Moon formed. However, the current lunar orbital inclination requires the Moon's orbital inclination relative to the Earth's equator to be about ten degrees when traced back to the time of lunar formation. We show that, after explaining Earth-Moon isotopic similarity in the framework of the canonical giant impact theory, gravitational tidal interaction between Earth and the two moons with negligible orbital inclination could lead to the merger of the two moons with newly formed moon's orbital inclination relative to Earth's equator exceeding 10 degrees.</description>

      <title>Multispacecraft Observations of the 2024 September 9 Backside Solar Eruption that Resulted in a Sustained Gamma Ray Emission Event</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23852v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report on the 2024 September 9 sustained gamma ray emission (SGRE) event observed by the Large Area Telescope (LAT) onboard the Fermi satellite. The event was associated with a backside solar eruption observed by multiple spacecraft such as the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO), Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO), Parker Solar Probe (PSP), Solar Orbiter (SolO), Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), Wind, and GOES, and by ground based radio telescopes. Fermi LAT observed the SGRE after the EUV wave from the backside eruption crossed the limb to the frontside of the Sun. SolO's Spectrometer Telescope for Imaging X rays (STIX) imaged an intense (X3.3) flare, which occurred about 41 deg behind the east limb, from heliographic coordinates S13E131. Forward modeling of the CME flux rope revealed that it impulsively accelerated (3.54 km/s/s) to attain a peak speed of 2162 km/s. SolO's energetic particle detectors (EPD) observed protons up to about 1 GeV from the extended shock and electrons that produced a complex type II burst and possibly type III bursts. The durations of SGRE and type II burst are consistent with the linear relation between these quantities obtained from longer duration (&gt;3 hours) SGRE events. All these observations are consistent with an extended shock surrounding the CME flux rope, which is the likely source of high energy protons required for the SGRE event. We compare this event with six other BTL SGRE eruptions and find that they are all consistent with energetic shock driving CMEs. We also find a significant east west asymmetry (3:1) in the BTL source locations.</description>

Abstract: We construct a static, spherically symmetric black hole (BH) solution embedded within a dark matter (DM) halo, formulated as a non-vacuum extension of the Schwarzschild spacetime. The DM distribution is modeled via an empirical density profile calibrated to observations of the elliptical galaxy NGC 4649 (M60), incorporating Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging, stellar velocity dispersion data, and globular cluster dynamics. The resultant spacetime metric depends on three independent parameters: the black hole mass $M$, the asymptotic circular velocity $V_c$, and the halo scale radius $a$, and smoothly reduces to the Schwarzschild limit as $V_c \to 0$ and $a \to 0$. We analyze the influence of the halo on key geometric and physical quantities, including the event horizon radius, photon sphere, shadow size, and curvature invariants. The Kretschmann scalar exhibits an enhanced sensitivity to halo-induced modifications, particularly in the near-horizon regime. Thermodynamic properties of the solution are also examined. In the extremal limit, characterized by a vanishing surface gravity, the model supports a finite tangential pressure, implying a non-trivial extension of standard black hole thermodynamics. These results highlight the relevance of incorporating astrophysical environments into BH modeling and offer new avenues for testing strong-field gravity through precision observational data.</description>

      <title>Theoretical modeling of approximate universality of tidally deformed neutron stars</title>

Abstract: Quasi-universal relations are known to exist among various neutron star observables that do not depend sensitively on the underlying nuclear matter equations of state. For example, some of these relations imply that the tidally induced multipole moments are approximately characterized by the electric-type quadrupolar tidal deformability. Such relations can be used to reduce the number of independent tidal parameters in gravitational-waveform modeling, thereby allowing us to infer extreme nuclear matter properties more accurately and test General Relativity in an insensitive manner to uncertainties in nuclear physics. We present a comprehensive theoretical investigation into approximate universality of neutron stars. Our approach employs a semi-analytic relativistic stellar interior model, which extends the Tolman VII solution, thereby enabling a refined exploration of the tidal properties of nonrotating stars within a semi-analytic framework. The derived power-law relations among various tidal deformabilities -- referred to as the universal Love relations -- agree well with expressions in previous work found empirically. We elucidate how the equation-of-state dependence is suppressed in a particular combination of macroscopic physical parameters induced by perturbations and demonstrate that the relation between the moment of inertia and electric-type quadrupolar tidal deformability (I-Love relation) rests on the same underlying mechanism. Our findings indicate that the approximate universality of neutron stars can be attributed to low compressibility, consistent with some of the previous studies on the possible origin of the universality.</description>

      <title>RGE effects on new physics searches via gravitational waves</title>

Abstract: Gravitational wave (GW) observations offer a promising probe of new physics associated with a first-order electroweak phase transition. Precision studies of the Higgs potential, including Fisher matrix analyses, have been extensively conducted in this context. However, significant theoretical uncertainties in the GW spectrum, particularly those due to renormalization scale dependence in the conventional daisy-resummed approach, have cast doubt on the reliability of such precision measurements. These uncertainties have been highlighted using the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) as a benchmark. To address these issues, we revisit Fisher matrix analyses based on the daisy-resummed approach, explicitly incorporating renormalization scale uncertainties. We then reassess the prospects for precise new physics measurements using GW observations. Adopting the SMEFT as a benchmark, we study the effects of one-loop RGE running of dimension-six operators on the Higgs effective potential via the Higgs self-couplings, top Yukawa coupling, and gauge couplings, in addition to the SMEFT tree-level effects. We find that future GW observations can remain sensitive to various dimension-six SMEFT effects, even in the presence of renormalization scale uncertainties, provided that the SMEFT $(H^{\dagger}H)^3$ operator is precisely measured, e.g., by future collider experiments.</description>

      <title>Fully general relativistic description of rapidly-rotating axially-symmetric neutron stars for constraining nuclear matter equations of state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20990</link>

Abstract: Background: Constraining the nuclear matter equation of state (EoS) from neutron star observations is one of the main subjects in nuclear physics today. In general, neutron stars rotate rapidly and structure of neutron stars can be affected, especially in millisecond pulsars. To better constrain the nuclear EoS, it is important to describe neutron star structure taking into account the effects of rotation in a fully relativistic manner. Purpose: In this study, we investigate the internal structure of neutron stars under the influence of rotation. We explore correlations between rotational effects and EoS parameters, based on realistic calculations of rapidly rotating neutron stars based on the KEH method, which provides stable solutions for axially symmetric rotating equilibrium configurations. Results: Using 5 different Skyrme EoS parameter sets, we find that the maximum angular frequency achievable by rotating neutron stars, as calculated via the KEH method, varies depending on the stiffness of the equation of state. We confirm that an increase in the rotating frequency leads to an overall increase in both the mass and radius along the M-R curve. By performing calculations at two frequently referenced neutron stars, we further examine how the changes in mass and radius correlate with the nuclear matter properties at saturation density. Our results suggest that the 716Hz rotational constraint may require a more conservative interpretation when accounting for realistic stellar deformation effects. Conclusions: To place stringent constraints on the nuclear EoS based on observational data, it is sometimes essential to account for the effects of rotation in neutron star models. In particular, the influence of rotation becomes increasingly significant at higher spin frequencies and cannot be neglected in rapidly rotating systems with $&gt;$400Hz.</description>

      <title>Bright ring features and polarization structures in Kerr-Sen black hole images illuminated by radiatively inefficient accretion flows</title>

Abstract: We have investigated the bright ring-like features and polarization structures
  in the Kerr-Sen black hole's images based on general relativistic radiative transfer (GRRT) simulations, which are illuminated by the 230 GHz thermal synchrotron emission from the radiatively inefficient accretion flows (RIAF). Using the REx method, we extracted the bright ring from the black hole images and found that both the bright ring and black hole shadow shrink as the dilation parameter increases. Combing with the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observational data of SgrA*, we present the allowed ranges of black hole parameters for different observed inclinations and disk thicknesses. Our results show that effects of the disk thickness on the allowed parameter space are more strong than those of the observed inclination. We also probe the rotational symmetry of EVPA in the polarization structure of the black hole images by analyzing the coefficient $\beta_2$. The dilaton parameter results in that the real part $Re\beta_2$ increases and the imaginary part $Im\beta_2$ decreases, but the magnitude $|\beta_2|$ generally exhibits a declining trend. Finally, we find that effects of the disk thickness on $\beta_2$ are much weaker than those from the dilaton parameter.</description>
