      <title>Instrumental Polarization in Stellar Coronagraphy: Coherent Behavior and its Implications for Dark Hole Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar coronagraphs designed for high-contrast imaging of exoplanets inevitably introduce a small amount of instrumental polarization, called \emph{secondary polarization}. At the contrast levels required to detect and characterize terrestrial planets, these effects may become significant. Instrumentally induced polarization is often referred to as ``incoherent," yet this use of the term lacks rigor. This work uses Jones calculus and vector field simulations, including interactions with dielectric surfaces to show that the secondary polarization is fully coherent with the input field, but it does not interfere with it due to orthogonality. A key consequence of the coherence secondary polarization is that the process of creating a dark hole in the primary polarization tends to also significantly mitigate the intensity corresponding to the secondary polarization, called the \emph{secondary intensity}, in the dark hole region. This reduction of the secondary intensity may lead to relaxed polarization design requirements in future coronagraphs. Additionally, if the contrast is sufficient to make the secondary intensity non-negligible, modulation schemes to separate the planet from the instrumental light need to account for the modulation of the secondary intensity.</description>

      <title>The Subaru-Asahi StarCam: Description of the system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Subaru-Asahi StarCam is a high-sensitivity live-streaming camera for meteor observation, installed on the dome of the Subaru Telescope at the summit area of Maunakea, Hawai'i. Although it was originally intended to share the Maunakea night sky with the public, including the local Hawai'i community, the system quickly demonstrated its potential for scientific research, owing to its highly sensitive video capabilities and the exceptional fraction of clear nights at the site. The core of the StarCam system features a Sony FX3 camera body paired with an F1.4 wide-angle lens, offering a field of view of 70 deg by 40 deg. Leveraging a state-of-the-art, high-sensitivity CMOS sensor and a bright lens, the system is capable of capturing stars as faint as magnitude 8 in real-time, with an effective frame rate of 15--30 fps. Live streaming via YouTube began in April 2021, and the feed is constantly monitored by more than a hundred viewers at any given nighttime. This has enabled the camera to be used not only for observing regular meteor showers but also for monitoring scientifically important phenomena such as fireballs or unexpected meteor outbursts. Notable scientific achievements include: 1) Detection of the new Arid meteor shower in 2021, 2) Identification of a sub-peak activity in the Gamma-Perseid meteor shower (2021), 3) Detection of the 2022 Tau-Herculid meteor shower outburst, 4) Confirmation of the activity of the Andromedid meteor shower (2021), and 5) Multiple detections of meteor cluster phenomena. We discuss the potential and the future scope of StarCam as an open-access, real-time data platform for citizen science in meteor observations.</description>

      <title>Development of Space Qualified Signal Processing Readout Electronics for HabWorlds and Origins Space Telescope Detector and Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO), a flagship ultraviolet/optical/infrared space telescope recommended by the National Academies' Pathways to Discovery in Astronomy and Astrophysics, will require detector technologies capable of supporting significantly larger pixel-count arrays than previous missions. Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detectors (MKIDs), naturally suited to microwave multiplexing readout, are already in use across several balloon-borne missions with FPGA-based systems. To transition this capability to space, we are developing a radiation-hardened detector readout system that builds directly on the technical and environmental requirements defined by the PRIMA mission. PRIMA serves as a critical pathfinder, informing the radiation tolerance, resource constraints, and on-board processing capabilities needed for HWO. In this work, we present our current results on algorithm implementation, hardware architecture, and firmware development using the radiation-hardened AMD Kintex Ultrascale FPGA, aligning with PRIMA's stringent specifications to ensure compatibility with future space-based observatories like HWO.</description>

      <title>Noise Reduction Method for Radio Astronomy Single Station Observation Based on Wavelet Transform and Mathematical Morphology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 21 cm radiation of neutral hydrogen provides crucial information for studying the early universe and its evolution. To advance this research, countries have made significant investments in constructing large low-frequency radio telescope arrays, such as the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) and the Square Kilometre Array Phase 1 Low Frequency (SKA1-low). These instruments are pivotal for radio astronomy research. However, challenges such as ionospheric plasma interference, ambient radio noise, and instrument-related effects have become increasingly prominent, posing major obstacles in cosmology research. To address these issues, this paper proposes an efficient signal processing method that combines wavelet transform and mathematical morphology. The method involves the following steps: Background Subtraction: Background interference in radio observation signals is eliminated. Wavelet Transform: The signal, after removing background noise, undergoes a two-dimensional discrete wavelet transform. Threshold processing is then applied to the wavelet coefficients to effectively remove interference components. Wavelet Inversion: The processed signal is reconstructed using wavelet inversion. Mathematical Morphology: The reconstructed signal is further optimized using mathematical morphology to refine the results. Experimental verification was conducted using solar observation data from the Xinjiang Observatory and the Yunnan Observatory. The results demonstrate that this method successfully removes interference signals while preserving useful signals, thus improving the accuracy of radio astronomy observations and reducing the impact of radio frequency interference (RFI).</description>

      <title>Prototype Development and Calibration of the CUbesat Solar Polarimeter (CUSP)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The space-based CUbesat Solar Polarimeter (CUSP) mission aims to measure the linear polarization of solar flares in the hard X-ray band by means of a Compton scattering polarimeter. CUSP will allow to study the magnetic reconnection and particle acceleration in the flaring magnetic structures of our star with its unprecedented sensitivity to solar flare polarization. CUSP is a project in the framework of the Alcor Program of the Italian Space Agency aimed to develop new CubeSat missions. It has been proposed as a constellation of a two Cubesat mission to monitor the Sun for Space Weather, and will proceed with a single-satellite asset in its baseline implementation.
  In the frame of CUSP's Phase B study, that started in December 2024 for a 1-year period, we present the development status of this dual-phase polarimeter. Preliminary laboratory results using two chains of acquisition will be discussed. The first chain of acquisition, based on the Hamamatsu R7600 multi-anode photomultiplier tubes coupled to plastic scintillator bars and read out by the MAROC-3A ASIC, is used to detect the Compton scattering of incoming photons. On the other hand, GAGG crystals coupled to avalanche photo-diodes with a readout based on the SKIROC-2A ASIC are used to absorb the scattered photons. By reconstructing the azimuthal scattering direction for many incoming photons, one can infer the linear polarization degree and angle of the source. We will discuss the calibration results obtained with our prototype detector by using well-known radioactive isotopes, allowing us to assess the performances of our detector over the full 25-100 keV energy range.</description>

      <title>Study of the HV power supply modules for the CUbesat Solar Polarimeter (CUSP)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The CUbesat Solar Polarimeter (CUSP) project is a CubeSat mission orbiting the Earth aimed to measure the linear polarization of solar flares in the hard X-ray band by means of a Compton scattering polarimeter. CUSP will allow to study the magnetic reconnection and particle acceleration in the flaring magnetic structures of our star. CUSP is a project in the framework of the Alcor Program of the Italian Space Agency aimed to develop new CubeSat missions. CUSP undergoing the Phase B started in December 2024 that will last for 12 month. The Compton polarimeter of the CUSP payload performs coincidence measurements between plastic scintilaltors and GaGG(Ce) crystals to derive the polarization of X-rays. These sensors are readout by Multi Anode Photomultiplier Tubes (MAPMTs) and Avalanche Photodiodes (APDs) respectively. Both sensors need an HV power supply up to -1~kV (for the MAPMT) and +500~V (for the APD). We tested precision regulated High Voltage DC/DC Converters by HVM Technology Inc. with Sub-Miniature Case Size ($0.85''\times0.85''\times0.60''$) of the SMHV series. These modules are compact and suited for CubeSat missions.</description>

      <title>Measuring Local Turbulence Along the Optical Path: Multi-beam Optical Seeing Sensor (MOSS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deflection of light along the optical path is a major source of image degradation for ground-based telescopes. Methods have been developed to measure upper atmospheric seeing based on models of the turbulence in the atmosphere, but due to boundary conditions, transmission within telescope enclosures is more complex. The Multi-beam Optical Seeing Sensor (MOSS) directly measures the component of the image quality degradation from inhomogeneity of the index of refraction within the telescope dome. MOSS outputs four near-parallel beams of light that travel along the optical path and are imaged by the telescope's detector, landing like starlight on the telescope's focal plane. By using a strobed light source, we can 'freeze' the instantaneous index variations transverse to the optical path. This system captures both 'dome' and 'mirror' seeing. Through plotting the standard deviation of differential motion between pairs of beams, MOSS enables characterization of the length scale of turbulence within the dome. The temporal coherence of temperature gradients can be probed with different pulse lengths, and the spatial coherence by comparing pairs at different separations across the aperture of the telescope. Optical path turbulence measurements, alongside other telemetry metrics, will guide thermal and airflow management to optimize image quality. A MOSS prototype was installed in the 1.2 meter Auxiliary Telescope (AuxTel) at the Vera C. Rubin Observatory in Chile, and preliminary data constrain the optical path turbulence with a lower bound of 1.4 arcseconds. The optical path turbulence varied throughout the night of observing.</description>

      <title>Exploration of groups and outliers in Gaia RVS stellar spectra with metric learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Gaia mission is transforming our view of the Milky Way by providing distances towards a billion stars, and much more. The third data release includes nearly a million spectra from its Radial Velocity Spectrometer (RVS). Identifying unexpected features in such vast datasets presents a significant challenge. It is impossible to visually inspect all of the spectra and difficult to analyze them in a comprehensive way. In order to supplement traditional analysis approaches, and in order to facilitate deeper insights from these spectra, we present a new dataset together with an interactive portal that applies established self-supervised metric learning techniques, dimensionality reduction, and anomaly detection, to allow researchers to visualize, analyze, and interact with the Gaia RVS spectra in straightforward but under-utilized manner. We demonstrate a few example interactions with the dataset, examining groupings and the most unusual RVS spectra, according to our metric. This combination of methodology and public availability enables broader exploration, and may reveal yet-to-be-discovered stellar phenomena.</description>

      <title>Artificial Broadcasts as Galactic Populations: III. Constraints on Radio Broadcasts from the Cosmic Population of Inhabited Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Any population of artificial radio broadcasts in a galaxy contributes to its integrated radio luminosity. If this radio emission is bright enough, inhabited galaxies themselves form a cosmic population of artificial radio galaxies. We can detect these broadcasts individually or set constraints from their collective emission. Using the formalism in Paper I and II, I set bounds on the artificial radio galaxy population using both of these methodologies. Measured radio source counts set limits on radio broadcasts across the radio spectrum, including the first Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) constraints at ~250 GHz. I compare these with commensal limits from background galaxies in the fields of large SETI surveys. The field limits are more powerful, but generally only over a limited luminosity range and for frequencies with dedicated SETI surveys. The limits are weaker when broadcasts clump into discrete hosts that are themselves extremely rare. I find that the abundance of Kardashev Type III radio broadcast populations is less than one in 10^17 stars, about one in a million large galaxies. I also examine limits for a power-law distribution in broadcast luminosity.</description>

      <title>Unlocking New Paths for Science with Extreme-Mass-Ratio Inspirals: Machine Learning-Enhanced MCMC for Accurate Parameter Inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detection of gravitational waves from extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) in space-borne antennas like LISA and Taiji promises deep insights into strong-field gravity and black hole astrophysics. However, the complex, non-convex likelihood landscapes of EMRI signals (compounded by instrumental noises) have long hindered reliable parameter estimation based on traditional Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, which often fail to escape local optima or require impractical computational costs. To address this critical bottleneck, we introduce Flow-Matching Markov Chain Monte Carlo (FM-MCMC), a pioneering Bayesian framework that synergizes continuous normalizing flows (CNFs) with parallel tempering MCMC (PTMCMC). By leveraging CNFs to rapidly explore high-dimensional parameter spaces and PTMCMC for precise posterior sampling, FM-MCMC achieves unprecedented efficiency and accuracy in recovering EMRI intrinsic parameters. By enabling real-time, unbiased parameter inference, FM-MCMC unlocks the full scientific potential of EMRI observations, and would serve as a scalable pipeline for precision gravitational-wave astronomy.</description>

      <title>Using tunable coherence for reaching micrometer coherence lengths and suppressing stray light in a power-recycled Michelson interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By reentering into laser interferometers, scattered or stray light introduces non-linear noise. This is a major limitation of precision interferometers as preventing such parasitic light is nearly impossible. Thus, substantial effort is put into mitigating the reentering of these fields in various ways. Ground-based laser interferometric gravitational wave detectors employ such mitigation techniques to reduce otherwise restrictive stray light noise. However, they are now reaching sensitivities where conventional mitigation techniques reach limitations. Further improvements planed for future observatories are placing even more demanding constraints on tolerable stray light power. We previously presented tunable coherence as a possible technique to ease these constraints and suppress unwanted coherent interference. For these promising demonstrations, the remaining coherence length and achievable suppression in length-constrained layouts was limited, among other things, by the used pseudo-random-noise phase modulation frequency. In this work, we demonstrate stray light suppression and cavity performance at modulation frequencies up to 10 GHz. This reduces the remaining coherence to a few centimeter in an interferometer, and even to the scale of the laser wavelength in a cavity. We further present a first demonstration of tunable coherence in a power-recycled Michelson interferometer, successfully suppressing stray light in a more complex topology.</description>

      <title>A normalizing flow approach for the inference of star cluster properties from unresolved broadband photometry I: Comparison to spectral energy distribution fitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimating properties of star clusters from unresolved broadband photometry is a challenging problem that is classically tackled by spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting methods that are based on simple stellar population (SSP) models. However, because of their exponential scaling, grid-based methods suffer from computational limitations. In addition, stochastic latent variables in the model can make the computation of the likelihood function intractable. These limitations can be overcome by modern generative deep learning methods that offer flexible and powerful tools for modeling high-dimensional posterior distributions and fast inference from learned data. We present a normalizing flow approach for the inference of cluster age, mass, and reddening from Hubble Space Telescope (HST) broadband photometry. In particular, we explore our network's behavior on an inference problem that has been analyzed in previous works. We used the SED modeling code CIGALE to create a dataset of synthetic photometric observations for $5 \times 10^6$ mock star clusters. Subsequently, this data set was used to train a coupling-based flow in the form of a conditional invertible neural network (cINN) to predict posterior probability distributions for cluster age, mass, and reddening from photometric observations. We predicted cluster parameters for the 'Physics at High Angular resolution in Nearby GalaxieS' (PHANGS) Data Release 3 catalog. To evaluate the capabilities of the network, we compared our results to the publicly available PHANGS estimates and found that the estimates agree reasonably well. We demonstrate that normalizing flow methods can be a viable tool for the inference of cluster parameters, and argue that this approach is especially useful when latent variables make the computation of the likelihood intractable and in scenarios that require efficient density estimation.</description>

      <title>CUbesat Solar Polarimeter (CUSP) Sensitivity Estimation and Performance Optimization using Geant4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The CUbesat Solar Polarimeter (CUSP) aims to measure the linear polarization of solar flares in the 25-100 keV X-ray band using a Compton scattering polarimeter. CUSP will allow us to study the magnetic reconnection and particle acceleration in the flaring magnetic structures of our star by providing high-sensitivity polarization measurements. CUSP is a project in the framework of the Alcor Program of the Italian Space Agency aimed to develop innovative CubeSat technologies and missions. As part of CUSPs Phase B study, which began in December 2024 and will continue for one year, we present the development status of the Geant4 based simulator to accurately simulate the detectors response and initial results on the sensitivity of the instrument. Geant4 Monte Carlo simulation is used to assess the physical interactions of the source photons with the detector and the passive materials. We implemented a detailed CUSP Mass Model within Geant4 to simulate and estimate the instruments sensitivity, correcting the geometric effects of the instrument. We also evaluated the effect of backscattering shielding on the sensitivity to optimize the mass model of the instrument.</description>

      <title>Starkiller: subtracting stars and other sources from IFU spectroscopic data through forward modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14705v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present starkiller, an open-source Python package for forward-modeling flux retrieval from integral field unit spectrograph (IFU) datacubes. Starkiller simultaneously provides stellar spectral classification, relative velocity, and line-of-sight extinction for all sources in a catalog, alongside a source-subtracted datacube. It performs synthetic difference imaging by simulating all catalog sources in the field of view, using the catalog for positions and fluxes to scale stellar models, independent of the datacube. This differencing method is particularly powerful for subtracting both point-sources and trailed or even streaked sources from extended astronomical objects. We demonstrate starkiller's effectiveness in improving observations of extended sources in dense stellar fields for VLT/MUSE observations of comets, asteroids and nebulae. We also show that starkiller can treat satellite-impacted VLT/MUSE observations. The package could be applied to tasks as varied as dust extinction in clusters and stellar variability; the stellar modeling using Gaia fluxes is provided as a standalone function. The techniques can be expanded to imagers and to other IFUs.</description>

      <title>VEGA: Voids idEntification using Genetic Algorithm</title>

Abstract: Cosmic voids are large, nearly empty regions that lie between the web of galaxies, filaments and walls, and are recognized for their extensive applications in the field of cosmology and astrophysics. Despite their significance, a universal definition of voids remains unsettled as various void-finding methods identify different types of voids, each differing in shape and density, based on the method that were used. In this paper, we present VEGA, a novel algorithm for void identification. VEGA utilizes Voronoi tessellation to divide the dataset space into spatial cells and applies the Convex Hull algorithm to estimate the volume of each cell. It then integrates Genetic Algorithm analysis with luminosity density contrast to filter out over-dense cells and retain the remaining ones, referred to as void block cells. These filtered cells form the basis for constructing the final void structures. VEGA operates on a grid of points, which increases the algorithm's spatial accessibility to the dataset and facilitates the identification of seed points around which the algorithm constructs the voids. To evaluate VEGA's performance, we applied both VEGA and the Aikio M\"ah\"onen method to the same test dataset. We compared the resulting void populations in terms of their luminosity and number density contrast, as well as their morphological features such as sphericity. This comparison demonstrated that the VEGA void finding method yields reliable results and can be effectively applied to various particle distributions.</description>

      <title>ODS: A self-reporting system for radio telescopes to coexist with adaptive satellite constellations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15068v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellations bring broadband internet and cellular service to the most remote locations on the planet. Unfortunately, many of these locations also host some of the world's best optical and radio astronomy (RA) observatories. With the number of LEO satellites expected to increase by an order of magnitude in the upcoming decade, satellite downlink radio frequency interference (RFI) is a growing concern in protected radio-quiet areas like the United States National Radio Quiet Zone. When these satellites transmit in the spectrum near protected RA bands, undesired out-of-band emission can leak into these protected bands and impact scientific observations. In this paper, we present a self-reporting system - Operational Data Sharing (ODS) - which enables mutual awareness by publishing radio telescopes' operational information to a protected database that is available to satellite operators through a representational state transfer application programming interface (REST API). Satellite operators can use the ODS data to adapt their downlink tasking algorithms in real time to avoid overwhelming sensitive RA facilities, particularly, through the novel Telescope Boresight Avoidance (TBA) technique. Preliminary results from recent experiments between the NRAO and the SpaceX Starlink teams demonstrate the effectiveness of the ODS and TBA in reducing downlink RFI in the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array's observations in the 1990-1995 MHz and 10.7-12.7 GHz bands. This automated ODS system is beginning to be implemented by other RA facilities and could be utilized by other satellite operators in the near future.</description>

      <title>TESSELLATE: Piecing Together the Variable Sky With TESS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16905v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present TESSELLATE, a dedicated pipeline for performing an untargeted search documenting all variable phenomena captured by the TESS space telescope. Building on the TESSreduce difference imaging pipeline, TESSELLATE extracts calibrated and reduced photometric data for every full frame image in the TESS archive. Using this data, we systematically identify transient, variable and non-sidereal signals across timescales ranging from minutes to weeks. The high cadence and wide field of view of TESS enables us to conduct a comprehensive search of the entire sky to a depth of ~17 $m_i$. Based on the volumetric rates for known fast transients, we expect there to be numerous Fast Blue Optical Transients and Gamma Ray Burst afterglows present in the existing TESS dataset. Beyond transients, TESSELLATE can also identify new variable stars and exoplanet candidates, and recover known asteroids. We classify events using machine learning techniques and the work of citizen scientists via the Zooniverse Cosmic Cataclysms project. Finally, we introduce the TESSELLATE Sky Survey: a complete, open catalog of the variable sky observed by TESS.</description>

Abstract: Will it be possible in the future to realize large, complex space missions dedicated to basic science like HST, Chandra and JWST? Or will their cost be too great? Today's space scene is completely different from that of even five years ago, and certainly from that of the time when HST, Chandra and JWST were conceived and built. Space-related investments have grown exponentially in recent years, with a monetary investment exceeding half a trillion dollars per year since 2023. This boom is greatly aided by the rise of the so-called 'new space' economy driven by private commercial funding, which for the first time last year surpassed public investments in space. The establishment of a market logic to space activities results in more competition and a resulting dramatic cost and schedule reduction. Can space science take advantage of the benefits of the new space economy to reduce cost and development time and at the same time succeed in producing powerful missions in basic science? The prospects for Europe and the United States are considered here. We argue that this goal would be achievable if the scientific community could take advantage of the three pillars underlying the innovation of the new space economy: (1) technology innovation proceeding through both incremental innovation and disruptive innovation, (2) business innovation, through vertical integration, scale production, and service-oriented business model, and (3) cultural innovation, through openness to risk and iterative development.</description>

      <title>radio-llava: Advancing Vision-Language Models for Radio Astronomical Source Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23859v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The advent of next-generation radio telescopes is set to transform radio astronomy by producing massive data volumes that challenge traditional processing methods. Deep learning techniques have shown strong potential in automating radio analysis tasks, yet are often constrained by the limited availability of large annotated datasets. Recent progress in self-supervised learning has led to foundational radio vision models, but adapting them for new tasks typically requires coding expertise, limiting their accessibility to a broader astronomical community. Text-based AI interfaces offer a promising alternative by enabling task-specific queries and example-driven learning. In this context, Large Language Models (LLMs), with their remarkable zero-shot capabilities, are increasingly used in scientific domains. However, deploying large-scale models remains resource-intensive, and there is a growing demand for AI systems that can reason over both visual and textual data in astronomical analysis. This study explores small-scale Vision-Language Models (VLMs) as AI assistants for radio astronomy, combining LLM capabilities with vision transformers. We fine-tuned the LLaVA VLM on a dataset of 59k radio images from multiple surveys, enriched with 38k image-caption pairs from the literature. The fine-tuned models show clear improvements over base models in radio-specific tasks, achieving ~30% F1-score gains in extended source detection, but they underperform vision-only classifiers and exhibit ~20% drop on general multimodal tasks. Inclusion of caption data and LoRA fine-tuning enhances instruction-following and helps recover ~10% accuracy on multimodal benchmarks. This work lays the foundation for future advancements in radio VLMs, highlighting their potential and limitations, such as the need for better multimodal alignment, higher-quality datasets, and mitigation of catastrophic forgetting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19870v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Instrumental artefacts, such as glitches, can significantly compromise the scientific output of LISA. Our methodology employs advanced Bayesian techniques, including Reversible Jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo and parallel tempering to find and characterize glitches and astrophysical signals. The robustness of the pipeline is demonstrated through its ability to simultaneously handle diverse glitch morphologies and it is validated with a 'Spritz'-type data set from the LISA Data Challenge. Our approach enables accurate inference on Massive Black Hole Binaries, while simultaneously characterizing both instrumental artefacts and noise. These results present a significant development in strategies for differentiating between instrumental noise and astrophysical signals, which will ultimately improve the accuracy and reliability of source population analyses with LISA.</description>

      <title>How Many Times Should We Matched Filter Gravitational Wave Data? A Comparison of GstLAL's Online and Offline Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23959v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Searches for gravitational waves from compact binary coalescences employ a process called matched filtering, in which gravitational wave strain data is cross-correlated against a bank of waveform templates. Data from every observing run of the LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA collaboration is typically analyzed in this way twice, first in a low-latency mode in which gravitational wave candidates are identified in near-real time, and later in a high-latency mode. Such high-latency analyses have traditionally been considered more sensitive, since background data from the full observing run is available for assigning significance to all candidates, as well as more robust, since they do not need to worry about keeping up with live data. In this work, we present a novel technique to use the matched filtering data products from a low-latency analysis and re-process them by assigning significances in a high-latency way, effectively removing the need to perform matched filtering a second time. To demonstrate the efficacy of our method, we analyze 38 days of LIGO and Virgo data from the third observing run (O3) using the GstLAL pipeline, and show that our method is as sensitive and reliable as a traditional high-latency analysis. Since matched filtering represents the vast majority of computing time for a traditional analysis, our method greatly reduces the time and computational burden required to produce the same results as a traditional high-latency analysis. Consequently, it has already been adopted by GstLAL for the fourth observing run (O4) of the LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA collaboration.</description>

      <title>New Methods for Offline GstLAL Analyses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06497v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present new methods implemented in the GstLAL offline gravitational wave search. These include a technique to reuse the matched filtering data products from a GstLAL online analysis, which hugely reduces the time and computational resources required to obtain offline results; a technique to combine these results with a separate search for heavier black hole mergers, enabling detections from a larger set of gravitational wave sources; changes to the likelihood ratio which increases the sensitivity of the analysis; and two separate changes to the background estimation, allowing more precise significance estimation of gravitational wave candidates. Some of these methods increase the sensitivity of the analysis, whereas others correct previous mis-estimations of sensitivity by eliminating false positives. These methods have been adopted for GstLAL's offline results during the fourth observing run of LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA (O4). To test these new methods, we perform an offline analysis over one chunk of O3 data, lasting from May 12 19:36:42 UTC 2019 to May 21 14:45:08 UTC 2019, and compare it with previous GstLAL results over the same period of time. We show that cumulatively these methods afford around a 50% - 100% increase in sensitivity in the highest mass space, while simultaneously increasing the reliability of results, and making them more reusable and computationally cheaper.</description>
