      <title>Role of structural biaxiality on the phase behaviour of chiral liquid crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a computer simulation study on the effect of molecular structural biaxiality in the phase formation of chiral molecules. In this study, we have done coarse-grained modeling to observe self-assembled phase behavior. In our molecular dynamics simulation study we varied both the chiral interaction strength and molecular biaxiality. Uniaxial molecules give rise to cholesteric phase, blue phase whereas molecular biaxiality favours cholesteric phase. At higher chirality, small chiral domains are formed creating twisted cylindrical networks with each cylinder having elliptical cross-sections instead of circular nature as found in uniaxial systems. The value of cholesteric pitch decreases when chirality and molecular biaxiality becomes higher. Coaction of biaxiality and chirality is crucial for fabricating liquid crystal materials with optical properties suitable for displays, sensors and chiral photonic devices.</description>

      <title>Brownian Dynamics Simulations of Inclusions in an Active Fluid Bath</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We carry out two-dimensional Brownian dynamics simulations of the behavior of rigid inclusion particles immersed in an active fluid bath. The active fluid is modeled as a collection of self-propelled circular disks interacting via a soft repulsive potential and a nematic alignment interaction. The fluid is characterized by its nematic order, polar order and orientational correlation length. The active fluid bath transitions from the isotropic to the nematic phase with increasing number density, increasing nematic interaction strength or increasing P\'eclet number. The inclusion particles are modeled as rigid assemblies of passive circular disks. Four types of inclusions are considered: a rod-like $I$ shape, a boomerang-like $L$ shape, and stair-like shapes $Z$ and $Z^*$, with opposite handedness. When inclusions are introduced into the active fluid bath, their diffusion is significantly enhanced by the force and torque exerted by the active fluid particles and the chiral inclusion particles exhibit constant rotational drift. These diffusion and rotation enhancements increase as the swimming speed of the active fluid particles increases. The translational motion of the inclusion particles also couples with their orientational motion, and the correlation is modulated by the active fluid particles' swimming speed. This work paves the way for future simulations of inclusions in active fluid baths and suggests potential avenues for controlling transport properties in active materials.</description>

      <title>Accelerated snapping of slender beams under lateral forcing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hysteretic snapping under lateral forcing of a compressed, buckled beam is fundamental for many devices and mechanical metamaterials. For a single-tip lateral pusher, an important limitation is that snapping requires the pusher to cross the centerline of the beam. Here, we show that dual-tip pushers allow accelerated snapping, where the beam snaps before the pusher reaches the centerline. As a consequence, we show that when a buckled beam under increased compression comes in contact with a dual-tip pusher, it can snap to the opposite direction -- this is impossible with a single-tip pusher. Additionally, we reveal a novel two-step snapping regime, in which the beam sequentially loses contact with the two tips of the dual-tip pusher. To characterize this class of snapping instabilities, we employ a systematic modal expansion of the beam shape. This expansion allows us to capture and analyze the transition from one-step to two-step snapping geometrically. Finally we demonstrate how to maximize the distance between the pusher and the beam's centerline at the moment of snapping. Together, our work opens up a new avenue for quantitatively and qualitatively controlling and modifying the snapping of buckled beams, with potential applications in mechanical sensors, actuators, and metamaterials.</description>

      <title>Inferring activity from the flow field around active colloidal particles using deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active colloidal particles create flow around them due to non-equilibrium process on their surfaces. In this paper, we infer the activity of such colloidal particles from the flow field created by them via deep learning. We first explain our method for one active particle, inferring the $2s$ mode (or the stresslet) and the $3t$ mode (or the source dipole) from the flow field data, along with the position and orientation of the particle. We then apply the method to a system of many active particles. We find excellent agreements between the predictions and the true values of activity. Our method presents a principled way to predict arbitrary activity from the flow field created by active particles.</description>

      <title>Tuning the morphology of aerosolised cellulose nanocrystals via controlled aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) are polycrystalline, rod-shaped nanoparticles isolated from cellulose, which have attracted increasing attention for a wide variety of applications. While there has been significant research into CNCs in suspensions, hydrogels and films, there have been remarkably few studies that investigated their properties during and after aerosolisation. Here, we studied how aerosolisation impacts the size and morphology of different CNCs suspensions with different surface functionalities. By building a new experimental setup, we observed that colloidally-metastable aqueous CNC suspensions, achieved by carboxylation of the surface hydroxy groups or by exposure to high intensity ultrasonication, yield large particulates upon aerosolisation under ambient temperatures. In contrast, aqueous suspensions of unfunctionalised CNCs tend to produce, upon aerosolisation, smaller particulates, despite suffering from poor colloidal stability in liquid suspension. Our results demonstrate that both the aerosolisation process itself and the properties of the CNC suspension play a crucial role in determining the final particle size and morphology of CNC-based particles, highlighting the need to consider colloidal stability and surface functionality when designing CNC-based materials for applications involving aerosol delivery or spray drying.</description>

      <title>Computer simulations show that liquid-liquid phase separation enhances self-assembly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biomolecular condensates are liquid- or gel-like droplets of proteins and nucleic acids formed at least in part through liquid-liquid phase separation. Condensates enable diverse functions of cells and the pathogens that infect them, including self-assembly reactions. For example, it has been shown that many viruses form condensates within their host cells to compartmentalize capsid assembly and packaging of the viral genome. Yet, the physical principles controlling condensate-mediated self-assembly remain incompletely understood. In this article we use coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to study the effect of a condensate on the assembly of icosahedral capsids. The capsid subunits are represented by simple shape-based models to enable simulating a wide range of length and time scales, while the condensate is modeled implicitly to study the effects of phase separation independent of the molecular details of biomolecular condensates. Our results show that condensates can significantly enhance assembly rates, yields, and robustness to parameter variations, consistent with previous theoretical predictions. However, extending beyond those predictions, the computational models also show that excluded volume enables control over the number of capsids that assemble within condensates. Moreover, long-lived aberrant off-pathway assembly intermediates can suppress yields within condensates. In addition to elucidating condensate-mediated assembly of viruses and other biological structures, these results may guide the use of condensates as a generic route to enhance and control self-assembly in human-engineered systems.</description>

      <title>Modeling droplet-particle interactions on solid surfaces by coupling the lattice Boltzmann and discrete element methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a numerical method for investigating interfacial flows coupled with frictional solid particles. Our method combines the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) to model the dynamics of a two-component fluid and the discrete element method (DEM) to model contact forces (normal reaction, sliding friction, rolling friction) between solid particles and between solid particles and flat solid surfaces. To couple the fluid and particle dynamics, we (1) use the momentum exchange method to transfer hydrodynamic forces between the fluids and particles, (2) account for different particle wettability using a geometric boundary condition, and (3) explicitly account for capillary forces between particles and liquid-fluid interfaces using a 3D capillary force model. We benchmark the contact forces by investigating the dynamics of a particle bouncing off a solid surface and rolling down an inclined plane. To benchmark the hydrodynamic and capillary forces, we investigate the Segr\`e-Silberberg effect and measure the force required to detach a particle from a liquid-fluid interface, respectively. Motivated by the self-cleaning properties of the lotus leaf, we apply our method to investigate how drops remove contaminant particles from surfaces and quantify the forces acting on particles during removal. Our method makes it possible to investigate the influence of various parameters that are often difficult to tune independently in experiments, including contact angles, surface tension, viscosity, and coefficient of friction between the surface and particles. Our results highlight that friction plays a crucial role when drops remove particles from surfaces.</description>

      <title>Subcellular nano-chemical characterization in photothermal spectroscopic imaging of antimicrobial interaction in model system Bacillus subtilis &amp; vancomycin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The power of photothermal spectroscopic imaging to visualize antimicrobial interaction on the surface of individual bacteria cells has been demonstrated on the model system Bacillus subtilis (B. subtilis) and vancomycin using mid-infrared photo-induced force microscopy (PiF-IR, also mid-IR PiFM). High-resolution PiF contrasts obtained by merging subsequent PiF-IR scans at two different illumination frequencies revealed chemical details of cell wall destruction after 30 and 60 min incubation with vancomycin with a spatial resolution of $\approx 5$ nm. This approach compensates local intensity variations induced by near-field coupling of the illuminating electric field with nanostructured surfaces, which appear in single-frequency contrasts in photothermal imaging methods, as shown by [Anindo et al., J. Phys. Chem C, 2025, 129, 4517]. Spectral shifts associated with hydrogen bond formation between vancomycin and the N-acyl-D-Ala4-D-Ala5 termini in the peptidoglycan cell wall have been observed in chemometrics of PiF-IR spectra from treated and untreated B. subtilis harvested after 30 min from the same experiment. The vancomyin interaction in the piecrust of a progressing septum is located with $\approx 10$ nm resolution exemplarily using PiF contrasts of three selected bands of a PiF-IR hyperspectral scan of an individual B. subtilis cell harvested after 30 min incubation. Our results provide a new perspective for visualizing the chemical interaction of antibiotics on the surface of microbes with few nanometer resolution.</description>

      <title>Physical synchronization of soft self-oscillating limbs for fast and autonomous locomotion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07011v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Animals achieve robust locomotion by offloading regulation from the brain to physical couplings within the body. In contrast, locomotion in artificial systems often depends on centralized processors. We introduce a rapid and autonomous locomotion strategy with synchronized gaits emerging through physical interactions between self-oscillating limbs and the environment, without control signals. Each limb is a single soft tube that only requires constant flow of air to perform cyclic stepping motions at frequencies reaching 300 hertz. By combining several of these self-oscillating limbs, their physical synchronization enables locomotion speeds that are orders of magnitude faster than comparable state-of-the-art. Through body-environment dynamics, these seemingly simple devices exhibit autonomy, including obstacle avoidance, amphibious gait transitions, and phototaxis.</description>

      <title>Electrokinetic nanofluidic sensing of DNA nanostar condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08673v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate electronic sensing of DNA nanostar (NS) condensate. Specifically, we use electrokinetic nanofluidics to observe and interpret how temperature-induced NS condensation affects nanochannel current. The increase in current upon filling a nanochannel with NS condensate indicates that its electrophoretic mobility is about half that of a single NS and its effective ionic strength is $\sim35$% greater than that of 150mM NaCl in phosphate buffer. $\zeta$-potential measurements before and after exposure to NS show that condensate binds the silica walls of a nanochannel more strongly than individual NS do under identical conditions. This binding increases electroosmotic flow, possibly enough to completely balance, or even exceed, the electrophoretic velocity of NS condensate. Although the current through a flat nanochannel is erratic in the presence of NS condensate, tilting the nanochannel to accumulate NS condensate at one entrance (and away from the other) results in a robust electronic signature of the NS phase transition at temperatures $T_c$ = $f$([NaCl]) that agree with those obtained by other methods. Electrokinetic nanofluidic detection and measurement of NS condensate thus provides a foundation for novel biosensing technologies based on liquid-liquid phase separation.</description>

      <title>Experiments and modeling of mechanically-soft, hard magnetorheological foams with potential applications in haptic sensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20580v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study proposes a family of novel mechanically-soft and magnetically-hard magnetorheological foams that, upon deformation, lead to robust and measurable magnetic flux changes in their surroundings. This allows to infer qualitatively and even quantitatively the imposed deformation and, eventually from that, an estimation of the stiffness and average stress on the sample even in complex loading scenarios involving combinations of uniform or nonuniform compression/tension with superposed shearing in different directions. The work provides a complete experimental, theoretical and numerical framework on finite strain, compressible magneto-elasticity, thereby allowing to measure and predict coupled magneto-mechanical properties of such materials with different particle volume fractions and then use it to estimate and design potential haptic sensing devices.</description>

      <title>Toward Efficient Electrokinetic Energy Conversion with Topographic Modulation of Electrical Conduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08208v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents experimental and theoretical analyses of electrokinetic flow in microchannels with glass and silica surfaces across a broad range of electrolyte concentrations (0.01 to 100 mM). We demonstrate simple but effective strategies for controlling electrical conduction by engineering nanoscale and microscale topographic features that directly modify the structure and extent of the electric double layer (EDL) and the interfacial ion conduction pathway. These tailored surface topographies modulate the overall electrical conductivity in slit microchannels through similar phenomena documented for nanochannels and nanopores due to the presence of liquid-filled nanoscale topographic features with high concentration of highly mobile protons. The findings of this work reveal that the interaction between tailored surface features and the EDL can substantially enhance energy conversion efficiency in microscale systems. These insights along with simple analytical models provide guidance for the rational design and optimization of scalable electrokinetic devices and are broadly relevant to numerous energy harvesting and charge-separation technologies.</description>

      <title>Atomistic mechanisms of dynamics in a two-dimensional dodecagonal quasicrystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10295v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quasicrystals have been observed in a variety of materials ranging from metal alloys to block copolymers. However, their structural and dynamical properties cannot be readily described in terms of conventional solid-state models of liquids and solids. We may expect the dynamics of this specific class of quasicrystalline materials to be more like glass-forming liquids in the sense of exhibiting large fluctuations in the local mobility ("dynamic heterogeneity") and non-Arrhenius temperature dependence of relaxation and diffusion. In this work, we investigate a model dodecagonal quasicrystal material in two dimensions (2D) using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, with a focus on heterogeneous dynamics and non-Arrhenius relaxation and diffusion. As observed in glass-forming liquids and heated crystals, we observe a two-stage relaxation dynamics in the self-intermediate scattering function $F_s(k,t)$ of our quasicrystal material. It involves a fast $\beta$-relaxation and $\alpha$ relaxation process having a highly temperature dependent relaxation time whose activation energy varies in concert with the extent of string-like collective motion, a phenomenon recognized to occur in glass-forming liquids at low temperatures and crystalline materials at elevated temperatures. After examining the dynamics of our dodecagonal quasicrystalline material in great detail, we conclude that the dynamics of these materials more closely resembles observations on metallic glass-forming liquids than crystalline materials.</description>
