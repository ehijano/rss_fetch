      <title>Bounds of Shannon entropy and Extropy and their application in exploring the extreme value behavior of a large set of data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper derives bounds for two omnipresent information theoretic measures, the Shannon entropy and its complementary dual, the extropy. Based on a large size data set from a logconcave model, the said bounds are obtained for the entropy and the extropy of the distribution of the largest order statistic and the respective normalized sequence, in the extreme value theory setting. A characterization of the exponential distribution is provided as the model that maximizes the Shannon entropy and the extropy which are associated with the distribution of the maximum value, in a large sample size regime. This characterization is exploited to provide an alternative, immediate proof of the convergence of Shannon entropy and extropy of the normalized maxima of a large size sample to the respective measures for the Gumbel distribution, studied recently for Shannon entropy in Johnson (2024) and references therein.</description>

      <title>On consistency of the MLE under finite mixtures of location-scale distributions with a structural parameter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a general and rigorous proof for the strong consistency of maximum likelihood estimators of the cumulative distribution function of the mixing distribution and structural parameter under finite mixtures of location-scale distributions with a structural parameter. The consistency results do not require the parameter space of location and scale to be compact. We illustrate the results by applying them to finite mixtures of location-scale distributions with the component density function being one of the commonly used density functions: normal, logistic, extreme-value, or $t$. An extension of the strong consistency results to finite mixtures of multivariate elliptical distributions is also discussed.</description>

      <title>GOSPA and T-GOSPA quasi-metrics for evaluation of multi-object tracking algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces two quasi-metrics for performance assessment of multi-object tracking (MOT) algorithms. In particular, one quasi-metric is an extension of the generalised optimal subpattern assignment (GOSPA) metric and measures the discrepancy between sets of objects. The other quasi-metric is an extension of the trajectory GOSPA (T-GOSPA) metric and measures the discrepancy between sets of trajectories. Similar to the GOSPA-based metrics, these quasi-metrics include costs for localisation error for properly detected objects, the number of false objects and the number of missed objects. The T-GOSPA quasi-metric also includes a track switching cost. Differently from the GOSPA and T-GOSPA metrics, the proposed quasi-metrics have the flexibility of penalising missed and false objects with different costs, and the localisation costs are not required to be symmetric. These properties can be useful in MOT evaluation in certain applications. The performance of several Bayesian MOT algorithms is assessed with the T-GOSPA quasi-metric via simulations.</description>

      <title>A Survey of Dimension Estimation Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is a standard assumption that datasets in high dimension have an internal structure which means that they in fact lie on, or near, subsets of a lower dimension. In many instances it is important to understand the real dimension of the data, hence the complexity of the dataset at hand. A great variety of dimension estimators have been developed to find the intrinsic dimension of the data but there is little guidance on how to reliably use these estimators.
  This survey reviews a wide range of dimension estimation methods, categorising them by the geometric information they exploit: tangential estimators which detect a local affine structure; parametric estimators which rely on dimension-dependent probability distributions; and estimators which use topological or metric invariants.
  The paper evaluates the performance of these methods, as well as investigating varying responses to curvature and noise. Key issues addressed include robustness to hyperparameter selection, sample size requirements, accuracy in high dimensions, precision, and performance on non-linear geometries. In identifying the best hyperparameters for benchmark datasets, overfitting is frequent, indicating that many estimators may not generalise well beyond the datasets on which they have been tested.</description>

      <title>Seriation of Toeplitz and latent position matrices: optimal rates and computational trade-offs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10004v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of seriation of a permuted structured matrix based on noisy observations. The entries of the matrix relate to an expected quantification of interaction between two objects: the higher the value, the closer the objects. A popular structured class for modelling such matrices is the permuted Robinson class, namely the set of matrices whose coefficients are decreasing away from its diagonal, up to a permutation of its lines and columns. We consider in this paper two submodels of Robinson matrices: the Toeplitz model, and the latent position model. We provide a computational lower bound based on the low-degree paradigm, which hints that there is a statistical-computational gap for seriation when measuring the error based on the Frobenius norm. We also provide a simple and polynomial-time algorithm that achives this lower bound. Along the way, we also characterize the information-theory optimal risk thereby giving evidence for the extent of the computation/information gap for this problem.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-variance quasi-maximum likelihood estimation of semi-parametric time series models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.06100v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel estimation approach for a general class of semi-parametric time series models where the conditional expectation is modeled through a parametric function. The proposed class of estimators is based on a Gaussian quasi-likelihood function and it relies on the specification of a parametric pseudo-variance that can contain parametric restrictions with respect to the conditional expectation. The specification of the pseudo-variance and the parametric restrictions follow naturally in observation-driven models with bounds in the support of the observable process, such as count processes and double-bounded time series. We derive the asymptotic properties of the estimators and a validity test for the parameter restrictions. We show that the results remain valid irrespective of the correct specification of the pseudo-variance. The key advantage of the restricted estimators is that they can achieve higher efficiency compared to alternative quasi-likelihood methods that are available in the literature. Furthermore, the testing approach can be used to build specification tests for parametric time series models. We illustrate the practical use of the methodology in a simulation study and two empirical applications featuring integer-valued autoregressive processes, where assumptions on the dispersion of the thinning operator are formally tested, and autoregressions for double-bounded data with application to a realized correlation time series.</description>

      <title>Two-stage weighted least squares estimator of multivariate non-negative observation-driven models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.13487v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A novel estimation approach for a general class of semi-parametric multivariate time series models is introduced where the conditional mean is modeled through parametric functions. The focus of the estimation is the conditional mean parameter vector for non-negative time series. Quasi-Maximum Likelihood Estimators (QMLEs) based on the linear exponential family are typically employed for such estimation problems when the true multivariate conditional probability distribution is unknown or too complex. Although QMLEs provide consistent estimates they may be inefficient. Novel two-stage Multivariate Weighted Least Square Estimators (MWLSEs) are introduced which enjoy the same consistency property as the QMLEs but provide improved efficiency with a suitable choice of the weighting sequence of matrices in the second stage. The proposed method enables a more accurate estimation of model parameters, particularly for data where maximum likelihood estimation is infeasible. Moreover, consistency and asymptotic normality of MWLSEs are derived, and their efficiency is proved under the correct specification of the weighting sequence. The estimation performance of QMLE and MWLSE is also compared through simulation experiments and a real data application, showing the superior accuracy of the proposed methodology.</description>

      <title>Optimization via Strategic Law of Large Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05604v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a unified framework for the global optimization of a continuous function in a bounded rectangular domain. Specifically, we show that: (1) under the optimal strategy for a two-armed decision model, the sample mean converges to a global optimizer under the Strategic Law of Large Numbers, and (2) a sign-based strategy built upon the solution of a parabolic PDE is asymptotically optimal. Motivated by this result, we propose a class of {\bf S}trategic {\bf M}onte {\bf C}arlo {\bf O}ptimization (SMCO) algorithms, which uses a simple strategy that makes coordinate-wise two-armed decisions based on the signs of the partial gradient of the original function being optimized over (without the need of solving PDEs). While this simple strategy is not generally optimal, we show that it is sufficient for our SMCO algorithm to converge to local optimizer(s) from a single starting point, and to global optimizers under a growing set of starting points. Numerical studies demonstrate the suitability of our SMCO algorithms for global optimization, and illustrate the promise of our theoretical framework and practical approach. For a wide range of test functions with challenging optimization landscapes (including ReLU neural networks with square and hinge loss), our SMCO algorithms converge to the global maximum accurately and robustly, using only a small set of starting points (at most 100 for dimensions up to 1000) and a small maximum number of iterations (200). In fact, our algorithms outperform many state-of-the-art global optimizers, as well as local algorithms augmented with the same set of starting points as ours.</description>

      <title>Random irregular histograms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22034v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new method of histogram construction, providing a fully Bayesian approach to irregular histograms. Our procedure applies Bayesian model selection to a piecewise constant model of the underlying distribution, resulting in a method that selects both the number of bins as well as their location based on the data in a fully automatic fashion. We show that the histogram estimate is consistent with respect to the Hellinger metric under mild regularity conditions, and that it attains a convergence rate equal to the minimax rate (up to a logarithmic factor) for H\"{o}lder continuous densities. Simulation studies indicate that the new method performs comparably to other histogram procedures, both for minimizing the estimation error and for identifying modes. A software implementation is included as supplementary material.</description>
