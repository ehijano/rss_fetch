      <title>$(2B, 3A, 5A)$-subalgebras of the Griess algebra with alternating Miyamoto group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use Majorana representations to study the subalgebras of the Griess algebra that have shape $(2B,3A,5A)$ and whose associated Miyamoto groups are isomorphic to $A_n$. We prove that these subalgebras exist only if $n\in \{5,6,8\}$. The case $n=5$ was already treated by Ivanov, Seress, McInroy, and Shpectorov. In case $n=6$ we prove that these algebras are all isomorphic and provide their precise description. In case $n=8$ we prove that these algebras do not arise from standard Majorana representations.</description>

      <title>A representation of range decreasing group homomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The method of range decreasing group homomorphisms can be applied to study various maps between mapping spaces, includin holomorphic maps, group homomorphisms, linear maps, semigroup homomorphisms, Lie algebra homomorphisms and algebra homomorphisms [Z1, Z2]. Previous studies on range decreasing group homomorphisms have primarily focused on specific subsets of mapping groups. In this paper, we provide a characterization of a general range decreasing group homomorphism applicable to the entire mapping group. As applications, we compute a particular class of homomorphisms between mapping groups and identify all range decreasing group homomorphisms defined on specific mapping groups.</description>

      <title>Uncountably many $2$-spherical groups of Kac-Moody type of rank $3$ over $\mathbb{F}_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we show that Weyl-invariant commutator blueprints of type $(4, 4, 4)$ are faithful. As a consequence we answer a question of Tits from the late $1980$s about twin buildings. Moreover, we obtain the first example of a $2$-spherical Kac-Moody group over a finite field which is not finitely presented.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically CAT(0) metrics, Z-structures, and the Farrell-Jones Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that colorable hierarchically hyperbolic groups (HHGs) admit asymptotically CAT(0) metrics, that is, roughly, metrics where the CAT(0) inequality holds up to sublinear error in the size of the triangle.
  We use the asymptotically CAT(0) metrics to construct contractible simplicial complexes and compactifications that provide $\mathcal{Z}$-structures in the sense of Bestvina and Dranishnikov. It was previously unknown that mapping class groups are asymptotically CAT(0) and admit $\mathcal{Z}$-structures. As an application, we prove that many HHGs satisfy the Farrell--Jones Conjecture, including extra large-type Artin groups.
  To construct asymptotically CAT(0) metrics, we show that hulls of finitely many points in a colorable HHGs can be approximated by CAT(0) cube complexes in a way that adding a point to the finite set corresponds, up to finitely many hyperplanes deletions, to a convex embedding.</description>

      <title>Group Downsampling with Equivariant Anti-aliasing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Downsampling layers are crucial building blocks in CNN architectures, which help to increase the receptive field for learning high-level features and reduce the amount of memory/computation in the model. In this work, we study the generalization of the uniform downsampling layer for group equivariant architectures, e.g., G-CNNs. That is, we aim to downsample signals (feature maps) on general finite groups with anti-aliasing. This involves the following: (a) Given a finite group and a downsampling rate, we present an algorithm to form a suitable choice of subgroup. (b) Given a group and a subgroup, we study the notion of bandlimited-ness and propose how to perform anti-aliasing. Notably, our method generalizes the notion of downsampling based on classical sampling theory. When the signal is on a cyclic group, i.e., periodic, our method recovers the standard downsampling of an ideal low-pass filter followed by a subsampling operation. Finally, we conducted experiments on image classification tasks demonstrating that the proposed downsampling operation improves accuracy, better preserves equivariance, and reduces model size when incorporated into G-equivariant networks</description>

      <title>Two gluing methods for string C-group representations of the symmetric groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of string C-group representations of rank at least $n/2$ for the symmetric group $S_n$ has gained a lot of attention in the last fifteen years. In a recent paper, Cameron et al. gave a list of permutation representation graphs of rank $r\geq n/2$ for $S_n$, having a fracture graph and a non-perfect split. They conjecture that these graphs are permutation representation graphs of string C-groups. In trying to prove this conjecture, we discovered two new techniques to glue two CPR graphs for symmetric groups together. We discuss the cases in which they yield new CPR graphs. By doing so, we invalidate the conjecture of Cameron et al. We believe our gluing techniques will be useful in the study of string C-group representations of high ranks for the symmetric groups.</description>

      <title>Measure equivalence rigidity of $\mathrm{Out}(F_N)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.03696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2103.03696v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that for every $N\ge 3$, the group $\mathrm{Out}(F_N)$ of outer automorphisms of a free group of rank $N$ is superrigid from the point of view of measure equivalence: any countable group that is measure equivalent to $\mathrm{Out}(F_N)$, is in fact virtually isomorphic to $\mathrm{Out}(F_N)$.
  We introduce three new constructions of canonical splittings associated to a subgroup of $\mathrm{Out}(F_N)$ of independent interest. They encode respectively the collection of invariant free splittings, invariant cyclic splittings, and maximal invariant free factor systems. Our proof also relies on the following improvement of an amenability result by Bestvina and the authors: given a free factor system $\mathcal{F}$ of $F_N$, the action of $\mathrm{Out}(F_N,\mathcal{F})$ (the subgroup of $\mathrm{Out}(F_N)$ that preserves $\mathcal{F}$) on the space of relatively arational trees with amenable stabilizer is a Borel amenable action.</description>

      <title>Restricted Hausdorff spectra of $q$-adic automorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.16508v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Firstly, we completely determine the self-similar Hausdorff spectrum of the group of $q$-adic automorphisms where $q$ is a prime power, answering a question of Grigorchuk. Indeed, we take a further step and completely determine its Hausdorff spectra restricted to the most important subclasses of self-similar groups, providing examples differing drastically from the previously known ones in the literature. Our proof relies on a new explicit formula for the computation of the Hausdorff dimension of closed self-similar groups and a generalization of iterated permutational wreath products.
  Secondly, we provide for every prime $p$ the first examples of just infinite branch pro-$p$ groups with zero Hausdorff dimension in $\Gamma_p$, giving strong evidence against a well-known conjecture of Boston.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08248v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that if a group $G$ admits a virtually special action on a CAT(0) cube complex, then any product of convex-cocompact subgroups of $G$ is separable. Previously, this was only known for products of three subgroups, or in the case where $G$ is hyperbolic, or in some other more technical cases with additional assumptions on the subgroups (plus these previous results assume that the action of $G$ is cocompact). We also provide an application to the action of a virtually special cubulated group on its contact graph (and to some other actions of cubulated groups on graphs).</description>

      <title>The $m$-partite digraphical representations of valency 3 of finite groups generated by two elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22980v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: \ \ Let $G$ be a finite group and $m \geq 2$ an integer. An $m$-partite digraphical representation ($m$-PDR) of a group $G$ is a digraph $\Gamma = (V, E)$ satisfying the following properties:
  \item $\Gamma$ is regular;
  \item The automorphism group $\mathrm{Aut}(\Gamma)$ is isomorphic to $G$;
  \item $\mathrm{Aut}(\Gamma)$ acts semiregularly on the vertex set $V$;
  \item The action of $\mathrm{Aut}(\Gamma)$ partitions $V$ into exactly $m$ orbits, with each induced subgraph on an orbit being edgeless. This paper advances the classification program for $m$-PDRs with prescribed valency. Building on Du et al.'s complete classification of unrestricted $m$-PDRs \cite{du4} (2021), we focus on the unresolved valency-specific cases. For digraphs, the minimal nontrivial valencies are $k=2$ (even) and $k=3$ (odd), since a connected digraph of valency one is just a directed cycle. While Du et al. \cite{du3} recently classified valency 2 $m$-POSRs for groups generated by at most two elements - where $m$-POSRs are necessarily $m$-PDRs by definition - the valency 3 case remains open. Since all finite simple groups are two-generated, we investigate $m$-PDRs of valency 3 for groups generated by at most two elements, and establish a complete classification of nontrivial finite simple groups admitting $m$-PDRs of valency 3.</description>

      <title>An addendum on the Mathieu Conjecture for $SU(N)$, $Sp(N)$ and $G_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01516v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we sharpen results obtained by the author in 2023. The new results reduce the Mathieu Conjecture on $SU(N)$ (formulated for all compact connected Lie groups by O. Mathieu in 1997) to a conjecture involving only functions on $\mathbb{R}^n\times (S^1)^m$ with $n,m$ non-negative integers instead of involving functions on $\mathbb{R}^n\times (S^1\setminus\{1\})^m$. The proofs rely on a more recent work of the author (2024) and a specific $KAK$ decomposition. Finally, with these results we can also improve the results on the groups $Sp(N)$ and $G_2$ in the latter paper, since they relied on the construction introduced in the 2023 paper.</description>
