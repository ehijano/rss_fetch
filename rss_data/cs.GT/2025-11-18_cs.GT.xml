      <title>Collusion-proof Auction Design using Side Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of auction design in the presence of bidder collusion. Specifically, we consider a multi-unit auction of identical items with single-minded bidders, where a subset of bidders may collude by coordinating bids and transferring payments and items among themselves. While the classical Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism achieves efficient and truthful outcomes, it is highly vulnerable to collusion. In contrast, fully collusion-proof mechanisms are limited to posted-price formats, which fail to guarantee even approximate efficiency. This paper aims to bridge this gap by designing auctions that achieve good welfare and revenue guarantees even when some bidders collude. We first characterize the strategic behavior of colluding bidders under VCG and prove that such bidders optimally bid shade: they never overbid or take additional items, but instead reduce the auction price. This characterization enables a Bulow-Klemperer type result: adding colluding bidders can only improve welfare and revenue relative to running VCG on the non-colluding group alone. We then propose a Hybrid VCG (H-VCG) mechanism that combines VCG applied to non-colluding bidders with a posted-price mechanism for colluding bidders, assuming access to a black-box collusion detection algorithm. We show that H-VCG is ex-post dominant-strategy incentive compatible (DSIC) and derive probabilistic guarantees on expected welfare and revenue under both known and unknown valuation distributions. Numerical experiments across several distributions demonstrate that H-VCG consistently outperforms VCG restricted to non-colluding bidders and approaches the performance of the ideal VCG mechanism assuming universal truthfulness. Our results provide a principled framework for incorporating collusion detection into mechanism design, offering a step toward collusion-resistant auctions.</description>

      <title>Perturbing Best Responses in Zero-Sum Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of perturbations on the best-response-based algorithms approximating Nash equilibria in zero-sum games, namely Double Oracle and Fictitious Play. More precisely, we assume that the oracle computing the best responses perturbs the utilities before selecting the best response. We show that using such an oracle reduces the number of iterations for both algorithms. For some cases, suitable perturbations ensure the expected number of iterations is logarithmic. Although the utility perturbation is computationally demanding as it requires iterating through all pure strategies, we demonstrate that one can efficiently perturb the utilities in games where pure strategies have further inner structure.</description>

      <title>Bandit Learning in Housing Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The housing market, also known as one-sided matching market, is a classic exchange economy model where each agent on the demand side initially owns an indivisible good (a house) and has a personal preference over all goods. The goal is to find a core-stable allocation that exhausts all mutually beneficial exchanges among subgroups of agents. While this model has been extensively studied in economics and computer science due to its broad applications, little attention has been paid to settings where preferences are unknown and must be learned through repeated interactions. In this paper, we propose a statistical learning model within the multi-player multi-armed bandit framework, where players (agents) learn their preferences over arms (goods) from stochastic rewards. We introduce the notion of core regret for each player as the market objective. We study both centralized and decentralized approaches, proving $O(N \log T / \Delta^2)$ upper bounds on regret, where $N$ is the number of players, $T$ is the time horizon and $\Delta$ is the minimum preference gap among players. For the decentralized setting, we also establish a matching lower bound, demonstrating that our algorithm is order-optimal.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Data Value: Asymmetric Data Shapley for Structure-Aware Valuation in Data Markets and Machine Learning Pipelines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rigorous valuation of individual data sources is critical for fair compensation in data markets, informed data acquisition, and transparent development of ML/AI models. Classical Data Shapley (DS) provides a essential axiomatic framework for data valuation but is constrained by its symmetry axiom that assumes interchangeability of data sources. This assumption fails to capture the directional and temporal dependencies prevalent in modern ML/AI workflows, including the reliance of duplicated or augmented data on original sources and the order-specific contributions in sequential pipelines such as federated learning and multi-stage LLM fine tuning. To address these limitations, we introduce Asymmetric Data Shapley (ADS), a structure-aware data valuation framework for modern ML/AI pipelines. ADS relaxes symmetry by averaging marginal contributions only over permutations consistent with an application-specific ordering of data groups. It preserves efficiency and linearity, maintains within group symmetry and directional precedence across groups, and reduces to DS when the ordering collapses to a single group. We develop two complementary computational procedures for ADS: (i) a Monte Carlo estimator (MC-ADS) with finite-sample accuracy guarantees, and (ii) a k-nearest neighbor surrogate (KNN-ADS) that is exact and efficient for KNN predictors. Across representative settings with directional and temporal dependence, ADS consistently outperforms benchmark methods by distinguishing novel from redundant contributions and respecting the sequential nature of training. These results establish ADS as a principled and practical approach to equitable data valuation in data markets and complex ML/AI pipelines.</description>

      <title>Resilient and Efficient Allocation for Large-Scale Autonomous Fleets via Decentralized Coordination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Operating large autonomous fleets demands fast, resilient allocation of scarce resources (such as energy and fuel, charger access and maintenance slots, time windows, and communication bandwidth) under uncertainty. We propose a side-information-aware approach for resource allocation at scale that combines distributional predictions with decentralized coordination. Local side information shapes per-agent risk models for consumption, which are coupled through chance constraints on failures. A lightweight consensus-ADMM routine coordinates agents over a sparse communication graph, enabling near-centralized performance while avoiding single points of failure. We validate the framework on real urban road networks with autonomous vehicles and on a representative satellite constellation, comparing against greedy, no-side-information, and oracle central baselines. Our method reduces failure rates by 30-55% at matched cost and scales to thousands of agents with near-linear runtime, while preserving feasibility with high probability.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new algorithm that achieves a $\frac{7}{9}$-approximation for the maximin share (MMS) allocation of indivisible goods under additive valuations, improving the current best ratio of $\frac{10}{13}$ (Heidari et al., SODA 2026). Building on a new analytical framework, we further obtain an FPTAS that achieves a $\frac{7}{9}-\varepsilon$ approximation in $\tfrac{1}{\varepsilon} \cdot \mathrm{poly}(n,m)$ time. Compared with prior work (Heidari et al., SODA 2026), our algorithm is substantially simpler.</description>

      <title>MEV in Multiple Concurrent Proposer Blockchains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze maximal extractable value in multiple concurrent proposer blockchains, where multiple blocks become data available before their final execution order is determined. This concurrency breaks the single builder assumption of sequential chains and introduces new MEV channels, including same tick duplicate steals, proposer to proposer auctions, and timing races driven by proof of availability latency. We develop a hazard normalized model of delay and inclusion, derive a closed form delay envelope \(M(\tau)\), and characterize equilibria for censorship, duplication, and auction games. We show how deterministic priority DAG scheduling and duplicate aware payouts neutralize same tick MEV while preserving throughput, identifying simple protocol configurations to mitigate MCP specific extraction without centralized builders.</description>

      <title>The Publication Choice Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Researchers strategically choose where to submit their work in order to maximize its impact, and these publication decisions in turn determine venues' impact factors. To analyze how individual publication choices both respond to and shape venue impact, we introduce a game-theoretic framework, coined the Publication Choice Problem, that captures this two-way interplay. We show the existence of a pure-strategy equilibrium in the Publication Choice Problem and its uniqueness under binary researcher types. Our characterizations of the equilibrium properties offer insights about what publication behaviors better indicate a researcher's impact level. Through equilibrium analysis, we further investigate how labeling papers with ``spotlight'' affects the impact factor of venues in the research community. Our analysis shows that competitive venue labeling top papers with ``spotlight'' may decrease the overall impact of other venues in the community, while less competitive venues with ``spotlight'' labeling have the opposite impact.</description>

      <title>Aspiration-based Perturbed Learning Automata in Games with Noisy Utility Measurements. Part A: Stochastic Stability in Non-zero-Sum Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement-based learning has attracted considerable attention both in modeling human behavior as well as in engineering, for designing measurement- or payoff-based optimization schemes. Such learning schemes exhibit several advantages, especially in relation to filtering out noisy observations. However, they may exhibit several limitations when applied in a distributed setup. In multi-player weakly-acyclic games, and when each player applies an independent copy of the learning dynamics, convergence to (usually desirable) pure Nash equilibria cannot be guaranteed. Prior work has only focused on a small class of games, namely potential and coordination games. To address this main limitation, this paper introduces a novel payoff-based learning scheme for distributed optimization, namely aspiration-based perturbed learning automata (APLA). In this class of dynamics, and contrary to standard reinforcement-based learning schemes, each player's probability distribution for selecting actions is reinforced both by repeated selection and an aspiration factor that captures the player's satisfaction level. We provide a stochastic stability analysis of APLA in multi-player positive-utility games under the presence of noisy observations. This is the first part of the paper that characterizes stochastic stability in generic non-zero-sum games by establishing equivalence of the induced infinite-dimensional Markov chain with a finite dimensional one. In the second part, stochastic stability is further specialized to weakly acyclic games.</description>

      <title>On the Trade-Off Between Transparency and Security in Adversarial Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transparency and security are both central to Responsible AI, but they may conflict in adversarial settings. We investigate the strategic effect of transparency for agents through the lens of transferable adversarial example attacks. In transferable adversarial example attacks, attackers maliciously perturb their inputs using surrogate models to fool a defender's target model. These models can be defended or undefended, with both players having to decide which to use. Using a large-scale empirical evaluation of nine attacks across 181 models, we find that attackers are more successful when they match the defender's decision; hence, obscurity could be beneficial to the defender. With game theory, we analyze this trade-off between transparency and security by modeling this problem as both a Nash game and a Stackelberg game, and comparing the expected outcomes. Our analysis confirms that only knowing whether a defender's model is defended or not can sometimes be enough to damage its security. This result serves as an indicator of the general trade-off between transparency and security, suggesting that transparency in AI systems can be at odds with security. Beyond adversarial machine learning, our work illustrates how game-theoretic reasoning can uncover conflicts between transparency and security.</description>

      <title>KrwEmd: Revising the Imperfect-Recall Abstraction from Forgetting Everything</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Excessive abstraction is a critical challenge in hand abstraction-a task specific to games like Texas hold'em-when solving large-scale imperfect-information games, as it impairs AI performance. This issue arises from extreme implementations of imperfect-recall abstraction, which entirely discard historical information. This paper presents KrwEmd, the first practical algorithm designed to address this problem. We first introduce the k-recall winrate feature, which not only qualitatively distinguishes signal observation infosets by leveraging both future and, crucially, historical game information, but also quantitatively captures their similarity. We then develop the KrwEmd algorithm, which clusters signal observation infosets using earth mover's distance to measure discrepancies between their features. Experimental results demonstrate that KrwEmd significantly improves AI gameplay performance compared to existing algorithms.</description>

      <title>Prrr: Personal Random Rewards for Blockchain Reporting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Smart contracts, the stateful programs running on blockchains, often rely on reports. Publishers are paid to publish these reports on the blockchain. Designing protocols that incentivize timely reporting is the prevalent reporting problem. But existing solutions face a security-performance trade-off: Relying on a small set of trusted publishers introduces centralization risks, while allowing open publication results in an excessive number of reports on the blockchain. We identify the root cause of this trade-off to be the standard symmetric reward design, which treats all reports equally. We prove that no symmetric-reward mechanism can overcome the trade-off.
  We present Personal Random Rewards for Reporting (Prrr), a protocol that assigns random heterogeneous values to reports. We call this novel mechanism-design concept Ex-Ante Synthetic Asymmetry. To the best of our knowledge, Prrr is the first game-theoretic mechanism (in any context) that deliberately forms participant asymmetry. Prrr employs a second-price-style settlement to allocate rewards, ensuring incentive compatibility and achieving both security and efficiency. Following the protocol constitutes a Subgame-Perfect Nash Equilibrium, robust against collusion and Sybil attacks. Prrr is applicable to numerous smart contracts that rely on timely reports.</description>

      <title>Continuity, Uniqueness and Long-Term Behavior of Nash Flows Over Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.06877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.06877v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a dynamic model of traffic that has received a lot of attention in the past few years. Users control infinitesimal flow particles aiming to travel from an origin to a destination as quickly as possible. Flow patterns vary over time, and congestion effects are modeled via queues, which form whenever the inflow into a link exceeds its capacity. Despite lots of interest, some very basic questions remain open in this model. We resolve a number of them in the single-commodity setting:
  - We show uniqueness of journey times in equilibria.
  - We show continuity of equilibria: small perturbations to the instance or to the traffic situation at some moment cannot lead to wildly different equilibrium evolutions.
  - We demonstrate that, assuming constant inflow into the network at the source, equilibria always settle down into a "steady state" in which the behavior extends forever in a linear fashion.
  One of our main conceptual contributions is to show that the answer to the first two questions, on uniqueness and continuity, are intimately connected to the third. To resolve the third question, we substantially extend the approach of Cominetti et al., who show a steady-state result in the regime where the input flow rate is smaller than the network capacity.</description>

      <title>Multi-District School Choice: Playing on Several Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04530v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the seminal model of Pathak and S\"onmez (2008) to a setting with multiple school districts, each running its own separate centralized match, and focus on the case of two districts. In our setting, in addition to each student being either sincere or sophisticated, she is also either constrained - able to apply only to schools within her own district of residence - or unconstrained - able to choose any single district within which to apply. We show that several key results from Pathak and S\"onmez (2008) qualitatively flip: A sophisticated student may prefer for a sincere student to become sophisticated, and a sophisticated student may prefer for her own district to use Deferred Acceptance over the Boston Mechanism, irrespective of the mechanism used by the other district. We furthermore investigate the preferences of students over the constraint levels of other students. Many of these phenomena appear abundantly in large random markets.</description>

      <title>Bounds of Block Rewards in Honest PinFi Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02174v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: PinFi is a class of novel protocols for decentralized pricing of dissipative assets, whose value naturally declines over time. Central to the protocol's functionality and its market efficiency is the role of liquidity providers (LPs). This study addresses critical stability and sustainability challenges within the protocol, namely: the propensity of LPs to prefer selling in external markets over participation in the protocol; a similar inclination towards selling within the PinFi system rather than contributing as LPs; and a scenario where LPs are disinclined to sell within the protocol. Employing a game-theoretic approach, we explore PinFi's mechanisms and its broader ramifications. Our findings reveal that, under a variety of common conditions and with an assumption of participant integrity, PinFi is capable of fostering a dynamic equilibrium among LPs, sellers, and buyers. This balance is maintained through a carefully calibrated range of block rewards for LPs, ensuring the protocol's long-term stability and utility.</description>

      <title>Pandora's Box Problem With Time Constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15261v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Pandora's Box problem models the search for the best alternative when evaluation is costly. In the simplest variant, a decision maker is presented with $n$ boxes, each associated with a cost of inspection and a hidden random reward. The decision maker inspects a subset of these boxes one after the other, in a possibly adaptive order, and gains the difference between the largest revealed reward and the sum of the inspection costs. Although this classic version is well understood (Weitzman 1979), there is a flourishing recent literature on variants of the problem. Here we introduce a general framework -- the Pandora's Box Over Time problem -- that captures a wide range of variants where time plays a role, e.g., by constraining the schedules of exploration and influencing costs and rewards. In our framework, boxes have time-dependent rewards and costs, whereas inspection may require a box-specific processing time. Moreover, once a box is inspected, its reward may deteriorate over time. Our main result is an efficient constant-factor approximation to the optimal strategy for the Pandora's Box Over Time problem, which is generally NP-hard to compute. We further obtain improved results for the natural special cases where boxes have no processing time, boxes are available only in specific time slots, or when costs and reward distributions are time-independent (but rewards may still deteriorate after inspection).</description>

      <title>Position Fair Mechanisms Allocating Indivisible Goods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06423v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fair division mechanisms for indivisible goods require agent orderings to deterministically select one allocation when running the algorithm in practice. We introduce position envy-freeness up to one good (PEF1) as a fairness criterion for mechanisms: a mechanism is said to satisfy PEF1 if for any pair of agent orderings, no agent prefers their bundle determined under one ordering to that under another ordering by more than the utility of a single good. First, we propose a scale-invariant, polynomial-time mechanism that satisfies PEF1 and yields an envy-freeness up to one good (EF1) allocation. For the case of two agents, we establish that any mechanism producing a maximum Nash welfare allocation eliminates envy based on positions by removing one good, provided that utilities are positive. Additionally, we present a polynomial-time mechanism based on the adjusted winner procedure, which satisfies PEF1 and produces an EF1 and Pareto optimal allocation for two agents. In contrast, we demonstrate that well-known mechanisms such as round-robin and envy-cycle elimination do not generally satisfy PEF1.</description>

      <title>Convergence of Fast Policy Iteration in Markov Games and Robust MDPs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06661v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Markov games and robust MDPs are closely related models that involve computing a pair of saddle point policies. As part of the long-standing effort to develop efficient algorithms for these models, the Filar-Tolwinski (FT) algorithm has shown considerable promise. As our first contribution, we demonstrate that FT may fail to converge to a saddle point and may loop indefinitely, even in small games. This observation contradicts the proof of FT's convergence to a saddle point in the original paper. As our second contribution, we propose Residual Conditioned Policy Iteration (RCPI). RCPI builds on FT, but is guaranteed to converge to a saddle point. Our numerical results show that RCPI outperforms other convergent algorithms by several orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Spatial Branch-and-Bound for Computing Multiplayer Nash Equilibrium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10204v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Equilibria of realistic multiplayer games constitute a key solution concept both in practical applications, such as online advertising auctions and electricity markets, and in analytical frameworks used to study strategic voting in elections or assess policy impacts in integrated assessment models. However, efficiently computing these equilibria requires games to have a carefully designed structure and satisfy numerous restrictions; otherwise, the computational complexity becomes prohibitive. In particular, finding even approximate Nash equilibria in general-sum normal-form games with two or more players is known to be PPAD-complete. Current state-of-the-art algorithms for computing Nash equilibria in multiplayer normal-form games either suffer from poor scalability due to their reliance on non-convex optimization solvers, or lack guarantees of convergence to a true equilibrium. In this paper, we propose a formulation of the Nash equilibrium computation problem as a polynomial complementarity problem and develop a complete and sound spatial branch-and-bound algorithm based on this formulation. We provide a qualitative analysis arguing why one should expect our approach to perform well, and show the relationship between approximate solutions to our formulation and that of computing an approximate Nash equilibrium. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our algorithm substantially outperforms existing complete methods.</description>

      <title>Personalized Pricing Through Strategic User Profiling in Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17111v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional user profiling techniques rely on browsing history or purchase records to identify users' willingness to pay. This enables sellers to offer personalized prices to profiled users while charging only a uniform price to non-profiled users. However, the emergence of privacy-enhancing technologies has caused users to actively avoid on-site data tracking. Today, major online sellers have turned to public platforms such as online social networks to better track users' profiles from their product-related discussions. This paper presents the first analytical study on how users should best manage their social activities against potential personalized pricing, and how a seller should strategically adjust her pricing scheme to facilitate user profiling in social networks. We formulate a dynamic Bayesian game played between the seller and users under asymmetric information. The key challenge of analyzing this game comes from the double couplings between the seller and the users as well as among the users. Furthermore, the equilibrium analysis needs to ensure consistency between users' revealed information and the seller's belief under random user profiling. We address these challenges by alternately applying backward and forward induction, and successfully characterize the unique perfect Bayesian equilibrium (PBE) in closed form. Our analysis reveals that as the accuracy of profiling technology improves, the seller tends to raise the equilibrium uniform price to motivate users' increased social activities and facilitate user profiling. However, this results in most users being worse off after the informed consent policy is imposed to ensure users' awareness of data access and profiling practices by potential sellers. This finding suggests that recent regulatory evolution towards enhancing users' privacy awareness may have unintended consequences of reducing users' payoffs.</description>

      <title>Measuring the Hidden Cost of Data Valuation through Collective Disclosure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08869v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data valuation methods assign marginal utility to each data point that has contributed to the training of a machine learning model. If used directly as a payout mechanism, this creates a hidden cost of valuation, in which contributors with near-zero marginal value would receive nothing, even though their data had to be collected and assessed. To better formalize this cost, we introduce a conceptual and game-theoretic model, the Information Disclosure Game, between a Data Union (sometimes also called a data trust), a member-run agent representing contributors, and a Data Consumer (e.g., a platform). After first aggregating members' data, the DU releases information progressively by adding Laplacian noise under a differentially-private mechanism. Through simulations with strategies guided by data Shapley values and multi-armed bandit exploration, we demonstrate on a Yelp review helpfulness prediction task that data valuation inherently incurs an explicit acquisition cost and that the DU's collective disclosure policy changes how this cost is distributed across members.</description>

      <title>Convergence of Regret Matching in Potential Games and Constrained Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17067v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Regret matching (RM) -- and its modern variants -- is a foundational online algorithm that has been at the heart of many AI breakthrough results in solving benchmark zero-sum games, such as poker. Yet, surprisingly little is known so far in theory about its convergence beyond two-player zero-sum games. For example, whether regret matching converges to Nash equilibria in potential games has been an open problem for two decades. Even beyond games, one could try to use RM variants for general constrained optimization problems. Recent empirical evidence suggests that they -- particularly regret matching$^+$ (RM$^+$) -- attain strong performance on benchmark constrained optimization problems, outperforming traditional gradient descent-type algorithms.
  We show that RM$^+$ converges to an $\epsilon$-KKT point after $O_\epsilon(1/\epsilon^4)$ iterations, establishing for the first time that it is a sound and fast first-order optimizer. Our argument relates the KKT gap to the accumulated regret, two quantities that are entirely disparate in general but interact in an intriguing way in our setting, so much so that when regrets are bounded, our complexity bound improves all the way to $O_\epsilon(1/\epsilon^2)$. From a technical standpoint, while RM$^+$ does not have the usual one-step improvement property in general, we show that it does in a certain region that the algorithm will quickly reach and remain in thereafter. In sharp contrast, our second main result establishes a lower bound: RM, with or without alternation, can take an exponential number of iterations to reach a crude approximate solution even in two-player potential games. This represents the first worst-case separation between RM and RM$^+$. Our lower bound shows that convergence to coarse correlated equilibria in potential games is exponentially faster than convergence to Nash equilibria.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06518v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a class of two-player zero-sum Colonel Blotto games in which, after allocating soldiers across battlefields, players engage in (possibly distinct) normal-form games on each battlefield. Per-battlefield payoffs are parameterized by the soldier allocations. This generalizes the classical Blotto setting, where outcomes depend only on relative soldier allocations. We consider both discrete and continuous allocation models and examine two types of aggregate objectives: linear aggregation and worst-case battlefield value. For each setting, we analyze the existence and computability of Nash equilibrium. The general problem is not convex-concave, which limits the applicability of standard convex optimization techniques. However, we show that in several settings it is possible to reformulate the strategy space in a way where convex-concave structure is recovered. We evaluate the proposed methods on synthetic and real-world instances inspired by security applications, suggesting that our approaches scale well in practice.</description>

      <title>Fair Multi-agent Persuasion with Submodular Constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.08538v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of selection in the context of Bayesian persuasion. We are given multiple agents with hidden values (or quality scores), to whom resources must be allocated by a welfare-maximizing decision-maker. An intermediary with knowledge of the agents' values seeks to influence the outcome of the selection by designing informative signals and providing tie-breaking policies, so that when the receiver maximizes welfare over the resulting posteriors, the expected utilities of the agents (where utility is defined as allocation times value) achieve certain fairness properties. The fairness measure we will use is majorization, which simultaneously approximately maximizes all symmetric, monotone, concave functions of the utilities. We consider the general setting where the allocation to the agents needs to respect arbitrary submodular constraints, as given by the corresponding polymatroid.
  We present a signaling policy that, under a mild bounded rationality assumption on the receiver, achieves a logarithmically approximate majorized policy in this setting. The approximation ratio is almost best possible, and that significantly outperforms generic results that only yield linear approximations. A key component of our result is a structural characterization showing that the vector of agent utilities for a given signaling policy defines the base polytope of a different polymatroid, a result that may be of independent interest. In addition, we show that an arbitrarily good additive approximation to this vector can be produced in (weakly) polynomial time via the multiplicative weights update method.</description>

      <title>Online Price Competition under Generalized Linear Demands</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.10718v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study sequential price competition among $N$ sellers, each influenced by the pricing decisions of their rivals. Specifically, the demand function for each seller $i$ follows the single index model $\lambda_i(\mathbf{p}) = \mu_i(\langle \boldsymbol{\theta}_{i,0}, \mathbf{p} \rangle)$, with known increasing link $\mu_i$ and unknown parameter $\boldsymbol{\theta}_{i,0}$, where the vector $\mathbf{p}$ denotes the vector of prices offered by all the sellers simultaneously at a given instant. Each seller observes only their own realized demand -- unobservable to competitors -- and the prices set by rivals. Our framework generalizes existing approaches that focus solely on linear demand models. We propose a novel decentralized policy, PML-GLUCB, that combines penalized MLE with an upper-confidence pricing rule, removing the need for coordinated exploration phases across sellers -- which is integral to previous linear models -- and accommodating both binary and real-valued demand observations. Relative to a dynamic benchmark policy, each seller achieves $O(N^{2}\sqrt{T}\log(T))$ regret, which essentially matches the optimal rate known in the linear setting. A significant technical contribution of our work is the development of a variant of the elliptical potential lemma -- typically applied in single-agent systems -- adapted to our competitive multi-agent environment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03472v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by understanding the behavior of the Alternating Mirror Descent (AMD) algorithm for bilinear zero-sum games, we study the discretization of continuous-time Hamiltonian flow via the symplectic Euler method. We provide a framework for analysis using results from Hamiltonian dynamics, Lie algebra, and symplectic numerical integrators, with an emphasis on the existence and properties of a conserved quantity, the modified Hamiltonian (MH), for the symplectic Euler method. We compute the MH in closed-form when the original Hamiltonian is a quadratic function, and show that it generally differs from the other conserved quantity known previously in that case. We derive new error bounds on the MH when truncated at orders in the stepsize in terms of the number of iterations, $K$, and use these bounds to show an improved $\mathcal{O}(K^{1/5})$ total regret bound and an $\mathcal{O}(K^{-4/5})$ duality gap of the average iterates for AMD. Finally, we propose a conjecture which, if true, would imply that the total regret for AMD scales as $\mathcal{O}\left(K^{\varepsilon}\right)$ and the duality gap of the average iterates as $\mathcal{O}\left(K^{-1+\varepsilon}\right)$ for any $\varepsilon&gt;0$, and we can take $\varepsilon=0$ upon certain convergence conditions for the MH.</description>

      <title>Riemannian Manifold Learning for Stackelberg Games with Neural Flow Representations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05498v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel framework for online learning in Stackelberg general-sum games, where two agents, the leader and follower, engage in sequential turn-based interactions. At the core of this approach is a learned diffeomorphism that maps the joint action space to a smooth spherical Riemannian manifold, referred to as the Stackelberg manifold. This mapping, facilitated by neural normalizing flows, ensures the formation of tractable isoplanar subspaces, enabling efficient techniques for online learning. Leveraging the linearity of the agents' reward functions on the Stackelberg manifold, our construct allows the application of linear bandit algorithms. We then provide a rigorous theoretical basis for regret minimization on the learned manifold and establish bounds on the simple regret for learning Stackelberg equilibrium. This integration of manifold learning into game theory uncovers a previously unrecognized potential for neural normalizing flows as an effective tool for multi-agent learning. We present empirical results demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach compared to standard baselines, with applications spanning domains such as cybersecurity and economic supply chain optimization.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Swap Regret Minimization via KL-Calibration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16387v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Calibration is a fundamental concept that aims at ensuring the reliability of probabilistic predictions by aligning them with real-world outcomes. There is a surge of studies on new calibration measures that are easier to optimize compared to the classical $\ell_1$-Calibration while still having strong implications for downstream applications. One recent such example is the work by Fishelson et al. (2025) who show that it is possible to achieve $O(T^{1/3})$ pseudo $\ell_2$-Calibration error via minimizing pseudo swap regret of the squared loss, which in fact implies the same bound for all bounded proper losses with a smooth univariate form. In this work, we significantly generalize their result in the following ways: (a) in addition to smooth univariate forms, our algorithm also simultaneously achieves $O(T^{1/3})$ swap regret for any proper loss with a twice continuously differentiable univariate form (such as Tsallis entropy); (b) our bounds hold not only for pseudo swap regret that measures losses using the forecaster's distributions on predictions, but also hold for the actual swap regret that measures losses using the forecaster's actual realized predictions.
  We achieve so by introducing a new stronger notion of calibration called (pseudo) KL-Calibration, which we show is equivalent to the (pseudo) swap regret for log loss. We prove that there exists an algorithm that achieves $O(T^{1/3})$ KL-Calibration error and provide an explicit algorithm that achieves $O(T^{1/3})$ pseudo KL-Calibration error. Moreover, we show that the same algorithm achieves $O(T^{1/3}(\log T)^{-1/3}\log(T/\delta))$ swap regret w.p. $\ge 1-\delta$ for any proper loss with a smooth univariate form, which implies $O(T^{1/3})$ $\ell_2$-Calibration error. A technical contribution of our work is a new randomized rounding procedure and a non-uniform discretization scheme to minimize the swap regret for log loss.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.10567v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider finite-strategy approximations of infinite-strategy evolutionary games. We prove that such approximations converge to the true dynamics over finite-time intervals, under mild regularity conditions which are satisfied by classical examples, e.g., the replicator dynamics. We identify and formalize novel characteristics in evolutionary games: choice mobility, and its complement choice paralysis. Choice mobility is shown to be a key sufficient condition for the long-time limiting behavior of finite-strategy approximations to coincide with that of the true infinite-strategy game. An illustrative example is constructed to showcase how choice paralysis may lead to the infinite-strategy game getting "stuck," even though every finite approximation converges to equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Good-for-MDP State Reduction for Stochastic LTL Planning</title>

Abstract: We study stochastic planning problems in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with goals specified in Linear Temporal Logic (LTL). The state-of-the-art approach transforms LTL formulas into good-for-MDP (GFM) automata, which feature a restricted form of nondeterminism. These automata are then composed with the MDP, allowing the agent to resolve the nondeterminism during policy synthesis. A major factor affecting the scalability of this approach is the size of the generated automata. In this paper, we propose a novel GFM state-space reduction technique that significantly reduces the number of automata states. Our method employs a sophisticated chain of transformations, leveraging recent advances in good-for-games minimisation developed for adversarial settings. In addition to our theoretical contributions, we present empirical results demonstrating the practical effectiveness of our state-reduction technique. Furthermore, we introduce a direct construction method for formulas of the form $\mathsf{G}\mathsf{F}\varphi$, where $\varphi$ is a co-safety formula. This construction is provably single-exponential in the worst case, in contrast to the general doubly-exponential complexity. Our experiments confirm the scalability advantages of this specialised construction.</description>
