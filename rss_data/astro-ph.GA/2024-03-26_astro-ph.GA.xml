      <title>The Influence of Baryons on Low-mass Haloes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Voids-within-Voids-within-Voids (VVV) project used dark-matter-only simulations to study the abundance and structure of dark matter haloes over the full mass range populated in the standard $\Lambda\mathrm{CDM}$ cosmology. Here we explore how baryonic effects modify these results for $z=0$ halo masses in the range $10^4$ to $10^7~\mathrm{M_\odot}$, below the threshold for galaxy formation. Our main study focuses on three simulations from identical initial conditions at $z=127$, one following dark matter only, one including non-radiative gas, and one additionally including the baryonic physics relevant in this halo mass range (cooling and photoheating). In the non-radiative simulation, above $10^{5.5}~\mathrm{M_\odot}$, halo abundance and internal structure are very similar to the dark-matter-only simulation, and the baryon to dark matter ratio is everywhere close to the cosmic value. At lower mass, this ratio drops and haloes are less concentrated and less massive in the non-radiative case. Test simulations at higher resolution show this to be mainly a resolution effect; the expected drop in baryon content due to residual pressure effects only becomes substantial for $z=0$ haloes below $\sim 10^{2.7}~\mathrm{M_\odot}$. However, gas is heated by reionization at $z=6$ in our ``full physics'' run, and this results in almost complete expulsion of gas from all haloes in our simulated mass range. This suppresses the halo mass function by $\sim 30 \%$, lowers halo concentration, and consequently weakens the dark matter annihilation signal by $\sim 40-60 \%$.</description>

      <title>The MUSE Ultra Deep Field (MUDF). V. Characterizing the Mass-Metallicity Relation for Low Mass Galaxies at $\boldsymbol{z}$ $\boldsymbol{\sim}$ 1 - 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using more than 100 galaxies in the MUSE Ultra Deep Field with spectroscopy from the Hubble Space Telescope's Wide Field Camera 3 and the Very Large Telescope's Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer, we extend the gas-phase mass-metallicity relation (MZR) at $z\approx\,$1$\,$-$\,$2 down to stellar masses of M$_{\star}$ $\approx$ 10$^{7.5}$ M$_{\odot}$. The sample reaches six times lower in stellar mass and star formation rate (SFR) than previous HST studies at these redshifts, and we find that galaxy metallicities decrease to log(O/H) + 12 $\approx$ 7.8 $\pm$ 0.1 (15% solar) at log(M$_{\star}$/M$_{\odot}$) $\approx$ 7.5, without evidence of a turnover in the shape of the MZR at low masses. We validate our strong-line metallicities using the direct method for sources with [O III] $\lambda$4363 and [O III] $\lambda$1666 detections, and find excellent agreement between the techniques. The [O III] $\lambda$1666-based metallicities double existing measurements with S/N $\geq$ 5 for unlensed sources at $z~&gt;$ 1, validating the strong-line calibrations up to $z \sim$2.5. We confirm that the MZR resides $\sim$0.3 dex lower in metallicity than local galaxies and is consistent with the fundamental metallicity relation (FMR) if the low mass slope varies with SFR. At lower redshifts ($z\sim$0.5) our sample reaches $\sim$0.5 dex lower in SFR than current calibrations and we find enhanced metallicities that are consistent with extrapolating the MZR to lower SFRs. Finally, we detect only a $\sim$0.1 dex difference in the metallicities of galaxies in groups versus isolated environments. These results are based on robust calibrations and reach the lowest masses and SFRs that are accessible with HST, providing a critical foundation for studies with the Webb and Roman Space Telescopes.</description>

      <title>Supernova Remnant properties and Luminosity Functions in NGC 7793 using MUSE IFS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study we use MUSE Integral Field Spectroscopy (IFS), along with multi-line diagnostics, for the optical identification of Supernova Remnants (SNRs) in the galaxy NGC 7793. We find in total 238 SNR candidates, 225 of them new identifications, increasing significantly the number of known SNRs in this galaxy. The velocity dispersion of the candidate SNRs was calculated, giving a mean value of 27 $ km\,s^{ -1} $. We construct the H$\rm \alpha$, [S II], [O III], and [S II] - H$\rm \alpha$ luminosity functions, and for the first time, the [N II], [N II] - H$\rm \alpha$, [N II] - [S II], [O III] - [S II], and [O III] - [N II] luminosity functions of the candidate SNRs. Shock models, along with the observed multi-line information were used, in order to estimate shock velocities. The $\sim$ 65% of the SNRs present velocities &lt; 300 $ km\,s^{ -1} $. There is a clear correlation between shock velocity and [O III]/H$\rm \beta$ ratio, and a less clear but still evident correlation in the relation between shock velocity and the [S II]/H$\rm \alpha$, [N II]/H$\rm \alpha$ ratios. We also use the [S II]6716/31 ratio of the SNR candidates to calculate their post-shock density, assuming different temperatures. The median value of the density of our sample is $\sim$ 80 $ cm^{ -3} $, for a temperature of T = $10^4\,K$. No correlation between shock velocity and density, or density and SNRs with [S II]/H$\rm \alpha$ &gt; 0.4 and [S II]/H$\rm \alpha$ &lt; 0.4 is observed.</description>

      <title>AXES-SDSS: comparison of SDSS galaxy groups with All-sky X-ray Extended Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the picture of X-ray emission of groups through the study of systematic differences in the optical properties of groups with and without X-ray emission and study the effect of large-scale density field on scaling relations. We present the identification of X-ray galaxy groups using a combination of RASS and SDSS data. We include new X-ray reanalysis of RASS, to include very extended (up to a size of half a degree) sources and account for differences in the limiting sensitivity towards compact and very extended X-ray emission. X-ray groups exhibit less scatter in the scaling relations and selecting the groups based on the extended X-ray emission leads to an additional scatter reduction. Most of the scatter for the optical groups is associated with a small (6%) fraction of outliers, primarily associated with low optical luminosity groups found in dense regions of the cosmic web. These groups are the primary candidates for being the contaminants in the optical group catalogues. Removing those groups from the optical group sample using optically measured properties only, leads to a substantial reduction in the scatter in the most scaling relations of the optical groups. We find a density dependence of both the X-ray and optical luminosity of groups, which we associate with the assembly bias. Abridged.</description>

      <title>AXES-2MRS: A new all-sky catalogue of extended X-ray galaxy groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new all-sky catalogue of X-ray detected groups (AXES-2MRS), based on the identification of large X-ray sources found in the ROSAT All-Sky Survey (RASS) with the Two Micron Redshift Survey (2MRS) Bayesian Group Catalogue. We study the basic properties of these galaxy groups to gain insights into the effect of different group selections on the properties. In addition to X-ray luminosity coming from shallow survey data of RASS, we have obtained detailed X-ray properties of the groups by matching the AXES-2MRS catalogue to archival X-ray observations by XMM-Newton and complemented this by adding the published XMM-Newton results on galaxy clusters in our catalogue. We analyse temperature and density to the lowest overdensity accessible by the data, obtaining hydrostatic mass estimates and comparing them to the velocity dispersions of the groups. We find a large spread in the central mass to virial mass ratios for galaxy groups in the XMM-Newton subsample. This can either indicate large non-thermal pressure of galaxy groups affecting our X-ray mass measurements, or the effect of a diversity of halo concentrations on X-ray properties of galaxy groups. Previous catalogues, based on detecting the peak of the X-ray emission preferentially sample the high-concentration groups, while our new catalogue includes many low-concentration groups.

      <title>Dual AGNs: Precursors of Binary Supermassive Black Hole Formation and Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The presence of dual active galactic nuclei (AGN) on scales of a few tens of kpc can be used to study merger-induced accretion on supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and offer insights about SMBH mergers, using dual AGNs as merger precursors. In this study, we use the Romulus25 cosmological simulation to investigate the properties and evolution of dual AGNs. We first analyze the properties of AGNs ($L_{bol} &gt; 10^{43} \rm erg/s$) and their neighboring SMBHs (any SMBHs closer than 30 pkpc to an AGN) at $z \leq 2$. This is our underlying population. Subsequently, we applied the luminosity threshold of $L_{bol} &gt; 10^{43} erg/s$ to the neighboring SMBHs thereby identifying dual and multiple AGNs in our simulation. We examined the properties and statistics of dual AGNs in comparison to single AGNs. Our findings indicate an increase in the number of both single and dual AGNs from lower to higher redshifts. All dual AGNs in our sample resulted from major mergers. Compared with the single AGN population, duals are characterized by a lower black hole to halo mass ratio. We found that the properties of dual AGN host halos, including halo mass, stellar mass, star formation rate (SFR), and gas mass, are generally consistent with those of single AGN halos, albeit tending towards the higher end of their respective property ranges. Our analysis uncovered a diverse array of evolutionary patterns among dual AGNs, including rapidly evolving systems, slower ones, and instances where SMBH mergers are ineffective.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Multi-wavelength Thermal Dust Polarization from the Orion Molecular Cloud in Light of the Radiative Torque Paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dust grains are important in various astrophysical processes and serve as indicators of interstellar medium structures, density, and mass. Understanding their physical properties and chemical composition is crucial in astrophysics. Dust polarization is a valuable tool for studying these properties. The Radiative Torque (RAT) paradigm, which includes Radiative Torque Alignment (RAT-A) and Radiative Torque Disruption (RAT-D), is essential to interpret the dust polarization data and constrain the fundamental properties of dust grains. However, it has been used primarily to interpret observations at a single wavelength. In this study, we analyze the thermal dust polarization spectrum obtained from observations with SOFIA/HAWC+ and JCMT/POL-2 in the OMC-1 region and compare the observational data with our numerical results using the RAT paradigm. We find that the dense gas exhibits a positive spectral slope, whereas the warm regions show a negative one. We demonstrate that a one-layer dust (one-phase) model can only reproduce the observed spectra at certain locations and cannot match those with prominent V-shape spectra (for which the degree of polarization initially decreases with wavelength from 54 to $\sim$ 300$\,\mu$m and then increases at longer wavelengths). To address this, we improve our model by incorporating two dust components (warm and cold) along the line of sight, resulting in a two-phase model. This improved model successfully reproduces the V-shaped spectra. The best model corresponds to a mixture composition of silicate and carbonaceous grains in the cold medium. Finally, by assuming the plausible model of grain alignment, we infer the inclination angle of the magnetic fields in OMC-1. This approach represents an important step toward better understanding the physics of grain alignment and constraining 3D magnetic fields using dust polarization spectrum.</description>

      <title>RIOJA. Complex Dusty Starbursts in a Major Merger B14-65666 at z=7.15</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present JWST NIRCam imaging of B14-65666 ("Big Three Dragons"), a bright Lyman-break galaxy system ($M_\text{UV}=-22.5$ mag) at $z=7.15$. The high angular resolution of NIRCam reveals the complex morphology of two galaxy components: galaxy E has a compact core (E-core), surrounded by diffuse, extended, rest-frame optical emission, which is likely to be tidal tails; and galaxy W has a clumpy and elongated morphology with a blue UV slope ($\beta_\text{UV}=-2.2\pm0.1$). The flux excess, F356W$-$F444W, peaks at the E-core ($1.05^{+0.08}_{-0.09}$ mag), tracing the presence of strong [OIII] 4960,5008 \r{A} emission. ALMA archival data show that the bluer galaxy W is brighter in dust continua than the redder galaxy E, while the tails are bright in [OIII] 88 $\mathrm{\mu m}$. The UV/optical and sub-mm SED fitting confirms that B14-65666 is a major merger in a starburst phase as derived from the stellar mass ratio (3:1 to 2:1) and the star-formation rate, $\simeq1$ dex higher than the star-formation main sequence at the same redshift. The galaxy E is a dusty ($A_\text{V}=1.2\pm0.1$ mag) starburst with a possible high dust temperature ($\ge63$-$68$ K). The galaxy W would have a low dust temperature ($\le27$-$33$ K) or patchy stellar-and-dust geometry, as suggested from the infrared excess (IRX) and $\beta_\text{UV}$ diagram. The high optical-to-FIR [OIII] line ratio of the E-core shows its lower gas-phase metallicity ($\simeq0.2$ Z$_{\odot}$) than the galaxy W. These results agree with a scenario where major mergers disturb morphology and induce nuclear dusty starbursts triggered by less-enriched inflows. B14-65666 shows a picture of complex stellar buildup processes during major mergers in the epoch of reionization.</description>

      <title>Galaxy groups as the ultimate probe of AGN feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The co-evolution between supermassive black holes and their environment is most directly traced by the hot atmospheres of dark matter halos. Cooling of the hot atmosphere supplies the central regions with fresh gas, igniting active galactic nuclei (AGN) with long duty cycles. Outflows from the central engine tightly couple with the surrounding gaseous medium and provide the dominant heating source preventing runaway cooling. Every major modern hydrodynamical simulation suite now includes a prescription for AGN feedback to reproduce realistic populations of galaxies. However, the mechanisms governing the feeding/feedback cycle between the central black holes and their surrounding galaxies and halos are still poorly understood. Galaxy groups are uniquely suited to constrain the mechanisms governing the cooling-heating balance, as the energy supplied by the central AGN can exceed the gravitational binding energy of halo gas particles. Here we provide a brief overview of our knowledge of the impact of AGN on the hot atmospheres of galaxy groups, with a specific focus on the thermodynamic profiles of groups. We then present our on-going efforts to improve on the implementation of AGN feedback in galaxy evolution models by providing precise benchmarks on the properties of galaxy groups. We introduce the \XMM~ Group AGN Project (X-GAP), a large program on \XMM~ targeting a sample of 49 galaxy groups out to $R_{500c}$.</description>

      <title>Teaming-up radio and submm-FIR observations to probe dusty star-forming galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the benefits of teaming up data from the radio to the far- 1 infrared (FIR) regime for the characterization of Dusty Star-Forming Galaxies (DSFGs). These galaxies 2 are thought to be the star-forming progenitors of local massive quiescent galaxies, and play a pivotal 3 role in the reconstruction of the cosmic star formation rate density up to high redshift. Due to their 4 dust-enshrouded nature, DSFGs are often invisible in the near-infrared/Optical/UV bands. Therefore, 5 they necessitate observations at longer wavelengths, primarily the FIR, where dust emission occurs, 6 and radio, which is not affected by dust absorption. Combining data from these two spectral windows 7 makes it possible to characterize even the dustiest objects, enabling the retrieval of information about 8 their age, dust temperature, and star-formation status, and facilitates the differentiation between 9 various galaxy populations that evolve throughout cosmic history. Despite the detection of faint radio 10 sources being a challenging task, this study demonstrates that an effective strategy to build statistically 11 relevant samples of DSFGs would be reaching deep sensitivities in the radio band, even restricted to 12 smaller areas, and then combining these radio observations with FIR/submm data. Additionally, 13 the paper quantifies the improvement in the Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) reconstruction of 14 DSFGs by incorporating ALMA band measurements, in particular, in its upgraded status thanks to 15 the anticipated Wideband Sensitivity Upgrade.</description>

      <title>The Physical Origin of the Mass-Size Relation and Its Scatter of Disk Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Utilizing a kinematic decomposition of simulated galaxies, we focus on galaxies with tiny kinematically inferred stellar halos, indicative of weak external influences. We investigate the intricate interplay between internal (natural) and external (nurture) processes in shaping the scaling relationships of specific angular momentum ($j_\star$), stellar mass ($M_\star$), and size of disk galaxies within the IllustrisTNG simulation. The correlation among mass, size, and angular momentum of galaxies is examined by comparing simulations with observations and the theoretical predictions of the exponential hypothesis. Galaxies with tiny stellar halos exhibit a large scatter in the $j_\star$-$M_\star$ relation, which suggests that it is inherently present in their initial conditions. The analysis reveals that the disks of these galaxies adhere to the exponential hypothesis, resulting in a tight fiducial $j_\star$-$M_\star$-scale length (size) relation that is qualitatively consistent with observations. The inherent scatter in $j_\star$ provides a robust explanation for the mass-size relation and its substantial variability. Notably, galaxies that are moderately influenced by external processes closely adhere to a scaling relation akin to that of galaxies with tiny stellar halos. This result underscores the dominant role of internal processes in shaping the overall $j_\star$-$M_\star$ and mass-size relation, with external effects playing a relatively minor role in disk galaxies. Furthermore, the correlation between galaxy size and the virial radius of the dark matter halo exists but fails to provide strong evidence of the connection between galaxies and their parent dark matter halos.</description>

      <title>Rotational Spectrum and First Interstellar Detection of 2-Methoxyethanol Using ALMA Observations of NGC 6334I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use both chirped-pulse Fourier transform and frequency modulated absorption spectroscopy to study the rotational spectrum of 2-methoxyethanol in several frequency regions ranging from 8.7-500 GHz. The resulting rotational parameters permitted a search for this molecule in Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations toward the massive protocluster NGC 6334I as well as source B of the low-mass protostellar system IRAS 16293-2422. 25 rotational transitions are observed in the ALMA Band 4 data toward NGC 6334I, resulting in the first interstellar detection of 2-methoxyethanol. A column density of $1.3_{-0.9}^{+1.4} \times 10^{17}$ cm$^{-2}$ is derived at an excitation temperature of $143_{-39}^{+31}$ K. However, molecular signal is not observed in the Band 7 data toward IRAS 16293-2422B and an upper limit column density of $2.5 \times 10^{15}$ cm$^{-2}$ is determined. Various possible formation pathways--including radical recombination and insertion reactions--are discussed. We also investigate physical differences between the two interstellar sources that could result in the observed abundance variations.</description>

      <title>The Unified Era: An understanding journey from observations to the Unified Model of Active Galactic Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Unified Model of Active Galactic Nuclei (UMAGN) is a comprehensive theoretical framework aimed at elucidating the diverse observations of AGN, encompassing quasars and Seyfert galaxies. The Model attributes the observed variations to different orientations of a surrounding matter disk around a supermassive black hole (SMBH), with the primary factor influencing observational diversity being the alignment of the AGN with the observer's line of sight. We present a comprehensive overview of the observational evidence, empirical and theoretical research, tracing key milestones that led to a unified perspective. We encapsulate the scientific journey culminating in the proposal of the UMAGN, including insights into the accretion disk, torus, and relativistic jet, and emphasize the properties of objects within UMAGN. Additionally, we underscore recent progress in multimessenger research involving electromagnetic waves, gravitational waves, astroparticles, and neutrinos, notably through collaborations such as the Event Horizon Telescope, LIGO/Virgo, IceCube, Pierre Auger, and KM3Net. We argue that these advancements present opportunities to enhance and refine UMAGN, contributing to a deeper understanding of AGNs and their implications for the formation and evolution of galaxies. The convergence of observational and theoretical research, coupled with emerging multimessenger techniques, paves the way for further strides in comprehending these enigmatic cosmic phenomena.</description>

      <title>Quasar Island - Three new $z\sim6$ quasars, including a lensed candidate, identified with contrastive learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Of the hundreds of $z\gtrsim6$ quasars discovered to date, only one is known to be gravitationally lensed, despite the high lensing optical depth expected at $z\gtrsim6$. High-redshift quasars are typically identified in large-scale surveys by applying strict photometric selection criteria, in particular by imposing non-detections in bands blueward of the Lyman-$\alpha$ line. Such procedures by design prohibit the discovery of lensed quasars, as the lensing foreground galaxy would contaminate the photometry of the quasar. We present a novel quasar selection methodology, applying contrastive learning (an unsupervised machine learning technique) to Dark Energy Survey imaging data. We describe the use of this technique to train a neural network which isolates an 'island' of 11 sources, of which 7 are known $z\sim6$ quasars. Of the remaining four, three are newly discovered quasars (J0109-5424, $z=6.07$; J0122-4609, $z=5.99$; J0603-3923, $z=5.94$), as confirmed by follow-up Gemini-South/GMOS and archival NTT/EFOSC2 spectroscopy, implying a 91 per cent efficiency for our novel selection method; the final object on the island is a brown dwarf. In one case (J0109-5424), emission below the Lyman limit unambiguously indicates the presence of a foreground source, though high-resolution optical/near-infrared imaging is still needed to confirm the quasar's lensed (multiply-imaged) nature. Detection in the g band has led this quasar to escape selection by traditional colour cuts. Our findings demonstrate that machine learning techniques can thus play a key role in unveiling populations of quasars missed by traditional methods.</description>

      <title>Compatibility of JWST results with exotic halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is unveiling astounding results about the first few hundred million years of life of the Universe, delivering images of galaxies at very high redshifts. Here, we develop a UV luminosity function model for high-redshift galaxies, considering parameters such as the stellar formation rate, dust extinction, and halo mass function. Calibration of this luminosity function model using UV luminosity data at redshifts z = 4-7 yields optimal parameter values. Testing the model against data at higher redshifts reveals successful accommodation of the data at z = 8-9, but challenges emerge at z~13. Our findings suggest a negligible role of dust extinction at the highest redshifts, prompting a modification of the stellar formation rate to incorporate a larger fraction of luminous objects per massive halo, consistently with similar recent studies. This effect could be attributed to mundane explanations such as unknown evolution of standard astrophysics at high redshift or to the existence of exotic objects at high redshift. We comment on this latter possibility.</description>

      <title>The imprints of galaxy cluster internal dynamics on the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Forthcoming measurements of the Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) effect in galaxy clusters will dramatically improve our understanding of the main intra-cluster medium (ICM) properties and how they depend on the particular thermal and dynamical state of the associated clusters. Using a sample of simulated galaxy clusters we assess the impact of the ICM internal dynamics on both the thermal and kinetic SZ effects (tSZ and kSZ, respectively). We produce synthetic maps of the SZ effect, for the simulated clusters. For each galaxy cluster in the sample, its dynamical state is estimated by using a combination of well-established indicators. We use the correlations between SZ maps and cluster dynamical state, to look for the imprints of the evolutionary events, mainly mergers, on the SZ signals. The kinetic effect shows a remarkable correlation with the dynamical state: unrelaxed clusters present a higher radial profile and an overall stronger signal at all masses and radii. Furthermore, the kSZ signal is correlated with rotation for relaxed clusters, while for the disturbed systems the effect is dominated by other motions such as bulk flows, turbulence, etc. The kSZ effect shows a dipolar pattern when averaging over cluster dynamical classes, especially for the relaxed population. This feature can be exploited to stack multiple kSZ maps in order to recover a stronger dipole signal that would be correlated with the global rotation properties of the sample. The SZ effect can be used as a tool to estimate the dynamical state of galaxy clusters, especially to segregate those clusters with a quiescent evolution from those with a rich record of recent merger events. Our results suggest that the forthcoming observational data measuring the SZ signal in clusters could be used as a complementary strategy to classify the evolutionary history of galaxy clusters.</description>

      <title>Cosmic hide and seek: the volumetric rate of X-ray quasi-periodic eruptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-wavelength extragalactic nuclear transients, particularly those detectable as multi-messengers, are among the primary drivers for the next-generation observatories. X-ray quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) are the most recent and perhaps most peculiar addition to this group. Here, we report a first estimate of the volumetric rate of QPEs based on the first four discoveries with the eROSITA X-ray telescope onboard the Spectrum Roentgen Gamma observatory. Under the assumption, supported by a suite of simulated light curves, that these four sources sample the intrinsic population somewhat homogeneously, we correct for their detection efficiency and compute a QPE abundance of $\mathscr{R}_{{\rm vol}} = 0.60_{-0.43}^{+4.73} \times 10^{-6}\,$Mpc$^{-3}$ above an intrinsic average $\log L_{\rm 0.5-2.0\,keV}^{\rm peak} &gt; 41.7$. Since the exact lifetime of QPEs ($\tau_{\rm life}$) is currently not better defined than between a few years or few decades, we convert this to a formation rate of $\mathscr{R}_{\rm vol}/\tau_{\rm life}\approx 0.6 \times 10^{-7} (\tau_{\rm life}/10\,\mathrm{y})^{-1}\,$Mpc$^{-3}\,$year$^{-1}$. As a comparison, this value is a factor $\sim10\,\tau_{\rm life}$ times smaller than the formation rate of tidal disruption events. The origin of QPEs is still debated, although lately most models suggest that they are the electromagnetic counterpart of extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs). In this scenario, the QPE rate would thus be the first-ever constraint (i.e. a lower limit) to the EMRI rate from observations alone. Future discoveries of QPEs and advances in their theoretical modeling will consolidate or rule out their use for constraining the number of EMRIs detectable by the LISA mission.</description>

      <title>Runaway OB Stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud III. Updated Kinematics and Insights on Dynamical vs. Supernova Ejections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use the kinematics of field OB stars to estimate the frequencies of runaway stars generated by the dynamical ejection scenario (DES), the binary supernova scenario (BSS), and the combined two-step mechanism. We update the proper motions for field OB and OBe stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) using Gaia DR3. Our sample now contains 336 stars from the Runaways and Isolated O-Type Star Spectroscopic Survey of the SMC (RIOTS4), and we update our algorithm to calculate more accurate velocities compared to those obtained previously from DR2. We find a decrease in median velocity from 39 to 29 km/s, implying that the proper motions from our previous work were systematically overestimated. We present the velocity distribution for OBe stars and quantitatively compare it to those of non-compact binaries and high-mass X-ray binaries. We confirm that OBe stars appear to be dominated by the BSS and are likely post-SN binary systems, further supporting the mass-transfer model to explain the origin of their emission-line disks. In contrast, normal OB stars may show a bimodal velocity distribution, as may be expected from different processes that occur with dynamical ejections. The kinematics of fast-rotating OB stars are similar to those of normal OB stars rather than OBe stars, suggesting that the origin of their high v_r*sin(i) is different from that of OBe stars. We update our model parameters describing the kinematic origins of the SMC field population, still confirming that for runaway stars, the DES mechanism dominates, and two-step ejections seem comparable in frequency to pure BSS ejections.</description>

      <title>Galaxy spin direction asymmetry in JWST deep fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The unprecedented imaging power of JWST provides new abilities to observe the shapes of objects in the early Universe in a way that has not been possible before. Recently, JWST acquired a deep field image inside the same field imaged in the past as the HST Ultra Deep Field. Computer-based quantitative analysis of spiral galaxies in that field shows that among 34 galaxies for which their rotation of direction can be determined by the shapes of the arms, 24 rotate clockwise, and just 10 rotate counterclockwise. The one-tailed binomial distribution probability to have asymmetry equal or stronger than the observed asymmetry by chance is $\sim$0.012. While the analysis is limited by the small size of the data, the observed asymmetry is aligned with all relevant previous large-scale analyses from all premier digital sky surveys, all show a higher number of galaxies rotating clockwise in that part of the sky, and the magnitude of the asymmetry increases as the redshift gets higher. This paper also provides data and analysis to reproduce previous experiments suggesting that the distribution of galaxy rotation in the Universe is random, to show that the exact same data used in these studies in fact show non-random distribution, and in excellent agreement with the results shown here. These findings reinforce consideration of the possibility that the directions of rotation of spiral galaxies as observed from Earth are not necessarily randomly distributed. The explanation can be related to the large-scale structure of the Universe, but can also be related to a possible anomaly in the physics of galaxy rotation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In previous work we have shown that the dipole in the low redshift supernovae of the Pantheon+SH0ES data does not agree with the one inferred from the velocity of the solar system as obtained from CMB data. We interpreted this as the presence of significant bulk velocities. In this paper we study the monopole, dipole and quadrupole in the Pantheon+SH0ES data. We find that in addition to the dipole also both, the monopole and the quadrupole are detected with high significance. They are of similar amplitudes as the bulk flow. While the monopole is only significant at very low redshift, the quadrupole even increases with redshift.</description>

      <title>X-ray Properties of the Luminous Quasar PG 1634+706 at z = 1.337 from SRG and XMM-Newton Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the fall of 2019, during the in-flight calibration phase of the SRG observatory, the onboard eROSITA and Mikhail Pavlinsky ART-XC telescopes carried out a series of observations of PG 1634+706 - one of the most luminous (an X-ray luminosity $\sim 10^{46}$ erg/s) quasars in the Universe at $z&lt;2$. Approximately at the same dates this quasar was also observed by the XMM-Newton observatory. Although the object had already been repeatedly studied in X-rays previously, its new observations allowed its energy spectrum to be measured more accurately in the wide range $1-30$ keV (in the quasar rest frame). Its spectrum can be described by a two-component model that consists of a power-law continuum with a slope $\Gamma\approx 1.9$ and a broadened iron emission line at an energy of about 6.4 keV. The X-ray variability of the quasar was also investigated. On time scales of the order of several hours (here and below, in the source rest frame) the X-ray luminosity does not exhibit a statistically significant variability. However, it changed noticeably from observation to observation in the fall of 2019, having increased approximately by a factor of 1.5 in 25 days. A comparison of the new SRG and XMM-Newton measurements with the previous measurements of other X-ray observatories has shown that in the entire 17-year history of observations of the quasar PG 1634+706 its X-ray luminosity has varied by no more than a factor of 2.5, while the variations on time scales of several weeks and several years are comparable in amplitude.</description>

      <title>Cosmic evolution of black hole-spin and galaxy orientations: clues from the NewHorizon and Galactica simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03712v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: (Reduced) Using the recent cosmological high-resolution zoom-in simulations, NewHorizon and Galactica, in which the evolution of black hole spin is followed on the fly, we have tracked the cosmic history of a hundred of black holes (BHs) with a mass greater than 2x10^4 Ms. For each of them, we have studied the variations of the three dimensional angle (Psi) subtended between the BH spins and the angular momentum vectors of their host galaxies. The analysis of the individual evolution of the most massive BHs suggests that they are generally passing by three different regimes. First, for a short period after their birth, low mass BHs (&lt;3x10^4 Ms) are rapidly spun up by gas accretion and their spin tends to be aligned with their host galaxy spin. Then follows a second phase in which the accretion of gas onto low mass BHs (&lt;10^5 Ms) is quite chaotic and inefficient, reflecting the complex and disturbed morphologies of forming proto-galaxies at high redshifts. The variations of Psi are rather erratic during this phase and are mainly driven by the rapid changes of the direction of the galaxy angular momentum. Then, in a third and long phase, BHs are generally well settled in the center of galaxies around which the gas accretion becomes much more coherent (&gt;10^5 Ms). In this case, the BH spins tend to be well aligned with the angular momentum of their host galaxy and this configuration is generally stable even though BH merger episodes can temporally induce misalignment. We have also derived the distributions of cos(Psi) at different redshifts and found that BHs and galaxy spins are generally aligned. Finally, based on a Monte Carlo method, we also predict statistics for the 2-d projected spin-orbit angles lambda. In particular, the distribution of lambda traces well the alignment tendency in the 3-d analysis. Such predictions provide an interesting background for future observational analyses.</description>

      <title>New insights on the dynamics of satellite galaxies: effects of the figure rotation of a host galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08143v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a mechanism to form and keep a planar spatial distribution of satellite galaxies in the Milky Way (MW), which is called the satellite plane. It has been pointed out that the {\Lambda}CDM cosmological model hardly explains the existence of such a satellite plane, so it is regarded as one of the serious problems in the current cosmology. We here focus on a rotation of the gravitational potential of a host galaxy, i.e., so-called a figure rotation, following the previous suggestion that this effect can induce the tilt of a so-called tube orbit. Our calculation shows that a figure rotation of a triaxial potential forms a stable orbital plane perpendicular to the rotational axis of the potential. Thus, it is suggested that the MW's dark halo is rotating with its axis being around the normal line of the satellite plane. Additionally, we find that a small velocity dispersion of satellites is required to keep the flatness of the planar structure, namely the standard derivation of their velocities perpendicular to the satellite plane needs smaller than their mean rotational velocity on the plane. Although not all the MW's satellites satisfy this condition, some fraction of them called member satellites, which are prominently on the plane, satisfy it. We suggest that this picture explaining the observed satellite plane can be achieved by the filamentary accretion of dark matter associated with the formation of the MW and a group infall of member satellites along this cosmic filament.</description>

      <title>What is the nature of Little Red Dots and what is not, MIRI SMILES edition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08782v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study little red dots (LRD) detected by JADES and covered by the SMILES MIRI survey. Our sample contains 31 sources, $\sim70$% detected in the two bluest MIRI bands, 40% in redder filters. The median/quartiles redshifts are $z=6.9_{5.9}^{7.7}$ (55% spectroscopic). We analyze the rest-frame ultraviolet through near/mid-infrared spectral energy distributions of LRDs combining NIRCam and MIRI observations, using a variety of modeling techniques that include emission from stars, dust, and (un)obscured active galactic nuclei (AGN). The NIRCam$-$MIRI colors, for $\geq10$ $\mu$m, are bluer than direct pure emission from AGN tori; the spectral slope flattens in the rest-frame near-infrared, consistent with a 1.6 $\mu$m stellar bump. Both observations imply that stellar emission makes the dominant contribution at these wavelengths, expediting a stellar mass estimation: the median/quartiles are $\log \mathrm{M_\star/M_\odot}=9.4_{9.1}^{9.7}$. The number density of LRDs is $10^{-4.0\pm0.1}$ Mpc$^{-3}$, accounting for $14\pm3$% of the global population of galaxies with similar redshifts and masses. The flat ultraviolet spectral range is dominated by young stars. The rest-frame near/mid-infrared (2-4 $\mu$m) spectral slope reveals significant amounts of dust (bolometric stellar attenuation $\sim3-4$ mag) heated by strong radiation fields arising from highly embedded compact sources. Our models imply $&lt;0.4$ kpc heating knots, containing dust-enshrouded OB stars or an AGN producing a similar radiation field, obscured by $\mathrm{A(V)}&gt;10$ mag. We conclude that LRDs are extremely intense and compact starburst galaxies with mass-weighted ages 5-10 Myr, very efficient in producing dust, their global energy output dominated by the direct and dust-recycled emission from OB stars, with some contribution from obscured AGN in the mid-infrared.</description>

      <title>From giant clumps to clouds IV: extreme star-forming clumps on top of universal cloud scaling relations in gas-rich galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15557v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The clumpy nature of gas-rich galaxies at cosmic noon raises the question of universality of the scaling relations and average properties of the star-forming structures. Using controlled simulations of disk galaxies and varying only the gas fraction, we show that the influence of the galactic environments (large-scale turbulence, tides, shear) contributes, together with the different regime of instabilities, to setting a diversity of physical conditions for the formation and evolution of gas clumps from low to high gas fractions. However, the distributions of gas clumps at all gas fractions follow similar scaling relations as Larson's, suggesting the universality of median properties. Yet, we find that the scatter around these relations significantly increases with the gas fraction, allowing for the presence of massive, large, and highly turbulent clouds in gas-rich disks in addition to a more classical population of clouds. Clumps with an excess of mass for their size are slightly denser, more centrally concentrated, and host more abundant and faster star formation. We find that the star formation activity (rate, efficiency, depletion time) correlates much more strongly with the excess of mass than with the mass itself. Our results suggest the existence of universal scaling relations for gas clumps but with redshift-dependent scatters, which calls for deeper and more complete census of the populations of star-forming clumps and young stellar clusters at cosmic noon and beyond.</description>

Abstract: Many models have been proposed to minimize the dark matter (DM) content in various astronomical objects at every scale in the Universe. The most widely known model isMOdified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND). MOND was first published by Mordehai Milgromin 1983 (Milgrom, 1983; 2015; see also Banik and Zhao, 2022 for a review). A second concurrent model is modified gravity (MOG), which is a covariant scalar-tensor-vector (STVG)extension of general relativity (Moffat, 2006; 2020). Other theories also exist but have notbeen broadly applied to a large list of astronomical objects (Mannheim and Kazanas, 1989;Capozziello and De Laurentis, 2012; O'Brien and Moss, 2015; Verlinde, 2017). A new model,called $\kappa$-model, based on very elementary phenomenological considerations, has recently beenproposed in the astrophysics field. This model shows that the presence of dark matter canbe considerably minimized with regard to the dynamics of galaxies (Pascoli, 2022 a,b). The$\kappa$-model belongs to the general family of theories descended from MOND. Under this familyof theories, there is no need to develop a highly uncertain dark matter sector of physics toexplain the observations.</description>

      <title>Galaxy Spin Transition Driven by the Misalignments between the Protogalaxy Inertia and Initial Tidal Tensors</title>

Abstract: A numerical detection of the $\tau$-driven transition of galaxy spins is presented, where $\tau$ is the degree of misalignment between the initial tidal field and protogalaxy inertia tensors. Analyzing the data from the IllustrisTNG 300-1 simulations, we first measure the values of $\tau$ at the protogalactic sites found by tracing the constituents of the galactic halos in the mass range of $10.5\le \log \left[M_{h}/(h^{-1}M_{\odot})\right] \le 13$ back to the initial stage, $z_{i}=127$. The probability density functions of $\tau$ are shown to be well modeled by the $\Gamma$-distributions, whose shape and scale parameters turn out to have universal values on a certain critical scale. Then, we investigate how the strength and tendency of the galaxy spin alignments with the principal axes of the local tidal fields depend on the initial condition, $\tau$. It is found that on the scale lower than the critical one, the galaxy spin transition occurs at two different thresholds from the major to intermediate and from the intermediate to minor principal axes of the local tidal fields, respectively. Noting that the $\tau$-dependent spin transition supersedes in strength the previously found mass-dependent, morphology-dependent, and radius-dependent counterparts, we suggest that $\tau$ should be the key driver of all types of the galaxy spin transition and that the present galaxy spins are indeed excellent fossil records of the initial condition.</description>
