      <title>Breakdown and Restoration of Hydrodynamics in Dipole-conserving Active Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a general hydrodynamic theory for active fluids, capable of describing living matter, that conserve center of mass or dipole moment. Imposition of dipole or center-of-mass conservation has been reported to yield peculiar behavior: breaking Galilean invariance in classical systems and potentially enabling exotic immobile excitations in quantum settings. In passive fluids, dipole conservation has been shown to cause a breakdown of linear hydrodynamics in all experimentally relevant dimensions. We show that introducing activity changes this picture: it can either restore or break linear hydrodynamics depending on spatial dimensions. Using our formulation, we predict universal dynamical scaling exponents for single-component active fluids in $d=1,2,3$ dimensions and find agreement with microscopic lattice-field simulations. Strikingly, for $d\geq 2$, activity revives linear hydrodynamics, while for $d&lt;2$ it leads to a breakdown; both cases flow to previously unexplored universality classes. Our results suggest that dipole-conserving active fluids are far more experimentally accessible than their passive counterparts.</description>

      <title>Dynamic fragmentation of residually stressed solids: From microscopic instabilities to universal scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamic fragmentation of residually stressed solids involves a complex interplay between stored elastic energy, stress wave propagation, and crack instabilities. In this work, we investigate the fracture mechanics of chemically toughened glass through high-velocity projectile impact experiments and a novel micromechanical network model. We rigorously incorporate residual stress into the discrete lattice framework via a prescribed inelastic strain (eigenstrain) distribution, formulated as equivalent body and surface forces to ensure mesh-independent fracture paths. Our experiments and simulations demonstrate that while the fracture topology shifts from coarse to fine with increasing impact energy, the cumulative fragment size distribution consistently follows an exponential decay. Crucially, we reveal a universal scaling law: fragment size distributions from diverse loading conditions and stress profiles collapse onto a single master curve when normalized by the mean fragment area. Furthermore, the model elucidates the determinants of fragmentation, showing that the resulting fragment size is governed not only by the magnitude of residual stress but also by the steepness of the stress gradient. At the microscopic scale, we identify a mechanism for dynamic instability where non-sequential bond breaking ahead of the crack tip leads to apparent local crack speeds exceeding the Rayleigh wave speed ($c_r$). These arrested micro-branches, analogous to the Burridge-Andrews mechanism, provide a physical explanation for the "tongue-like" features and hackle zones observed in post-mortem fractography.</description>

      <title>The Kovacs memory effect in a thin granular layer: experimental evidence and its physical origin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the experimental observation of memory effects in a vertically vibrated thin granular layer. Following
  a quench in the input acceleration, the granular temperature exhibits an anomalous Kovacs memory effect
  confined to the initial fast relaxation stage. This memory vanishes shortly thereafter, yielding a
  time-dependent memoryless regime governed solely by the instantaneous temperature before the system reaches
  its final steady state. We develop a kinetic theory framework that quantitatively captures these features by
  identifying the initial memory and subsequent memoryless regimes with the kinetic and hydrodynamic states,
  respectively (that are well established in kinetic theory). Our analysis reveals that memory emerges during
  fast transients through coupling between horizontal and vertical temperatures, a mechanism that fundamentally
  constrains the accessible memory phenomenology and precludes observation of the standard Kovacs effect in
  this system. Molecular dynamics simulations provide independent confirmation of all experimental and
  theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>The Jammed Phase of Infinitely Persistent Active Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study an extreme active matter system, which is essentially a dense assembly of athermal, soft and infinitely persistent active particles. Using extensive numerical simulations we obtain jammed configurations of this system in two dimensions and probe the stability of such structures under increasing active forcing magnitude. We show that the critical active forcing magnitude for the jammed phase to yield scales with virial pressure as $f_c\sim p^\alpha$, with $\alpha=1.17$, describing the yielding line. Using a Laplacian framework, we redistribute the active forces into a modified contact force network. By analysing the statistics of these redistributed forces, we obtain a very robust scaling law consistent with the passive limit, not just near the unjamming line, but in the entire jammed active phase. The probability distribution of the magnitude of the contact force deviates from the power-law form found in passive systems for values smaller than the active force. Moreover, within the jammed phase, the system displays elastic, plastic, and yielding events with increasing active forcing. This active plasticity appears abruptly and can not be captured by the continuous softening of the Hessian spectrum. However, we demonstrate that the Hessian still retains the ability to predict relaxation times. These results clarify how activity modifies force distributions and leads to deformation, plasticity and yielding in dense, jammed, infinitely persistent active matter.</description>

      <title>Dynamic versus quasi-static response of a cantilevered beam rotated harmonically</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a cantilevered elastic beam subjected to harmonic rotational motion. In the rotating frame, the beam experiences centrifugal and Euler fictitious forces, with negligible Coriolis effects. We validate a reduced-order \textit{elastica} model through precision experiments on slender beams rotating with a controlled sinusoidal angular velocity. Systematically exploring the parameter space, we identify regimes where inertial effects are negligible, enabling a quasi-static treatment despite harmonic driving. We characterize the transition to dynamic response using two dimensionless parameters, the Euler and centrifugal numbers, which compare centrifugal and Euler forces to bending forces. Counterintuitively, the quasi-static regime expands as rotational speed increases: faster rotation produces less dynamic response. The critical Euler number separating these regimes remains constant at low centrifugal numbers but follows square-root scaling at higher rotation rates, a transition driven by centrifugal stiffening. Our results establish the conditions under which quasi-static approximations remain valid for rotating flexible beams under harmonic driving.</description>

      <title>A constitutive model for discontinuous shear thickening in epithelial tissues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rheological properties of biological tissues, though fundamental to many physiological and pathological processes such as embryonic development, wound healing, and tumor progression, remain poorly understood. A recent study showed that the active vertex model of biological tissues exhibits discontinuous shear thickening (DST), where stress and viscosity suddenly increase at a critical shear rate. What is the mechanism of DST here? Is it another nontrivial feature of activity or an inherent property of the system? To address this, we show that the thermal vertex model also exhibits DST at a small but non-zero temperature $T$. Solid-like and liquid-like cells coexist at the stress jump, and the stress-controlled flow curves exhibit the characteristic S-shape. We then introduce a constitutive model for DST in epithelial tissues. As $p_0$ increases, the theory predicts DST, followed by continuous shear thickening (CST), and finally Newtonian behavior, consistent with simulations. DST begins at the jamming point, $p_0^m$, and the Newtonian behavior starts at $p_0^*$, where the yield stress vanishes. Both $p_0^*$ and the liquid-to-solid transition stress, $\sigma^*$, govern the DST-CST boundary. Furthermore, $p_0^*$ and $\sigma^*$ also depend on $T$. Increasing $T$ reduces $p_0^*$, narrows the shear-thickening regime, and eventually destroys DST when $p_0^* \leq p_0^m$. Thus, the primary ingredients of DST in tissue models are a finite yield stress in the unjammed regime and non-zero fluctuations, whose specific form is not important. The theory agrees well with our simulation data and also provides further testable predictions.</description>

      <title>Lost in Projection? Gaussian Filtering Recovers Hidden Conformational States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To interpret molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, it is common practice to reduce the dimensionality of the molecular coordinates to a low-dimensional collective variable $x$. Projecting the high-dimensional MD data onto $x$ yields a free energy landscape $\Delta G(x)$, which highlights low-energy regions corresponding to conformational states. The accurate definition of these states, however, is often impeded by projection artifacts, resulting in artificially shortened state lifetimes or even the complete disappearance of states from the analysis. As demonstrated for a two-dimensional toy model, Gaussian low-pass filtering of the high-dimensional MD coordinates can restore the underlying free energy landscape, allowing to recover previously hidden states. When applied to an all-atom folding trajectory of HP35, the number of microstates increases by an order of magnitude, which leads to metastable states that are long-lived and much better defined structurally, even compared to dynamically cored state trajectories.</description>

      <title>Controlling inertial active Brownian motion via stochastic resetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inertia is intrinsic to many living and synthetic active systems, from animals and robotic agents to colloidal swimmers, and it strongly shapes transport. Many such systems employ intermittent restart protocols to regulate exploration. Stochastic resetting provides a theoretical framework for these strategies and a route to control nonequilibrium steady states, yet the role of inertia in reset-controlled active dynamics remains poorly understood. Here we study an inertial active Brownian particle subject to complete stochastic resetting of position, velocity, and orientation in two dimensions. Using a moment-generating framework together with the Final-Value Theorem, we derive closed-form steady-state moments up to fourth order as functions of inertia, activity, and reset rate. We show that inertia fundamentally modifies reset-controlled transport: at large reset rates the steady-state mean-squared displacement is suppressed much more strongly than in the overdamped limit, yielding enhanced localization near the reset point. At the same time, position excess-kurtosis phase diagrams reveal strongly non-Gaussian steady states characterized by a sharp central peak coexisting with heavy tails in the position distribution, indicating rare long excursions enabled by inertial persistence. The tail weight varies non-monotonically with reset rate, reflecting a competition between inertial momentum relaxation and resetting that selects an optimal regime maximizing rare excursions. Our results provide experimentally testable signatures of inertial effects in reset-controlled active systems.</description>

      <title>Hyperuniformity in active fluids reshape nucleation and capillary-wave dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While nucleation in typical active and driven fluids often appears equilibrium-like, striking departures emerge when large-scale fluctuations are strongly suppressed. Here, we investigate nucleation in nonequilibrium hyperuniform fluids by projecting the full density-field dynamics onto relevant collective variables. We demonstrate that nucleation is governed by a nonequilibrium quasi-potential rather than the reversible work of formation. Surprisingly, because of the reduced hyperuniform fluctuations, the nucleation probability no longer separates into the usual surface and volume contributions. Furthermore, accounting for capillary waves reveals a clear breakdown of detailed balance driven by nonreciprocal dynamics. More broadly, our framework can be readily extended to identify nonequilibrium signatures in conventional active fluids.</description>

      <title>Programming Shapes with Competing Layered Patterns</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.20655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Studying shape changing thick surfaces induced by differential growth helps us understand morphogenesis in biology and offers opportunities for device design. While ideal 2D differential growth maps have been well studied for both isotropic and anisotropic growth, scenarios involving gradients in thickness growth are far less explored. In this paper, we focus on a bilayer system in which the two layers undergo independent but incompatible growth. We examine how the strength of the growth patterns and the aspect ratio of the bilayer influence the resulting shapes. We first investigate the effect of global area difference in the bilayer. Next, we make one of the two layers active and program it with positive or negative, localized or uniform curvature. We then present examples involving competition between two active surfaces with opposite curvature signs or different curvature distributions and understand how the final configurations follow from the principles identified earlier. Finally, we demonstrate the ability to program biologically inspired shapes, such as dental epithelium and the ventral furrow in Drosophila, using a bilayer with simple, distinct deformation gradients.</description>

      <title>Density Functional Theory Predictions of Derivative Thermodynamic Properties of a Confined Fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fluids in nanopores are of importance for many engineering applications, including energy storage in supercapacitors, hydrocarbons recovery from unconventional sources, or water desalination. Thermodynamic properties of fluids confined in nanopores differ from the properties of the same fluids in bulk. Density functional theory (DFT) has been widely used for modeling thermodynamics of confined fluids. However, it is rarely used for calculations of derivative thermodynamic properties. Here we use a rather simple DFT model for argon based on the Percus-Yevick equation, and showed that with standard parametrization it fails to predict derivative properties. However, slight adjustment in parameters leads to quantitative predictions of isothermal compressibility and thermal expansion coefficient at a selected temperature. Using the adjusted parameterization we performed the calculations of compressibility of argon confined in carbon slit pores of various sizes, and demonstrated that the compressibility of argon in confinement is lower than that in bulk and is pore size dependent. We confirmed the DFT predictions using the Monte Carlo molecular simulations. In addition to isothermal compressibility, we calculated the thermal expansion coefficient of confined argon. Our calculations showed that it behaves similar to compressibility -- it is always lower than the bulk value and gradually increases for smaller pore sizes. For several selected pore sizes we verified the DFT calculations by Monte Carlo simulations. Overall, our results suggest that the classical DFT can be utilized for calculations of derivative thermodynamic properties of confined fluids, which are computationally challenging to predict using molecular simulations.</description>

      <title>Role of activity and dissipation in achieving precise beating in cilia: Insights from the rower model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07681v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cilia and flagella are micron-sized filaments that actively beat with remarkable precision in a viscous medium, driving microorganism movement and efficient flow. We study the rower model to uncover how cilia activity and dissipation enable this precise motion. In this model, cilia motion is represented by a micro-bead's Brownian movement between two distant harmonic potentials. At specific locations, energy pumps trigger potential switches, capturing cilia activity and generating oscillations. We quantify precision of oscillation using a quality factor, identifying its scaling with activity and oscillation amplitude, finding precision maximization at an optimal amplitude. The data collapse is not accurate for noisy oscillations. An exact analytic expression for the precision quality factor, based on first passage time fluctuations, and derived in the small noise approximation, explains its optimality and scaling. Energy budget analysis shows the quality factor's consistency with the thermodynamic uncertainty relation. Finally, we demonstrate that asymmetric beating reduces oscillation precision compared to the symmetric model: although the optimal amplitude remains unchanged, the overall scaling of the quality factor depends explicitly on the asymmetry parameter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00346v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sensitive detection of low-abundance molecular targets is widely assumed to require enzymatic amplification, such as PCR, to achieve low detection limits. In amplification-free platforms, sensitivity is traditionally constrained by equilibrium binding affinity. Here we show that multivalent linker entropy provides a distinct physical route to exponential sensitivity enhancement in purely equilibrium sensing architectures. Using a statistical-mechanical theory supported by grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations, we demonstrate that redistributing a fixed total interaction strength over increasing linker valency exponentially lowers adsorption thresholds. This scaling emerges not from stronger energetic affinity, but from the rapid growth of combinatorial binding configurations, revealing entropy as an intrinsic amplification mechanism. Consequently, detection limits can be tuned independently of bond strength, enabling ultrasensitive responses without enzymatic replication. Our results establish a general physical design principle for engineering amplification-free detection systems capable of approaching PCR-level sensitivities through entropy-driven collective effects.</description>

      <title>Effects of Near-Field Hydrodynamic Interactions on Bacterial Dynamics Near a Solid Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17626v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Near-field hydrodynamic interactions between bacteria and no-slip solid surfaces are the main mechanism underlying surface entrapment of bacteria. In this study, we employ a chiral two-body model to simulate bacterial dynamics near the surface. The simulation results show that as bacteria approach the surface, their translational velocities and diffusion coefficients decrease. Under the combination of near-field hydrodynamic interactions and DLVO forces, bacteria reach a stable fixed point in the phase plane and follow circular trajectories at this point. In particular, bacteria with left-handed helical flagella exhibit clockwise circular motion on the surface. During this process, as the stable height increases, the near-field hydrodynamic interactions weaken. Consequently, the translational velocity of the bacteria parallel to the surface increases while the rotational velocity perpendicular to the surface decreases, collectively increasing the radius of curvature. Ultimately, our findings demonstrate that near-field hydrodynamic interactions significantly prolong the surface residence time of bacteria. Additionally, smaller stable heights further amplify this effect, resulting in longer residence times and enhanced surface entrapment.</description>

Abstract: We develop a kinetic-theory framework to investigate the steady rheology of a dilute gas interacting via a repulsive potential under uniform shear flow. Starting from the Boltzmann equation with a restitution coefficient that depends on the impact velocity and potential strength, we derive evolution equations for the stress tensor based on Grad's moment expansion. The resulting expressions for the collisional rates and transport coefficients are fitted with simple analytical functions that capture their temperature dependence over a wide range of shear rates. Comparison with direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) results shows excellent quantitative agreement for the shear stress, temperature anisotropy, and shear viscosity. We also analyze the velocity distribution functions, revealing that the system remains nearly Maxwellian even under strong shear.</description>

      <title>The Interplay Between Liquid-Liquid Phase Equilibria, Sequence, and Tg in Copolymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18659</link>

Abstract: Copolymerization is a powerful tool to tune polymers' glass formation behavior in order to improve properties such as ion conductivity, thermal stability, and mechanical response. Classically, mixing rules such as the Fox equation and its variants have been employed to predict and explain glass transition temperature (Tg) variations with copolymer composition. However, a large number of copolymers exhibit significant excursions from these mixing rules. Increasingly, it also appears that these excursions can be tuned by copolymer sequence - an effect that is not predicted by classical mixing rules and thus far remains poorly understood. Here, we perform molecular dynamics simulations to probe the interplay between copolymer sequence, liquid-liquid phase equilibria, and Tg. We find that the direction of Tg shifts, and their dependence on sequence, are predicted by the type of liquid-liquid phase boundary towards which the comonomers tend. Monomers tending towards Upper Critical Solution Temperature behavior exhibit Tg reductions that become stronger with increasing monomer alternation; monomers tending towards Lower Critical Solution Temperature behavior exhibit Tg enhancements that become stronger with increasing monomer alternation. This behavior fundamentally emerges from a forced mixing phenomenon wherein monomer alternation induces close contact between monomer types that would otherwise tend towards phase separation. These results point towards strategies for rationally varying copolymer Tg, at fixed chemical composition, via judicious design of polymer chain sequence.</description>

      <title>Noise-enabled goal attainment in crowded collectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08100v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In crowded environments, individuals must navigate around other occupants to reach their destinations. Understanding and controlling traffic flows in these spaces is relevant for coordinating robot swarms and designing infrastructure for dense populations. Here, we use simulations, theory, and experiments to study how adding stochasticity to agent motion can reduce traffic jams and help agents travel more quickly to prescribed goals. A computational approach reveals the collective behavior. Above a critical noise level, large jams do not persist. From this observation, we analytically approximate the swarm's goal attainment rate, which allows us to solve for the agent density and noise level that maximize the goals reached. Robotic experiments corroborate the behaviors observed in our simulated and theoretical results. Finally, we compare simple, local navigation approaches with a sophisticated but computationally costly central planner. A simple reactive scheme performs well up to moderate densities and is far more computationally efficient than a planner, motivating further research into robust, decentralized navigation methods for crowded environments. By integrating ideas from physics and engineering using simulations, theory, and experiments, our work identifies new directions for emergent traffic research.</description>

      <title>A Bottom-Up Field-Theoretic Framework via Hierarchical Coarse-Graining: Generalized Mode Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20025v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multiscale simulations facilitate the efficient exploration of large spatiotemporal scales in chemical and physical systems, yet particle-based simulations become prohibitively expensive at time and length scales beyond the molecular level. Field-theoretic simulations offer an attractive alternative, but most existing formulations rely on top-down approximations and are not systematically connected to atomistic interactions. Here, we present a hierarchical bottom-up framework for constructing auxiliary field representations of molecular liquids directly from microscopic models. We introduce a hierarchical coarse-graining framework that constructs field-theoretic models directly from atomistic liquids. The method first maps atomistic interactions to coarse-grained center-of-mass potentials and regularizes short-range divergences through a perturbative expansion in reciprocal space. Building on the auxiliary field formulation developed in polymer field-theoretic simulations, we then generalize the Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation to arbitrary pair potentials by separating positive and negative Fourier modes and introducing two auxiliary fields. The resulting generalized mode theory extends bottom-up field-theoretic modeling beyond positive-definite kernels and is compatible with existing field-theoretic sampling strategies. By combining formal derivations with numerical regularization and mode-truncation procedures, this work provides the theoretical foundation for scalable, bottom-up field-theoretic simulations of molecular systems.</description>
