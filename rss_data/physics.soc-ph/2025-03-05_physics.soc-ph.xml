      <title>Super-Linear Growth and Rising Inequality in Online Social Communities: Insights from Reddit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the effect of the number of users on the activity of communities within the online content sharing and discussion platform Reddit, called subreddits. We found that comment activity on Reddit has a heavy-tailed distribution, where a large fraction of the comments are made by a small set of users. Furthermore, as subreddits grow in size, this behavior becomes stronger, with activity (measured by the comments made in a subreddit) becoming even more centralised in a (relatively) smaller core of users. We verify that these changes are not explained by finite size nor by sampling effects. Instead, we observe a systematic change of the distribution with subreddit size. To quantify the centralisation and inequality of activity in a subreddit, we used the Gini coefficient. We found that as subreddits grow in users, so does the Gini coefficient, seemingly as a natural effect of the scaling. We found that the excess number of comments (the total number of comments minus the total number of users) follows a power law with exponent 1.27. For each subreddit we considered a snapshot of one month of data, as a compromise between statistical relevance and change in the system's dynamics. We show results over the whole year 2021 (with each subreddit having twelve snapshots, at most), nevertheless all results were consistent when using a single month or different years.</description>

      <title>A differential model of $N$ player games concerning ethical dilemmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ethics play an important role in determining the behavior of an individual under certain circumstances. Ethical or unethical behavior can be treated as a strategy of a player in a pay-off game. In this paper, we present two analytical solutions to studying time evolution of behavior of an individual from ethics perspective. We also present the effect of a third player as a perturbation to a two player game and develop a general approach for a $N$ player game. We demonstrate geometric modeling of behavioral characteristics of individuals as polytopes residing in $D$ dimensional space. We treat three player and two player games using set of differential equations that lead to time evolution of phase trajectories which reveal about the interdependencies and self dependencies of each player. We also demonstrate the effect of strategies of each player on other players in cardinal games.</description>

      <title>Social Network Heterogeneity Promotes Depolarization of Multidimensional Correlated Opinions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.01329v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose the multidimensional social compass model, based on two competing key ingredients: DeGroot learning, driven by the social influence exerted across multiple topics, and the preference of individuals to maintain their initial opinions. The interplay between these two mechanisms triggers a phase transition from polarization to consensus, determined by a threshold value of social influence. We analytically study the nature of the depolarization transition and its threshold depending on the number of topics discussed, the possible correlations between initial opinions, the topology of the underlying social networks, and the correlations between the initial opinion distribution and the network's structure. Theoretical predictions are validated by running numerical simulations on both synthetic and real social networks. We rely on several simplifying assumptions to explore different scenarios, such as a mean-field approximation for high dimension, or orthogonal initial orientations. We uncover an upper critical dimension (D_c = 5 topics) for uncorrelated initial opinions, distinguishing between discontinuous and continuous phase transitions. For the simplest D = 2 case and correlated initial opinions, we found that the depolarization threshold can vanish if the underlying connectivity is heterogeneous, as predicted by perturbation theory. Such an effect is due to the presence of hubs, which promote consensus in the population. We test this hypothesis by designing a rewiring algorithm that increases the structural heterogeneity of the underlying network, showing that the depolarization threshold decreases. Finally, we demonstrate that if hubs share the same initial opinion, the depolarization dynamics is significantly hindered.</description>

      <title>Analyzing recreational fishing effort -- Gender differences and the impact of Covid-19</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07492v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recreational fishing is an important economic driver and provides multiple social benefits. To predict fishing activity, identifying variables related to variation, such as gender or Covid-19, is helpful. We conducted a Canada-wide email survey of users of an online fishing platform and analyzed responses focusing on gender, the impact of Covid-19, and variables directly related to fishing effort. Genders (90% men and 10% women) significantly differed in demographics, socioeconomic status, and fishing skills but showed similar fishing preferences, fishing effort in terms of trip frequency, and travel distance. Covid-19 altered trip frequency for almost half of fishers, with changes varying by gender and activity level. A Bayesian network revealed travel distance as the main determinant of trip frequency, negatively impacting fishing activity for 61% of fishers, with fishing expertise also playing a role. The results suggest that among active fishers, socio-economic differences between genders do not drive fishing effort, but responses to Covid-19 were gender-specific. Recognizing these patterns is critical for equitable policy-making and accurate socio-ecological models, thereby improving resource management and sustainability.</description>

      <title>Shape and Performance of Fastest Paths over Networks with Interacting Selfish Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17665v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the evolution of the fastest paths (FP) in transportation networks under increasing congestion. Moving from the common edge-based to a path-based analysis, we examine the directed FPs connecting random origin-destination pairs as traffic grows. We describe their shape through effective length, detour (maximum distance of FP from a straight line), inness (signed area between FP and straight line), and their performance through a novel metric measuring how fast and how far an agent travels toward its destination. The entire network is characterized by analyzing the distribution of the performance metric (and its Gini coefficient) across uniformly sampled paths. The study focuses on the traffic loading phenomenon that takes place during the morning peak hour for eight major cities: Networks start with empty edges that are progressively populated by the FPs of single vehicles. As vehicle density grows, the interactions among selfish agents becomes stronger at edge level, and travel speed linearly decreases, thus optimal paths dynamically change with traffic. We fully characterize the transition to congestion and discuss the common aspects among the cities (and some peculiarities), in particular we were able to pinpoint a critical traffic level (or a sequence) for which path shape, rejection ratio, and inequality of the performance degradation, show a concurrent qualitative change. For all cities we observe large peaks for both detour and inness (and their variance) in the proximity of the critical traffic level. Inness shows that paths are slightly attracted by city centers with light traffic, but switch to a strong repulsion immediately beyond the transition. Finally, our path performance metric highlighted a strongly asymmetric behavior when the city neighborhoods act as origins or destinations.</description>

      <title>Geodesic Length Distribution in Sparse Network Ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.02330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.02330v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A key task in the study of networked systems is to derive local and global properties that impact connectivity, synchronizability, and robustness; computing shortest paths or geodesics yields measures of network connectivity that can explain such phenomena. We derive an analytic distribution of geodesic lengths on the giant component in the supercritical regime -- when the giant component exists -- or on small components in the subcritical regime, of any sparse (and possibly directed) network with conditionally independent edges, in the infinite-size limit. We provide specific results for widely used network models like stochastic block models, dot product graphs, random geometric graphs, and sparse graphons. The survival function of the geodesic length distribution possesses a simple closed-form expression which is asymptotically tight for finite lengths, has a natural interpretation of traversing independent geodesics in the network, and delivers novel insight into the aforementioned network families.</description>
