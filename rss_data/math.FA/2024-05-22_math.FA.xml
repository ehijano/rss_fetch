      <title>Existence and uniqueness of solutions in the Lipschitz space of a functional equation and its application to the behavior of the paradise fish</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine the solvability of a functional equation in a Lipschitz space. As an application, we use our result to determine the existence and uniqueness of solutions to an equation describing a specific type of choice behavior model for the learning process of the paradise fish. Finally, we present some concrete examples where, using numerical techniques, we obtain approximations to the solution of the functional equation. As the straightforward Picard's iteration can be very expensive, we show that an analytical suboptimal least-squares approximation can be chosen in practice, resulting in very good accuracy.</description>

      <title>Inversin of double Fourier integral of non-Lebesgue integrable bounded variation functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work proves pointwise convergence of the truncated Fourier double integral of non-Lebesgue integrable bounded variation functions. This leads to the Dirichlet-Jordan theorem proof for non-Lebesgue integrable functions, which has not been sufficiently studied. Note that recent contributions regarding this subject consider Lebesgue integrable functions, [F. Moricz, 2015], [B. Ghodadra-V. Fuulop, 2016].</description>

Abstract: Hyre-Ulam stability of functional equation in single variable is studied in non-triangular metric spaces. We derive it as applications of some fixed point results developed on the said structure. A general version of Baker's theorem is also deduced as a consequence.</description>

      <title>On disjoint dynamical properties and Lipschitz-free spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The notion of disjoint $\mathcal{A}$-transitivity for a Furstenberg family $\mathcal{A}$ is introduced with the aim to generalize properties derived from disjoint hypercyclic operators. We begin a systematic study by showing some of the basic properties, including necessary conditions to inherit the property on the whole space from an invariant linearly dense set containing the origin. As a consequence, we continue the study of the link between non-linear and linear dynamics through Lipschitz-free spaces by presenting some necessary conditions to obtain disjoint $\mathcal{A}$-transitivity for families of Lipschitz-free operators on $\mathcal{F}(M)$ expressed in terms of conditions in the underlying metric space $M$.</description>

      <title>The generalized Fuglede's conjecture holds for a class of Cantor-Moran measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Suppose ${\bf b}=\{b_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ is a sequence of integers bigger than 1 and ${\bf D}=\{{\mathcal D}_{n}\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ is a sequence of consecutive digit sets. Let $\mu_{{\bf b},{\bf D}}$ be the Cantor-Moran measure defined by \begin{eqnarray*}
  \mu_{{\bf b},{\bf D}}&amp;=&amp; \delta_{\frac{1}{b_1}{\mathcal D}_{1}}\ast\delta_{\frac{1}{b_1b_2}{\mathcal D}_{2}}\ast \delta_{\frac{1}{b_1b_2b_3}{\mathcal D}_{3}}\ast\cdots.
  \end{eqnarray*}
  We prove that $L^2(\mu_{{\bf b},{\bf D}})$ possesses an exponential orthonormal basis if and only if $\mu_{{\bf b},{\bf D}}\ast\nu={\mathcal L}_{[0,N_1/b_1]}$ for some Borel probability measure $\nu$.
  This theorem shows that the generalized Fuglede's conjecture is true for such Cantor-Moran measure. An immediate consequence of this result is the equivalence between the existence of an exponential orthonormal basis and the integral tiling of ${\bf D}_n={\mathcal D}_{n}+b_n{\mathcal D}_{n-1}+b_2\cdots b_n{\mathcal D}_{1}$ for $n\geq1$.</description>

      <title>On a time-frequency blurring operator with applications in data augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the success of recent data augmentation methods for signals which act on time-frequency representations, we introduce an operator which convolves the short-time Fourier transform of a signal with a specified kernel. Analytical properties including boundedness, compactness and positivity are investigated from the perspective of time-frequency analysis. A convolutional neural network and a vision transformer are trained to classify audio signals using spectrograms with different augmentation setups, including the above mentioned time-frequency blurring operator, with results indicating that the operator can significantly improve test performance, especially in the data-starved regime.</description>

      <title>On the weighted hermite-hadamard inequality in multiple variables, application for weighted multivariate means</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, the so-called Hermite-Hadamard inequality for (operator) convex functions with one variable has known extensive several developments by virtue of its nice properties and various applications. The fundamental target of this paper is to investigate a weighted variant of Hermite-Hadamard inequality in multiple variables that extends the univariate case. As an application, we introduce some weighted multivariate means extending certain bivariate means known in the literature.</description>

      <title>Feller generators with singular drifts in the critical range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider diffusion operator $-\Delta + b \cdot \nabla$ in $\mathbb R^d$, $d \geq 3$, with drift $b$ in a large class of locally unbounded vector fields that can have critical-order singularities. Covering the entire range of admissible magnitudes of singularities of $b$ (but excluding the borderline value), we construct a strongly continuous Feller semigroup on the space of continuous functions vanishing at infinity, thus completing a number of results on well-posedness of SDEs with singular drifts. The previous results on Feller semigroups employed strong elliptic gradient bounds and hence required the magnitude of the singularities to be less than a small dimension-dependent constant. Our approach is different and uses De Giorgi's method ran in $L^p$ for $p$ sufficiently large, hence the gain in the assumptions on singular drift.
  For the critical borderline value of the magnitude of singularities of $b$, we construct a strongly continuous semigroup in a ``critical'' Orlicz space on $\mathbb R^d$ whose local topology is stronger than the local topology of $L^p$ for any $2 \leq p&lt;\infty$ but is slightly weaker than that of $L^\infty$.</description>

      <title>The Laplace and Leray transforms on some (weakly) convex domains in $\mathbb{C}^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The space of Laplace transforms of holomorphic Hardy-space functions have been characterized as weighted Bergman spaces of entire functions in two cases: that of planar convex domains (Lutsenko--Yumulmukhametov, 1991), and that of strongly convex domains in higher dimensions (Lindholm, 2002). In this paper, we establish such a Paley--Weiner result for a class of (weakly) convex Reinhardt domains in $\mathbb{C}^2$ that are well-modelled by the so-called egg domains. We consider Hardy spaces on these domains with respect to a canonical choice of boundary Monge--Ampere measure. This class of domains was introduced by Barrett--Lanzani (2009) to study the $L^2$-boundedness of the Leray transform in the absence of either strongly convexity or $\mathcal{C}^2$-regularity. The boundedness of the Leray transform plays a crucial role in understanding the image of the Laplace transform. As a supplementary result, we expand the known class of convex Reinhardt domains for which the Leray transform is $L^2$-bounded (with respect to the aforementioned choice of boundary measure). Finally, we also produce an example to show that the Lutsenko--Yumulmukhametov result cannot be expected to generalize to all convex domains in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>On some questions about composition operators on weighted Hardy spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01062v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We first consider some questions raised by N. Zorboska in her thesis. In particular she asked for which sequences $\beta$ every symbol $\varphi \colon \mathbb{D} \to \mathbb{D}$ with $\varphi \in H^2 (\beta)$ induces a bounded composition operator $C_\phi$ on the weighted Hardy space $H^2 (\beta)$. We give partial answers and investigate when $H^2 (\beta)$ is an algebra. We answer negatively another question in showing that there are a sequence $\beta$ and $\varphi \in H^2 (\beta)$ such that $\| \varphi \|_\infty &lt; 1$ and the composition operator $C_\varphi$ is not bounded on $H^2 (\beta)$. In a second part, we show that for $p \neq 2$, no automorphism of $\mathbb{D}$, except those that fix $0$, induces a bounded composition operator on the Beurling-Sobolev space $\ell^p_A$, and even on any weighted version of this space.</description>

      <title>Operator Projective Line and Its Transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02595v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a concept of the operator (non-commutative) projective line PH defined by a Hilbert space H and a symplectic structure on it. Points of PH are Lagrangian subspaces of H. If a particular Lagrangian subspace is fixed then we can define SL(2,R)-action on PH. This gives a consistent framework for linear fractional transformations of operators. Some connections with spectral theory are outline as well.</description>

      <title>Kernel theorems for operators on co-orbit spaces associated with localised frames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18367v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kernel theorems, in general, provide a convenient representation of bounded linear operators. For the operator acting on a concrete function space, this means that its action on any element of the space can be expressed as a generalised integral operator, in a way reminiscent of the matrix representation of linear operators acting on finite dimensional vector spaces. We prove kernel theorems for bounded linear operators acting on co-orbit spaces associated with localised frames. Our two main results consist in characterising the spaces of operators whose generalised integral kernels belong to the co-orbit spaces of test functions and distributions associated with the tensor product of the localised frames respectively. Moreover, using a version of Schur's test, we establish a characterisation of the bounded linear operators between some specific co-orbit spaces.</description>
