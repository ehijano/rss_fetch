      <title>Immediate Neighbours of Monotone Boolean Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Boolean networks constitute relevant mathematical models to study the behaviours of genetic and signalling networks. These networks define regulatory influences between molecular nodes, each being associated to a Boolean variable and a regulatory (local) function specifying its dynamical behaviour depending on its regulators. However, existing data is mostly insufficient to adequately parametrise a model, that is to uniquely define a regulatory function for each node. With the intend to support model parametrisation, this paper presents results on the set of Boolean functions compatible with a given regulatory structure, i.e. the partially ordered set of monotone non-degenerate Boolean functions. More precisely, we present original rules to obtain the direct neighbours of any function of this set. Besides a theoretical interest, presented results will enable the development of more efficient methods for Boolean network synthesis and revision, benefiting from the progressive exploration of the vicinity of regulatory functions.</description>

      <title>D&amp;A: Resource Optimisation in Personalised PageRank Computations Using Multi-Core Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Resource optimisation is commonly used in workload management, ensuring efficient and timely task completion utilising available resources. It serves to minimise costs, prompting the development of numerous algorithms tailored to this end. The majority of these techniques focus on scheduling and executing workloads effectively within the provided resource constraints. In this paper, we tackle this problem using another approach. We propose a novel framework D&amp;A to determine the number of cores required in completing a workload under time constraint. We first preprocess a small portion of queries to derive the number of required slots, allowing for the allocation of the remaining workloads into each slot. We introduce a scaling factor in handling the time fluctuation issue caused by random functions. We further establish a lower bound of the number of cores required under this scenario, serving as a baseline for comparison purposes. We examine the framework by computing personalised PageRank values involving intensive computations. Our experimental results show that D&amp;A surpasses the baseline, achieving reductions in the required number of cores ranging from 38.89% to 73.68% across benchmark datasets comprising millions of vertices and edges.</description>

      <title>Counting the Number of Domatic Partition of a Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A subset of vertices $S$ of a graph $G$ is a dominating set if every vertex in $V \setminus S$ has at least one neighbor in $S$. A domatic partition is a partition of the vertices of a graph $G$ into disjoint dominating sets. The domatic number $d(G)$ is the maximum size of a domatic partition. Suppose that $dp(G,i)$ is the number of distinct domatic partition of $G$ with cardinality $i$. In this paper, we consider the generating function of $dp(G,i)$, i.e., $DP(G,x)=\sum_{i=1}^{d(G)}dp(G,i)x^i$ which we call it the domatic partition polynomial. We explore the domatic polynomial for trees, providing a quadratic time algorithm for its computation based on weak 2-coloring numbers. Our results include specific findings for paths and certain graph products, demonstrating practical applications of our theoretical framework.</description>

      <title>Further Connectivity Results on Plane Spanning Path Reconfiguration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a finite set $ S $ of points, we consider the following reconfiguration graph. The vertices are the plane spanning paths of $ S $ and there is an edge between two vertices if the two corresponding paths differ by two edges (one removed, one added). Since 2007, this graph is conjectured to be connected but no proof has been found. In this paper, we prove several results to support the conjecture. Mainly, we show that if all but one point of $ S $ are in convex position, then the graph is connected with diameter at most $ 2 | S | $ and that for $ | S | \geq 3 $ every connected component has at least $ 3 $ vertices.</description>

      <title>Graph Simplification Solutions to the Street Intersection Miscount Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Street intersection counts and densities are ubiquitous measures in transport geography and planning. However, typical street network data and typical street network analysis tools can substantially overcount them. This paper explains why this happens and introduces solutions to this problem. It presents the OSMnx package's algorithms to automatically simplify graph models of urban street networks -- via edge simplification and node consolidation -- resulting in faster, parsimonious models and more accurate network measures like intersection counts/densities, street segment lengths, and node degrees. Then it validates these algorithms and conducts a worldwide empirical assessment of count bias to quantify the motivating problem's prevalence. A full accounting of this bias and better methods to attenuate misrepresentations of intersections are necessary for data-driven, evidence-informed transport planning.</description>

      <title>Krenn-Gu conjecture for sparse graphs</title>

Abstract: Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states are quantum states involving at least three entangled particles. They are of fundamental interest in quantum information theory, and the construction of such states of high dimension has various applications in quantum communication and cryptography. They are of fundamental interest in quantum information theory, and the construction of such states of high dimension has various applications in quantum communication and cryptography. Krenn, Gu and Zeilinger discovered a correspondence between a large class of quantum optical experiments which produce GHZ states and edge-weighted edge-coloured multi-graphs with some special properties called the \emph{GHZ graphs}. On such GHZ graphs, a graph parameter called \emph{dimension} can be defined, which is the same as the dimension of the GHZ state produced by the corresponding experiment. Krenn and Gu conjectured that the dimension of any GHZ graph with more than $4$ vertices is at most $2$. An affirmative resolution of the Krenn-Gu conjecture has implications for quantum resource theory. On the other hand, the construction of a GHZ graph on a large number of vertices with a high dimension would lead to breakthrough results.
  In this paper, we study the existence of GHZ graphs from the perspective of the Krenn-Gu conjecture and show that the conjecture is true for graphs of vertex connectivity at most 2 and for cubic graphs. We also show that the minimal counterexample to the conjecture should be $4$-connected. Such information could be of great help in the search for GHZ graphs using existing tools like PyTheus. While the impact of the work is in quantum physics, the techniques in this paper are purely combinatorial, and no background in quantum physics is required to understand them.</description>

      <title>Enumeration of minimal transversals of hypergraphs of bounded VC-dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of enumerating all minimal transversals (also called minimal hitting sets) of a hypergraph $\mathcal{H}$. An equivalent formulation of this problem known as the \emph{transversal hypergraph} problem (or \emph{hypergraph dualization} problem) is to decide, given two hypergraphs, whether one corresponds to the set of minimal transversals of the other. The existence of a polynomial time algorithm to solve this problem is a long standing open question. In \cite{fredman_complexity_1996}, the authors present the first sub-exponential algorithm to solve the transversal hypergraph problem which runs in quasi-polynomial time, making it unlikely that the problem is (co)NP-complete.
  In this paper, we show that when one of the two hypergraphs is of bounded VC-dimension, the transversal hypergraph problem can be solved in polynomial time, or equivalently that if $\mathcal{H}$ is a hypergraph of bounded VC-dimension, then there exists an incremental polynomial time algorithm to enumerate its minimal transversals. This result generalizes most of the previously known polynomial cases in the literature since they almost all consider classes of hypergraphs of bouded VC-dimension. As a consequence, the hypergraph transversal problem is solvable in polynomial time for any class of hypergraphs closed under partial subhypergraphs. We also show that the proposed algorithm runs in quasi-polynomial time in general hypergraphs and runs in polynomial time if the conformality of the hypergraph is bounded, which is one of the few known polynomial cases where the VC-dimension is unbounded.</description>

      <title>Linear-Time MaxCut in Multigraphs Parameterized Above the Poljak-Turz\'ik Bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: MaxCut is a classical NP-complete problem and a crucial building block in many combinatorial algorithms. The famous Edwards-Erd\H{o}s bound states that any connected graph on n vertices with m edges contains a cut of size at least $m/2 + (n-1)/4$. Crowston, Jones and Mnich [Algorithmica, 2015] showed that the MaxCut problem on simple connected graphs admits an FPT algorithm, where the parameter k is the difference between the desired cut size c and the lower bound given by the Edwards-Erd\H{o}s bound. This was later improved by Etscheid and Mnich [Algorithmica, 2017] to run in parameterized linear time, i.e., $f(k)\cdot O(m)$. We improve upon this result in two ways: Firstly, we extend the algorithm to work also for multigraphs (alternatively, graphs with positive integer weights). Secondly, we change the parameter; instead of the difference to the Edwards-Erd\H{o}s bound, we use the difference to the Poljak-Turz\'ik bound. The Poljak-Turz\'ik bound states that any weighted graph G has a cut of size at least $w(G)/2 + w_{MSF}(G)/4$, where w(G) denotes the total weight of G, and $w_{MSF}(G)$ denotes the weight of its minimum spanning forest. In connected simple graphs the two bounds are equivalent, but for multigraphs the Poljak-Turz\'ik bound can be larger and thus yield a smaller parameter k. Our algorithm also runs in parameterized linear time, i.e., $f(k)\cdot O(m+n)$.</description>

      <title>Cycles of weight divisible by $k$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A weighted (directed) graph is a (directed) graph with integer weights assigned to its vertices and edges. The weight of a subgraph is the sum of weights of vertices and edges in the subgraph. The problem of determining the largest order $f(k)$ of a weighted complete directed graph that does not contain a directed cycle of weight divisible by $k$, for an integer $k \ge 2$, was raised by Alon and Krivelevich [J. Graph Theory 98 (2021) 623-629]. They showed that $f(k)$ is $O(k\log k)$ and $f(k) \le 2k-2$ if $k$ is prime. The best bounds known to us are $f(k) \le 2k-2$ for all $k$ and $f(k) &lt; (3k-1)/2$ for prime $k$. It is also known that $f(k) \ge k$ and this is believed to be the correct value. We prove that $f(k) &lt; k+2\Omega(k)$, where $\Omega(k)$ is the number of prime factors, not necessarily distinct, in the prime factorization of $k$.
  We also show that any weighted undirected graph of minimum degree $2k-1$ contains a cycle of weight divisible by $k$. This result is proved in the more general setting in which the weights are from a finite abelian group of order $k$, and the cycle has weight equal to the group identity. We conjecture that this holds for undirected graphs with minimum degree $k+1$.</description>

      <title>Efficient Computation in Congested Anonymous Dynamic Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.07849v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An anonymous dynamic network is a network of indistinguishable processes whose communication links may appear or disappear unpredictably over time. Previous research has shown that deterministically computing an arbitrary function of a multiset of input values given to these processes takes only a linear number of communication rounds (Di Luna-Viglietta, FOCS 2022).
  However, fast algorithms for anonymous dynamic networks rely on the construction and transmission of large data structures called "history trees", whose size is polynomial in the number of processes. This approach is unfeasible if the network is congested, and only messages of logarithmic size can be sent through its links. Observe that sending a large message piece by piece over several rounds is not in itself a solution, due to the anonymity of the processes combined with the dynamic nature of the network. Moreover, it is known that certain basic tasks such as all-to-all token dissemination (by means of single-token forwarding) require $\Omega(n^2/\log n)$ rounds in congested networks (Dutta et al., SODA 2013).
  In this work, we develop a series of practical and efficient techniques that make it possible to use history trees in congested anonymous dynamic networks. Among other applications, we show how to compute arbitrary functions in such networks in $O(n^3)$ communication rounds, greatly improving upon previous state-of-the-art algorithms for congested networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.06407v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The most efficient automated way to construct a large class of quantum photonic experiments is via abstract representation of graphs with certain properties. While new directions were explored using Artificial intelligence and SAT solvers to find such graphs, it becomes computationally infeasible to do so as the size of the graph increases. So, we take an analytical approach and introduce the technique of local sparsification on experiment graphs, using which we answer a crucial open question in experimental quantum optics, namely whether certain complex entangled quantum states can be constructed. This provides us with more insights into quantum resource theory, the limitation of specific quantum photonic systems and initiates the use of graph-theoretic techniques for designing quantum physics experiments.</description>

Abstract: With the goal of obtaining strong relaxations for binary polynomial optimization problems, we introduce the pseudo-Boolean polytope defined as the convex hull of the set of binary points satisfying a collection of equations containing pseudo-Boolean functions. By representing the pseudo-Boolean polytope via a signed hypergraph, we obtain sufficient conditions under which this polytope has a polynomial-size extended formulation. Our new framework unifies and extends all prior results on the existence of polynomial-size extended formulations for the convex hull of the feasible region of binary polynomial optimization problems of degree at least three.</description>

      <title>Total Variation Distance Meets Probabilistic Inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.09134v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a novel connection between total variation (TV) distance estimation and probabilistic inference. In particular, we present an efficient, structure-preserving reduction from relative approximation of TV distance to probabilistic inference over directed graphical models. This reduction leads to a fully polynomial randomized approximation scheme (FPRAS) for estimating TV distances between same-structure distributions over any class of Bayes nets for which there is an efficient probabilistic inference algorithm. In particular, it leads to an FPRAS for estimating TV distances between distributions that are defined over a common Bayes net of small treewidth. Prior to this work, such approximation schemes only existed for estimating TV distances between product distributions. Our approach employs a new notion of $partial$ couplings of high-dimensional distributions, which might be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Plum: Prompt Learning using Metaheuristic</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.08364v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since the emergence of large language models, prompt learning has become a popular method for optimizing and customizing these models. Special prompts, such as Chain-of-Thought, have even revealed previously unknown reasoning capabilities within these models. However, the progress of discovering effective prompts has been slow, driving a desire for general prompt optimization methods. Unfortunately, few existing prompt learning methods satisfy the criteria of being truly "general", i.e., automatic, discrete, black-box, gradient-free, and interpretable all at once. In this paper, we introduce metaheuristics, a branch of discrete non-convex optimization methods with over 100 options, as a promising approach to prompt learning. Within our paradigm, we test six typical methods: hill climbing, simulated annealing, genetic algorithms with/without crossover, tabu search, and harmony search, demonstrating their effectiveness in white-box and black-box prompt learning. Furthermore, we show that these methods can be used to discover more human-understandable prompts that were previously unknown in both reasoning and image generation tasks, opening the door to a cornucopia of possibilities in prompt optimization. We release all the codes in \url{https://github.com/research4pan/Plum}.</description>

      <title>Frustrated Random Walks: A Fast Method to Compute Node Distances on Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13054v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A hypergraph is a generalization of a graph that arises naturally when attribute-sharing among entities is considered. Compared to graphs, hypergraphs have the distinct advantage that they contain explicit communities and are more convenient to manipulate. An open problem in hypergraph research is how to accurately and efficiently calculate node distances on hypergraphs. Estimating node distances enables us to find a node's nearest neighbors, which has important applications in such areas as recommender system, targeted ads, etc. In this paper, we propose using expected hitting times of random walks to compute hypergraph node distances. We note that simple random walks (SRW) cannot accurately compute node distances on highly complex real-world hypergraphs, which motivates us to introduce frustrated random walks (FRW) for this task. We further benchmark our method against DeepWalk, and show that while the latter can achieve comparable results, FRW has a distinct computational advantage in cases where the number of targets is fairly small. For such cases, we show that FRW runs in significantly shorter time than DeepWalk. Finally, we analyze the time complexity of our method, and show that for large and sparse hypergraphs, the complexity is approximately linear, rendering it superior to the DeepWalk alternative.</description>

      <title>Constructions, bounds, and algorithms for peaceable queens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06974v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The peaceable queens problem asks to determine the maximum number $a(n)$ such that there is a placement of $a(n)$ white queens and $a(n)$ black queens on an $n \times n$ chessboard so that no queen can capture any queen of the opposite color. In this paper, we consider the peaceable queens problem and its variant on the toroidal board. For the regular board, we show that $a(n) \leq 0.1716n^2$, for all sufficiently large $n$. This improves on the bound $a(n) \leq 0.25n^2$ of van Bommel and MacEachern.
  For the toroidal board, we provide new upper and lower bounds. Somewhat surprisingly, our bounds show that there is a sharp contrast in behaviour between the odd torus and the even torus. Our lower bounds are given by explicit constructions. For the upper bounds, we formulate the problem as a non-linear optimization problem with at most $100$ variables, regardless of the size of the board. We solve our non-linear program exactly using modern optimization software.
  We also provide a local search algorithm and a software implementation which converges very rapidly to solutions which appear optimal. Our algorithm is sufficiently robust that it works on both the regular and toroidal boards. For example, for the regular board, the algorithm quickly finds the so-called Ainley construction. Thus, our work provides some further evidence that the Ainley construction is indeed optimal.</description>

      <title>The Repetition Threshold for Rote Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17867v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider Rote words, which are infinite binary words with factor complexity $2n$. We prove that the repetition threshold for this class is $5/2$. Our technique is purely computational, using the Walnut theorem prover and a new technique for generating automata from morphisms due to the first author and his co-authors.</description>
