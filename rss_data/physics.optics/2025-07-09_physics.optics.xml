      <title>Reducing Disorder-Induced Backscattering in Photonic Crystal Waveguides through Inverse Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic crystal waveguides (PCWs) allow for the engineering of photonic modes and band structures to control the flow of light and light-matter interactions within the waveguide. They have shown potential for enhancing optical nonlinearities, quantum dot single photon emissions, as well as optical buffers due to their ability to confine fields on-chip and produce slow-light modes. While these features are promising for applications in nanophotonics, PCWs are prone to high scattering losses due to disorder-induced backscattering, which has remained a significant problem for decades, across various waveguide designs. By combining a fast mode solving approach with physics-based scattering formulas and inverse design, we show how backscattering losses can be significantly reduced, even when working at the same group index. We demonstrate substantial improvements for both W1-like waveguide modes as well topological waveguide modes. Our general methodology is fully three dimensional and can be used to introduce new PCWs for a variety of design metrics.</description>

      <title>A near infrared emission feature from visible fluorescence tails and its correlation with singlet oxygen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The near infrared (NIR, &gt;800 nm) or short wave infrared (SWIR) range of the electromagnetic spectrum overlays with the tissue transparency window and the telecommunication window, which makes it important for fluorescence-based imaging and photonics in general. Additionally, there are NIR absorption features related to vibrational overtone or combination modes and autofluorescence in photosynthetic organisms such as plants. Here, we report a persistent NIR tail and feature at 923 nm that is observed during the photochemical generation of singlet oxygen using various photosensitizers. This feature initially appears to originate from singlet oxygen as its energy fits to known higher order optical and vibrational transitions, and it occurs simultaneously with the characteristic singlet oxygen phosphorescence at 1275 nm. To determine its origin, a systematic investigation is carried out using different photosensitizers (Rose Bengal, a ruthenium complex, Methylene Blue, chlorophyll), solvents, excitation sources and optical setups. The emission is present under all photochemical conditions, but it is not observed for chemically generated singlet oxygen. Its intensity correlates with photosensitizer concentration (1 uM - 1 mM), excitation intensity and the visible fluorescence intensity, but does not require the presence of oxygen as the 1275 nm phosphorescence of singlet oxygen. A simulation shows that this feature arises from the NIR-tail of (visible) photosensitizer emission and the non-linear increase of detector sensitivity in the range between 900 nm - 950 nm. At the same time this feature and the whole NIR tail correlates with photochemically generated singlet oxygen concentration under certain conditions. Thus, careful interpretation of NIR emission is crucial but it also contains valuable information.</description>

      <title>Visualization of nonlinear optics in a microresonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A precise understanding of nonlinear optical phenomena in whispering gallery mode (WGM) microresonators is crucial for developing next-generation integrated photonic devices. Applications include on-chip sensors for biomedical use, optical memories for all-optical networks and frequency combs for optical clocks. However, our ability to spatially localize nonlinear optical processes within microresonators has been limited because optical feedback is often only collected through a bus waveguide. In this study, we present the direct visualization of nonlinear optical processes using scattering patterns captured by a short-wave infrared (SWIR) camera. Through systematic analysis of these scattering patterns, we can distinguish between different nonlinear effects occurring within the microresonator. Direct imaging of nonlinear processes in microresonators can significantly impact many applications, including the optimization of soliton frequency combs, real-time debugging of photonic circuits, microresonator-based memories, and chip-based data switching in telecom circuits.</description>

      <title>Sensing with Broken Symmetry: Revisiting Bound States in the Continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metasurface with bound states in the continuum (BICs) offer exceptional potential for optical sensing due to their inherently high quality (Q) factors. However, the detection of symmetry-protected BICs remains experimentally challenging due to their non-radiative nature. Introducing slight asymmetry makes these resonances observable, though it reduces the Q-factor. In real devices, intrinsic material losses further affect the resonance behavior and sensing performance. While it is often assumed that sensing is optimized at the critical coupling when radiative and non-radiative losses are balanced, the precise conditions for achieving the best limit of detection (LOD) and figure-of-merit (FOM) remain under active discussion. In this work, we experimentally and theoretically investigate BIC-based sensing in the terahertz (THz) range. We demonstrate that the LOD exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on asymmetry, reaching an unexpected optimum where radiative and non-radiative losses are not equal. Moreover, we show that this optimum differs between reflection and transmission sensing schemes. Our results provide practical guidelines for optimizing Q-factor, sensitivity, and signal amplitude together, and contribute to a deeper understanding of the fundamental limits of BIC-based sensing.</description>

      <title>Low-loss terahertz negative curvature suspended-core fiber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the design concept of negative curvature hollow-core fibers, this paper presents an innovative negative curvature suspended-core THz fiber. Compared to traditional suspended-core fibers, all structural units of this fiber are designed with circular boundaries, effectively avoiding the issues of insufficient mechanical strength and manufacturing difficulties associated with the wide and ultra-thin rectangular support arms in traditional structures. The numerical simulation using the full-vector finite element method shows that the optical fiber loss is as low as 0.0868dB/cm (0.02cm-1) in 0.4-0.9THz, and the low loss bandwidth is 0.43THz. In addition, by adjusting the structural parameters of the fiber, near zero flat dispersion of -0.15-0.05 ps/THz/cm can be achieved in the range of 0.4-0.9 THz. The fiber exhibits excellent characteristics of low loss, wide bandwidth, and low dispersion, theoretically opening a new research path for the design of low loss THz fibers. This will provide important component support for the application and development of THz technology in fields such as communication, sensing, and imaging.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, artificially constructed metamaterials have become of considerable interest, as these materials can exhibit electromagnetic characteristics unlike any conventional materials. Artificial magnetism and negative refractive index are two specific types of behavior that have been demonstrated over the past few years, illustrating the new physics and new applications possible when we expand our view as to what constitutes a material. In this review, we describe recent advances in metamaterials research, and discuss the potential that these materials may hold for realizing new and seemingly exotic electromagnetic phenomena.</description>

      <title>Tailored-light photocurrent spectroscopy for probing time-reversal symmetry-broken phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light-field-driven photocurrents represent a powerful tool for generating photocurrents without external bias in light-matter systems that lack inversion symmetry. While these photocurrents are used in electronic applications, such as current sources, switches, and photovoltaics, their presence can also be used to probe material properties in and out of equilibrium, such as topology.Here we advance this path of light-field-driven photocurrent spectroscopy by utilizing tailored laser fields for ultrafast photocurrent generation. We employ combinations of bichromatic linearly-polarized laser beams that individually respect mirror and time-reversal symmetry (TRS). Hence they do not lead to a field-driven photocurrent individually, but when superposed can break individual symmetries and generate photocurrents. For unique choices of the relative polarization angle and two-color phase the tailored light exhibits TRS while breaking all other crystal symmetries, which imposes a forbidden photocurrent selection rule in TRS-invariant systems as we show both theoretically and experimentally. We employ state-of-the-art \textit{ab-initio} simulations to validate this physical mechanism, and, crucially, predict its breaking in materials with intrinsically-broken TRS, creating a background free signal for magnetism and Chern physics. Our work paves way for probing TRS-broken phases of matter in an ultrafast time-resolved manner, not requiring the application of external magnetic fields or even circularly-polarized electric fields.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic Boundary Conditions for Space--time Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a general family of electromagnetic boundary conditions applicable to arbitrary space--time interfaces between electromagnetic media, which include the known space--only and time--only boundary conditions as special cases. These boundary conditions describe a broad class of electromagnetic interfaces, including surfaces in arbitrary motion, ultra-thin (metasurface) media, and cases where the media on one or both sides of the boundary can be both spatially and temporally dispersive. Our approach utilizes 4-dimensional spacetime and addresses the question of how, and in what ways, an electromagnetic field may be connected across a 3-dimensional hypersurface.
  We show that our proposed boundary conditions are the most general conditions consistent with causality and linearity.</description>

      <title>Exploring Gain-Doped-Waveguide-Synapse for Neuromorphic Applications: A Pulsed Pump-Signal Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neuromorphic computing promises to transform AI systems by enabling them to perceive, respond to, and adapt swiftly and accurately to dynamic data and user interactions. However, traditional silicon-based and hybrid electronic technologies for artificial neurons constrain neuromorphic processors in terms of flexibility, scalability, and energy efficiency. In this study, we pioneer the use of Doped-Gain-Layer-on-Waveguide-Synapses for bio-inspired neurons, utilizing a pulsed pump-signal mechanism to enhance neuromorphic computation. This approach addresses critical challenges in scalability and energy efficiency inherent in current technologies.
  We introduce the concept of Gain on Waveguide Dynamics for synapses, demonstrating how non-linear pulse transformations of input probe signals occur under various pump-probe configurations. Our findings reveal that primarily properties of pulse amplitude, period as well material properties such as doping densities and population dynamics influence strongly the generation of spiking responses that emulate neuronal behaviour and effectively how computational logic is. By harnessing the complex interactions of asynchronous spiking pump techniques and ion densities in excited states, our method produces event-driven responses that mirror natural neuronal functions. This gain-enhanced environment supports short-term memory capabilities alongside essential characteristics like asynchronous spike generation, threshold operation, and temporal integration, foundational to brain-inspired spiking neural network paradigms.</description>

      <title>Programmable skyrmions for robust communication and intelligent sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recently observed plasmonic skyrmions, as electromagnetic counterparts of topologically stable quasiparticles, hold significant promise as novel carriers for robust information transfer and manipulation of nontrivial light-matter interactions. However, their practical applications has been hindered by the lack of flexible tuning devices to encode these topological structures. Here, we present a programmable plasmonic skyrmion platform capable of coding diverse skyrmion topologies, including N\'eel-type skyrmions and merons. Based on unprecedented ultra-fast coding feature, we synthesize nonlinear skyrmions in the temporal dimension and, for the first time, applied skyrmions in communication and sensing applications. Specifically, we achieved highly robust and multi-channel wireless communications by using programmable topological skyrmions, providing a promising platform for communication in turbulent noise channels and extreme conditions. Furthermore, we implemented intelligent sensing across twenty animal models on the same platform, achieving high recognition accuracy. This design offers revolutionary insights into the programmability of skyrmions and promising potentials applications of skyrmion topologies in next-generation information communication and intelligent sensing.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Nonlocal Metasurface for Harmonic Generation and Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of second harmonic generation in 1961 marked the birth of nonlinear optics, unlocking a range of applications from frequency conversion to quantum light generation. Yet, phase matching in bulk nonlinear crystals remains a key bottleneck. Thinning nonlinear media eases this constraint but severely reduces nonlinear efficiency due to limited interaction length. Photonic metasurfaces, planar arrays of subwavelength meta atoms, offer a compelling alternative by supporting resonant modes that enhance local fields. However, existing designs suffer from a trade off between the high efficiency of nonlocal metasurfaces and the precise wavefront control enabled by local ones. These two capabilities have remained decoupled due to their fundamentally different mechanisms. Here, we design a nonlinear nonlocal metasurface supporting quasi trapped modes (QTM), enabling efficient third harmonic generation and meta atom level phase manipulation. Using topologically asymmetric all-dielectric meta-atoms, we achieve strong field confinement and demonstrate THG enhancement exceeding three orders of magnitude compared to unstructured films. By exploiting symmetry and Pancharatnam-Berry (PB) phase via meta atom rotation, we realize helicity dependent wavefront control at both the fundamental and TH wavelengths. A slight boundary perturbation yields geometric phase accumulation only at resonance, a behavior absent in conventional PB based metasurfaces. This selectivity arises from QTM field profiles that maintain global symmetry off resonance while enabling local geometric phase encoding at resonance. Our results advance silicon photonics and reveal new mechanisms for nonlinear geometric phase control at the nanoscale.</description>

      <title>Differentiation of Wild-Type and CRISPR-Modified Colon Cancer Cells Using Brillouin Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the mechanical properties of colon cancer cells through Brillouin microscopy, focusing on the differentiation between wild-type (WT) and CRISPR-modified cells. Brillouin microspectroscopy, a non-invasive technique, was employed to measure Brillouin shifts and full width at half maximum (FWHM) values of the cells in vitro. Using a custom-built confocal Brillouin microspectrometer, both WT and CRISPR-modified cells exhibited distinct mechanical responses. Statistical analysis revealed that WT cells had different stiffness and viscosity compared to CRISPR-modified cells, as indicated by their Brillouin shift and FWHM values. The data suggest that Brillouin spectroscopy offers a viable method to differentiate between normal and mutated cells at the subcellular level, providing new insights into cellular mechanical properties relevant to cancer research. These findings hold potential for advancing non-invasive diagnostic techniques and understanding cellular mechanics in oncology.</description>

      <title>Secure Quantum Relay Networks Using Distributed Entanglement without Classical Authentication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current quantum communication protocols rely heavily on classical authentication for message origin verification, leaving them vulnerable to evolving attacks that exploit classical trust assumptions. In this work, we propose a novel framework for secure quantum relay networks that completely avoids classical authentication. Instead, we leverage pre-distributed entanglement graphs and non-classical correlation-assisted decoding to enable exclusive message retrieval by designated nodes without broadcasting any key or handshake. The system routes messages across multiple relay nodes, yet ensures that no intermediate node can access the message unless it possesses the entangled state partner. We demonstrate that even in multi-path scenarios with asynchronous entanglement distribution, the protocol guarantees quantum-forward secrecy and end-to-end origin integrity without trusted intermediaries. Simulation results confirm both functionality and robustness under entanglement loss and imperfect detection. This architecture paves the way for scalable quantum communication systems where physical quantum states replace classical authentication mechanisms entirely.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Quantum Cryptosystems: Integration of Entanglement-Assisted Decryption and Physical Phase Obfuscation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study introduces a hybrid cryptographic framework for quantum communication that integrates entanglement-assisted decryption with phase-based physical obfuscation. While conventional quantum protocols often rely on explicit transmission of decryption keys or phase parameters, such models expose critical vulnerabilities to eavesdropping. To address this challenge, we propose a two-stage encryption-decryption mechanism. The first stage employs randomized phase modulation protected by active electromagnetic shielding to conceal the quantum signal from unauthorized interception. The second stage enables legitimate receivers to retrieve encrypted phase data using entangled quantum states, eliminating the need for classical key transfer. A formal mathematical framework is developed to describe the two-stage encoding and decryption process, including phase-modulated entangled states and their transformation under nonlocal correlation and adversarial noise. Simulation metrics confirm that the hybrid system preserves quantum coherence with visibility above 94% and entanglement negativity of 0.86, even under dynamic shielding and transmission noise. Simulation results demonstrate that the combined protocol enhances anti-eavesdropping resilience while maintaining quantum coherence. This architecture is suitable for large-scale secure quantum networks, where multi-layered defense strategies are essential against classical and quantum threats.</description>

      <title>Approximate direct and inverse scattering for the AKNS system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the direct and inverse scattering problems for the AKNS (Ablowitz-Kaup-Newell-Segur) system. New representations for the Jost solutions are obtained in the form of the power series in terms of a transformed spectral parameter. In terms of that parameter, the Jost solutions are convergent power series in corresponding unit disks. For the coefficients of the series simple recurrent integration procedures are devised. Solution of the direct scattering problem reduces to computing the coefficients and locating zeros of corresponding analytic functions in the interior of the unit disk. Solution of the inverse scattering problem reduces to the solution of two systems of linear algebraic equations for the power series coefficients, while the potentials are recovered from the first coefficients. The overall approach leads to a simple and efficient method for the numerical solution of both direct and inverse scattering problems, which is illustrated by numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Model-free Optical Processors using In Situ Reinforcement Learning with Proximal Policy Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical computing holds promise for high-speed, energy-efficient information processing, with diffractive optical networks emerging as a flexible platform for implementing task-specific transformations. A challenge, however, is the effective optimization and alignment of the diffractive layers, which is hindered by the difficulty of accurately modeling physical systems with their inherent hardware imperfections, noise, and misalignments. While existing in situ optimization methods offer the advantage of direct training on the physical system without explicit system modeling, they are often limited by slow convergence and unstable performance due to inefficient use of limited measurement data. Here, we introduce a model-free reinforcement learning approach utilizing Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) for the in situ training of diffractive optical processors. PPO efficiently reuses in situ measurement data and constrains policy updates to ensure more stable and faster convergence. We experimentally validated our method across a range of in situ learning tasks, including targeted energy focusing through a random diffuser, holographic image generation, aberration correction, and optical image classification, demonstrating in each task better convergence and performance. Our strategy operates directly on the physical system and naturally accounts for unknown real-world imperfections, eliminating the need for prior system knowledge or modeling. By enabling faster and more accurate training under realistic experimental constraints, this in situ reinforcement learning approach could offer a scalable framework for various optical and physical systems governed by complex, feedback-driven dynamics.</description>

      <title>PULSE-A Mission Overview: Optical Communications for Undergraduate Students</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in the size, weight, and power (SWaP) requirements for space-based sensing have dramatically increased the demand for high-bandwidth downlink. However, high data rate RF transceivers still pose significant SWaP and cost restrictions, especially for university-class CubeSat missions. Optical communication may provide a solution to this challenge, enabling data transmission with order-of-magnitude rate increases over RF while being both secure and SWaP-efficient. The Polarization-modUlated Laser Satellite Experiment (PULSE-A) is a University of Chicago mission to demonstrate optical downlink at a data rate of up to 10 Mbps using circular polarization shift keying (CPolSK). PULSE-A comprises a &lt;1.5U Optical Transmission Terminal, 3U CubeSat Bus, Optical Ground Station (OGS) employing an amateur telescope, and RF Ground Station (RFGS), all of which are being designed and integrated by a team of over 60 undergraduate students. The mission objective is threefold: (1) to provide hands-on educational experiences for undergraduate students, (2) to make hardware for optical communication systems more accessible via open-source design, and (3) to explore the viability and potential advantages of using CPolSK for optical downlink. In this work, we present an overview of the mission, and we describe the PULSE-A Team's learning-oriented approach to program management and engineering. We especially emphasize the importance of student leadership in PULSE-A's development process and the resulting benefits for the University of Chicago community. We also highlight takeaways from the experience of founding and operating an undergraduate student-led CubeSat program.</description>

      <title>Wave/particle duality in monitored Jaynes--Cummings resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We operationally uncover aspects of wave/particle duality for the open driven Jaynes-Cummings (JC) model in its strong-coupling limit. We lay special emphasis on the vacuum Rabi resonance, and determine the corresponding normalized intensity-field correlation function via mapping to ordinary resonance fluorescence. We demonstrate that temporal wave-particle fluctuations of light emanating from an established vacuum Rabi resonance are explicitly non-classical, while the limit of vanishing spontaneous emission restores detailed balance. When photon blockade sets in, individual realizations show a rapidly increasing frequency of fluctuations towards the two-photon resonance, arising as a direct consequence of a resolved JC spectrum. About the two-photon resonance peak, spontaneous emissions are more likely to revive a high-frequency quantum beat in the conditioned electromagnetic field amplitude than photons escaping out of the cavity mode. The beat originates from a coherent superposition of the first excited JC couplet states, and sets the background against which nonclassical phase shifts are observed in the conditioned quadrature amplitudes. We also find that the onset of steady-state bimodality reduces the variation of the normalized intensity-field correlation, at the expense of its temporal symmetry.</description>

      <title>An explanation of the number or points and symmetries of starbursts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Starbursts are the light intensity patterns seen when small bright sources are looked at night, typically stars. Starburst shapes are produced when the presence of the eye's wave aberrations generates caustics (light concentration) at the retina. A fascinating, but never explained fact about starbursts is that they usually present a $p$-fold symmetry pattern. We provide a theoretical explanation of the number of points and symmetries of starbursts, based on the geometric and algebraic properties of the wave aberration function expressed as a Zernike polynomial expansion. Specifically, we investigate the number and distribution of saddle cusps of Gauss of the Hessian of the wave aberration function. We also establish the connections between those points with the symmetries and the number of starburst points. We found that starbursts are likely generated by axially symmetric dominated wave aberrations with some amount of non-axially symmetric terms. For instance, whereas a wave aberration with a dominant spherical aberration (Zernike polynomial $Z_4^{0}$) plus $Z_3^{3}$ may induce a $3$ points starburst with a $3$-fold symmetry, a wave aberration combining $Z_4^{0}$ and $Z_4^{4}$ may induce a $4$-fold symmetry starburst with $4$ or $8$ points.</description>

      <title>Optical chiral microrobot for out-of-plane rotation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16053v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optical microrobots (OPTOBOTs) have garnered significant interest, particularly in the medical field, due to their potential for precise cell manipulation in various biological studies and microsurgical applications. Previously described OPTOBOTs demonstrate multiple degrees of freedom, yet improvements are needed, especially in achieving reliable out-of-plane rotation. Here, we propose an OPTOBOT design based on chirality that enables full-cycle out-of-plane rotations using optical tweezers. The OPTOBOT has an arrow-like structure with two handles aligned on the same axis, maintaining its horizontal orientation and facilitating controlled movement. Additionally, the OPTOBOT's tail is a chiral helix, which induces repetitive out-of-plane rotations around its longer axis when targeted by a laser beam that is due to broken axial parity. Finite element analysis is employed to design the OPTOBOT and assess its capacity to generate mono-directional high optical torque. Experimental results confirm various actuation modes, supporting future integration of OPTOBOTs in complex micromanipulation tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09071v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A common approach to detecting weak signals or minute quantities involves leveraging the localized spectral features of resonant modes, whose sharper lines (i.e. high Q-factors) enhance transduction sensitivity. However, maximizing the Q-factor often introduces technical challenges in fabrication and design. In this work, we propose an alternative strategy to achieve sharper spectral features by using interference and nonlinearity, all while maintaining a constant dissipation rate. Using far-infrared thermomechanical detectors as a test case, we demonstrate that signal transduction along an engineered response curve slope effectively reduces the detector's noise equivalent power (NEP), achieving $\mathrm{\sim 30 \, pW/\sqrt{Hz}}$ NEP for electrical read-out, sub-THz detectors with an optimized absorbing layer.</description>

      <title>Engineering of self-bending surface plasmon polaritons through Hermite-Gaussian mode expansion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08706v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Surface plasmon polaritons have received much attention over the last decades in photonics or nanotechnology due to their inherent high sensitivity to metal surface variations (e.g., presence of adsorbates or changes in the roughness). It is thus expected that they will find promising major applications in widely cross-disciplinary areas, from material science to medicine. Here we introduce a novel theoretical framework suitable for designing new types of structured paraxial surface plasmon beams and controlling their propagation. More specifically, this method relies on a convenient Hermite--Gaussian mode expansion, which constitutes a complete basis set upon which new types of structured paraxial plasmon beams can be generated. The family of beams generated in this way presents a rather peculiar feature: they exhibit local intensity maxima at different propagation distances, which enables the control over where to place the beam energy. This, thus, opens up worthwhile pathways to manipulate light propagation along metal surfaces at the nanoscale. As a proof-of-concept, we provide numerical evidence of the feasibility of the method by analyzing the propagation of Airy-based surface plasmon polaritons along an air--silver interface.</description>

      <title>Probing the Topological Anderson Transition in Quasiperiodic Photonic Lattices via Chiral Displacement and Wavelength Tuning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07175v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interplay of topology and disorder in quantum dynamics has recently attracted significant attention across diverse platforms, including solid-state devices, ultracold atoms, and photonic systems. Here, we report on a topological Anderson transition caused by quasiperiodic modulation of the stronger intra-cell couplings in photonic Su-Schrieffer-Heeger lattices. As the quasiperiodic strength is varied, the system exhibits a reentrant transition from a trivial phase to a topological phase and back to a trivial phase, accompanied by the closing and reopening of the band gap around zero energy. Unlike the traditional detection of photonic topological edge modes, we measure the mean chiral displacement from the transport of light in the bulk of the lattices. In our photonic lattices with a fixed length, the propagation dynamics is retrieved by varying the wavelength of light, which tunes the inter-waveguide couplings.</description>

      <title>Self-localized ultrafast pencil beam for volumetric multiphoton imaging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11618v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The formation of organized optical states in multidimensional systems is crucial for understanding light-matter interaction and advancing light-shaping technologies. Here, we report the observation of a self-localized, ultrafast pencil beam near the critical power in a standard multimode fiber (MMF) and demonstrate its application in volumetric multiphoton imaging. We show that self-focusing in step-index MMFs, traditionally considered detrimental, can facilitate the formation of a nonlinear spatiotemporal localized state with a sidelobe-suppressed Bessel-like beam profile, exhibiting markedly improved stability and noise characteristics. By simply launching an overfilled on-axis Gaussian beam into a standard MMF, a high-quality ultrafast pencil beam can be generated through a self-localized process and readily integrated into an existing multiphoton point-scanning microscope. We apply this self-localized pencil beam to two-photon imaging of intact mouse enteric nervous systems, benchmarking with diffraction-limited Gaussian beams and outperforming conventional Bessel beams with reduced sidelobes and enhanced resilience to tissue-induced aberration. Finally, we monitor the transferrin uptake dynamics in a live human blood-brain barrier model by combining NAD(P)H-FAD-based metabolic phenotyping with minute-resolved 3D scans, revealing spatially and temporally resolved inter- and intra-cell heterogeneity. Our findings provide new insights into nonlinear dynamics of multidimensional optical systems and offer a promising approach for generating robust ultrafast pencil beams, enabling high-throughput 3D biosystem imaging to elucidate biological transport pathways and guide the design of therapeutics requiring cell-specific delivery.</description>

      <title>Origin of the Fano interference and its tunability with near-field interactions in a guided mode-resonant metasurface</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06610v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Asymmetric resonances emerging from the Fano interference are a well-known phenomenon in fields like atomic physics and grating optics, and they have recently started to gain interest in artificially engineered dielectric, metallic, or composite metasurfaces and metamaterials. The guided mode-resonant metasurface belongs to this class with grating-waveguide responses and shows asymmetric resonances. Here, we have theoretically studied the origin of the resonance, finding out the root of the Fano interference. We have followed the ab initio theory derived from the Feshbach formalism for the electromagnetic scattering. We have numerically simulated the metasurface to obtain different field parameters required for the ab initio theory; in this regard, we have used the multipole decomposition of the scattering fields for the induced moments. Motivated by our recent experiments, we have used a planewave and polarized dipole sources to excite the metasurface, and studied subsequent effects, like the resonance redshift and the resonance linewidth narrowing for the metasurface. These happened due to the change of the excitation, and we have numerically quantified them. The change of the excitation source bears the novelty of the work. Thus, it helps comprehend the experimental observations qualitatively. This work could help explain and explore possibilities to observe asymmetric resonances in metasurfaces for various excitation conditions, and the key results of resonance shift and linewidth narrowing could be significant for precision applications and fundamental optical studies.</description>

      <title>Directional Flow of Confined Polaritons in CrSBr</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04367v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nanoscale control of energy transport is a central challenge in modern photonics. Utilization of exciton-polaritons hybrid light-matter quasiparticles is one viable approach, but it typically demands complex device engineering to enable directional transport. Here, we demonstrate that the van der Waals magnet CrSBr offers an inherent avenue for steering polariton transport leveraging a unique combination of intrinsic optical anisotropy, high refractive index, and excitons dressed by photons. This combination enables low-loss guided modes that propagate tens of microns along the crystal $a$-axis, while simultaneously inducing strong one-dimensional confinement along the orthogonal $b$-axis. By embedding CrSBr flakes in a microcavity, we further enhance the confinement, as evidenced by energy modes that are discretized along the $b$-axis but continuous along the $a$-axis. Moreover, the magneto-exciton coupling characteristic of CrSBr allows unprecedented control over both unidirectional propagation and confinement. Our results establish CrSBr as a versatile polaritonic platform for integrated optoelectronic device applications, including energy-efficient optical modulators and switches.</description>

      <title>Quantum jumps in amplitude bistability: tracking a coherent and invertible state localization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11260v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the nature of quantum jumps occurring between macroscopic metastable states of light in the open driven Jaynes-Cummings model. We find that, in the limit of zero spontaneous emission considered in [H. J. Carmichael, Phys. Rev. X 5, 031028 (2015)], the jumps from a high-photon state to the vacuum state entail two stages. The first part is coherent and modelled by the localization of a state superposition, in the example of a null-measurement record predicted by quantum trajectory theory. The underlying evolution is mediated by an unstable state (which often splits to a complex of states), identified by the conditioned density matrix and the corresponding quasiprobability distribution of the cavity field. The unstable state subsequently decays to the vacuum to complete the jump. Coherence in the localization allows for inverting the null-measurement photon average about its initial value, to account for the full switch which typically lasts a small fraction of the cavity lifetime. This mechanism is contrasted to the jumps leading from the vacuum to the high-photon state in the bistable signal. Spontaneous emission degrades coherence in the localization, and prolongs the jumps.</description>

      <title>Broadband coherent XUV light from $e^-/e^+$ microbunching in an intense laser pulse</title>

Abstract: Attosecond pulses of coherent extreme ultraviolet (XUV) light are instrumental for investigating subatomic dynamics and can be produced using a free-electron laser (FEL). It has been suggested that an optical FEL, which employs a laser pulse in place of a conventional undulator, could enable a dramatically more compact implementation of such a light source. Yet, the high electron density and subsequent high emittance implied by an optical FEL makes this concept challenging to realize with an electron beam. There has been impressive progress in recent years producing collimated dense and relativistic beams of electrons and positrons in the laboratory. As we demonstrate here, the inherent stability of a quasi-neutral electron-positron beam mitigates Coulomb expansion, and renders it a promising alternative source of coherent light. Specifically, we show via computer simulations that broadband coherent light in the XUV domain, which takes the form of 8-as pulses at 92-as intervals, can be generated by microbunching of relativistic electrons and positrons in a laser pulse. This process occurs over a sub-millimeter length scale, enabling the development of light sources which are orders-of-magnitude more compact than existing sources, with potential applications in physics, chemistry, biology, and industry.</description>

      <title>Subnanometric control of coupling between WS$_2$ monolayers with a molecular spacer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20313v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stacking monolayer semiconductors into heterostructures allows for control of their optical and electronic properties, offering advantages for nanoscale electronics, optoelectronics, and photonics. Specifically, adding a thin spacer between monolayers can yield bulk materials that retain interesting monolayer properties, such as a direct bandgap and a high emission quantum efficiency. The interaction mechanisms between monolayers, including interlayer coupling, charge transfer, and energy transfer, might be tuned through subnanometric control over the spacer thickness. Traditional spacer materials like bulk oxides or other layered materials can suffer from poor material interfaces or inhomogeneous thickness over large areas. Here, we use a spin-cast organic molecular spacer to adjust interlayer coupling in WS$_2$ monolayer stacks. We vary the molecular spacer thickness to tune the interlayer distance, significantly altering the optical properties of the resulting organic-inorganic heterostructures. Additionally, we demonstrate a dependence of the valence-band splitting on molecular spacer thickness manifested as a change in the energy difference between A and B excitons resulting from spin-orbit coupling and interlayer interactions. Our results illustrate the potential of molecular spacers to tailor the properties of monolayer heterostructures. This accessible approach opens new routes to advance atomically thin devices and could enable sensing technologies at the subnanometer scale.</description>

      <title>Observation of non-Markovian Radiative Phenomena in Structured Photonic Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09261v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spectral structure of a photonic reservoir shapes radiation phenomena for embedded quantum emitters. We implement an all-optical analog to study such an effect, particularly to observe the non- Markovian radiation dynamics of an emitter coupled to two-dimensional structured reservoirs. Its dynamics is simulated by light propagating through a photonic lattice, acting as a reservoir for an adjacent waveguide that mimics a coupled quantum emitter. We study radiation dynamics in square and Lieb lattices under different coupling regimes and observe how the flat band properties of the Lieb lattice significantly enhances light-matter coupling and non-Markovianity. Our platform opens a path for the experimental exploration of single-photon quantum optical phenomena in structured reservoirs to enhance light-matter interactions.</description>

      <title>Decoherence of Schr\"odinger cat states in light of wave/particle duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12328v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We challenge the standard picture of decohering Schr\"odinger cat states as an ensemble average obeying a Lindblad master equation, brought about locally from an irreversible interaction with an environment. We generate self-consistent collections of pure system states correlated with specific environmental records, corresponding to the function of the wave-particle correlator first introduced in Carmichael {\it et al.} [Phys. Rev. Lett. 85, 1855 (2000)]. In the spirit of Carmichael {\it et al.} [Coherent States: Past, Present and Future, pp. 75--91, World Scientific (1994)], we find that the complementary unravelings evince a pronounced disparity when the ``position'' and ``momentum'' of the damped cavity mode -- an explicitly open quantum system -- are measured. Intensity-field correlations may largely deviate from a monotonic decay, while Wigner functions of the cavity state display contrasting manifestations of quantum interference when conditioned on photon counts sampling a continuous photocurrent. In turn, the conditional photodetection events mark the contextual diffusion of both the net charge generated at the homodyne detector, and the electromagnetic field amplitude in the resonator.</description>
