      <title>Cross-Modality Translation with Generative Adversarial Networks to Unveil Alzheimer's Disease Biomarkers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative approaches for cross-modality transformation have recently gained significant attention in neuroimaging. While most previous work has focused on case-control data, the application of generative models to disorder-specific datasets and their ability to preserve diagnostic patterns remain relatively unexplored. Hence, in this study, we investigated the use of a generative adversarial network (GAN) in the context of Alzheimer's disease (AD) to generate functional network connectivity (FNC) and T1-weighted structural magnetic resonance imaging data from each other. We employed a cycle-GAN to synthesize data in an unpaired data transition and enhanced the transition by integrating weak supervision in cases where paired data were available. Our findings revealed that our model could offer remarkable capability, achieving a structural similarity index measure (SSIM) of $0.89 \pm 0.003$ for T1s and a correlation of $0.71 \pm 0.004$ for FNCs. Moreover, our qualitative analysis revealed similar patterns between generated and actual data when comparing AD to cognitively normal (CN) individuals. In particular, we observed significantly increased functional connectivity in cerebellar-sensory motor and cerebellar-visual networks and reduced connectivity in cerebellar-subcortical, auditory-sensory motor, sensory motor-visual, and cerebellar-cognitive control networks. Additionally, the T1 images generated by our model showed a similar pattern of atrophy in the hippocampal and other temporal regions of Alzheimer's patients.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Models for Atypical Serotonergic Cells Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The serotonergic system modulates brain processes via functionally distinct subpopulations of neurons with heterogeneous properties, including their electrophysiological activity. In extracellular recordings, serotonergic neurons to be investigated for their functional properties are commonly identified on the basis of "typical" features of their activity, i.e. slow regular firing and relatively long duration of action potentials. Thus, due to the lack of equally robust criteria for discriminating serotonergic neurons with "atypical" features from non-serotonergic cells, the physiological relevance of the diversity of serotonergic neuron activities results largely understudied. We propose deep learning models capable of discriminating typical and atypical serotonergic neurons from non-serotonergic cells with high accuracy. The research utilized electrophysiological in vitro recordings from serotonergic neurons identified by the expression of fluorescent proteins specific to the serotonergic system and non-serotonergic cells. These recordings formed the basis of the training, validation, and testing data for the deep learning models. The study employed convolutional neural networks (CNNs), known for their efficiency in pattern recognition, to classify neurons based on the specific characteristics of their action potentials.</description>

      <title>A minimal dynamical system and analog circuit for non-associative learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning in living organisms is typically associated with networks of neurons. The use of large numbers of adjustable units has also been a crucial factor in the continued success of artificial neural networks. In light of the complexity of both living and artificial neural networks, it is surprising to see that very simple organisms -- even unicellular organisms that do not possess a nervous system -- are capable of certain forms of learning. Since in these cases learning may be implemented with much simpler structures than neural networks, it is natural to ask how simple the building blocks required for basic forms of learning may be. The purpose of this study is to discuss the simplest dynamical systems that model a fundamental form of non-associative learning, habituation, and to elucidate technical implementations of such systems, which may be used to implement non-associative learning in neuromorphic computing and related applications.</description>

      <title>Cooling down and waking up: feedback cooling switches an unconscious neural computer into a conscious quantum computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.02708v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a theory of how feedback cooling in the brain reduces thermal noise to the point where macroscale quantum phenomena - crucially Bose-Einstein condensation - can operate at body temperature. It takes the core idea from Stapp that mind and brain interact via some sort of oscillator and identifies a likely candidate, neuronal arrays identified by Stapp as cortical minicolumns. Feedback cooling allows amplifiers to act like refrigerators, and when applied to minicolumns it is suggested they perform as quantum accelerators, solid-state devices able to supercharge standard computers. When the accelerator is idle, as in sleep, we have a neural computer operating unconsciously, but feedback cooling produces a Bose-Einstein condensate, quantum computation, and consciousness. The model explains how macroscale quantum phenomena can operate in a warm and noisy brain, how and why consciousness evolved, and gives insight into unconscious states like sleepwalking. The model is testable, predicting that cold states in the brain are detectable by magnetic resonance thermometry.</description>

      <title>Alljoined1 -- A dataset for EEG-to-Image decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05553v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present Alljoined1, a dataset built specifically for EEG-to-Image decoding. Recognizing that an extensive and unbiased sampling of neural responses to visual stimuli is crucial for image reconstruction efforts, we collected data from 8 participants looking at 10,000 natural images each. We have currently gathered 46,080 epochs of brain responses recorded with a 64-channel EEG headset. The dataset combines response-based stimulus timing, repetition between blocks and sessions, and diverse image classes with the goal of improving signal quality. For transparency, we also provide data quality scores. We publicly release the dataset and all code at https://linktr.ee/alljoined1.</description>
