      <title>Frictional Contact Network in Dense Suspension Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dense particulate suspensions often exhibit a dramatic increase in viscosity in response to external deformation. This shear thickening behavior has been related to a transition from lubricated, unconstrained pairwise motion to a frictional contact network (FCN) at high stresses. Here, we study the characteristics of the FCN formed during shear thickening to investigate the role of constraints, emphasizing the impact of resistance to gear-like rolling. We contrast the FCN formed by sliding friction alone with that formed by particles with sliding and rolling constraints. Particles with sliding constraints only form a highly interconnected network with primary force chains in the compressive direction, which requires orthogonal support from other force chains. However, orthogonal support is not required for mechanical stability when particles have both sliding and rolling constraints. In addition, the force chains appear linear and longer, reducing the jamming volume fraction for rough/faceted particles. Finally, we propose a novel mechanical stability picture for rough/faceted particles with sliding and rolling constraints, which is crucial for understanding the flow behavior of real-life suspensions.</description>

      <title>Emergent universal long-range structure in random-organizing systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-organization through noisy interactions is ubiquitous across physics, mathematics, and machine learning, yet how long-range structure emerges from local noisy dynamics remains poorly understood. Here, we investigate three paradigmatic random-organizing particle systems drawn from distinct domains: models from soft matter physics (random organization, biased random organization) and machine learning (stochastic gradient descent), each characterized by distinct sources of noise. We discover universal long-range behavior across all systems, namely the suppression of long-range density fluctuations, governed solely by the noise correlation between particles. Furthermore, we establish a connection between the emergence of long-range order and the tendency of stochastic gradient descent to favor flat minima -- a phenomenon widely observed in machine learning. To rationalize these findings, we develop a fluctuating hydrodynamic theory that quantitatively captures all observations. Our study resolves long-standing questions about the microscopic origin of noise-induced hyperuniformity, uncovers striking parallels between stochastic gradient descent dynamics on particle system energy landscapes and neural network loss landscapes, and should have wide-ranging applications -- from the self-assembly of hyperuniform materials to ecological population dynamics and the design of generalizable learning algorithms.</description>

      <title>Polymer-modulated evaporation flow enables scalable self-assembly of highly aligned nanowires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Highly aligned nanowire networks are essential for enabling anisotropic optical, electrical, and sensing functionalities in next-generation devices. However, achieving such alignment typically requires complex fabrication methods or high-energy processing. Here, we present a simple and scalable self-assembly strategy that uses a viscosity-enhancing polymer additive to modulate fluid flows during solvent evaporation. The addition of carboxymethylcellulose sodium (CMC-Na) reshapes the evaporation-driven flow field and generates a compressional flow region near the drying edge. Within this region, rotation-inducing velocity gradients progressively align silver nanowires (AgNWs) into highly ordered arrays. This unique mechanism yields uniform AgNW coatings with a high degree of nanowire alignment and tunable areal density across centimeter-scale areas. The resulting films exhibit strong broadband anisotropy, including polarization-dependent transmission in both visible and terahertz (THz) regimes and angle-dependent electrical conductivity. The approach also integrates naturally with dip-coating-based shear alignment, enabling programmable control over alignment direction and spatial patterning. This work establishes a robust, polymer-enabled mechanism for bottom-up nanowire alignment and offers a passive, energy-efficient route for fabricating anisotropic nanostructured coatings.</description>

      <title>Dynamic signature of the thermodynamic transition in a novel mean field system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the connection between thermodynamics and dynamics in glass-forming liquids remains a central challenge in condensed matter physics. In this study, we investigate a novel model system that enables a continuous crossover from a standard three dimensional liquid to a fully connected mean field like system by introducing pseudo neighbours. These pseudo neighbours enhance the effective connectivity of the system without altering its local structure. While their presence slows down the dynamics, they influence thermodynamic properties even more significantly. In particular, the configurational entropy obtained via thermodynamic integration vanishes at a temperature much higher than the temperature where the dynamics begin to slow down, leading to a clear breakdown of the Adam Gibbs relation. To uncover a possible dynamical signature of this thermodynamic transition, we analyse bond breakage dynamics. Unlike real-real bonds, which decay similarly in both the parent Kob Andersen model and its mean field variant, real-pseudo bonds exhibit long lived, persistent behaviour with strong temperature dependence. These bonds do not fully decay over time, leading to a finite saturation value of the bond breakage correlation function. Remarkably, we show that the number of surviving pseudo bonds can be analytically estimated and correlates directly with the thermodynamic transition temperature T_K. We propose a phenomenological relation between T_K and the number of surviving pseudo-bonds, establishing a novel link between thermodynamic and dynamic observables. Our results suggest that these persistent pseudo bonds serve as a robust dynamical signature of the thermodynamic transition, and the system might have properties analogous to those of randomly bonded ultrastable glasses.</description>

      <title>X-ray diffraction from smectic multilayers: crossover from kinematical to dynamical regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study X-ray diffraction in smectic liquid crystal multilayers. Such systems are fabricated as freely suspended films and have a unique layered structure. As such, they can be described as organic Bragg mirrors with sub-nanometer roughness. However, an interesting peculiarity arises in the diffraction on these structures: the characteristic shape of diffraction peaks associated with dynamical scattering effects is not observed. Instead, the diffraction can be well described kinematically, which is atypical for Bragg mirrors. In this article we investigate the transition between the kinematical and dynamical regimes of diffraction. For this purpose, we analyze the reflection of synchrotron radiation on a real liquid crystal sample with both kinematical and dynamical theories. Furthermore, based on these theories, we derive a quantitative criterion for the transition from the kinematical to the dynamical regime. This, in turn, allows us to explain the peculiar diffraction behavior in smectic films with thicknesses exceeding thousands of molecular layers.</description>

      <title>Understanding and Embracing Imperfection in Physical Learning Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Performing machine learning (ML) with analog instead of digital signals offers advantages in speed and energy efficiency, but component and measurement imperfections can make nonlinear analog networks difficult to train. As a result, most schemes involve a precise digital model, either to train alone or in tandem with experiments. Here we take a different perspective: working in the analog domain, we characterize the consequences of the inherent imperfection of a physical learning system and, ultimately, overcome them. We train an analog network of self-adjusting resistors -- a contrastive local learning network (CLLN) -- for multiple tasks, and observe limit cycles and characteristic scaling behaviors absent in `perfect' systems. We develop an analytical model that captures these phenomena by incorporating an uncontrolled but deterministic bias into the learning process. Our results suggest that imperfections limit precision and erase memory of previous tasks by continuously modifying the underlying representation of all learned tasks, akin to representational drift in the brain. Finally, we introduce and demonstrate a system-agnostic training method that greatly suppresses these effects. Our work points to a new, scalable approach in analog learning, one that eschews precise modeling and instead thrives in the mess of real systems.</description>

      <title>Burgers rings as topological signatures of Eshelby-like plastic events in glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Eshelby-like quadrupolar structures serve as the fundamental microscopic units for characterizing plastic instabilities in amorphous solids and play a crucial role in explaining their mechanical failure, including the formation of shear bands. However, identifying Eshelby-like plastic events in glasses remains challenging due to their inherent structural and dynamical complexity. In this work, we show that Eshelby-like structures can be precisely identified and localized using a topological invariant known as the continuous Burgers vector. By combining analytical and simulation techniques, we reveal the emergence of a topological Burgers ring around Eshelby plastic events, enabling the precise identification of their center of mass and capturing their orientation as well. This proposed method offers a clear and unambiguous framework to locate and characterize the plastic rearrangements that govern plasticity in glasses.</description>

      <title>Intermediate State Formation of Topologically Associated Chromatin Domains using Quantum Annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topologically Associating Chromatic Domains are spatially distinct chromatin regions that regulate transcription by segregating active and inactive genomic elements. Empirical studies show that their formation correlates with local patterns of epigenetic markers, yet the precise mechanisms linking 1D epigenetic landscapes to 3D chromatin folding remain unclear. Recent models represent chromatin as a spin system, where nucleosomes are treated as discrete-state variables coupled by interaction strengths derived from genomic and epigenomic data. Classical samplers struggle with these models due to high frustration and dense couplings. Here, we present a quantum annealing (QA) approach to efficiently sample chromatin states, embedding an epigenetic Ising model into the topology of D-Wave quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Diffusive noise controls early stages of genetic demixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Theoretical descriptions of the stepping-stone model, a cornerstone of spatial population genetics, have long overlooked diffusive noise arising from migration dynamics. We derive an exact fluctuating hydrodynamic description of this model from microscopic rules, which we then use to demonstrate that diffusive noise significantly alters early-time genetic demixing, which we characterize through heterozygosity, a key measure of diversity. Combining macroscopic fluctuation theory and microscopic simulations, we demonstrate that the scaling of density fluctuations in a spatial domain displays an early-time behaviour dominated by diffusive noise. Our exact results underscore the need for additional terms in existing continuum theories and highlight the necessity of including diffusive noise in models of spatially structured populations.</description>

      <title>Phantom chain simulations for fracture of star polymer networks on the effect of arm molecular weight</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14058v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigated the fracture of star polymer networks made from prepolymers with various arm molecular weights in the range $2 \leq N_a \leq 0$, for node functionalities $3 \leq f \leq 8$ and conversion ratios $0.6\leq\phi_c\leq0.95$ by phantom chain simulations. The networks were created via end-linking reactions of star polymers dispersed in a simulation box with a fixed monomer density $\rho=8$. The resultant networks were alternatively subjected to energy minimization and uniaxial stretch until the break. The stretch at the break, $\lambda_b$, depended on the strand molecular weight $N_s=2N_a+1$ with a power-law manner described as $\lambda_b \sim N_s^0.67$, consistent with the experiment. However, the strand length before stretch is proportional to $N_s^0.5$, which does not explain the observed N_s-dependence of $\lambda_b$. The analysis based on the non-affine deformation theory does not interpret the phenomenon either. Instead, the increase of normalized prepolymer concentration concerning the overlapping concentration with increasing $N_s$ explains the result through a rise in the fraction of broken strands.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24120v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Uncovering the rules governing the nonequilibrium dynamics of the membranes that define biological cells is of central importance to understanding the physics of living systems. We theoretically and computationally investigate the behavior of flexible quasispherical vesicles that exchange membrane constituents, internal volume, and heat with an external reservoir. The excess chemical potential and osmotic pressure difference imposed by the reservoir act as generalized thermodynamic driving forces that modulate vesicle morphology. We show that the renormalization of membrane mechanical properties by nonequilibrium driving gives rise to a morphological transition between a weakly driven regime, in which growing vesicles remain quasispherical, and a strongly driven regime, in which vesicles accommodate rapid membrane uptake by developing surface wrinkles. Additionally, we propose a minimal vesicle growth-shape law, derived using insights from stochastic thermodynamics, that robustly describes vesicle growth dynamics even in strongly driven, far-from-equilibrium regimes.</description>

      <title>Tunable self-emulsification via viscoelastic control of Marangoni-driven interfacial instabilities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11021v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interfacial instabilities in multicomponent fluidic systems are widespread in nature and in industrial processes, yet controlling their dynamics remains a challenge. Here, we present a strategy to actively tune Marangoni-driven self-emulsification at liquid-liquid interfaces by harnessing fluid viscoelasticity. When a water-alcohol droplet spreads on an oil bath, a radial surface tension gradient induced by selective alcohol evaporation drives an interfacial instability, leading to the spontaneous formation of a dense two-dimensional array of "daughter" droplets. We demonstrate that introducing trace amounts of high-molecular-weight polymers, which introduces viscoelasticity, provides a robust means of controlling this process. Increasing viscoelasticity systematically suppresses the instability, resulting in a delayed onset of fragmentation and longer spreading fingers. By combining high-resolution experimental visualization and theoretical analysis, we uncover a quantitative relationship between the polymer concentration and the finger length prior to breakup. These findings establish a predictive framework for designing viscoelastic interfacial materials with programmable dynamic and offer new opportunities for surface-tension-mediated patterning, emulsification, and fluidic control in soft material systems.</description>

      <title>Learned Free-Energy Functionals from Pair-Correlation Matching for Dynamical Density Functional Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09543v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classical density functional theory (cDFT) and dynamical density functional theory (DDFT) are modern statistical mechanical theories for modeling many-body colloidal systems at the one-body density level. The theories hinge on knowing the excess free-energy accurately, which is however not feasible for most practical applications. Dijkman et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 056103 (2025)] recently showed how a neural excess free-energy functional for cDFT can be learned from bulk simulations via pair-correlation matching. In this article, we demonstrate how this same functional can be applied to DDFT, without any retraining, to simulate non-equilibrium overdamped dynamics of inhomogeneous densities. We evaluate this on a 3D Lennard-Jones system with planar geometry under various complex external potentials and observe good agreement of the dynamical densities with those from expensive Brownian dynamic simulations, up to the limit of the adiabatic approximation. We further develop and apply an extension of DDFT based on gradient flows, to a grand-canonical system modeled after breakthrough gas adsorption studies, finding similarly good agreement. Our results demonstrate a practical route for leveraging learned free-energy functionals in DDFT, paving the way for accurate and efficient modeling of many-body non-equilibrium systems.</description>

      <title>The XY model with vision cone: non-reciprocal vs. reciprocal interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19297v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the behavior of the classical XY model on a two-dimensional square lattice, with interactions occurring within a vision cone of each spin. Via Monte Carlo simulations, we explore one non-reciprocal and two reciprocal implementations of these interactions. The corresponding energy involves couplings that depend non-trivially on the system's configuration, leading to both long-range and quasi-long-range ordered phases at low temperatures. Our results demonstrate that non-reciprocity is not essential for achieving long-range order at low temperatures. Using symmetry arguments, we provide a theoretical framework to explain these findings, and additionally we uncover an unexpected order-by-disorder transition.</description>
