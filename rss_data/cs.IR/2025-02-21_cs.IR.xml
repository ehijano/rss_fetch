      <title>Collaborative Retrieval for Large Language Model-based Conversational Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conversational recommender systems (CRS) aim to provide personalized recommendations via interactive dialogues with users. While large language models (LLMs) enhance CRS with their superior understanding of context-aware user preferences, they typically struggle to leverage behavioral data, which have proven to be important for classical collaborative filtering (CF)-based approaches. For this reason, we propose CRAG, Collaborative Retrieval Augmented Generation for LLM-based CRS. To the best of our knowledge, CRAG is the first approach that combines state-of-the-art LLMs with CF for conversational recommendations. Our experiments on two publicly available movie conversational recommendation datasets, i.e., a refined Reddit dataset (which we name Reddit-v2) as well as the Redial dataset, demonstrate the superior item coverage and recommendation performance of CRAG, compared to several CRS baselines. Moreover, we observe that the improvements are mainly due to better recommendation accuracy on recently released movies. The code and data are available at https://github.com/yaochenzhu/CRAG.</description>

      <title>An Evaluation of Sakana's AI Scientist for Autonomous Research: Wishful Thinking or an Emerging Reality Towards 'Artificial General Research Intelligence' (AGRI)?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A major step toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and Super Intelligence is AI's ability to autonomously conduct research - what we term Artificial General Research Intelligence (AGRI). If machines could generate hypotheses, conduct experiments, and write research papers without human intervention, it would transform science. Recently, Sakana.ai introduced the AI Scientist, a system claiming to automate the research lifecycle, generating both excitement and skepticism.
  We evaluated the AI Scientist and found it a milestone in AI-driven research. While it streamlines some aspects, it falls short of expectations. Literature reviews are weak, nearly half the experiments failed, and manuscripts sometimes contain hallucinated results. Most notably, users must provide an experimental pipeline, limiting the AI Scientist's autonomy in research design and execution.
  Despite its limitations, the AI Scientist advances research automation. Many reviewers or instructors who assess work superficially may not recognize its output as AI-generated. The system produces research papers with minimal human effort and low cost. Our analysis suggests a paper costs a few USD with a few hours of human involvement, making it significantly faster than human researchers. Compared to AI capabilities from a few years ago, this marks progress toward AGRI.
  The rise of AI-driven research systems requires urgent discussion within Information Retrieval (IR) and broader scientific communities. Enhancing literature retrieval, citation validation, and evaluation benchmarks could improve AI-generated research reliability. We propose concrete steps, including AGRI-specific benchmarks, refined peer review, and standardized attribution frameworks. Whether AGRI becomes a stepping stone to AGI depends on how the academic and AI communities shape its development.</description>

      <title>Efficient AI in Practice: Training and Deployment of Efficient LLMs for Industry Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide range of industrial applications, from search and recommendations to generative tasks. Although scaling laws indicate that larger models generally yield better generalization and performance, their substantial computational requirements often render them impractical for many real-world scenarios at scale. In this paper, we present methods and insights for training small language models (SLMs) that deliver high performance and efficiency in deployment. We focus on two key techniques: (1) knowledge distillation and (2) model compression via quantization and pruning. These approaches enable SLMs to retain much of the quality of their larger counterparts while significantly reducing training, serving costs, and latency. We detail the impact of these techniques on a variety of use cases at a large professional social network platform and share deployment lessons - including hardware optimization strategies that enhance speed and throughput for both predictive and reasoning-based applications.</description>

      <title>EAGER-LLM: Enhancing Large Language Models as Recommenders through Exogenous Behavior-Semantic Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly leveraged as foundational backbones in the development of advanced recommender systems, offering enhanced capabilities through their extensive knowledge and reasoning. Existing llm-based recommender systems (RSs) often face challenges due to the significant differences between the linguistic semantics of pre-trained LLMs and the collaborative semantics essential for RSs. These systems use pre-trained linguistic semantics but learn collaborative semantics from scratch via the llm-Backbone. However, LLMs are not designed for recommendations, leading to inefficient collaborative learning, weak result correlations, and poor integration of traditional RS features. To address these challenges, we propose EAGER-LLM, a decoder-only llm-based generative recommendation framework that integrates endogenous and exogenous behavioral and semantic information in a non-intrusive manner. Specifically, we propose 1)dual-source knowledge-rich item indices that integrates indexing sequences for exogenous signals, enabling efficient link-wide processing; 2)non-invasive multiscale alignment reconstruction tasks guide the model toward a deeper understanding of both collaborative and semantic signals; 3)an annealing adapter designed to finely balance the model's recommendation performance with its comprehension capabilities. We demonstrate EAGER-LLM's effectiveness through rigorous testing on three public benchmarks.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Agent Perspective on Modern Information Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rise of large language models (LLMs) has introduced a new era in information retrieval (IR), where queries and documents that were once assumed to be generated exclusively by humans can now also be created by automated agents. These agents can formulate queries, generate documents, and perform ranking. This shift challenges some long-standing IR paradigms and calls for a reassessment of both theoretical frameworks and practical methodologies. We advocate for a multi-agent perspective to better capture the complex interactions between query agents, document agents, and ranker agents. Through empirical exploration of various multi-agent retrieval settings, we reveal the significant impact of these interactions on system performance. Our findings underscore the need to revisit classical IR paradigms and develop new frameworks for more effective modeling and evaluation of modern retrieval systems.</description>

      <title>A Survey of Model Architectures in Information Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This survey examines the evolution of model architectures in information retrieval (IR), focusing on two key aspects: backbone models for feature extraction and end-to-end system architectures for relevance estimation. The review intentionally separates architectural considerations from training methodologies to provide a focused analysis of structural innovations in IR systems.We trace the development from traditional term-based methods to modern neural approaches, particularly highlighting the impact of transformer-based models and subsequent large language models (LLMs). We conclude by discussing emerging challenges and future directions, including architectural optimizations for performance and scalability, handling of multimodal, multilingual data, and adaptation to novel application domains beyond traditional search paradigms.</description>

      <title>Towards Context-Robust LLMs: A Gated Representation Fine-tuning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) enhanced with external contexts, such as through retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), often face challenges in handling imperfect evidence. They tend to over-rely on external knowledge, making them vulnerable to misleading and unhelpful contexts. To address this, we propose the concept of context-robust LLMs, which can effectively balance internal knowledge with external context, similar to human cognitive processes. Specifically, context-robust LLMs should rely on external context only when lacking internal knowledge, identify contradictions between internal and external knowledge, and disregard unhelpful contexts. To achieve this goal, we introduce Grft, a lightweight and plug-and-play gated representation fine-tuning approach. Grft consists of two key components: a gating mechanism to detect and filter problematic inputs, and low-rank representation adapters to adjust hidden representations. By training a lightweight intervention function with only 0.0004\% of model size on fewer than 200 examples, Grft can effectively adapt LLMs towards context-robust behaviors.</description>

      <title>Less is More: On the Importance of Data Quality for Unit Test Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unit testing is crucial for software development and maintenance. Effective unit testing ensures and improves software quality, but writing unit tests is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Recent studies have proposed deep learning (DL) techniques or large language models (LLMs) to automate unit test generation. These models are usually trained or fine-tuned on large-scale datasets. Despite growing awareness of the importance of data quality, there has been limited research on the quality of datasets used for test generation. To bridge this gap, we systematically examine the impact of noise on the performance of learning-based test generation models. We first apply the open card sorting method to analyze the most popular and largest test generation dataset, Methods2Test, to categorize eight distinct types of noise. Further, we conduct detailed interviews with 17 domain experts to validate and assess the importance, reasonableness, and correctness of the noise taxonomy. Then, we propose CleanTest, an automated noise-cleaning framework designed to improve the quality of test generation datasets. CleanTest comprises three filters: a rule-based syntax filter, a rule-based relevance filter, and a model-based coverage filter. To evaluate its effectiveness, we apply CleanTest on two widely-used test generation datasets, i.e., Methods2Test and Atlas. Our findings indicate that 43.52% and 29.65% of datasets contain noise, highlighting its prevalence. Finally, we conduct comparative experiments using four LLMs (i.e., CodeBERT, AthenaTest, StarCoder, and CodeLlama7B) to assess the impact of noise on test generation performance. The results show that filtering noise positively influences the test generation ability of the models.</description>

      <title>A Collaborative Jade Recognition System for Mobile Devices Based on Lightweight and Large Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the widespread adoption and development of mobile devices, vision-based recognition applications have become a hot topic in research. Jade, as an important cultural heritage and artistic item, has significant applications in fields such as jewelry identification and cultural relic preservation. However, existing jade recognition systems still face challenges in mobile implementation, such as limited computing resources, real-time requirements, and accuracy issues. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a jade recognition system based on size model collaboration, aiming to achieve efficient and accurate jade identification using mobile devices such as smartphones.First, we design a size model based on multi-scale image processing, extracting key visual information by analyzing jade's dimensions, shapes, and surface textures. Then, a collaborative multi-model classification framework is built by combining deep learning and traditional computer vision algorithms. This framework can effectively select and adjust models based on different jade characteristics, providing high accuracy results across various environments and devices.Experimental results show that the proposed system can provide high recognition accuracy and fast processing time on mobile devices, while consuming relatively low computational resources. The system not only holds great application potential but also provides new ideas and technical support for the intelligent development of jade identification.</description>

      <title>Retrieval-Augmented Process Reward Model for Generalizable Mathematical Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced mathematical reasoning, Process Reward Models (PRMs) have been developed to evaluate the logical validity of reasoning steps. However, PRMs still struggle with out-of-distribution (OOD) challenges. This paper identifies key OOD issues, including step OOD, caused by differences in reasoning patterns across model types and sizes, and question OOD, which arises from dataset shifts between training data and real-world problems. To address these issues, we introduce Retrieval-Augmented Process Reward Model (RetrievalPRM), a novel framework designed to tackle these OOD issues. By utilizing a two-stage retrieval-enhanced mechanism, RetrievalPRM retrieves semantically similar questions and steps as a warmup, enhancing PRM's ability to evaluate target steps and improving generalization and reasoning consistency across different models and problem types. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that RetrievalPRM outperforms existing baselines across multiple real-world datasets. Our open-source contributions include a retrieval-enhanced dataset, a tuning framework for PRM training, and the RetrievalPRM model, establishing a new standard for PRM performance.</description>

      <title>Unstructured Evidence Attribution for Long Context Query Focused Summarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are capable of generating coherent summaries from very long contexts given a user query. Extracting and properly citing evidence spans could help improve the transparency and reliability of these summaries. At the same time, LLMs suffer from positional biases in terms of which information they understand and attend to, which could affect evidence citation. Whereas previous work has focused on evidence citation with predefined levels of granularity (e.g. sentence, paragraph, document, etc.), we propose the task of long-context query focused summarization with unstructured evidence citation. We show how existing systems struggle to generate and properly cite unstructured evidence from their context, and that evidence tends to be "lost-in-the-middle". To help mitigate this, we create the Summaries with Unstructured Evidence Text dataset (SUnsET), a synthetic dataset generated using a novel domain-agnostic pipeline which can be used as supervision to adapt LLMs to this task. We demonstrate across 5 LLMs of different sizes and 4 datasets with varying document types and lengths that LLMs adapted with SUnsET data generate more relevant and factually consistent evidence than their base models, extract evidence from more diverse locations in their context, and can generate more relevant and consistent summaries.</description>

      <title>Multi-Record Web Page Information Extraction From News Websites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we focused on the problem of extracting information from web pages containing many records, a task of growing importance in the era of massive web data. Recently, the development of neural network methods has improved the quality of information extraction from web pages. Nevertheless, most of the research and datasets are aimed at studying detailed pages. This has left multi-record "list pages" relatively understudied, despite their widespread presence and practical significance.
  To address this gap, we created a large-scale, open-access dataset specifically designed for list pages. This is the first dataset for this task in the Russian language. Our dataset contains 13,120 web pages with news lists, significantly exceeding existing datasets in both scale and complexity. Our dataset contains attributes of various types, including optional and multi-valued, providing a realistic representation of real-world list pages. These features make our dataset a valuable resource for studying information extraction from pages containing many records.
  Furthermore, we proposed our own multi-stage information extraction methods. In this work, we explore and demonstrate several strategies for applying MarkupLM to the specific challenges of multi-record web pages. Our experiments validate the advantages of our methods.
  By releasing our dataset to the public, we aim to advance the field of information extraction from multi-record pages.</description>

      <title>InstructAgent: Building User Controllable Recommender via LLM Agent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional recommender systems usually take the user-platform paradigm, where users are directly exposed under the control of the platform's recommendation algorithms. However, the defect of recommendation algorithms may put users in very vulnerable positions under this paradigm. First, many sophisticated models are often designed with commercial objectives in mind, focusing on the platform's benefits, which may hinder their ability to protect and capture users' true interests. Second, these models are typically optimized using data from all users, which may overlook individual user's preferences. Due to these shortcomings, users may experience several disadvantages under the traditional user-platform direct exposure paradigm, such as lack of control over the recommender system, potential manipulation by the platform, echo chamber effects, or lack of personalization for less active users due to the dominance of active users during collaborative learning. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop a new paradigm to protect user interests and alleviate these issues. Recently, some researchers have introduced LLM agents to simulate user behaviors, these approaches primarily aim to optimize platform-side performance, leaving core issues in recommender systems unresolved. To address these limitations, we propose a new user-agent-platform paradigm, where agent serves as the protective shield between user and recommender system that enables indirect exposure. To this end, we first construct four recommendation datasets, denoted as $\dataset$, along with user instructions for each record.</description>

      <title>From Knowledge Generation to Knowledge Verification: Examining the BioMedical Generative Capabilities of ChatGPT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The generative capabilities of LLM models present opportunities in accelerating tasks and concerns with the authenticity of the knowledge it produces. To address the concerns, we present a computational approach that systematically evaluates the factual accuracy of biomedical knowledge that an LLM model has been prompted to generate. Our approach encompasses two processes: the generation of disease-centric associations and the verification of them using the semantic knowledge of the biomedical ontologies. Using ChatGPT as the select LLM model, we designed a set of prompt-engineering processes to generate linkages between diseases, drugs, symptoms, and genes to establish grounds for assessments. Experimental results demonstrate high accuracy in identifying disease terms (88%-97%), drug names (90%-91%), and genetic information (88%-98%). The symptom term identification accuracy was notably lower (49%-61%), as verified against the DOID, ChEBI, SYMPTOM, and GO ontologies accordingly.

      <title>Interpretable Text Embeddings and Text Similarity Explanation: A Primer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text embeddings and text embedding models are a backbone of many AI and NLP systems, particularly those involving search. However, interpretability challenges persist, especially in explaining obtained similarity scores, which is crucial for applications requiring transparency. In this paper, we give a structured overview of interpretability methods specializing in explaining those similarity scores, an emerging research area. We study the methods' individual ideas and techniques, evaluating their potential for improving interpretability of text embeddings and explaining predicted similarities.</description>

      <title>Confidence-aware Fine-tuning of Sequential Recommendation Systems via Conformal Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08976v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In Sequential Recommendation Systems (SRecsys), traditional training approaches that rely on Cross-Entropy (CE) loss often prioritize accuracy but fail to align well with user satisfaction metrics. CE loss focuses on maximizing the confidence of the ground truth item, which is challenging to achieve universally across all users and sessions. It also overlooks the practical acceptability of ranking the ground truth item within the top-$K$ positions, a common metric in SRecsys. To address this limitation, we propose \textbf{CPFT}, a novel fine-tuning framework that integrates Conformal Prediction (CP)-based losses with CE loss to optimize accuracy alongside confidence that better aligns with widely used top-$K$ metrics. CPFT embeds CP principles into the training loop using differentiable proxy losses and computationally efficient calibration strategies, enabling the generation of high-confidence prediction sets. These sets focus on items with high relevance while maintaining robust coverage guarantees. Extensive experiments on five real-world datasets and four distinct sequential models demonstrate that CPFT improves precision metrics and confidence calibration. Our results highlight the importance of confidence-aware fine-tuning in delivering accurate, trustworthy recommendations that enhance user satisfaction.</description>

      <title>Taxonomy-Guided Zero-Shot Recommendations with LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14043v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the emergence of large language models (LLMs) and their ability to perform a variety of tasks, their application in recommender systems (RecSys) has shown promise. However, we are facing significant challenges when deploying LLMs into RecSys, such as limited prompt length, unstructured item information, and un-constrained generation of recommendations, leading to sub-optimal performance. To address these issues, we propose a novel method using a taxonomy dictionary. This method provides a systematic framework for categorizing and organizing items, improving the clarity and structure of item information. By incorporating the taxonomy dictionary into LLM prompts, we achieve efficient token utilization and controlled feature generation, leading to more accurate and contextually relevant recommendations. Our Taxonomy-guided Recommendation (TaxRec) approach features a two-step process: one-time taxonomy categorization and LLM-based recommendation, enabling zero-shot recommendations without the need for domain-specific fine-tuning. Experimental results demonstrate TaxRec significantly enhances recommendation quality compared to traditional zero-shot approaches, showcasing its efficacy as personal recommender with LLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/yueqingliang1/TaxRec.</description>

      <title>STAR: A Simple Training-free Approach for Recommendations using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16458v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) offers promising new approaches for recommendation system tasks. While the current state-of-the-art methods rely on fine-tuning LLMs to achieve optimal results, this process is costly and introduces significant engineering complexities. Conversely, methods that directly use LLMs without additional fine-tuning result in a large drop in recommendation quality, often due to the inability to capture collaborative information. In this paper, we propose a Simple Training-free Approach for Recommendation (STAR), a framework that utilizes LLMs and can be applied to various recommendation tasks without the need for fine-tuning, while maintaining high quality recommendation performance. Our approach involves a retrieval stage that uses semantic embeddings from LLMs combined with collaborative user information to retrieve candidate items. We then apply an LLM for pairwise ranking to enhance next-item prediction. Experimental results on the Amazon Review dataset show competitive performance for next item prediction, even with our retrieval stage alone. Our full method achieves Hits@10 performance of +23.8% on Beauty, +37.5% on Toys &amp; Games, and -1.8% on Sports &amp; Outdoors relative to the best supervised models. This framework offers an effective alternative to traditional supervised models, highlighting the potential of LLMs in recommendation systems without extensive training or custom architectures.</description>

      <title>Rankify: A Comprehensive Python Toolkit for Retrieval, Re-Ranking, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02464v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Retrieval, re-ranking, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) are critical components of modern applications in information retrieval, question answering, or knowledge-based text generation. However, existing solutions are often fragmented, lacking a unified framework that easily integrates these essential processes. The absence of a standardized implementation, coupled with the complexity of retrieval and re-ranking workflows, makes it challenging for researchers to compare and evaluate different approaches in a consistent environment. While existing toolkits such as Rerankers and RankLLM provide general-purpose reranking pipelines, they often lack the flexibility required for fine-grained experimentation and benchmarking. In response to these challenges, we introduce Rankify, a powerful and modular open-source toolkit designed to unify retrieval, re-ranking, and RAG within a cohesive framework. Rankify supports a wide range of retrieval techniques, including dense and sparse retrievers, while incorporating state-of-the-art re-ranking models to enhance retrieval quality. Additionally, Rankify includes a collection of pre-retrieved datasets to facilitate benchmarking, available at Huggingface (https://huggingface.co/datasets/abdoelsayed/reranking-datasets-light). To encourage adoption and ease of integration, we provide comprehensive documentation (http://rankify.readthedocs.io/), an open-source implementation on GitHub (https://github.com/DataScienceUIBK/rankify), and a PyPI package for easy installation (https://pypi.org/project/rankify/). As a unified and lightweight framework, Rankify allows researchers and practitioners to advance retrieval and re-ranking methodologies while ensuring consistency, scalability, and ease of use.</description>

      <title>TALKPLAY: Multimodal Music Recommendation with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13713v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present TalkPlay, a multimodal music recommendation system that reformulates the recommendation task as large language model token generation. TalkPlay represents music through an expanded token vocabulary that encodes multiple modalities - audio, lyrics, metadata, semantic tags, and playlist co-occurrence. Using these rich representations, the model learns to generate recommendations through next-token prediction on music recommendation conversations, that requires learning the associations natural language query and response, as well as music items. In other words, the formulation transforms music recommendation into a natural language understanding task, where the model's ability to predict conversation tokens directly optimizes query-item relevance. Our approach eliminates traditional recommendation-dialogue pipeline complexity, enabling end-to-end learning of query-aware music recommendations. In the experiment, TalkPlay is successfully trained and outperforms baseline methods in various aspects, demonstrating strong context understanding as a conversational music recommender.</description>

      <title>CoSQA+: Pioneering the Multi-Choice Code Search Benchmark with Test-Driven Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11589v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Semantic code search, retrieving code that matches a given natural language query, is an important task to improve productivity in software engineering. Existing code search datasets face limitations: they rely on human annotators who assess code primarily through semantic understanding rather than functional verification, leading to potential inaccuracies and scalability issues. Additionally, current evaluation metrics often overlook the multi-choice nature of code search. This paper introduces CoSQA+, pairing high-quality queries from CoSQA with multiple suitable codes. We develop an automated pipeline featuring multiple model-based candidate selections and the novel test-driven agent annotation system. Among a single Large Language Model (LLM) annotator and Python expert annotators (without test-based verification), agents leverage test-based verification and achieve the highest accuracy of 96.4%. Through extensive experiments, CoSQA+ has demonstrated superior quality over CoSQA. Models trained on CoSQA+ exhibit improved performance. We provide the code and data at https://github.com/DeepSoftwareAnalytics/CoSQA_Plus.</description>

      <title>Extracting Sentence Embeddings from Pretrained Transformer Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08073v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pre-trained transformer models shine in many natural language processing tasks and therefore are expected to bear the representation of the input sentence or text meaning. These sentence-level embeddings are also important in retrieval-augmented generation. But do commonly used plain averaging or prompt templates sufficiently capture and represent the underlying meaning? After providing a comprehensive review of existing sentence embedding extraction and refinement methods, we thoroughly test different combinations and our original extensions of the most promising ones on pretrained models. Namely, given 110 M parameters, BERT's hidden representations from multiple layers, and many tokens, we try diverse ways to extract optimal sentence embeddings. We test various token aggregation and representation post-processing techniques. We also test multiple ways of using a general Wikitext dataset to complement BERT's sentence embeddings. All methods are tested on eight Semantic Textual Similarity (STS), six short text clustering, and twelve classification tasks. We also evaluate our representation-shaping techniques on other static models, including random token representations. Proposed representation extraction methods improve the performance on STS and clustering tasks for all models considered. Very high improvements for static token-based models, especially random embeddings for STS tasks, almost reach the performance of BERT-derived representations. Our work shows that the representation-shaping techniques significantly improve sentence embeddings extracted from BERT-based and simple baseline models.</description>

      <title>CKnowEdit: A New Chinese Knowledge Editing Dataset for Linguistics, Facts, and Logic Error Correction in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05806v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chinese, as a linguistic system rich in depth and complexity, is characterized by distinctive elements such as ancient poetry, proverbs, idioms, and other cultural constructs. However, current Large Language Models (LLMs) face limitations in these specialized domains, highlighting the need for the development of comprehensive datasets that can assess, continuously update, and progressively improve these culturally-grounded linguistic competencies through targeted training optimizations. To address this gap, we introduce CKnowEdit, the first-ever Chinese knowledge editing dataset designed to correct linguistic, factual, and logical errors in LLMs. We collect seven types of knowledge from a wide range of sources, including classical texts, idioms, and content from Baidu Tieba Ruozhiba, taking into account the unique polyphony, antithesis, and logical structures inherent in the Chinese language. By analyzing this dataset, we highlight the challenges current LLMs face in mastering Chinese. Furthermore, our evaluation of state-of-the-art knowledge editing techniques reveals opportunities to advance the correction of Chinese knowledge. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/zjunlp/EasyEdit.</description>

      <title>OmniThink: Expanding Knowledge Boundaries in Machine Writing through Thinking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09751v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine writing with large language models often relies on retrieval-augmented generation. However, these approaches remain confined within the boundaries of the model's predefined scope, limiting the generation of content with rich information. Specifically, vanilla-retrieved information tends to lack depth, novelty, and suffers from redundancy, which negatively impacts the quality of generated articles, leading to shallow, unoriginal, and repetitive outputs. To address these issues, we propose OmniThink, a slow-thinking machine writing framework that emulates the human-like process of iterative expansion and reflection. The core idea behind OmniThink is to simulate the cognitive behavior of learners as they slowly deepen their knowledge of the topics. Experimental results demonstrate that OmniThink improves the knowledge density of generated articles without compromising metrics such as coherence and depth. Human evaluations and expert feedback further highlight the potential of OmniThink to address real-world challenges in the generation of long-form articles.</description>

      <title>An Open-Source Web-Based Tool for Evaluating Open-Source Large Language Models Leveraging Information Retrieval from Custom Documents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10916v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In our work, we present the first-of-its-kind open-source web-based tool which is able to demonstrate the impacts of a user's speech act during discourse with conversational agents, which leverages open-source large language models. With this software resource, it is possible for researchers and experts to evaluate the performance of various dialogues, visualize the user's communicative intents, and utilise uploaded specific documents for the chat agent to use for its information retrieval to respond to the user query. The context gathered by these models is obtained from a set of linguistic features extracted, which forms the context embeddings of the models. Regardless of these models showing good context understanding based on these features, there still remains a gap in including deeper pragmatic features to improve the model's comprehension of the query, hence the efforts to develop this web resource, which is able to extract and then inject this overlooked feature in the encoder-decoder pipeline of the conversational agent. To demonstrate the effect and impact of the resource, we carried out an experiment which evaluated the system using 2 knowledge files for information retrieval, with two user queries each, across 5 open-source large language models using 10 standard metrics. Our results showed that larger open-source models, demonstrated an improved alignment when the user speech act was included with their query. The smaller models in contrast showed an increased perplexity and mixed performance, which explicitly indicated struggles in processing queries that explicitly included speech acts. The results from the analysis using the developed web resource highlight the potential of speech acts towards enhancing conversational depths while underscoring the need for model-specific optimizations to address increased computational costs and response times.</description>
