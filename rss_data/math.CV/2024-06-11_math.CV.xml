      <title>Space of circle patterns on tori and its symplectic form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider circle patterns on closed tori equipped with complex projective structures. There is an embedding of the space of circle patterns to the Teichm\"{u}ller space of a punctured surface. Via the embedding, the Weil-Petersson symplectic form is pulled back to the space of circle patterns. We investigate its non-degeneracy. On the other hand, we also complete a conjecture that the space of circle patterns is homeomorphic to the Teichm\"{u}ller space of the closed torus.</description>

      <title>On a nonhomogeneous heat equation on the complex plane</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate the existence, uniqueness, and asymptotic behaviors of mild solutions of a parabolic evolution equations on complex plane, in which the diffusion operator has the form \(\overline{\Box}_{\varphi} = \overline{D}\, \overline{D}^{\ast}\), where \(\overline{D} f = \bar{\partial}f + \varphi_{\bar{z}} f\), the function \(\varphi\) is smooth and subharmonic on \(\mathbb{C}\), and \(\overline{D}^{\ast}\) is the formal adjoint of \(\overline{D}\). Our method combines certain estimates of heat kernel associating with the homogeneous linear equation of Raich \cite{raich06} and a fixed point argument.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a complete classification of simply-connected pluriclosed manifolds with parallel Bismut torsion, extending previously known results in the literature. Consequently, we also establish a splitting theorem for compact manifolds that are both pluriclosed with parallel Bismut torsion and Calabi-Yau with torsion.</description>

      <title>The Tannaka group $E_6$ only arises from cubic threefolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that under mild assumptions, the Fano surfaces of lines on smooth cubic threefolds are the only smooth subvarieties of abelian varieties whose Tannaka group for the convolution of perverse sheaves is an exceptional simple group. This in particular leads to a considerable strengthening of our previous work on the Shafarevich conjecture. A key idea is to control the Hodge decomposition on cohomology by a cocharacter of the Tannaka group of Hodge modules, and to play this off against an improvement of the Hodge number estimates for irregular varieties by Lazarsfeld-Popa and Lombardi.</description>

      <title>General form of second main theorem on generalized $p$-Parabolic manifolds for arbitrary closed subschemes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.01889v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By introducing the notion of distributive constant for a family of closed subschemes, we establish a general form of the second main theorem for algebraic nondegenerate meromorphic mappings from a generalized $p$-Parabolic manifold into a projective variety with arbitrary families of closed subschemes. As its consequence, we give a second main theorem for such meromorphic mappings intersecting arbitrary hypersurfaces with an explicitly truncation level for the counting functions.</description>

      <title>Towards computing the harmonic-measure distribution function for the middle-thirds Cantor set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.00235v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the numerical computation of the harmonic-measure distribution function, or $h$-function for short, associated with a particular planar domain. This function describes the hitting probability of a Brownian walker released from some point with the boundary of the domain. We use a fast and accurate boundary integral method for the numerical calculation of the $h$-functions for symmetric multiply connected slit domains with high connectivity. In view of the fact that the middle-thirds Cantor set $\mathcal{C}$ is a special limiting case of these slit domains, the proposed method is used to approximate the $h$-function for the set $\mathcal{C}$. We also numerically analyze some asymptotic features of the calculated $h$-functions.</description>

      <title>Fast computation of analytic capacity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.01808v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A boundary integral equation method is presented for fast computation of the analytic capacities of compact sets in the complex plane. The method is based on using the Kerzman--Stein integral equation to compute the Szeg\"o kernel and then the value of the Ahlfors map at the point at infinity. The proposed method can be used for domains with smooth and piecewise smooth boundaries. When combined with conformal mappings, the method can be used for compact slit sets. Several numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method. We recover some known exact results and corroborate the conjectural subadditivity property of analytic capacity.</description>

      <title>The complex structure of the Teichm\"uller space of circle diffeomorphisms in the Zygmund smooth class</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15521v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide the complex Banach manifold structure for the Teichmueller space of circle diffeomorphisms whose derivatives are in the Zygmund class. This is done by showing that the Schwarzian derivative map is a holomorphic split submersion. We prove similar results for the pre-Schwarzian derivative map and investigate the fiber space over the Teichmueller space. Especially, we show that this projection is also a holomorphic split submersion and induces the structure of a disk bundle. Finally, we introduce the little Zygmund class and consider the closed subspace given by this family of mappings in the Teichmueller space.</description>

      <title>A new class of Carleson measures and integral operators on Bergman spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11692v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $n$ be a positive integer and $\mathbf{g}=(g_0,g_1,\cdots,g_{n-1})$, with $g_k\in H(\mathbb{D})$ for $k=0,1,\cdots,n-1$. Let $I_{\mathbf{g}}^{(n)}$ be the generalized Volterra-type operators on $H(\mathbb{C})$, which is represented as $$ I_{\mathbf{g}}^{(n)}f=I^n\left(fg_0+f'g_1+\cdots+f^{(n-1)}g_{n-1}\right), $$ where $I$ denotes the integration operator $$(If)(z)=\int_0^zf(w)dw,$$ and $I^n$ is the $n$th iteration of $I$. This operator is a generalization of the operator that was introduced by Chalmoukis in \cite{Cn}. In this paper, we study the boundedness and compactness of the operator $I_{\mathbf{g}}^{(n)}$ acting on Bergman spaces to another. As a consequence of these characterizations, we obtain conditions for certain linear differential equations to have solutions in Bergman spaces. Moreover, we study the boundedness, compactness and Hilbert-Schmidtness of the following sums of generalized weighted composition operators: Let $\mathbf{u}=(u_0,u_1,\cdots,u_n)$ with $u_k\in H(\mathbb{D})$ for $0\leq k\leq n$ and $\varphi$ be an analytic self-map of $\mathbb{D}.$ The sums of generalized weighted composition operators is defined by $$L_{\mathbf{u},\varphi}^{(n)}=\sum_{k=0}^nW_{u_k,\varphi}^{(k)},$$ where $$W_{u_k,\varphi}^{(k)}f=u_k\cdot f^{(k)}\circ\varphi.$$ Our approach involves the study of new class of Sobolev-Carleson measures for classical Bergman spaces on unit disk which appears in the first main Theorems \ref{Theorem1.1} and \ref{Theorem1.2}.</description>

      <title>A Bishop-Phelps-Bollob\'{a}s theorem for bounded analytic functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2109.10125v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $H^\infty$ denote the Banach algebra of all bounded analytic functions on the open unit disc and denote by $\mathscr{B}(H^\infty)$ the Banach space of all bounded linear operators from $H^\infty$ to itself. We prove that the Bishop-Phelps-Bollob\'{a}s property holds for $\mathscr{B}(H^\infty)$. As an application to our approach, we prove that the Bishop-Phelps-Bollob\'{a}s property also holds for operator ideals of $\mathscr{B}(H^\infty)$.</description>

      <title>Bloch-Ros principle and its application to surface theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12909v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There exists the duality between normal family theory and value distribution theory of meromorphic functions, which is called the Bloch principle. Zalcman formulated a more precise statement on it. In this paper, based on the Zalcman and Ros work, we comprehend the phenomenon of the trinity among normal family theory, value distribution theory and minimal surface theory and give a systematic description to the relationship among the Montel theorem, the Liuoville theorem and the Bernstein theorem as well as the Carath\'{e}odory-Montel theorem, the Picard little theorem and the Fujimoto theorem. We call this phenomenon Bloch-Ros principle. We also generalize the Bloch-Ros principle to various classes of surfaces, for instance, maxfaces in the Lorentz-Minkowski $3$-space, improper affine fronts in the affine $3$-space and flat fronts in the hyperbolic $3$-space. In particular, we give an effective criterion to determine which properties for meromorphic functions that play a role of the Gauss maps of these classes of surfaces satisfy the Gaussian curvature estimate.</description>
