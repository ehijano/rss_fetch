      <title>AlphaFold2 for protein structure prediction: Best practices and critical analyses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AlphaFold2 (AF2) has emerged in recent years as a groundbreaking innovation that has revolutionized several scientific fields, in particular structural biology, drug design and the elucidation of disease mechanisms. Many scientists now use AF2 on a daily basis, including non-specialist users. This chapter is aimed at the latter. Tips and tricks for getting the most out of AF2 to produce a high quality biological model are discussed here. We suggest to non-specialist users how to maintain a critical perspective when working with AF2 models and provide guidelines on how to properly evaluate them. After showing how to perform our own structure prediction using ColabFold, we list several ways to improve AF2 models by adding information that is missing from the original AF2 model. By using software such as AlphaFill to add cofactors and ligands to the models, or MODELLER to add disulfide bridges between cysteines, we guide users to build a high quality biological model suitable for applications such as drug design, protein interaction or molecular dynamics studies.</description>

      <title>Predicting the stability of profiling signals of small RNAs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Profiling is a process that finds similarities between different RNA secondary structures by extracting signals from the Boltzmann sampling. The reproducibility of profiling can be identified by the standard deviation of number of features among Boltzmann samples. We found a strong relationship between the frequency of each helix class and its standard deviation of the frequency upon repeated Boltzmann sampling. We developed a perturbation technique to predict the stability of these featured helix classes without the need for repeated Boltzmann sampling, with accuracy between 84% and 94%, depending on the type of RNA. Our technique only requires 0.2% of the computation time compared to one profiling process.</description>

      <title>Strangers in a foreign land: 'Yeastizing' plant enzymes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Expressing plant metabolic pathways in microbial platforms is an efficient, cost-effective solution for producing many desired plant compounds. As eukaryotic organisms, yeasts are often the preferred platform. However, expression of plant enzymes in a yeast frequently leads to failure because the enzymes are poorly adapted to the foreign yeast cellular environment. Here we first summarize current engineering approaches for optimizing performance of plant enzymes in yeast. A critical limitation of these approaches is that they are labor-intensive and must be customized for each individual enzyme, which significantly hinders the establishment of plant pathways in cellular factories. In response to this challenge, we propose the development of a cost-effective computational pipeline to redesign plant enzymes for better adaptation to the yeast cellular milieu. This proposition is underpinned by compelling evidence that plant and yeast enzymes exhibit distinct sequence features that are generalizable across enzyme families. Consequently, we introduce a data-driven machine learning framework designed to extract 'yeastizing' rules from natural protein sequence variations, which can be broadly applied to all enzymes. Additionally, we discuss the potential to integrate the machine learning model into a full design-build-test-cycle.</description>

      <title>FoldToken: Learning Protein Language via Vector Quantization and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09673v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Is there a foreign language describing protein sequences and structures simultaneously? Protein structures, represented by continuous 3D points, have long posed a challenge due to the contrasting modeling paradigms of discrete sequences. We introduce \textbf{FoldTokenizer} to represent protein sequence-structure as discrete symbols. This innovative approach involves projecting residue types and structures into a discrete space, guided by a reconstruction loss for information preservation. We refer to the learned discrete symbols as \textbf{FoldToken}, and the sequence of FoldTokens serves as a new protein language, transforming the protein sequence-structure into a unified modality. We apply the created protein language on general backbone inpainting and antibody design tasks, building the first GPT-style model (\textbf{FoldGPT}) for sequence-structure co-generation with promising results. Key to our success is the substantial enhancement of the vector quantization module, Soft Conditional Vector Quantization (\textbf{SoftCVQ}).</description>
