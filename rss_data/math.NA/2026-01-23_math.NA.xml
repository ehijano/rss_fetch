      <title>Efficient Numerical Reconstruction of Wave Equation Sources via Droplet-Induced Asymptotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop and numerically implement a novel approach for solving the inverse source problem of the acoustic wave equation in three dimensions. By injecting a small high-contrast droplet into the medium, we exploit the resulting wave field perturbation measured at a single external point over time. The method enables stable source reconstructions where conventional approaches fail due to ill-posedness, with potential applications in medical imaging and non-destructive testing. Key contributions include:
  1. Implementation of a theoretically justified asymptotic expansion, from [33], using the eigensystem of the Newtonian operator, with error analysis for the spectral truncation.
  2. Novel numerical schemes for solving the time-domain Lippmann-Schwinger equation and reconstructing the source via Riesz basis expansions and mollification-based numerical differentiations.
  3. Reconstruction requiring only single-point measurements, overcoming traditional spatial data limitations.
  4. 3D numerical experiments demonstrating accurate source recovery under noise (SNR of the order $1/a$), with error analysis for the droplet size (of the order $a$) and the number of spectral modes $N$.</description>

      <title>A fully diagonalized spectral method on the unit ball</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our main objective in this work is to show how Sobolev orthogonal polynomials emerge as a useful tool within the framework of spectral methods for boundary-value problems. The solution of a boundary-value problem for a stationary Schr\"odinger equation on the unit ball can be studied from a variational perspective. In this variational formulation, a Sobolev inner product naturally arises. As test functions, we consider the linear space of the polynomials satisfying the boundary conditions on the sphere, and a basis of mutually orthogonal polynomials with respect to the Sobolev inner product is provided. The basis of the proposed method is given in terms of spherical harmonics and univariate Sobolev orthogonal polynomials. The connection formula between these Sobolev orthogonal polynomials and the classical orthogonal polynomials on the ball is established. Consequently, the Sobolev Fourier coefficients of a function satisfying the boundary value problem are recursively derived. Finally, one numerical experiment is presented.</description>

      <title>Canonical structure of the LLG equation for exponential updates in micromagnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this contribution we propose an exponential update algorithm for magnetic moments appearing in the framework of micromagnetics and the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation. This algorithm can be interpreted as the geometric integration on spheres, that a priori satisfy the unit length constraint of the normalized magnetization vector. Even though the geometric structures for this are obvious and some works already use an exponential algorithm, to the best of the authors' knowledge, there is no canonical structure of the LLG equation for the exponential update algorithm in micromagnetism. Tensor algebraic reformulations of the LLG equation allow the canonical representation of the evolution equation for the magnetization, which serves as the basis for different integrators. Based on the specific structure of the exponential of skew symmetric matrices an efficient update scheme is derived. The excellent performance of the proposed exponential update algorithm is demonstrated in representative examples.</description>

      <title>A hybrid reconstruction of piece-wise smooth functions from non-uniform Fourier data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of reconstructing piece-wise smooth functions from their non-uniform Fourier data. We first extend the filter method for uniform Fourier data to the non-uniform setting by using the techniques of admissible frames. We show that the proposed non-uniform filter method converges exponentially away from the jump discontinuities. However, the convergence rate is significantly slower near the jump discontinuities due to the Gibbs phenomenon. To overcome this issue, we combine the non-uniform filter method with a stable extrapolation method to recover the function values near the jump discontinuities. We show that the proposed hybrid method could achieve exponential accuracy uniformly on the entire domain. Numerical experiments are provided to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>A tensor network formalism for neuro-symbolic AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The unification of neural and symbolic approaches to artificial intelligence remains a central open challenge. In this work, we introduce a tensor network formalism, which captures sparsity principles originating in the different approaches in tensor decompositions. In particular, we describe a basis encoding scheme for functions and model neural decompositions as tensor decompositions. The proposed formalism can be applied to represent logical formulas and probability distributions as structured tensor decompositions. This unified treatment identifies tensor network contractions as a fundamental inference class and formulates efficiently scaling reasoning algorithms, originating from probability theory and propositional logic, as contraction message passing schemes. The framework enables the definition and training of hybrid logical and probabilistic models, which we call Hybrid Logic Network. The theoretical concepts are accompanied by the python library tnreason, which enables the implementation and practical use of the proposed architectures.</description>

      <title>A domain decomposition strategy for natural imposition of mixed boundary conditions in port-Hamiltonian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06107v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this contribution, a finite element scheme to impose mixed boundary conditions without introducing Lagrange multipliers is presented for hyperbolic systems described as port-Hamiltonian systems. The strategy relies on finite element exterior calculus and domain decomposition to interconnect two systems with dual input-output behavior. The spatial domain is split into two parts by introducing an arbitrary interface. Each subdomain is discretized with a mixed finite element formulation that introduces a uniform boundary condition in a natural way as the input. In each subdomain the finite element spaces are selected from a finite element subcomplex to obtain a stable discretization. The two systems are then interconnected together by making use of a feedback interconnection. This is achieved by discretizing the boundary inputs using appropriate spaces that couple the two formulations. The final systems include all boundary conditions explicitly and do not contain any Lagrange multiplier. Time integration is performed using the implicit midpoint or St\"ormer-Verlet scheme. The method can also be applied to semilinear systems containing algebraic nonlinearities. The proposed strategy is tested on different examples: geometrically exact intrinsic beam model, the wave equation, membrane elastodynamics and the Mindlin plate. Numerical tests assess the conservation properties of the scheme, the effectiveness of the methodology and its robustness against shear locking phenomena.</description>

      <title>The PML method for calculating the propagative wave numbers of electromagnetic wave in periodic structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07084v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When the electromagnetic wave is incident on the periodic structures, in addition to the scattering field, some guided modes that are traveling in the periodic medium could be generated. In the present paper, we study the calculation of guided modes. We formulate the problem as a nonlinear eigenvalue problem in an unbounded periodic domain. Then we use perfectly matched layers to truncate the unbounded domain, recast the problem to a quadratic eigenvalue problem, and prove the approximation property of the truncation. Finally, we formulate the quadratic eigenvalue problem to a general eigenvalue problem, use the finite element method to discrete the truncation problem, and show numerical examples to verify theoretical results.</description>

      <title>A Unified Framework for Efficient Kernel and Polynomial Interpolation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12629v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a unified interpolation scheme that combines compactly-supported positive-definite kernels and multivariate polynomials. This unified framework generalizes interpolation with compactly-supported kernels and also classical polynomial least squares approximation. To facilitate the efficient use of this unified interpolation scheme, we present specialized numerical linear algebra procedures that leverage standard matrix factorizations. These procedures allow for efficient computation and storage of the unified interpolant. We also present a modification to the numerical linear algebra that allows us to generalize the application of the unified framework to target functions on manifolds with and without boundary. Our numerical experiments on both Euclidean domains and manifolds indicate that the unified interpolant is superior to polynomial least squares for the interpolation of target functions in settings with boundaries.</description>

Abstract: This work is a follow-up to a poster that was presented at the DD29 conference. Participants were asked the question: ``Do you precondition on the left or on the right?''. Here we report on the results of this social experiment. We also provide context on left, right and split preconditioning, share our literature review on the topic, and analyze some of the finer points. Two examples illustrate that convergence bounds can sometimes lead to misleading conclusions.</description>

      <title>Deep Neural networks for solving high-dimensional parabolic partial differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13256v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The numerical solution of high dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs) is severely constrained by the curse of dimensionality (CoD), rendering classical grid--based methods impractical beyond a few dimensions. In recent years, deep neural networks have emerged as a promising mesh free alternative, enabling the approximation of PDE solutions in tens to thousands of dimensions. This review provides a tutorial--oriented introduction to neural--network--based methods for solving high dimensional parabolic PDEs, emphasizing conceptual clarity and methodological connections. We organize the literature around three unifying paradigms: (i) PDE residual--based approaches, including physicsinformed neural networks and their high dimensional variants; (ii) stochastic methods derived from Feynman--Kac and backward stochastic differential equation formulations; and (iii) hybrid derivative--free random difference approaches designed to alleviate the computational cost of derivatives in high dimensions. For each paradigm, we outline the underlying mathematical formulation, algorithmic implementation, and practical strengths and limitations. Representative benchmark problems--including Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman and Black--Scholes equations in up to 1000 dimensions --illustrate the scalability, effectiveness, and accuracy of the methods. The paper concludes with a discussion of open challenges and future directions for reliable and scalable solvers of high dimensional PDEs.</description>

      <title>Neural Green's Operators for Parametric Partial Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01857v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a paradigm for constructing parametric neural operators that are derived from finite-dimensional representations of Green's operators for linear partial differential equations (PDEs). We refer to such neural operators as Neural Green's Operators (NGOs). Our construction of NGOs preserves the linear action of Green's operators on the inhomogeneity fields, while approximating the nonlinear dependence of the Green's function on the coefficients of the PDE using neural networks. This construction reduces the complexity of the problem from learning the entire solution operator and its dependence on all parameters to only learning the Green's function and its dependence on the PDE coefficients. Furthermore, we show that our explicit representation of Green's functions enables the embedding of desirable mathematical attributes in our NGO architectures, such as symmetry, spectral, and conservation properties. Through numerical benchmarks on canonical PDEs, we demonstrate that NGOs achieve comparable or superior accuracy to Deep Operator Networks, Variationally Mimetic Operator Networks, and Fourier Neural Operators with similar parameter counts, while generalizing significantly better when tested on out-of-distribution data. For parametric time-dependent PDEs, we show that NGOs that are trained on a single time step can produce pointwise-accurate dynamics in an auto-regressive manner over arbitrarily large numbers of time steps. For parametric nonlinear PDEs, we demonstrate that NGOs trained exclusively on solutions of corresponding linear problems can be embedded within iterative solvers to yield accurate solutions, provided a suitable initial guess is available. Finally, we show that we can leverage the explicit representation of Green's functions returned by NGOs to construct effective matrix preconditioners that accelerate iterative solvers for PDEs.</description>

      <title>Numerical Optimization Strategies for the Variational Hamiltonian Ansatz in Noisy Quantum Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22398v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The prevalence of variational methods in near-term quantum computing makes optimizer choice critical, yet selection is frequently intuition-based. We therefore present a systematic benchmark of eight classical optimization algorithms for variational quantum chemistry using the truncated Variational Hamiltonian Ansatz. Performance is evaluated on H$_2$, H$_4$, and LiH in both full and active-space representations under noiseless and finite-shot sampling noise. Sampling noise substantially reshapes cost landscapes, induces wandering near minima, and flips optimizer rankings: gradient-based methods perform best in noiseless simulations, whereas population-based optimizers, particularly CMA-ES, show greater robustness under finite-shot noise. Optimizer performance is strongly problem dependent: Hartree-Fock initialization aids small systems, but its advantage diminishes with system size. Also, we observe that finite shot sampling frequently violates the lower bound given by the variational principle, a principle that cannot be strictly held in the presence of noise. By exploiting the guaranteed convergence of Evolution Strategies to a steady state distribution defined by the noise floor, we utilize the symmetry of these violations to achieve energy estimation precision beyond the intrinsic sampling limit.</description>

      <title>Quantum matrix arithmetics with Hamiltonian evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06316v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The efficient implementation of matrix arithmetic operations underpins the speedups of many quantum algorithms. We develop a suite of methods to perform matrix arithmetics -- with the result encoded in the off-diagonal blocks of a Hamiltonian -- using Hamiltonian evolutions of input operators. We show how to maintain this $\textit{Hamiltonian block encoding}$, so that matrix operations can be composed one after another, and the entire quantum computation takes $\leq 2$ ancilla qubits. We achieve this for matrix multiplication, matrix addition, matrix inversion, Hermitian conjugation, fractional scaling, integer scaling, complex phase scaling, as well as singular value transformation for both odd and even polynomials. We also present an overlap estimation algorithm to extract classical properties of Hamiltonian block encoded operators, analogous to the well known Hadmard test, at no extra cost of qubit. Our Hamiltonian matrix multiplication uses the Lie group commutator product formula and its higher-order generalizations due to Childs and Wiebe. Our Hamiltonian singular value transformation employs a dominated polynomial approximation, where the approximation holds within the domain of interest, while the constructed polynomial is upper bounded by the target function over the entire unit interval. We describe a circuit for simulating a class of sum-of-squares Hamiltonians, attaining a commutator scaling in step count, while leveraging the power of matrix arithmetics to reduce the cost of each simulation step. In particular, we apply this to the doubly factorized tensor hypercontracted Hamiltonians from recent studies of quantum chemistry, obtaining further improvements for initial states with a fixed number of particles. We achieve this with $1$ ancilla qubit.</description>

      <title>A Domain Decomposition-based Solver for Acoustic Wave propagation in Two-Dimensional Random Media</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23027v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An acoustic wave propagation problem with a log normal random field approximation for wave speed is solved using a sampling-free intrusive stochastic Galerkin approach. The stochastic partial differential equation with the inputs and outputs expanded using polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) is transformed into a set of deterministic PDEs and further to a system of linear equations. Domain decomposition (DD)-based solvers are utilized to handle the overwhelming computational cost for the resulting system with increasing mesh size, time step and number of random parameters. A conjugate gradient iterative solver with a two-level Neumann-Neumann preconditioner is applied here showing their efficient scalabilities.</description>
