      <title>The $A$-philosophy for the Hardy $Z$-Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent works we have introduced the parameter space $\mathcal{Z}_N$ of $A$-variations of the Hardy $Z$-function, $Z(t)$, whose elements are functions of the form \begin{equation} \label{eq:Z-sections} Z_N(t ; \overline{a} ) = \cos(\theta(t))+ \sum_{k=1}^{N} \frac{a_k}{\sqrt{k+1} } \cos ( \theta (t) - \ln(k+1) t), \end{equation} where $\overline{a} = (a_1,...,a_N) \in \mathbb{R}^N$. The \( A \)-philosophy advocates that studying the discriminant hypersurface forming within such parameter spaces, often reveals essential insights about the original mathematical object and its zeros. In this paper we apply the $A$-philosophy to our space $\mathcal{Z}_N$ by introducing \( \Delta_n(\overline{a} ) \) the $n$-th Gram discriminant of \( Z(t) \). We show that the Riemann Hypothesis (RH) is equivalent to the corrected Gram's law \[ (-1)^n \Delta_n(\overline{1}) &gt; 0, \] for any $n \in \mathbb{Z}$. We further show that the classical Gram's law \( (-1)^n Z(g_n) &gt;0\) can be considered as a first-order approximation of our corrected law. The second-order approximation of $\Delta_n (\overline{a})$ is then shown to be related to shifts of Gram points along the \( t \)-axis. This leads to the discovery of a new, previously unobserved, repulsion phenomena \[ \left| Z'(g_n) \right| &gt; 4 \left| Z(g_n) \right|, \] for bad Gram points $g_n$ whose consecutive neighbours $g_{n \pm 1}$ are good. Our analysis of the \(A\)-variation space \(\mathcal{Z}_N\) introduces a wealth of new results on the zeros of \(Z(t)\), casting new light on classical questions such as Gram's law, the Montgomery pair-correlation conjecture, and the RH, and also unveils previously unknown fundamental properties.</description>

      <title>A Simple Formula for Single-Variable Multinomial Coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00301v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine an underexplored property of polynomials, which states that under certain conditions, a polynomial can be completely determined by only two evaluations. We prove this property and then apply it to derive a novel formula for computing single-variable multinomial coefficients using only basic arithmetic operations. Additionally, we show how our formula addresses an open question posed by Graham, Knuth, and Patashnik regarding a simple closed form for the central trinomial coefficients. We conclude by posing an open problem of our own related to efficient computation of binomial coefficients modulo $n$.</description>

      <title>Using binary string to prove the Collatz conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00001v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a full binary directed tree structure to represent the set of natural numbers, further categorizing them into three distinct subsets: pure odd numbers, pure even numbers, and mixed numbers. We adopt a binary string representation for natural numbers and elaborate on the composite methodology encompassing odd- and even-number functions. Our analysis focuses on examining the iteration sequence (or composition) of the Collatz function and its reduced variant, which serves as an analog to the inverse function, to scrutinize the validity of the Collatz conjecture. To substantiate this conjecture, we incorporate binary strings into an algebraic formula that captures the essence of the Collatz sequence. By this means, we transform discrete powers of 2 into continuous counterparts, ultimately culminating in the smallest natural number, 1. Consequently, the sequence generated through infinite iterations of the Collatz function emerges as an eventually periodic sequence, thereby validating an enduring 87-year-old conjecture.</description>
