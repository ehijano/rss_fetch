      <title>Teaching quantum computing to computer science students: Review of a hands-on quantum circuit simulation practical</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a practical course targeting graduate students with prior knowledge of the basics of quantum computing. The practical aims to deepen students' understanding of fundamental concepts in quantum computing by implementing quantum circuit simulators. Through hands-on experience, students learn about different methods to simulate quantum computing, including state vectors, density matrices, the stabilizer formalism, and matrix product states. By implementing the simulation methods themselves, students develop a more in-depth understanding of fundamental concepts in quantum computing, including superposition, entanglement, and the effects of noise on quantum systems. This hands-on experience prepares students to do research in the field of quantum computing and equips them with the knowledge and skills necessary to tackle complex research projects in the field. In this work, we describe our teaching approach and the structure of our practical, and we discuss evaluations and lessons learned.</description>

      <title>DISCA: A Digital In-memory Stochastic Computing Architecture Using A Compressed Bent-Pyramid Format</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nowadays, we are witnessing an Artificial Intelligence revolution that dominates the technology landscape in various application domains, such as healthcare, robotics, automotive, security, and defense. Massive-scale AI models, which mimic the human brain's functionality, typically feature millions and even billions of parameters through data-intensive matrix multiplication tasks. While conventional Von-Neumann architectures struggle with the memory wall and the end of Moore's Law, these AI applications are migrating rapidly towards the edge, such as in robotics and unmanned aerial vehicles for surveillance, thereby adding more constraints to the hardware budget of AI architectures at the edge. Although in-memory computing has been proposed as a promising solution for the memory wall, both analog and digital in-memory computing architectures suffer from substantial degradation of the proposed benefits due to various design limitations. We propose a new digital in-memory stochastic computing architecture, DISCA, utilizing a compressed version of the quasi-stochastic Bent-Pyramid data format. DISCA inherits the same computational simplicity of analog computing, while preserving the same scalability, productivity, and reliability of digital systems. Post-layout modeling results of DISCA show an energy efficiency of 3.59 TOPS/W per bit at 500 MHz using a commercial 180nm CMOS technology. Therefore, DISCA significantly improves the energy efficiency for matrix multiplication workloads by orders of magnitude if scaled and compared to its counterpart architectures.</description>

      <title>Biologically Inspired Predictive Coding TCN-Transformer for Anticipatory Human-Robot Interaction in Shared Physical Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13955v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As mobile robots increasingly operate in environments shared with humans, proactively anticipating human motion rather than responding reactively is critical for preempting collisions during close-proximity navigation, while maintaining mobility efficiency and avoiding unnecessary yields. A timely and motivating engineering application is how autonomous vehicles interpret ambiguous right-of-way such as unsignalized pedestrian crossings. To address this challenge, this study explores the feasibility of decoding preparatory neural activity from wearable electroencephalography (EEG) to predict human motion intention before it is behaviorally expressed. Drawing inspiration from biological predictive coding mechanisms between the sensorimotor cortex and insula-frontoparietal network, we implement this principle in a Temporal Convolutional Network-Transformer architecture to decode fast-evolving EEG signals underlying perception-action transitions. In experiments involving twelve participants simulating road-crossing decisions under varying traffic volume, marked crosswalks, and traffic signals, neurophysiological analyses reveal hemispheric asymmetries in functional specialization and identify high-beta oscillations (16-25 Hz) in the right fronto-central region (F4) as robust neural markers of motor readiness and decision commitment. Using sliding-window feature extraction, we benchmarked sixteen classification models across traditional, recurrent, and convolutional deep learning architectures, and found that our approach achieved the highest Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.727 with an approximate 1-second look-ahead. This work demonstrates how biologically grounded temporal architectures can enhance anticipatory intelligence in autonomous systems and represents the first step toward proactive and adaptive human-robot interaction in the built environment.</description>

      <title>Valet: Efficient Data Placement on Modern SSDs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00977v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The increasing demand for SSDs coupled with scaling difficulties has left manufacturers scrambling for newer SSD interfaces which promise better performance and durability. While these interfaces reduce the rigidity of traditional abstractions, they require application or system-level changes that can impact the stability, security, and portability of systems. To make matters worse, such changes are rendered futile with the introduction of next-generation interfaces. It is therefore no surprise that such interfaces have seen limited adoption, leaving behind a graveyard of experimental interfaces ranging from open-channel SSDs to stream SSDs.
  Our solution, Valet, leverages userspace shim layers to add placement hints for application data, delivering up to 2-4x write throughput over filesystems and comparable or better performance than application-specific solutions, with up to 6x lower tail latency. Valet generates dynamic placement hints, remapping application data to modern SSDs with zero modifications to the application, the filesystem, or the kernel. We demonstrate performance, efficiency, and multi-tenancy benefits of Valet across a set of widely-used applications: RocksDB, MongoDB, and CacheLib, presenting a solution that combines the performance of application-specific solutions with wide applicability to log-structured data-intensive applications.</description>
