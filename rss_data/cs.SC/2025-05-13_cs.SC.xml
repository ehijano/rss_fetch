      <title>Bounds for D-Algebraic Closure Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide bounds on the size of polynomial differential equations obtained by executing closure properties for D-algebraic functions. While it is easy to obtain bounds on the order of these equations, it requires some more work to derive bounds on their degree. Here we give bounds that apply under some technical condition about the defining differential equations.</description>

      <title>A linear-time algorithm to compute the conjugate of nonconvex bivariate piecewise linear-quadratic functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose the first linear-time algorithm to compute the conjugate of (nonconvex) bivariate piecewise linear-quadratic (PLQ) functions (bivariate quadratic functions defined on a polyhedral subdivision). Our algorithm starts with computing the convex envelope of each quadratic piece obtaining rational functions (quadratic over linear) defined over a polyhedral subdivision. Then we compute the conjugate of each resulting piece to obtain piecewise quadratic functions defined over a parabolic subdivision. Finally we compute the maximum of all those functions to obtain the conjugate as a piecewise quadratic function defined on a parabolic subdivision. The resulting algorithm runs in linear time if the initial subdivision is a triangulation (or has a uniform upper bound on the number of vertexes for each piece).
  Our open-source implementation in MATLAB uses symbolic computation and rational numbers to avoid floating-point errors, and merges pieces as soon as possible to minimize computation time.</description>

      <title>Periods of fibre products of elliptic surfaces and the Gamma conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide an algorithm for computing a basis of homology of fibre products of elliptic surfaces over $\mathbb P^1$, along with the corresponding intersection product and period matrices. We use this data to investigate the Gamma conjecture for Calabi-Yau threefolds obtained in this manner. We find a formula that works for all operators of a list of 105 fibre products, as well as for fourth order operators of the Calabi-Yau database. This algorithm comes with a SageMath implementation.</description>

      <title>Model Human Learners: Computational Models to Guide Instructional Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02456v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Instructional designers face an overwhelming array of design choices, making it challenging to identify the most effective interventions. To address this issue, I propose the concept of a Model Human Learner, a unified computational model of learning that can aid designers in evaluating candidate interventions. This paper presents the first successful demonstration of this concept, showing that a computational model can accurately predict the outcomes of two human A/B experiments -- one testing a problem sequencing intervention and the other testing an item design intervention. It also demonstrates that such a model can generate learning curves without requiring human data and provide theoretical insights into why an instructional intervention is effective. These findings lay the groundwork for future Model Human Learners that integrate cognitive and learning theories to support instructional design across diverse tasks and interventions.</description>
