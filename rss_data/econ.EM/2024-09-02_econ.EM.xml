      <title>State Space Model of Realized Volatility under the Existence of Dependent Market Microstructure Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Volatility means the degree of variation of a stock price which is important in finance. Realized Volatility (RV) is an estimator of the volatility calculated using high-frequency observed prices. RV has lately attracted considerable attention of econometrics and mathematical finance. However, it is known that high-frequency data includes observation errors called market microstructure noise (MN). Nagakura and Watanabe[2015] proposed a state space model that resolves RV into true volatility and influence of MN. In this paper, we assume a dependent MN that autocorrelates and correlates with return as reported by Hansen and Lunde[2006] and extends the results of Nagakura and Watanabe[2015] and compare models by simulation and actual data.</description>

      <title>Weighted Regression with Sybil Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In many online domains, Sybil networks -- or cases where a single user assumes multiple identities -- is a pervasive feature. This complicates experiments, as off-the-shelf regression estimators at least assume known network topologies (if not fully independent observations) when Sybil network topologies in practice are often unknown. The literature has exclusively focused on techniques to detect Sybil networks, leading many experimenters to subsequently exclude suspected networks entirely before estimating treatment effects. I present a more efficient solution in the presence of these suspected Sybil networks: a weighted regression framework that applies weights based on the probabilities that sets of observations are controlled by single actors. I show in the paper that the MSE-minimizing solution is to set the weight matrix equal to the inverse of the expected network topology. I demonstrate the methodology on simulated data, and then I apply the technique to a competition with suspected Sybil networks run on the Sui blockchain and show reductions in the standard error of the estimate by 6 - 24%.</description>

      <title>Isotonic propensity score matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.08868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.08868v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a one-to-many matching estimator of the average treatment effect based on propensity scores estimated by isotonic regression. The method relies on the monotonicity assumption on the propensity score function, which can be justified in many applications in economics. We show that the nature of the isotonic estimator can help us to fix many problems of existing matching methods, including efficiency, choice of the number of matches, choice of tuning parameters, robustness to propensity score misspecification, and bootstrap validity. As a by-product, a uniformly consistent isotonic estimator is developed for our proposed matching method.</description>

      <title>Inference on many jumps in nonparametric panel regression models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01162v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the significance of change-point or jump effects within fully nonparametric regression contexts, with a particular focus on panel data scenarios where data generation processes vary across individual or group units, and error terms may display complex dependency structures. In our setting the threshold effect depends on a specific covariate, and we permit the true nonparametric regression to vary based on additional latent variables. We propose two uniform testing procedures: one to assess the existence of change-point effects and another to evaluate the uniformity of such effects across units. Even though the underlying data generation processes are neither independent nor identically distributed, our approach involves deriving a straightforward analytical expression to approximate the variance-covariance structure of change-point effects under general dependency conditions. Notably, when Gaussian approximations are made to these test statistics, the intricate dependency structures within the data can be safely disregarded owing to the localized nature of the statistics. This finding bears significant implications for obtaining critical values. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that our tests exhibit excellent control over size and reasonable power performance in finite samples, irrespective of strong cross-sectional and weak serial dependency within the data. Furthermore, applying our tests to two datasets reveals the existence of significant nonsmooth effects in both cases.</description>

      <title>Sparse spanning portfolios and under-diversification with second-order stochastic dominance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01951v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop and implement methods for determining whether relaxing sparsity constraints on portfolios improves the investment opportunity set for risk-averse investors. We formulate a new estimation procedure for sparse second-order stochastic spanning based on a greedy algorithm and Linear Programming. We show the optimal recovery of the sparse solution asymptotically whether spanning holds or not. From large equity datasets, we estimate the expected utility loss due to possible under-diversification, and find that there is no benefit from expanding a sparse opportunity set beyond 45 assets. The optimal sparse portfolio invests in 10 industry sectors and cuts tail risk when compared to a sparse mean-variance portfolio. On a rolling-window basis, the number of assets shrinks to 25 assets in crisis periods, while standard factor models cannot explain the performance of the sparse portfolios.</description>

      <title>Uniform Inference in High-Dimensional Threshold Regression Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08105v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop uniform inference for high-dimensional threshold regression parameters, allowing for either cross-sectional or time series data. We first establish Oracle inequalities for prediction errors and $\ell_1$ estimation errors for the Lasso estimator of the slope parameters and the threshold parameter, accommodating heteroskedastic non-subgaussian error terms and non-subgaussian covariates. Next, we derive the asymptotic distribution of tests involving an increasing number of slope parameters by debiasing (or desparsifying) the Lasso estimator in cases with no threshold effect and with a fixed threshold effect. We show that the asymptotic distributions in both cases are the same, allowing us to perform uniform inference without specifying whether the true model is a linear or threshold regression. Finally, we demonstrate the consistent performance of our estimator in both cases through simulation studies, and we apply the proposed estimator to analyze two empirical applications.</description>
