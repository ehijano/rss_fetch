      <title>Weak Values as Geometric Lenses: Deformations of Hilbert Space and the Emergence of superoscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formalism of weak measurement in quantum mechanics has revealed profound connections between measurement theory, quantum foundations, and signal processing. In this paper, we develop a pointer-free derivation of superoscillations, demonstrating that they are a natural and necessary consequence of the geometric structure underlying weak values. We argue that the weak value is best understood as a ratio of geometric deformation, quantifying how an observable transforms the structure of Hilbert space relative to a reference provided by the standard inner product. This deformation acts as a conceptual lens, warping the local structure of quantum states to produce oscillations far exceeding the global Fourier bandwidth. We formalize this by interpreting the weak value as a comparison between a deformed sesquilinear form and the standard one, and explore its deep connections to generalized Rayleigh quotients and the projective geometry of quantum states. This perspective unifies weak values and superoscillations as two facets of a single underlying geometric principle.</description>

      <title>Embedding-Aware Quantum-Classical SVMs for Scalable Quantum Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Support Vector Machines face scalability challenges due to high-dimensional quantum states and hardware limitations. We propose an embedding-aware quantum-classical pipeline combining class-balanced k-means distillation with pretrained Vision Transformer embeddings. Our key finding: ViT embeddings uniquely enable quantum advantage, achieving up to 8.02% accuracy improvements over classical SVMs on Fashion-MNIST and 4.42% on MNIST, while CNN features show performance degradation. Using 16-qubit tensor network simulation via cuTensorNet, we provide the first systematic evidence that quantum kernel advantage depends critically on embedding choice, revealing fundamental synergy between transformer attention and quantum feature spaces. This provides a practical pathway for scalable quantum machine learning that leverages modern neural architectures.</description>

      <title>Casimir force between two dielectric layers: Van Kampen approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Van Kampen method is used to calculate the Casimir force for two dielectric layers. Several terms of Lorentz oscillators are used in the permittivity model. A conductive dielectric (metal) with the Drude model is considered as a special case. The dependence of strength on thickness has a complex character with saturation at thicknesses of the order of 10 nm. At low thickness, the force density is proportional to the square of the thickness, but this is the case at low thicknesses, when the continuum model is no longer applicable. The correspondence between the method of the Casimir model and the Lorentz model is shown, as well as its applicability for an arbitrary configuration of layers and for a finite temperature.</description>

      <title>Quantum Semi-Random Forests for Qubit-Efficient Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern recommenders describe each item with hundreds of sparse semantic tags, yet most quantum pipelines still map one qubit per tag, demanding well beyond one hundred qubits, far out of reach for current noisy-intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices and prone to deep, error-amplifying circuits. We close this gap with a three-stage hybrid machine learning algorithm that compresses tag profiles, optimizes feature selection under a fixed qubit budget via QAOA, and scores recommendations with a Quantum semi-Random Forest (QsRF) built on just five qubits, while performing similarly to the state-of-the-art methods. Leveraging SVD sketching and k-means, we learn a 1000-atom dictionary ($&gt;$97 \% variance), then solve a 2020 QUBO via depth-3 QAOA to select 5 atoms. A 100-tree QsRF trained on these codes matches full-feature baselines on ICM-150/500.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Quantum Classical Surrogate for Real Time Inverse Finite Element Modeling in Digital Twins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale civil structures, such as bridges, pipelines, and offshore platforms, are vital to modern infrastructure, where unexpected failures can cause significant economic and safety repercussions. Although finite element (FE) modeling is widely used for real-time structural health monitoring (SHM), its high computational cost and the complexity of inverse FE analysis, where low dimensional sensor data must map onto high-dimensional displacement or stress fields pose ongoing challenges. Here, we propose a hybrid quantum classical multilayer perceptron (QMLP) framework to tackle these issues and facilitate swift updates to digital twins across a range of structural applications.
  Our approach embeds sensor data using symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrices and polynomial features, yielding a representation well suited to quantum processing. A parameterized quantum circuit (PQC) transforms these features, and the resultant quantum outputs feed into a classical neural network for final inference. By fusing quantum capabilities with classical modeling, the QMLP handles large scale inverse FE mapping while preserving computational viability.
  Through extensive experiments on a bridge, we demonstrate that the QMLP achieves a mean squared error (MSE) of 0.0000000000316, outperforming purely classical baselines with a large margin. These findings confirm the potential of quantum-enhanced methods for real time SHM, establishing a pathway toward more efficient, scalable digital twins that can robustly monitor and diagnose structural integrity in near real time.</description>

      <title>Dimension reduction with structure-aware quantum circuits for hybrid machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Schmidt decomposition of a vector can be understood as writing the singular value decomposition (SVD) in vector form. A vector can be written as a linear combination of tensor product of two dimensional vectors by recursively applying Schmidt decompositions via SVD to all subsystems. Given a vector expressed as a linear combination of tensor products, using only the $k$ principal terms yields a $k$-rank approximation of the vector. Therefore, writing a vector in this reduced form allows to retain most important parts of the vector while removing small noises from it, analogous to SVD-based denoising.
  In this paper, we show that quantum circuits designed based on a value $k$ (determined from the tensor network decomposition of the mean vector of the training sample) can approximate the reduced-form representations of entire datasets. We then employ this circuit ansatz with a classical neural network head to construct a hybrid machine learning model. Since the output of the quantum circuit for an $2^n$ dimensional vector is an $n$ dimensional probability vector, this provides an exponential compression of the input and potentially can reduce the number of learnable parameters for training large-scale models. We use datasets provided in the Python scikit-learn module for the experiments. The results confirm the quantum circuit is able to compress data successfully to provide effective $k$-rank approximations to the classical processing component.</description>

      <title>Free Independence and Unitary Design from Random Matrix Product Unitaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how complex quantum systems emulate randomness is central to quantum chaos, thermalization, and information theory. In one setting, out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs) have recently been shown to probe asymptotic freeness between Heisenberg operators: the non-commutative generalization of statistical independence. In a distinct research direction, the concept of approximate unitary designs have led to efficient constructions of unitaries that look random according to forward-in-time protocols. Bridging these two concepts, in this work we study the emergence of freeness from a random matrix product unitary (RMPU) ensemble. We prove that, with only polynomial bond dimension, these unitaries reproduce Haar values of higher-order OTOCs for local, finite-trace observables -- precisely the observables that lead to thermal correlations in chaotic many-body systems according to the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. The RMPU ensemble provably forms a unitary design, but, we argue, this does not account for average OTOC behavior and therefore the emergence of freeness. We further compute the ensemble's frame potential exactly to second order, showing convergence to Haar values also with polynomial deviations, indicating that freeness is also reached on-average for global observables. On the other hand, to reproduce the Haar-like OTOC value for local, traceless observables, the considered ensemble requires volume-law operator entanglement. Such correlations therefore lie beyond the paradigm of random unitary features which can be replicated efficiently. Our results highlight the need to refine previous notions of unitary designs in the context of operator dynamics, guiding us towards protocols for genuine quantum advantage while shedding light on the emergent complexity of chaotic many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Learning shadows to predict quantum ground state correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a variational scheme inspired by classical shadow tomography to compute ground state correlations of quantum spin Hamiltonians. Shadow tomography allows for efficient reconstruction of expectation values of arbitrary observables from a bag of repeated, randomized measurements, called snapshots, on copies of the state $\rho$. The prescription allows one to infer expectation values of $M$ $k-$local observables to accuracy $\epsilon$ using just $N \sim 3^k \text{log}M /\epsilon^2$ snapshots when measurements are performed in locally random bases. Turning this around, a bag of snapshots can be considered an efficient representation of the state $\rho$, particularly for estimating low-weight observables, such as terms in a local Hamiltonian needed to estimate the energy. Inspired by this, we consider a variational scheme wherein a bag of $N$ parametrized snapshots is used to represent the putative ground state of a desired local spin Hamiltonian and optimized to lower the energy with respect to it. Additional constraints in the form of positivity of reduced density matrices, motivated by work in quantum chemistry, are employed to ensure compatibility of the predicted correlations with the underlying Hilbert space. Unlike reduced density matrix approaches, learning the underlying distribution of measurement outcomes allows one to further correlations beyond those in the constrained density matrix. We show, with numerical results, that the proposed variational method can be parallelized, is efficiently simulable, and yields a more complete description of the ground state.</description>

      <title>Are controlled unitaries helpful?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many quantum algorithms, to compute some property of a unitary $U$, require access not just to $U$, but to $cU$, the unitary with a control qubit. We show that having access to $cU$ does not help for a large class of quantum problems. For a quantum circuit which uses $cU$ and $cU^\dagger$ and outputs $|\psi(U)\rangle$, we show how to ``decontrol'' the circuit into one which uses only $U$ and $U^\dagger$ and outputs $|\psi(\varphi U)\rangle$ for a uniformly random phase $\varphi$, with a small amount of time and space overhead. When we only care about the output state up to a global phase on $U$, then the decontrolled circuit suffices. Stated differently, $cU$ is only helpful because it contains global phase information about $U$.
  A version of our procedure is described in an appendix of Sheridan, Maslov, and Mosca [SMM09]. Our goal with this work is to popularize this result by generalizing it and investigating its implications, in order to counter negative results in the literature which might lead one to believe that decontrolling is not possible. As an application, we give a simple proof for the existence of unitary ensembles which are pseudorandom under access to $U$, $U^\dagger$, $cU$, and $cU^\dagger$.</description>

      <title>Truncation uncertainties for accurate quantum simulations of lattice gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The encoding of lattice gauge theories onto quantum computers requires a discretization of the gauge field's Hilbert space on each link, which presents errors with respect to the Kogut--Susskind limit. In the electric basis, Hilbert space fragmentation has recently been shown to limit the excitation of large electric fields. Here, we leverage this to develop a formalism for estimating the size of truncation errors in the electric basis. Generically, the truncation error falls off as a factorial of the field truncation. Examples of this formalism are applied to the Schwinger model and a pure U(1) lattice gauge theory. For reasonable choices of parameters, we improve on previous error estimates by a factor of 10^{306}.</description>

      <title>Imaginary Time Spectral Transforms for Excited State Preparation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Excited states of many-body quantum systems play a key role in a wide range of physical and chemical phenomena. Unlike ground states, for which many efficient variational techniques exist, there are few ways to systematically construct excited states of generic quantum systems on either classical or quantum hardware. To address this challenge, we introduce a general approach that allows us to obtain arbitrary eigenstates of quantum systems at a given energy. By combining the shift-invert mechanism with imaginary time evolution, we are able to avoid explicit inversion of the Hamiltonian and construct excited eigenstates of large many-body quantum systems. We demonstrate the technique classically by applying it to large disordered spin chains. Based on this approach, we propose a hybrid scheme suitable for near-future quantum hardware.</description>

Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate the coexistence of three entanglement-based quantum channels with carrier-grade classical optical channels over $11.5$km hollow core nested antiresonant nodeless fibre, in a four user quantum network. A transmission of $800$Gbps is achieved with four classical channels simultaneously with three quantum channels all operating in the C-band with a separation of $1.2$nm, with aggregated coexistence power of $-3$dBm. We established quantum key distribution in the four-node full-mesh quantum network with Bell state fidelity of up to $90.0\pm0.8$%. The secret key rate for all the links in the network are passively preserved over $55$hours of experimental time.</description>

      <title>Efficient and simple Gibbs state preparation of the 2D toric code via duality to classical Ising chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of polynomial-depth duality transformations, which relates two sets of operator algebras through a conjugation by a poly-depth quantum circuit, and make use of this to construct efficient Gibbs samplers for a variety of interesting quantum Hamiltonians as they are poly-depth dual to classical Hamiltonians. This is for example the case for the 2D toric code, which is demonstrated to be poly-depth dual to two decoupled classical Ising spin chains for any system size, and we give evidence that such dualities hold for a wide class of stabilizer Hamiltonians. Additionally, we extend the above notion of duality to Lindbladians in order to show that mixing times and other quantities such as the spectral gap or the modified logarithmic Sobolev inequality are preserved under duality.</description>

      <title>Effective 2D Envelope Function Theory for Silicon Quantum Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a rigorous method to reduce the three-dimensional (3D) description of a quantum dot in silicon to an effective two-dimensional (2D) envelope function theory for electron spin qubits. By systematically integrating out the strongly confined vertical dimension using a Born-Oppenheimer-inspired ansatz at the envelope-function level, we derive an effective in-plane potential that faithfully captures the essential electrostatics of the full 3D system. Considering the lowest two eigenstates of the out-of-plane direction, this reduction leads to the natural and explicit emergence of the valley degree of freedom within a 2D formalism, which is derived here from first principles. We validate the accuracy of the method through comparisons with full 3D simulations and demonstrate its superiority over naive 2D slicing, particularly in the presence of interface roughness. Crucially, the reduction in dimensionality leads to substantial computational savings, making our approach particularly well suited for simulating two-electron systems, e.g., for the extraction of parameters such as the exchange coupling. Beyond its practical utility, the rigorous 2D envelope function theory that is introduced in this study incorporates valley physics in a physically grounded manner, offering conceptual clarity on the role of valley states in qubit operation and measurement.</description>

      <title>Breakdown of Fermi's Golden Rule in 1d systems at non-zero temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In interacting quantum systems, the single-particle Green's function is expected to decay in time due to the interaction induced decoherence of quasiparticles. In the limit of weak interaction strengths ($\Delta$), a naive application of Fermi's Golden Rule (FGR) predicts an $\mathcal{O}(\Delta^{2})$ quasiparticle decay rate. However, for 1d fermions on the lattice at $T&gt;0$, this calculation gives a divergent result and the scaling of the quasiparticle lifetime with interaction strength remains an open question. In this work we propose a solution to this question: combining numerical simulations using the recently introduced dissipation-assisted operator evolution (DAOE) method, with non-perturbative diagrammatic re-summations, we predict a logarithmic enhancement of the quasiparticle decay rate $\tau^{-1} \sim \Delta^{2} \log \Delta^{-2}$. We argue that this effect is present in a wide variety of well-known weakly interacting quantum fermionic and bosonic systems, and even in some classical systems, provided the non-interacting limit has quasiparticles with a generic dispersion.</description>

      <title>Towards Efficient Verification of Computation in Quantum Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing quantum processors is a complex task that demands advanced verification methods to ensure their correct functionality. However, traditional methods of comprehensively verifying quantum devices, such as quantum process tomography, face significant limitations because of the exponential growth in computational resources. These limitations arise from treating the system as a black box and ignoring its design structure. Consequently, new testing methods must be developed considering the design structure. In this paper, we investigate the structure of computations on the hardware, focusing on the layered interruptible quantum circuit model and designing a scalable algorithm to verify it comprehensively. Specifically, for a given quantum hardware that claims to process an unknown $n$ qubit $d$ layer circuit via a finite set of quantum gates, our method completely reconstructs the circuits within a time complexity of $O(d^2 t \log (n/\delta))$, guaranteeing success with a probability of at least $1-\delta$. Here, $t$ represents the maximum execution time for each circuit layer. Our approach significantly reduces execution time for completely verifying computations in quantum devices, achieving double logarithmic scaling in the problem size. Furthermore, we validate our algorithm through experiments using IBM's quantum cloud service, demonstrating its potential applicability in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era.</description>

      <title>Entangling Power and Its Deviation: A Quantitative Analysis on Input-State Dependence and Variability in Entanglement Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantifying the entangling capability of quantum operations is a fundamental task in quantum information science. Traditionally, this capability is measured by the entangling power (EP), defined as the average entanglement generated when a quantum operation acts uniformly on all possible product states. However, EP alone cannot capture the intricate input-state-dependent nature of entanglement generation. To address this, we define a complementary metric -- entangling power deviation (EPD) -- as the standard deviation of entanglement generated over all product input states, thereby capturing the multifaceted nature of entangling behavior. We develop a general group-theoretical framework that yields closed-form expressions for both EP and EPD. Our analysis reveals a fundamental and previously unexplored physics: enhancing entangling capability inevitably increases sensitivity, or bias, toward specific input states. By analyzing representative two-qubit gates, we show that the gates with identical EP can exhibit markedly different EPD values, illustrating that the nature of entanglement generation can significantly differ depending on physical implementation. Extending our framework to a class of generalized controlled-unitary operations acting on bipartite Hilbert spaces of arbitrary dimensions, we (re)affirm the inherent trade-off between the entangling strength and uniformity. Moreover, we uncover a subtle dimension-parity-dependent behavior in entanglement generation, which EP alone fails to detect. These findings highlight EPD as an indispensable diagnostic tool -- one that, alongside EP, provides a deeper and more complete characterization of the entangling structure.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of non-Markovianity due to environment-induced indirect interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Markovian effects are often significant when the system-environment coupling is not weak. Indeed, we find the non-Markovianity to be negligible for a single two-level system undergoing pure dephasing via interaction with a harmonic oscillator environment. In this paper, we examine a natural extension, namely a pure dephasing model where a collection of two-level systems interacts with a common environment. We obtain analytically the dynamics of the collection of the two-level systems, and then take a partial trace over all the two-level systems except one. This remaining single two-level system is shown to display markedly non-Markovian dynamics, even in the weak system-environment coupling regime. This is due to the indirect interaction between two-level systems induced by their interaction with the common environment. In fact, this indirect interaction can not only increase the non-Markovianity by orders of magnitude, but also display qualitatively different characteristics. For instance, for a single two-level system undergoing pure dephasing, the dynamics are Markovian for Ohmic and sub-Ohmic environments. This is markedly not the case when we consider multiple two-level systems. We also show that the non-Markovianity increases as we increase the number of two-level systems. These findings provide insights into controlling decoherence in multi-qubit quantum systems and have implications for quantum technologies where non-Markovianity can be a resource rather than a limitation.</description>

      <title>Mixed State Entanglement Via the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The entanglement properties of mixed states are of great importance in the study of open quantum systems and quantum information science, but commonly used entanglement measures, such as negativity, can be difficult to apply or connect to physical properties of the system. We introduce the Cauchy-Schwarz Violation (CSV) Condition, which has a simple dependence on the populations and coherences of the density operator. A sufficient condition for entanglement, it provides a more direct connection to the physical characteristics of the system such as its symmetries. We illustrate the often surprising insights gained from the CSV condition by applying it to the Jaynes-Cummings Model, the Quantum Rabi Model, and an open-system Quantum Rabi Model.</description>

      <title>Truncating loopy tensor networks by zero-mode gauge fixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Loopy tensor networks have internal correlations that often make their compression inefficient. We show that even local bond optimization can make better use of the insight it has locally into relevant loop correlations. By cutting the bond, we define a set of states whose linear dependence can be used to truncate the bond dimension. The linear dependence is eliminated with zero modes of the states' metric tensor. The method is illustrated by a series of examples for the infinite pair entangled projected state (iPEPS) and for the periodic matrix product state (pMPS) that occurs in the tensor renormalization group (TRG) step. In all examples, it provides better initial truncation errors than standard initialization.</description>

      <title>Nonclassical microwave radiation from the parametric dynamical Casimir effect in the reversed-dissipation regime of circuit optomechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an experimentally feasible optomechanical system (OMS) that is dispersively driven and operates in the reversed dissipation regime (RDR), where the mechanical damping rate far exceeds the cavity decay rate. We demonstrate that coherent, fast-time modulation of the driving laser frequency-on time scales longer than the mechanical decoherence time-allows for adiabatic elimination of the mechanical mode, resulting in strong parametric amplification of quantum vacuum fluctuations of the intracavity field. This mechanism, known as the parametric dynamical Casimir effect (parametric-DCE), leads to the generation of Casimir photons. In the dispersive RDR, we find that the total system Hamiltonian-including the DCE term-is intrinsically modified by a generalized optomechanical Kerr-type nonlinearity. This nonlinearity not only saturates the mean number of radiated Casimir photons on short time scales, even without dissipation, but also induces oscillatory behavior in their dynamics and quantum characteristics. Remarkably, the presence of the Kerr nonlinearity causes the generated DCE photons to exhibit nonclassical features, including sub-Poissonian statistics, negative Wigner function and quadrature squeezing which can be controlled by adjusting the system parameters. The proposed nonclassical microwave radiation source possesses the potential to be applied in quantum information processing, quantum computing as well as microwave quantum sensing.</description>

      <title>Reducing Quantum Circuit Synthesis to #SAT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum circuit synthesis is the task of decomposing a given quantum operator into a sequence of elementary quantum gates. Since the finite target gate set cannot exactly implement any given operator, approximation is often necessary. Model counting, or #SAT, has recently been demonstrated as a promising new approach for tackling core problems in quantum circuit analysis. In this work, we show for the first time that the universal quantum circuit synthesis problem can be reduced to maximum model counting. We formulate a #SAT encoding for exact and approximate depth-optimal quantum circuit synthesis into the Clifford+T gate set. We evaluate our method with an open-source implementation that uses the maximum model counter d4Max as a backend. For this purpose, we extended d4Max with support for complex and negative weights to represent amplitudes. Experimental results show that existing classical tools have potential for the quantum circuit synthesis problem.</description>

      <title>Replacement-Type Quantum Gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the paradigm of replacement-type quantum gates. This type of gate introduces input qubits, candidate qubits, and output qubits. The candidate qubits are prepared such, that a displacement conditional on the input qubit results in the targeted output state. Finally, the circuit continues with the output qubits constructed from the candidate qubits instead of the input qubits, thus the name "replacement-type gate". We present examples of replacement-type $X$ and $\mathrm{CNOT}$ gates realized with spin qubits and with neutral atom qubits. By making use of the extended Hilbert space, including the position of the particles, these gates approximately preserve the innate noise bias of the qubits. The gate preserves the noise-bias which motivates advanced quantum computer architectures with error correction.</description>

      <title>Quantum Key-Recovery Attacks on FBC Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the advancement of quantum computing, symmetric cryptography faces new challenges from quantum attacks. These attacks are typically classified into two models: Q1 (classical queries) and Q2 (quantum superposition queries). In this context, we present a comprehensive security analysis of the FBC algorithm considering quantum adversaries with different query capabilities. In the Q2 model, we first design 4-round polynomial-time quantum distinguishers for FBC-F and FBC-KF structures, and then perform $r(r&gt;6)$-round quantum key-recovery attacks. Our attacks require $O(2^{(2n(r-6)+3n)/2})$ quantum queries, reducing the time complexity by a factor of $2^{4.5n}$ compared with quantum brute-force search, where $n$ denotes the subkey length. Moreover, we give a new 6-round polynomial-time quantum distinguisher for FBC-FK structure. Based on this, we construct an $r(r&gt;6)$-round quantum key-recovery attack with complexity $O(2^{n(r-6)})$. Considering an adversary with classical queries and quantum computing capabilities, we demonstrate low-data quantum key-recovery attacks on FBC-KF/FK structures in the Q1 model. These attacks require only a constant number of plaintext-ciphertext pairs, then use the Grover algorithm to search the intermediate states, thereby recovering all keys in $O(2^{n/2})$ time.</description>

      <title>Inference of maximum parsimony phylogenetic trees with model-based classical and quantum methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The maximum parsimony phylogenetic tree reconstruction problem is NP-hard, presenting a computational bottleneck for classical computing and motivating the exploration of emerging paradigms like quantum computing. To this end, we design three optimization models compatible with both classical and quantum solvers. Our method directly searches the complete solution space of all possible tree topologies and ancestral states, thereby avoiding the potential biases associated with pre-constructing candidate internal nodes. Among these models, the branch-based model drastically reduces the number of variables and explicit constraints through a specific variable definition, providing a novel modeling approach effective not only for phylogenetic tree building but also for other tree problems. The correctness of this model is validated with a classical solver, which obtains solutions that are generally better than those from heuristics on the GAPDH gene dataset. Moreover, our quantum simulations successfully find the exact optimal solutions for small-scale instances with rapid convergence, highlighting the potential of quantum computing to offer a new avenue for solving these intractable problems in evolutionary biology.</description>

      <title>Emergent Bifurcations in Quantum Circuit Stability from Hidden Parameter Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The compression of quantum circuits is a foundational challenge for near-term quantum computing, yet the principles governing circuit stability remain poorly understood. We investigate this problem through a large-scale numerical analysis of 300 structurally-uniform circuits across 10, 12, and 14 qubits. Despite their macroscopic uniformity, we find that each ensemble universally bifurcates into distinct robust and fragile classes. We solve the puzzle of this emergent bifurcation, demonstrating that its origin is not structural, but is instead encoded in the statistical properties of the gate rotation parameters. Fragile circuits consistently exhibit a universal signature of ``statistical brittleness,'' characterized by low parameter variability and a scarcity of small-angle gates. We uncover the underlying physical mechanism for this phenomenon: Paradoxical Importance where smaller-angle gates are counter-intuitively more critical to the circuit's function, an effect most pronounced in fragile circuits. This reliance on fine-tuning explains why statistically brittle circuits are uniquely vulnerable to failure under compression. These findings establish a new framework for engineering resilient quantum algorithms, shifting the focus from macroscopic structure to the microscopic statistical properties of a circuit's parameters.</description>

      <title>Q-Sylvan: A Parallel Decision Diagram Package for Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As physical realizations of quantum computers move closer towards practical applications, the need for tools to analyze and verify quantum algorithms grows. Among the algorithms and data structures used to tackle such problems, decision diagrams (DDs) have shown much success. However, an obstacle with DDs is their efficient parallelization, and while parallel speedups have been obtained for DDs used in classical applications, attempts to parallelize operations for quantum-specific DDs have yielded only limited success. In this work, we present an efficient implementation of parallel edge-valued DDs, which makes use of fine-grained task parallelism and lock-free hash tables. Additionally, we use these DDs to implement two use cases: simulation and equivalence checking of quantum circuits. In our empirical evaluation we find that our tool, Q-Sylvan, shows a single-core performance that is competitive with the state-of-the-art quantum DD tool MQT DDSIM on large instances, and moreover achieves parallel speedups of up to x18 on 64 cores.</description>

      <title>Quantum repeaters based on stationary and flying Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill qudits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are various approaches to long-range quantum communication based on conceptually different forms of quantum repeaters. Here we explore a quantum repeater scheme that employs quantum error correction (QEC) both on the flying (light) qubits and on the stationary (matter) qubits. The idea is to combine the benefits of encoded one-way and two-way schemes where effective channel transmission and loss scaling are enhanced by means of photon loss codes and encoded quantum memories, respectively, while sacrificing some of their advantages such as high clock rates, independent of classical communication times (one-way), and potentially large segment lengths (two-way). More specifically, we illustrate, propose, and analyze such a quantum repeater using the bosonic Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) code which naturally enables encoding and QEC of qudits, protecting them against transmission and memory loss, the latter, for instance, occuring on collective spin modes of atomic ensembles. While the encoded one-way and two-way schemes on their own either require very high repeater link coupling efficiencies and GKP squeezing or allow for experimentally more feasible, small values of these parameters, respectively, we find that there are intermediate parameter regimes where the combined repeater protocol is superior.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a quantum algorithm for ground-state preparation based on a Chebyshev series approximation to the wall function. This projector can be efficiently implemented as a product of Hamiltonian operators, enabling a straightforward realization via the linear combinations of unitaries method. We analyze the asymptotic scaling and provide numerical benchmarks, demonstrating that the wall-Chebyshev projector achieves competitive performance with leading methods based on imaginary time evolution and alternative projector function approximations. Notably, our approach exhibits superior robustness and convergence in scenarios where accurate ground-state energy estimates are unavailable, showing promise for realistic chemistry problems.</description>

      <title>Persistent Quantum Memory in Iterated Lifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study quantum coherence in continuous-time quantum walks on perfect graphs generated by the symmetric lift ${\mathrm{HL}}'_2(G)$, a canonical, unweighted, undirected construction defined as the line graph of a bipartite double cover of $G$. This lift acts as both a coherence-preserving and coherence-inducing transformation: it preserves and scales structured quantum interference in highly symmetric base graphs, and induces sustained coherence in random or weakly structured ones.
  In small graphs such as $K_4$, $K_5$, and the Petersen graph, where quantum walks exhibit sharp revivals and high return probability, repeated $\mathrm{HL}'_2$ lifting produces towers of perfect graphs with thousands to tens of thousands of vertices that retain periodic or quasi-periodic coherence. When applied to random regular or Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi graphs with flat or decaying return behavior, the lift introduces structured interference and significant amplification of mean and peak return probabilities.
  To quantify these effects, we evaluate standard coherence metrics from quantum resource theory, including inverse participation ratio (IPR), purity, relative entropy of coherence, and the logarithmic coherence number. These measures confirm that $\mathrm{HL}'_2$ lifting delocalizes eigenstates, increases coherence entropy, and expands the basis support of quantum states. These results demonstrate that $\mathrm{HL}'_2$ is a scalable and structurally grounded mechanism for organizing quantum interference, and introduce a new family of perfect graphs that support long-time quantum coherence without spectral tuning or engineered weights.</description>

      <title>Swapped Entanglement in High-Dimensional Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement swapping is a fundamental protocol in quantum information processing that enables the distribution of entanglement between distant quantum systems. In this work, we first extend the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional quantum systems, specifically qudits. We then analyze the dynamics of entanglement swapping and quantify the average swapped entanglement in terms of concurrence and negativity. Our results demonstrate that higher-dimensional systems offer enhanced entanglement distribution capabilities compared to qubit-based protocols. We also discuss the application of entangled qudits in terms of long-distance teleportation that provides the base for quantum repeaters. Furthermore, we discuss the entanglement swapping for a real and noisy system. The behaviors of entanglement against fidelity with different dimensions are also discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates pseudo-Hermitian quantum mechanics, where the Hamiltonian satisfies a modified Hermiticity condition. We extend the uncertainty relation for such systems, demonstrating its equivalence to the standard Hermitian case within a pseudo-Hermitian inner product. Analytical solutions to the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation with a linearly evolving potential are derived. Furthermore, we show that the uncertainty relation for position and momentum remains real and greater than 1/2, highlighting the significance of non-Hermitian systems in quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous emission as a bridge from Lindbladian to nonreciprocal reservoirs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study an out-of-equilibrium quantum system in which a state connecting two reservoirs is also coupled by stimulated and spontaneous emission of photons to an antitrapped state, thus implementing particle loss. After revisiting the spontaneous emission process, we show that the proper effective description of such a system requires one to go beyond the usual Lindbladian formalism and includes a nonreciprocal (``non-Hermitian'') coupling to the reservoir modeling the untrapped state. The presence of both, the reservoirs and the nonreciprocal coupling, have observable consequences that we compute, for example, by looking at the quantum Zeno effect in the loss current. We discuss the connection of our findings to possible experiments in cold atomic gases.</description>

      <title>There is no ultrastrong coupling with photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Theoretical accounts of ultrastrongly coupled light-matter systems commonly assume that it arises from the interaction of an emitter with propagating photon modes supported by a structure, understanding photons as the excitations of the transverse electromagnetic field. This description discards the Coulomb interaction between the emitter and structure charges. Here, we show with a general argument based on electromagnetic constraints that the emitter-photon coupling strength is fundamentally limited. Accordingly, we conclude that the ultrastrong coupling regime cannot be reached with photons. Instead, it must originate from the Coulomb interactions between charges. A further corollary is that the so-called polarization self-energy term does not need to be included. We illustrate our claims by solving an analytical model of the paradigmatic case of an emitter next to a metallic nanosphere. These findings shed light on the fundamental processes underlying ultrastrong coupling, clarify the role of the polarization self-energy term and compel a reevaluation of previous literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magic or non-stabilizerness is a resource for quantum computing that has been extensively studied in qudit networks. It describes the degree to which Clifford gates cannot generate a given state, capturing the advantage of quantum over classical computing. However, its definition in continuous variables and general composite systems remains an open issue. We study magic in a bipartite system, the Asymmetric Quantum Rabi model, a paradigmatic model from quantum optics. We explore the presence of magic in the qubit-reduced system throughout the Hamiltonian parameter space, the role of light-matter interactions in its generation, and the manifestation of Wigner function negativity in the corresponding bosonic degree of freedom. Finally, we discuss our results for magic state preparation in the strong and ultra-strong coupling regimes within the context of quantum informational systems.</description>

      <title>The Role of the Satellite in Quantum Information Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Information Networks (QIN) attract increasing interest, as they will enable interconnection of multiple quantum devices in a distributed organization thus enhancing intrinsic computing, sensing, and security capabilities. The core mechanism of a QIN is quantum state swapping, based on teleportation, which consumes quantum entanglement, and which can be seen in this context as a new kind of network resource. The satellite is expected to play a central role for supporting global connectivity in such novel networks in which ground fiber links have stringent restrictions in length due to the absorption losses in optical fibers. There is indeed fundamental limits in the maximal fiber links distance which may not be exceeded for any unitary links. In this paper we clarify our motivations to develop such networks with satellites, and we discuss their associated use cases based on entanglement distribution, and we present the future potential users. We also assess quantitatively the ranges for which the satellite becomes mandatory in quantum information networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Periodically structured surfaces (metasurfaces), i.e., periodic light, have evolved as a powerful tool for manipulating electromagnetic fields both in classical and quantum regimes. However, no general approach for quantizing the electromagnetic fields and treating quantum light-matter interactions in such structures exists. Here, we construct an ab initio few-mode quantization scheme for metasurface resonances based on macroscopic quantum electrodynamics. We use our approach to propose a framework for strong light-matter coupling in which collective excitations of periodic arrays of quantum emitters are strongly coupled to the light modes supported by the metasurface, leading to the formation of crystal polaritons. As a proof-of-principle example of their potential, we show that interactions between crystal polaritons can lead to an efficient and directional generation of entangled photon pairs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixed state ensembles such as the Bures-Hall and Hilbert-Schmidt measure are probability distributions that characterise the statistical properties of random density matrices and can be used to determine the typical features of mixed quantum states. Here we extend this framework by considering the properties of random states with fixed average energy, and the ensemble-averaged density matrix is derived under this additional physical constraint. This gives rise to a type of microcanonical ensemble for random mixed states and we connect its properties to a statistical mechanical entropy and temperature. Our results are illustrated using a variety of simple spin systems, and we find that they can exhibit exotic features such as phase transitions in the absence of interactions and finite relative energy fluctuations in the thermodynamic limit.</description>

      <title>Entanglement swapping for partially entangled qudits and the role of quantum complementarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the entanglement swapping protocol (ESP) to partially entangled qudit states and analyze the process within the framework of complete complementarity relations (CCRs). Building on previous results for qubits, we show that the average distributed entanglement between two parties via ESP is bounded above by the initial entanglement of one of the input pairs, and also by the product of the initial entanglements. Notably, we find that using initial states with vanishing local quantum coherence is sufficient to capture the essential features of the protocol, simplifying the analysis. By exploring the cases of qubits and qutrits, we observe that the upper bound on the average distributed entanglement -- expressed in terms of the product of the initial entanglements -- can be improved, and we conjecture what this tighter bound might be. Finally, we discuss the role of quantum complementarity in the ESP and show how local predictability constrains the entanglement that can be operationally distributed via ESP.</description>

      <title>Double descent: When do neural quantum states generalize?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00068v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural quantum states (NQS) provide flexible wavefunction parameterizations for numerical studies of quantum many-body physics. While inspired by deep learning, it remains unclear to what extent NQS share characteristics with neural networks used for standard machine learning tasks. We demonstrate that NQS exhibit the double descent phenomenon, a key feature of modern deep learning, where generalization worsens as network size increases before improving again in an overparameterized regime. Notably, we find the second descent to occur only for network sizes much larger than the Hilbert space dimension, indicating that NQS typically operate in an underparameterized regime, where increasing network size can degrade generalization. Our analysis reveals that the optimal network size in this regime depends on the number of unique training samples, highlighting the importance of sampling strategies. These findings suggest the need for symmetry-aware, physics-informed architecture design, rather than directly adopting machine learning heuristics.</description>

      <title>Fragmented eigenstate thermalization versus robust integrability in long-range models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the stability of integrability in many-body quantum systems is key to controlling their dynamics and predicting thermalization. While much is known about how integrability breaks down in short-range interacting systems, the corresponding picture for long-range couplings remains incomplete. Yet long-range interactions are both ubiquitous in nature and readily engineered in modern experimental platforms. Here, we show that integrability in fully connected models is either robust or extremely fragile depending on whether the perturbation is non-extensive, extensive one-body, or extensive two-body. In a finite system with short-range interactions, any of these perturbations can induce chaos when applied with finite strength. In contrast, in fully connected finite models, chaos is induced by extensive two-body perturbations, and they do so even at infinitesimal strength. In this case, chaos emerges within quasi-symmetry sectors, leading to a fragmented manifestation of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH). This challenges previous claims of ETH violation in quantum systems with strong long-range interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a logical implication between two old conjectures stated by Bapat and Sunder about the permanent of positive semidefinite matrices. Although Drury has recently disproved both conjectures, this logical implication yields a non-trivial link between two seemingly unrelated conditions that a positive semidefinite matrix may fulfill. As a corollary, the classes of matrices that are known to obey the first conjecture are then immediately proven to obey the second one. Conversely, we uncover new counterexamples to the first conjecture by exhibiting a previously unknown type of counterexamples to the second conjecture.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Near-term quantum processors are limited in terms of the number of qubits and gates they can afford. They nevertheless give unprecedented access to programmable quantum systems that can efficiently, although imperfectly, simulate quantum time evolutions. Dynamical mean field theory, on the other hand, maps strongly-correlated lattice models like the Hubbard model onto simpler, yet still many-body models called impurity models. Its computational bottleneck boils down to investigating the dynamics of the impurity upon addition or removal of one particle. This task is notoriously difficult for classical algorithms, which has warranted the development of specific classical algorithms called "impurity solvers" that work well in some regimes, but still struggle to reach some parameter regimes. In these lecture notes, we introduce the tools and methods of quantum computing that could be used to overcome the limitations of these classical impurity solvers, either in the long term -- with fully quantum algorithms, or in the short term -- with hybrid quantum-classical algorithms.</description>

      <title>Can the latent signatures of quantum superposition be detected through correlation harvesting?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore correlation harvesting in quantum superposition, specifically focusing on the entanglement and mutual information extracted by two Unruh-DeWitt detectors interacting with a quantum field in a mass-superposed BTZ black hole spacetime. Our findings reveal that the superposed nature of spacetime induces interference effects that can significantly enhance the entanglement harvesting relative to a single spacetime background. In contrast to entanglement, the mutual information obtained in spacetime superposition is influenced by the proper distance between the two detectors. While the mutual information harvested in a superposed spacetime remains lower than that in a single spacetime when the proper distance between detectors is small, it exceeds that in a single spacetime for specific mass ratios as the distance increases. Notably, we find that both entanglement and mutual information harvesting reach their maxima when the final spacetime superposition state is conditioned to align with the initial spacetime state.</description>

      <title>Quantum entanglement of Hawking-Partner modes in expanding cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article investigates quantum entanglement generated within a one-dimensional cavity where one boundary undergoes prescribed acceleration, a setup designed to mimic aspects of Hawking radiation. We quantify quantum correlations using logarithmic negativity for bipartitions where subsystem $A$ is a given mode and subsystem $B$ the rest of the system. For initial pure states, we also consider a given mode and reconstruct its partner using the Hotta-Sch\"utzhold-Unruh formula, obtaining identical results. Besides the initial vacuum state, we also consider one-mode squeezed and two-mode squeezed states, in order to confirm if quantum entanglement can be stimulated. Moreover, we analyze its robustness against initial thermal noise. Our analysis is based on numerical simulations and does not assume any approximation beyond the validity of our numerical algorithms. Our findings reveal that the expanding cavity effectively acts as a squeezing device, with Hawking-partner pairs largely behaving as two-mode squeezed states. A significant conclusion is that, in our setting, purification of Hawking modes is predominantly a low-energy process, with high-energetic particles contributing negligibly to the partner modes. Indeed, in both small and large acceleration regimes of the boundaries, quantum entanglement decreases towards the ultraviolet modes, indicating that higher-energy particles are more challenging to entangle and hence less probable to contribute in the purification process. While the Hotta-Sch\"utzhold-Unruh formula offers notable computational efficiency, partner modes do not commute, due to the non-trivial multimode entanglement structure of the system. Hence, this pairwise description is not suitable for describing the full system.</description>

      <title>Photon-mediated interactions and dynamics of coherently driven quantum emitters in complex photonic environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, Born-Markov master equations based on tracing out the electromagnetic degrees of freedom have been extensively employed in the description of quantum optical phenomena originating from photon-mediated interactions in quantum emitter ensembles. The breakdown of these effective models, built on assumptions such as ensemble spectral homogeneity, an unstructured photonic density of states, and weak light-matter coupling, has also recently attracted considerable attention. Here, we investigate the accuracy of this well-established framework beyond the most conventional, and extensively explored, spontaneous emission configuration. Specifically, we consider a system comprising two coherently driven and detuned quantum emitters, embedded within a hybrid photonic-plasmonic cavity, formed by a metallic nanorod integrated into a high-refractive-index dielectric microresonator. The local density of photonic states in this structure exhibits a complex frequency dependence, making it a compelling platform for exploring photon-mediated interactions beyond the assumptions above. We benchmark this modeling approach for the quantum dynamics of the emitter pair against exact calculations based on a macroscopic field quantization formalism, providing an illustrative assessment of its validity in significantly structured and dispersive photonic environments. Our analysis reveals four distinct regimes of laser driving and frequency splitting that lead to markedly different levels of accuracy in the effective model.</description>

      <title>The Bose-Hubbard polaron from weak to strong coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the zero-temperature properties of a mobile impurity immersed in a bath of bosonic particles confined to a square lattice. We analyze the regimes of attractive and repulsive coupling between the impurity and the bath particles for different strengths of boson-boson interactions in the bath, using exact large-scale quantum Monte-Carlo simulations in the grand canonical ensemble. For weak coupling, the polaron mass ratio is found to decrease around the Mott insulator (MI) to superfluid (SF) transition of the bath, as predicted by recent theory, confirming the possible use of the impurity as a probe for the transition. For strong coupling in the MI regime, instead, the impurity is found to modify the bath density by binding to an extra bath particle or a hole, depending on the sign of the polaron-bath interactions. While the binding prevent the aforementioned use of the polaron mass ratio as an MI-SF transition probe, we show that it can be used instead as a probe of the binding itself. Our exact numerical results provide a benchmark for comparing lattice Bose polaron theories and are relevant for experiments with cold atoms trapped in optical lattices, where the presence of a confining harmonic potential can be modeled by a slowly varying local chemical potential.</description>

      <title>Localized states and skin effect around non-Hermitian impurities in tight-binding models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use the generalized Bloch theorem formalism of Alase {\it et al.} [{\it Phys. Rev. Lett.} {\bf 117} 076804 (2016)] to analyze simple one-dimensional tight-binding lattice systems connected by Hermitian bonds (all with the same hopping parameter $t$), but containing one bond impurity which can be either Hermitian or non-Hermitian. We calculate the band structure, the bulk-boundary correspondence indicator ($D_L(\epsilon)$) and analyze the eigenvalues of the lattice translation operator ($z$), for each eigenstate. From the $z$ values the generalized Brillouin zone can be reconstructed. If the impurity is Hermitian (and $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric), we find a parameter regime in which two localized edge states separate from the tight-binding band. We then simulate a non-Hermitian impurity by keeping hopping in one direction of the bond impurity the same as the rest of the tight-binding system, and varying only its reciprocal. Again, we find a region with localized edge states, but in this case the energy eigenvalues are purely imaginary. We also find that in this case the two zero energy eigenvectors coalesce, hence this system is an exceptional line. We then perform an interpolative scan between the above two scenarios and find that there is an intermediate region exhibiting a non-Hermitian skin effect. In this region a macroscopic fraction of states acquire complex energy eigenvalues and exhibit localization towards the impurity. Our numerical results are supported by a detailed analysis of the solutions of the boundary/impurity equation.</description>

      <title>Advancing Quantum Information Science Pre-College Education: The Case for Learning Sciences Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As quantum information science advances and the need for pre-college engagement grows, a critical question remains: How can young learners be prepared to participate in a field so radically different from what they have encountered before? This paper argues that meeting this challenge will require strong interdisciplinary collaboration with the Learning Sciences (LS), a field dedicated to understanding how people learn and designing theory-guided environments to support learning. Drawing on lessons from previous STEM education efforts, we discuss two key contributions of the learning sciences to quantum information science (QIS) education. The first is design-based research, the signature methodology of learning sciences, which can inform the development, refinement, and scaling of effective QIS learning experiences. The second is a framework for reshaping how learners reason about, learn and participate in QIS practices through shifts in knowledge representations that provide new forms of engagement and associated learning. We call for a two-way partnership between quantum information science and the learning sciences, one that not only supports learning in quantum concepts and practices but also improves our understanding of how to teach and support learning in highly complex domains. We also consider potential questions involved in bridging these disciplinary communities and argue that the theoretical and practical benefits justify the effort.</description>

      <title>Search for Dark Matter Scattering from Optically Levitated Nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of levitated optomechanics has enabled precise force sensors that operate in the quantum measurement regime, opening up unique opportunities to search for new physics whose weak interactions may have evaded existing sensors. We demonstrate the detection of impulsive forces acting on optically levitated nanoparticles, where the dominant noise source is provided by measurement backaction. Using these sensors, we search for momentum transfers that may originate from scattering of passing particle-like dark matter. For dark matter that couples to Standard Model neutrons via a generic long-range interaction, this search constrains a range of models in the mass range 1-$10^7~\mathrm{GeV/}c^2$, placing upper limits on single neutron coupling strength as low as $\leq 1 \times 10^{-7}$ at the 95% confidence level. We also demonstrate the ability of using the inherent directional sensitivity of these sensors to separate possible dark matter signals from backgrounds. Future extensions of the techniques developed here can enable searches for light dark matter and massive neutrinos that can reach sensitivity several orders of magnitude beyond existing searches.</description>

      <title>Fundamental trade-off relation in probabilistic entanglement generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2112.03233v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the generation of entanglement between two non-interacting systems by synthesizing a new quantum process from the superposition of distinct processes characterized by local-only operations. Our analysis leads to the derivation of a universal trade-off relation, $P_{\text{succ}}(1+\mathcal{C})\le1$, that fundamentally bounds the success probability ($P_{\text{succ}}$) and the generated entanglement (concurrence $\mathcal{C}$). The derivation of this trade-off relation is inspired by indefinite causal order, but applies for a broader class of quantum processes. Next, we show that the mathematical structure of this bound predicts the existence of a "quasi-deterministic" mode of operation, a surprising phenomenon which we then confirm with concrete entanglement generation protocols, where a maximally entangled state is guaranteed to be produced. In this mode of operation, both outcomes of the post-selection measurement on the auxiliary control system result in a maximally entangled state of the target system. Furthermore, we demonstrate how this general principle can be realized using a quantum switch, which leverages an indefinite causal order as a physical resource, and explore the rich variety of dynamical behaviors governed by the universal trade-off. Our results establish a general principle for entanglement generation with superposition of quantum processes and introduce a novel way of controlling entanglement generation.</description>

Abstract: Quantum generative models use the intrinsic probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics to learn and reproduce complex probability distributions. In this paper, we present an implementation of a 3-qubit quantum circuit Born machine trained to model a 3-bit Gaussian distribution using a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence loss and parameter-shift gradient optimization. The variational quantum circuit consists of layers of parameterized rotations and entangling gates, and is optimized such that the Born rule output distribution closely matches the target distribution. We detail the mathematical formulation of the model distribution, the KL divergence cost function, and the parameter-shift rule for gradient evaluation. Training results on a statevector simulator show that the KL divergence is minimized to near zero, and the final generated distribution aligns quantitatively with the target probabilities. We analyze the convergence behavior and discuss the implications for scalability and quantum advantage. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of small-scale quantum generative learning and provide insight into the training dynamics of quantum circuit models.</description>

      <title>Implementing fault-tolerant non-Clifford gates using the [[8,3,2]] color code</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.08663v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum computers promise to solve problems that are intractable for classical computers, but qubits are vulnerable to many sources of error, limiting the depth of the circuits that can be reliably executed on today's quantum hardware. Quantum error correction has been proposed as a solution to this problem, whereby quantum information is protected by encoding it into a quantum error-correcting code. But protecting quantum information is not enough, we must also process the information using logic gates that are robust to faults that occur during their execution. One method for processing information fault-tolerantly is to use quantum error-correcting codes that have logical gates with a tensor product structure (transversal gates), making them naturally fault-tolerant. Here, we test the performance of a code with such transversal gates, the [[8,3,2]] color code, using trapped-ion and superconducting hardware. We observe improved performance (compared to no encoding) for encoded circuits implementing non-Clifford gates, a class of gates that are essential for achieving universal quantum computing. In particular, we find improved performance for an encoded circuit implementing the control-control $Z$ gate, a key gate in Shor's algorithm. Our results illustrate the potential of using codes with transversal gates to implement non-trivial algorithms on near-term quantum hardware.</description>

Abstract: An optimal local quantum thermometer is a quantum many-body system that saturates the fundamental lower bound for the thermal state temperature estimation accuracy [L. Correa, et. al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 114, 220405 (2015)]. Such a thermometer has a particular energy level structure with a single ground state and highly degenerated excited states manifold, with an energy gap proportional to the estimated temperature. In this work, we show that the optimal local quantum thermometer can be realized in an experimentally feasible system of spinless fermions confined in a one-dimensional optical lattice described by the Rice-Mele model. We characterize the system's sensitivity to temperature changes in terms of quantum Fisher information and the classical Fisher information obtained from experimentally available site occupation measurements.</description>

Abstract: Response theory has a successful history of connecting experimental observations with theoretical predictions. Of particular interest is the optical response of matter, from which spectroscopy experiments can be modelled. However, the calculation of response properties for quantum systems is often prohibitively expensive, especially for nonlinear spectroscopy, as it requires access to either the time evolution of the system or to excited states. In this work, we introduce a generalized quantum phase estimation framework designed for multi-variate phase estimation. This allows the treatment of general correlation functions enabling the recovery of response properties of arbitrary orders. The generalized quantum phase estimation circuit has an intuitive construction that is linked with a physical process of interest, and can directly sample frequencies from the distribution that would be obtained experimentally. In addition, we provide a single-ancilla modification of the new framework for early fault-tolerant quantum computers. Overall, our framework enables the efficient simulation of spectroscopy experiments beyond the linear regime, such as Raman spectroscopy, having that the circuit cost grows linearly with respect to the order of the target nonlinear response. This opens up an exciting new field of applications for quantum computers with potential technological impact.</description>

Abstract: We provide a framework to determine the upper bound to the complexity of a computing a given observable with respect to a Hamiltonian. By considering the Heisenberg evolution of the observable, we show that each Hamiltonian defines an equivalence relation, causing the operator space to be partitioned into equivalence classes. Any operator within a specific class never leaves its equivalence class during the evolution. We provide a method to determine the dimension of the equivalence classes and evaluate it for various models, such as the $ XY $ chain and Kitaev model on trees. Our findings reveal that the complexity of operator evolution in the $XY$ model grows from the edge to the bulk, which is physically manifested as suppressed relaxation of qubits near the boundary. Our methods are used to reveal several new cases of simulable quantum dynamics, including a $XY$-$ZZ$ model which cannot be reduced to free fermions.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for evaluating analytical eigenfunctions of the finite Hartley transform. The approach is based on the use of $N=1/2$-supersymmetric quantum mechanics as a fundamental tool, which builds on the key observation that the Hartley transform commutes with the supercharge operator. Using the intertwining operator between the Hartley transform and the finite Hartley transform, our approach provides an overcomplete basis of eigenvectors expressed in terms of supersymmetric Hermite polynomials.</description>

Abstract: The Petz map has been established as a quantum version of the Bayes' rule. It unifies the conceptual belief update rule of a quantum state observed after a forward quantum process, and the operational reverse process that recovers the final state to match the updated belief, effectively counteracting the forward process. Here, we study a higher-order generalization of the quantum Bayes' rule by considering a quantum process undergoing a quantum supermap. For a few families of initial beliefs, we show that a similar unification is possible -- the rules updating the beliefs about quantum channels can be implemented via a "reverse" quantum supermap, termed the retrodiction supermap. The potential applications of retrodiction supermap are demonstrated with examples of improved error correction in quantum cloud computing. Analytical solutions are provided for these families, while a recipe for arbitrary initial beliefs remains an open question.</description>

      <title>Quantum Advantage in Distributed Sensing with Noisy Quantum Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17089v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is critically important to analyze the achievability of quantum advantage under realistic imperfections. In this work, we show that quantum advantage in distributed sensing can be achieved with noisy quantum networks which can only distribute noisy entangled states. We derive a closed-form expression of the quantum Fisher information (QFI) for estimating the average of local parameters using GHZ-diagonal probe states, an important distributed sensing prototype. From the QFI we obtain the necessary condition to achieve quantum advantage over the optimal local sensing strategy, which can also serve as an optimization-free entanglement detection criterion for multipartite states. In addition, we prove that genuine multipartite entanglement is neither necessary nor sufficient through explicit examples of depolarized and dephased GHZ states. We further explore the impacts from imperfect local entanglement generation and local measurement constraint, and our results imply that the quantum advantage is more robust against quantum network imperfections than local operation errors. Notably, these implications still hold when we explicitly consider dephasing during the sensing dynamics. Finally, we demonstrate that the probe state with potential for quantum advantage in distributed sensing can be prepared by a three-node quantum network using practical protocol stacks through simulations with SeQUeNCe, an open-source, customizable quantum network simulator. Our results significantly advance the understanding of, and offer practical guidance for achieving quantum advantage in distributed sensing under realistic noise.</description>

      <title>Polynomial time constructive decision algorithm for multivariable quantum signal processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02332v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum signal processing (QSP) and quantum singular value transformation (QSVT) have provided a unified framework for understanding many quantum algorithms, including factorization, matrix inversion, and Hamiltonian simulation. As a multivariable version of QSP, multivariable quantum signal processing (M-QSP) is proposed. M-QSP interleaves signal operators corresponding to each variable with signal processing operators, which provides an efficient means to perform multivariable polynomial transformations. However, the necessary and sufficient condition for what types of polynomials can be constructed by M-QSP is unknown. In this paper, we propose a classical algorithm to determine whether a given pair of multivariable Laurent polynomials can be implemented by M-QSP, which returns True or False. As one of the most important properties of this algorithm, it returning True is the necessary and sufficient condition. The proposed classical algorithm runs in polynomial time in the number of variables and signal operators. Our algorithm also provides a constructive method to select the necessary parameters for implementing M-QSP. These findings offer valuable insights for identifying practical applications of M-QSP.</description>

      <title>Observation of anomalous information scrambling in a Rydberg atom array</title>

Abstract: Quantum information scrambling, which describes the propagation and effective loss of localinformation, is crucial for understanding the dynamics of quantum many-body systems. We report the observation of anomalous information scrambling in an atomic tweezer array with dominant van der Waals interaction. We characterize information spreading by an out-of-time-order correlator and observe persistent oscillations inside a suppressed linear light cone for the initial Neel state. Such an anomalous dynamic, which differs from both generic thermal and many-body localized scenarios, originates from weak ergodicity breaking in quantum many-body scarred systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum Birthmarks: Ergodicity Breaking Beyond Scarring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02982v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A hallmark of classical ergodicity is the complete loss of memory of the initial conditions due to eventual uniform covering of it a priori available phase space. In quantum counterparts of such systems, however, this classical ergodic ideal is fundamentally limited: Here we introduce the concept of a quantum birthmark, a permanent signature left by the initial state and its early-time evolution in a general quantum system, which gives rise to nonergodic behavior persisting even in the infinite-time limit. We present a birthmark framework outlining a ubiquitous memory effect for an arbitrary, non-stationary state composed of two factors conspiring together: the universal and revival-enhancement. The former sets the minimal amplification carried by the time evolution of a quantum state based on global symmetries; whereas the latter incorporates the further enhancement stemming from the early dynamics, particularly prominent in the presence of recurrences occurring before the Heisenberg time. As a concrete example, we identify quantum birthmarks in the venerable stadium billiard where they can be significantly enhanced by quantum scars. Finally, we discuss the broader implications of quantum birthmarks, including their role as a natural extension for all types of scarring theories to generic nonstationary quantum systems and prospects for experimental observation. Generally, our work opens up an unexplored avenue for understanding the elusive quantum nature of ergodicity.</description>

      <title>Ensemble-Based Quantum Token Protocol Benchmarked on IBM Quantum Processors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08530v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum tokens envision to store unclonable quantum states in a physical device, with the goal of being used for personal authentication protocols, as required by banks. Still, the experimental realization of such devices faces many technical challenges, which can be partially mitigated using ensembles instead of single qubits. In this work, we thus propose an ensemble-based quantum token protocol, describing it through a simple yet general model based on a quantum mechanical observable. The protocol is benchmarked on five IBM quantum processors and a general hacker attack scenario is analyzed, in which the attacker attempts to read the bank token and forge a fake one, based on the information gained from this measurement. We experimentally demonstrate that the probability that the bank erroneously accepts a forged coin composed of multiple tokens can reach values below $10^{-22}$, while the probability that the bank accepts its own coin is above 0.999. The overall security of the protocol is therefore demonstrated within a hardware-agnostic framework, confirming the practical viability of the protocol in arbitrary quantum systems and thus paving the way for future applications with different ensembles of qubits, such as color center defects in solids.</description>

      <title>Fast M{\o}lmer-S{\o}rensen gates in trapped-ion quantum processors with compensated carrier transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02387v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Carrier transition is one of the major factors hindering the high-speed implementation of the M{\o}lmer-S{\o}rensen gates in trapped-ion quantum processors. We present an approach to design laser pulse shapes for the M{\o}lmer-S{\o}rensen gate in ion chains which accounts for the effect of carrier transition on qubit-phonon dynamics. We show that the fast-oscillating carrier term effectively modifies the spin-dependent forces acting on ions, and this can be compensated by a simple nonlinear transformation of a laser pulse. Using numerical simulations for short ion chains and perturbation theory for longer chains up to $20$ ions, we demonstrate that our approach allows to reach the infidelity below $10^{-4}$ while keeping the gate duration of the order of tens of microseconds.</description>

      <title>Ancilla-free Quantum Adder with Sublinear Depth</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16802v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first exact quantum adder with sublinear depth and no ancilla qubits. Our construction is based on classical reversible logic only and employs low-depth implementations for the CNOT ladder operator and the Toffoli ladder operator, two key components to perform ripple-carry addition. Namely, we demonstrate that any ladder of $n$ CNOT gates can be replaced by a CNOT-circuit with $O(\log n)$ depth, while maintaining a linear number of gates. We then generalize this construction to Toffoli gates and demonstrate that any ladder of $n$ Toffoli gates can be substituted with a circuit with $O(\log^2 n)$ depth while utilizing a linearithmic number of gates. This builds on the recent works of Nie et al. and Khattar and Gidney on the technique of conditionally clean ancillae. By combining these two key elements, we present a novel approach to design quantum adders that can perform the addition of two $n$-bit numbers in depth $O(\log^2 n)$ without the use of any ancilla and using classical reversible logic only (Toffoli, CNOT and X gates). We also present new constructions for incrementing and adding a constant to a quantum register.</description>

      <title>Direct Implementation of High-Fidelity Three-Qubit Gates for Superconducting Processor with Tunable Couplers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18319v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Three-qubit gates can be constructed using combinations of single-qubit and two-qubit gates, making their independent realization unnecessary. However, direct implementation of three-qubit gates reduces the depth of quantum circuits, streamlines quantum programming, and facilitates efficient circuit optimization, thereby enhancing overall performance in quantum computation. In this work, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a high-fidelity scheme for implementing a three-qubit controlled-controlled-Z (CCZ) gate in a flip-chip superconducting quantum processor with tunable couplers. This direct CCZ gate is implemented by simultaneously leveraging two tunable couplers interspersed between three qubits to enable three-qubit interactions, achieving an average final state fidelity of $97.94\%$ and a process fidelity of $93.54\%$. This high fidelity cannot be achieved through a simple combination of single- and two-qubit gate sequences from processors with similar performance levels. Our experiments also verify that multilayer direct implementation of the CCZ gate exhibits lower leakage compared to decomposed gate approaches. As a showcase, we utilize the CCZ gate as an oracle to implement the Grover search algorithm on three qubits, demonstrating high performance with the target probability amplitude significantly enhanced after two iterations. These results highlight the advantage of our approach, and facilitate the implementation of complex quantum circuits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15515v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We systematically investigate the interplay of disorder and time-homogeneous collisional noise in shaping the transport dynamics of an anisotropic XXZ spin chain. Using stochastic collision models to simulate interaction with the environment, we explore the localization-delocalization transitions across regimes with single and multiple excitations. We find that space-homogeneous and low-rate collisions can shape regions where localization sets in the form of subsequent plateaus. The localization process has universal features for the plateaus duration and the delocalization time. Interactions among the excitations favor this process even for tiniest disorder levels.
  Our findings can be applied to design stroboscopic protocols where sequences of transport and localization can be tailored. We establish relevant connections to noise-engineering of quantum devices in noisy intermediate-scale quantum simulators platforms, and to realistic biological systems where noise and disorder coexist.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06097v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is widely used and well-studied for its efficiency and strong security. This paper presents quantum circuit designs for the AES S-box by introducing the composite field \( F((2^4)^2) \) to replace the traditional field \( F(2^8) \), enabling the inversion to be decomposed into operations over \( F(2^4) \). This work reduces the quantum resource overhead required for implementing the S-box by decreasing the number of $CNOT$ gates in the matrix multiplication, lowering the depth of $T$ gates in both the inversion circuit and the multiplication circuit. Besides, the widths for the S-box quantum circuits are also optimized during the inversion circuit and multiplication circuit. With a linear key schedule, the resulting AES-128 quantum circuit reduce the product of the circuit width and $T$ depth to 102800, which is the lowest known to date.</description>

Abstract: We study the entanglement properties of two-mode bosonic Gaussian states based on their multi-mode counting statistics. We exploit the idea that measuring high-order correlations of particle numbers can reveal entanglement without making any assumptions about the coherence of the fields. We show that the two- and four-body number correlations are sufficient to fully characterize the entanglement of two-mode bosonic Gaussian states for which each mode exhibits a thermal distribution. In addition, we derive an entanglement witness based on two-body correlations alone. Our findings are of great importance because it becomes possible to reveal entanglement in a series of recent experiments.</description>

Abstract: Solid neon has emerged as a pristine material host for electron qubits. Single electron-on-solid-neon (eNe) charge qubits have shown extraordinarily long coherence times and high operation fidelities. Realizing two-qubit gates in this platform is the next major step for realistic quantum information processing. In this work, we demonstrate frequency- and time-domain coherent manipulation of multiple eNe charge qubits that are coupled by charge interactions. Cross-resonance and bSWAP two-qubit gates are implemented, laying the foundation for universal quantum computing. An inter-qubit coupling strength exceeding 60~MHz has been observed, promising fast gate speed and suppressed infidelity. These results highlight the potential to scale up the eNe qubit platform toward universal quantum computing.</description>

Abstract: Quantum observables of generic many-body systems exhibit a universal pattern of growth in the Krylov space of operators. This pattern becomes particularly manifest in the Lanczos basis, where the evolution superoperator assumes the tridiagonal form. According to the universal operator growth hypothesis, the nonzero elements of the superoperator, known as Lanczos coefficients, grow asymptotically linearly. We introduce and explore broad families of Lanczos coefficients that are consistent with the universal operator growth and lead to the exactly solvable dynamics. Within these families, the subleading terms of asymptotic expansion of the Lanczos sequence can be controlled and fine-tuned to produce diverse dynamical patterns. For one of the families, the Krylov complexity is computed exactly.</description>

Abstract: Frequency-filtered photon correlations have been proven to be extremely useful in grasping how the detection process alters photon statistics. Harnessing the spectral correlations also permits refinement of the emission and unraveling of previously hidden strong correlations in a plethora of quantum-optical systems under continuous-wave excitation. In this work, we investigate such correlations for time-dependent excitation and develop a methodology to compute efficiently time-integrated correlations, which are at the heart of the photon-counting theory, and subsequently apply it to analyze the photon emission of pulsed systems. By combining this formalism with the sensor method -- which facilitates frequency-resolved correlations -- we demonstrate how spectral filtering enhances single-photon purity and suppresses multi-photon noise in time-bin-encoded quantum states. Specifically, filtering the central spectral peak of a dynamically driven two-level system boosts temporal coherence and improves the fidelity of time-bin entanglement preparation, even under conditions favoring multi-photon emission. These results establish spectral filtering as a critical tool for tailoring photon statistics in pulsed quantum light sources.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10591v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computation requires compiling logical circuits into physical operations tailored to a given architecture. Prior work addressing this challenge has mostly focused on the surface code and lattice surgery schemes. In this work, we broaden the scope by considering lattice surgery compilation for topological codes beyond the surface code. We begin by defining a code substrate - a blueprint for implementing topological codes and lattice surgery. We then abstract from the microscopic details and rephrase the compilation task as a mapping and routing problem on a macroscopic routing graph, potentially subject to substrate-specific constraints. We explore specific substrates and codes, including the color code and the folded surface code, providing detailed microscopic constructions. For the color code, we present numerical simulations analyzing how design choices at the microscopic and macroscopic levels affect the depth of compiled logical $\mathrm{CNOT}+\mathrm{T}$ circuits. An open-source code is available on GitHub https://github.com/cda-tum/mqt-qecc.</description>

Abstract: Measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution (MDI-QKD), which eliminates all the attacks from the eavesdropper to the measurement party, has been one of the most promising technology for the implementation of end-to-end quantum networks. In practice, the asymmetry of both sources and channels is generally inevitable. Therefore, we propose a theory to analyze the performance when any two MDI users in networks communicates using asymmetric sources in distinct single or multiple temporal modes. As a specific application, we model to obtain the key rate of MDI-QKD with weak coherent pulse source and spontaneous parametric down-conversion source, and compare the performance to the cases with symmetric (i.e. identical) sources. The result demonstrates that the actual performance does not degrade due to the asymmetry of sources. In contrary, it maintains at a good level over the entire distance we study. This work provides a theoretical basis for analyzing and optimizing MDI-QKD networks with asymmetric sources, and thus paving the way for the practical deployment of completely asymmetric MDI-QKD networks.</description>

      <title>Entanglement-enhanced randomized measurement in noisy quantum devices</title>

Abstract: Quantum hardware is advancing rapidly across various platforms, yet implementing large-scale quantum error correction (QEC) remains challenging. As hardware continues to improve, there is a growing need to identify potential applications on noisy quantum devices that can leverage these enhancements. With this motivation, we explore the advantages of shallow measurements over (non-entangling) single-qubit measurements for learning various properties of a quantum state. While previous studies have examined this subject, they have primarily focused on specific problems. Here, by developing a new theoretical framework, we demonstrate how shallow measurements can benefit in diverse scenarios. Despite the additional errors from two-qubit gates in shallow measurements, we experimentally validated improvements compared to single-qubit measurements in applications like derandomization, common randomized measurements, and machine learning up to 40 qubits and 46 layers of two-qubit gates, respectively. As a result, we show that hardware improvements, even before QEC, could broaden the range of feasible applications.</description>

      <title>Quantum Knowledge Distillation for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13205v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As foundational tools in natural language processing, Large Language Models (LLMs) have immense parameter scales, which makes deployment and inference increasingly prohibitive, especially in resource-constrained devices. Therefore, knowledge distillation for LLMs, i.e., compressing the LLM to a smaller model, is meaningful. With strong parameter representation capacity, quantum computing is regarded as a promising solution. Here, we propose a Quantum knowledge Distillation model for LLMs (QD-LLM) that leverages variational quantum circuits to learn from LLMs. In classical simulation, QD-LLM outperforms several mainstream distillation methods on multiple text classification tasks in terms of both accuracy and efficiency using only 11 qubits. The results reveal an interesting phenomenon that the simulation of quantum student models may be regarded as a new class of quantum-inspired classical algorithms. Remarkably, we deploy the obtained circuits on the Baihua superconducting quantum processor via the Quafu platform to assess practical feasibility. The model maintains stable inference performance despite hardware constraints such as decoherence and finite sampling. In summary, QD-LLM marks a foundational step in connecting quantum computing with LLMs, demonstrating the feasibility of quantum-native approaches that aim to compress and deploy models of increasingly larger scales.

      <title>The perfect entangler spectrum as a tool to analyze crosstalk</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03137v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Crosstalk is a key obstacle to scaling up quantum computers. It may arise from persistent qubit-qubit couplings or dynamically during gate operation, with the latter being particularly difficult to detect. Here, we introduce the perfect entangler spectrum as a means to identify dynamic crosstalk leading to undesired entanglement. It leverages the geometric classification of two-qubit gates in terms of perfect entanglers. We exemplify application of the spectroscopy for fixed-frequency transmons and parametrically driven gates: When scanning the frequency of a spectator qubit, peaks in the perfect entangler spectrum signal dynamic crosstalk, and analysis of the peaks reveals the mechanisms causing the crosstalk. We discuss the experimental implementation of the crosstalk spectroscopy which requires two two-qubit gate tomographies.</description>

      <title>Quantum Fisher information from tensor network integration of Lyapunov equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11330v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) is a geometric measure of state deformation calculated along the trajectory parameterizing an ensemble of quantum states. It serves as a key concept in quantum metrology, where it is linked to the fundamental limit on the precision of the parameter that we estimate. However, the QFI is notoriously difficult to calculate due to its non-linear mathematical form. For mixed states, standard numerical procedures based on eigendecomposition quickly become impractical with increasing system size. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel numerical approach based on Lyapunov integrals that combines the concept of symmetric logarithmic derivative and tensor networks. Importantly, this approach requires only the elementary matrix product states algorithm for time-evolution, opening a perspective for broad usage and application to many-body systems. We discuss the advantages and limitations of our methodology through an illustrative example in quantum metrology, where the thermal state of the transverse-field Ising model is used to measure magnetic field amplitude.</description>

      <title>Macroscopic theory of multipartite correlations in permutation-invariant open quantum systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22121v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Information-theoretic quantities have received significant attention as system-independent measures of correlations in many-body quantum systems, e.g., as universal order parameters of synchronization. In this work, we present a method to determine the macroscopic behavior of the steady-state multipartite mutual information between $N$ interacting units undergoing Markovian evolution that is invariant under unit permutations. Using this approach, we extend a conclusion previously drawn for classical systems that the extensive scaling of mutual information is either not possible for systems relaxing to fixed points of the mean-field dynamics or such scaling is not robust to perturbations of system dynamics. In contrast, robust extensive scaling occurs for system relaxing to time-dependent attractors, e.g., limit cycles. We illustrate the applicability of our method on the driven-dissipative Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model.</description>

      <title>From Wavefunctional Entanglement to Entangled Wavefunctional Degrees of Freedom</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04650v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The question of whether entanglement between photons is equivalent to entanglement between their characteristic field modes, specifically, the single-particle wavefunctions that are composed and superposed to describe identical particles, is a key, open problem concerning multi-partite optical degrees of freedom, and has profound implications for topics ranging from quantum foundations to quantum computation. Here, I offer a fresh, deeper, physical insight into this subtle, albeit enduring, issue by describing a situation in which entangling interactions between optical modes, namely, the wavefunctions can be distilled into genuine entanglement between the physical properties of the photons, which are the wavefunctional degrees of freedom. This theoretical observation also highlights the salience of the measurement context, especially, of clearly disambiguating between the choice of the quantum subsystem and the decision to measure an observable along a particular axis of measurement, while quantifying and transforming quantum optical entanglement. This understanding might be applied to formulate a new class of protocols for distilling quantum magic from contextually and nonlocally entangled photons within inseparable field modes.</description>

      <title>High-fidelity, quasi-deterministic entanglement generation using phase-matched spectral islands in a zero-added-loss multiplexing architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14427v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While photonic entanglement generation and distribution are well developed, their demonstrated rates are far below what is needed for a quantum internet. The present paper proposes and analyzes a scheme for spectral multiplexing that provides entanglement-distribution rates well in excess of the state of the art. It builds on the idea presented by Chen~\emph{et al}.~[Phys. Rev. Appl. {\bf 19}, 054209 (2023)], who proposed zero-added-loss multiplexing (ZALM) as a means for high-fidelity, quasi-deterministic entanglement generation. Unfortunately, Chen \emph{et al}.'s ZALM requires a large number (800) of spectral channels to achieve its claimed high-fidelity, quasi-deterministic, high-rate entanglement generation. Our modified version of ZALM affords major performance improvements over the original. It draws on Morrison~\emph{et al}.~[APL Photon. {\bf 7}, 066102 (2022)], who domain engineered a $\chi^{(2)}$ crystal to realize a biphoton wave function with 8 discrete and spectrally-factorable frequency bins. Our ZALM SPDCs each have a modest number ($N_I\ll$ 800) of these phase-matched spectral islands each generating two-mode squeezed-vacuum states, permitting our analysis, unlike Chen~\emph{et al.}'s, to account for multipairs of all orders, losses in the partial BSM, and propagation losses en route to the receivers. A major innovation in our proposal is to employ both same-island heralding and cross-island heralding, which allows the entanglement-delivery rate to scale as $N_I^2$ rather than $N_I$ in the weak squeezing regime required for the reception of photon pairs with a high Bell-state fidelity under realistic losses. This heralding scheme uses an order of magnitude fewer spectral channels, which may enable near-term implementations of satellite-to-ground or fiber-optic based ZALM architectures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17435v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a unified framework for multipartite entanglement characterization based on the conditional gradient (CG) method, incorporating both fast heuristic detection and rigorous witness construction with numerical error control. Our method enables entanglement certification in quantum systems of up to ten qubits and applies to arbitrary entanglement structures. We demonstrate its power by closing the gap between entanglement and separability bounds in white noise robustness benchmarks for a class of bound entangled states. Furthermore, the framework extends to entanglement robustness under general quantum noise channels, providing accurate thresholds in cases beyond the reach of previous algorithmic methods. These results position CG methods as a powerful tool for practical and scalable entanglement analysis in realistic experimental settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19861v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Learning the behaviour of chaotic systems remains challenging due to instability in long-term predictions and difficulties in accurately capturing invariant statistical properties. While quantum machine learning offers a promising route to efficiently capture physical properties from high-dimensional data, its practical deployment is hindered by current hardware noise and limited scalability. Here, we introduce a quantum-informed machine learning framework for learning partial differential equations, with an application focus on chaotic systems. A quantum circuit Born machine is employed to learn the invariant properties of chaotic dynamical systems, achieving substantial memory efficiency by representing these complex physical statistics with a compact set of trainable circuit parameters. This approach reduces the data storage requirement by over two orders of magnitude compared to the raw simulation data. The resulting statistical quantum-informed prior is then incorporated into a Koopman-based auto-regressive model to address issues such as gradient vanishing or explosion, while maintaining long-term statistical fidelity. The framework is evaluated on three representative systems: the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, two-dimensional Kolmogorov flow and turbulent channel flow. In all cases, the quantum-informed model achieves superior performance compared to its classical counterparts without quantum priors. This hybrid architecture offers a practical route for learning dynamical systems using near-term quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Detecting quantum non-Gaussianity with a single quadrature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23005v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Full reconstruction of quantum states from measurement samples is often a prohibitively complex task, both in terms of the experimental setup and the scaling of the sample size with the system. This motivates the relatively easier task of certifying application-specific quantities using measurements that are not tomographically complete, i.e. that provide only partial information about the state related to the application of interest. Here, we focus on simplifying the measurements needed to certify non-Gaussianity in bosonic systems, a resource related to quantum advantage in various information processing tasks. We show that the statistics of a single quadrature measurement, corresponding to standard homodyne detection in quantum optics, can witness arbitrary degrees of non-Gaussianity as quantified by stellar rank. Our results are based on a version of Hudson's theorem for wavefunctions, proved in a companion paper [arXiv:2507.23468], revealing that the zeros in a homodyne distribution are signatures of quantum non-Gaussianity and higher stellar ranks. The validity of our witnesses is supported by a technical result showing that sets of states with bounded energy and finite stellar rank are compact. We provide an analysis of sample complexity, noise robustness, and experimental prospects. Our work drastically simplifies the setup required to detect quantum non-Gaussianity in bosonic quantum states.</description>

      <title>Context-Dependent Time-Energy Uncertainty Relations from Projective Quantum Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23059v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a general framework for defining context-dependent time distributions in quantum systems using projective measurements. The time-of-flow (TF) distribution, derived from population transfer rates into a measurement subspace, yields a time--energy uncertainty relation of the form $\Delta \mathcal{T} \cdot \Delta H \geq \hbar / (6\sqrt{3}) \cdot \delta\theta$, where $\delta\theta$ quantifies net population transfer. This bound applies to arbitrary projectors under unitary dynamics and reveals that time uncertainty is inherently measurement-dependent. We demonstrate the framework with two applications: a general time-of-arrival (TOA)-energy uncertainty relation and a driven three-level system under detuned coherent driving. The TF framework unifies timing observables across spin, atomic, and matter-wave systems, and offers an experimentally accessible route to probing quantum timing in controlled measurements.</description>

      <title>Scalable Ion Fluorescence Collection Using a Trap-Integrated Metalens</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23071v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A scaled trapped-ion quantum computer will require efficient fluorescence collection across a large area. Here we propose and demonstrate a compact monolithically integrated system featuring a metalens fabricated on the backside of a surface ion trap. A 40$\times$100 $\mu$m aperture enables a simulated point-source collection efficiency of 0.91% and a measured point-source detection efficiency of 0.58%. Increasing the aperture area to 40$\times$600 $\mu$m boosts the simulated collection efficiency to 3.17%$-$comparable to that of a conventional objective with a numerical aperture of 0.35. Further improvements are possible by co-optimizing the electrode and aperture geometry. An undercut of the electrode substrate at the aperture ensures a large distance between the ion and dielectric substrate without compromising collection efficiency. The metalens directly collimates the collected fluorescence, eliminating the need for a high numerical aperture objective. An array of such readout zones will offer a compact, scalable solution for high-fidelity parallel readout in next-generation trapped-ion quantum processors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23468v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Schr\"odinger wavefunction is ubiquitous in quantum mechanics, quantum chemistry, and bosonic quantum information theory. Its zero-set for fermionic systems is well-studied and central for determining chemical properties, yet for bosonic systems the zero-set is less understood, especially in the context of characterizing non-classicality. Here we study the zeros of such wavefunctions and give them a novel information-theoretic interpretation. Our main technical result is showing that the wavefunction of most bosonic quantum systems can be extended to a holomorphic function over the complex plane, allowing the application of powerful techniques from complex analysis. As a consequence, we prove a version of Hudson's theorem for the wavefunction and characterize Gaussian dynamics as classical motion of the wavefunction zeros. Our findings suggest that the non-Gaussianity of quantum optical states can be detected by measuring a single quadrature of the electromagnetic field, which we demonstrate in a companion paper [arXiv:2507.23005]. More generally, our results show that the non-Gaussian features of bosonic quantum systems are encoded in the zeros of their wavefunction.</description>

      <title>Swap Network Augmented Ans\"atze on Arbitrary Connectivity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23679v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficient parametrizations of quantum states are essential for trainable hybrid classical-quantum algorithms. A key challenge in their design consists in adapting to the available qubit connectivity of the quantum processor, which limits the capacity to generate correlations between distant qubits in a resource-efficient and trainable manner. In this work we first introduce an algorithm that optimizes qubit routing for arbitrary connectivity graphs, resulting in a swap network that enables direct interactions between any pair of qubits. We then propose a co-design of circuit layers and qubit routing by embedding the derived swap networks within layered, connectivity-aware ans\"atze. This construction significantly improves the trainability of the ansatz, leading to enhanced performance with reduced resources. We showcase these improvements through ground-state simulations of strongly correlated systems, including spin-glass and molecular electronic structure models. Across exemplified connectivities, the swap-enhanced ansatz consistently achieves lower energy errors using fewer entangling gates, shallower circuits, and fewer parameters than standard layered-structured baselines. Our results indicate that swap network augmented ans\"atze provide enhanced trainability and resource-efficient design to capture complex correlations on devices with constrained qubit connectivity.</description>

Abstract: We show that global properties of an unknown quantum network, such as the average degree, hub density, and the number of closed paths of fixed length, can be inferred from strictly local quantum measurements. In particular, we demonstrate that a malicious agent with access to only a small subset of nodes can initialize quantum states locally and, through repeated short-time measurements, extract sensitive structural information about the entire network. The intrusion strategy is inspired by extreme learning and quantum reservoir computing and combines short-time quantum evolution with a non-iterative linear readout with trainable weights. These results suggest new strategies for intrusion detection and structural diagnostics in future quantum Internet infrastructures.</description>

      <title>Celestial Quantum Error Correction I: Qubits from Noncommutative Klein Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16298v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum gravity in 4D asymptotically flat spacetimes features spontaneous symmetry breaking due to soft radiation hair, intimately tied to the proliferation of IR divergences. A holographic description via a putative 2D CFT is expected free of such redundancies. In this series of two papers, we address this issue by initiating the study of Quantum Error Correction in Celestial CFT (CCFT). In Part I we construct a toy model with finite degrees of freedom by revisiting noncommutative geometry in Kleinian hyperk\"ahler spacetimes. The model obeys a Wick algebra that renormalizes in the radial direction and admits an isometric embedding \`a la Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill. The code subspace is composed of 2-qubit stabilizer states which are robust under soft spacetime fluctuations. Symmetries of the hyperk\"ahler space become discrete and translate into the Clifford group familiar from quantum computation. The construction is then embedded into the incidence relation of twistor space, paving the way for the CCFT regime addressed in upcoming work.</description>

      <title>Bound energy, entanglement and identifying critical points in 1D long-range Kitaev model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05063v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the entanglement structure of a bipartite quantum system through the lens of quantum thermodynamics in the absence of conformal symmetry. Specifically, we consider the long-range Kitaev model, where the pairing interaction decays as a power law with exponent $\alpha$, with broken conformal symmetry for $\alpha&lt;3/2$. We analytically show that the bound energy, a quantum thermodynamical quantity, is linearly proportional to the square of entanglement entropy per unit system size for $\alpha=1$ where conformal symmetry is broken. We further show that for all values of $\alpha$, bound energy, in the thermodynamic limit, shows a pronounced minimum at the critical point, which enables the identification of $\mu=1$.</description>

      <title>False vacuum decay of excited states in finite-time instanton calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20431v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extracting information about a system's metastable ground state energy employing functional methods usually hinges on utilizing the late-time behavior of the Euclidean propagator, practically impeding the possibility of determining decay widths of excited states. We demonstrate that such obstacles can be surmounted by working with bounded time intervals, adapting the standard instanton formalism to compute a finite-time amplitude corresponding to excited state decay. This is achieved by projecting out the desired resonant energies utilizing carefully chosen approximations to the excited state wave functions in the false vacuum region. To carry out the calculation, we employ unconventional path integral techniques by considering the emerging amplitude as a single composite functional integral that includes fluctuations at the endpoints of the trajectories. This way, we explicitly compute the sought-after decay widths, including their leading quantum corrections, for arbitrary potentials, demonstrating accordance with traditional WKB results. While the initial starting point of weighting Euclidean propagator contributions according to their endpoints using false vacuum states has been proposed earlier, we find several flaws in the published evaluation of the relevant amplitudes. Although we show that the previous proposition of employing a sequential calculation scheme -- where the functional integral is evaluated around extremal trajectories with fixed endpoints, weighted only at a subsequent stage -- can lead to the desired goal, the novel composite approach is found to be more concise and transparent.</description>

      <title>Theory of Valley Splitting in Si/SiGe Spin-Qubits: Interplay of Strain, Resonances and Random Alloy Disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20618v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electron spin-qubits in silicon-germanium (SiGe) heterostructures are a major candidate for the realization of scalable quantum computers. A critical challenge in strained Si/SiGe quantum wells (QWs) is the existence of two nearly degenerate valley states at the conduction band minimum that can lead to leakage of quantum information. To address this issue, various strategies have been explored to enhance the valley splitting (i.e., the energy gap between the two low-energy conduction band minima), such as sharp interfaces, oscillating germanium concentrations in the QW (known as wiggle wells) and shear strain engineering. In this work, we develop a comprehensive envelope-function theory augmented by an empirical nonlocal pseudopotential model to incorporate the effects of alloy disorder, strain, and non-trivial resonances arising from interactions between valley states across neighboring Brillouin zones. We apply our model to analyze common epitaxial profiles studied in the literature with a focus on wiggle well type structures and compare our results with previous work. Our framework provides an efficient tool for quantifying the interplay of these effects on the valley splitting, enabling complex epitaxial profile optimization in future work.</description>

      <title>The Dirac equation in General Relativity and the 3+1 formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03918v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I present a review of the Dirac equation in general relativity. Although the generalization of the Dirac equation to a curved spacetime is well known, it is not usually part of the standard toolkit of techniques known to people working on classical general relativity. Recently, there has been some renewed interest in studying solutions of the Einstein--Dirac system of equations, particularly in the context of the so-called ``Dirac stars''. Motivated by this, here I present a review of the Dirac equation in general relativity, starting from Minkowski spacetime, and then considering the Lorentz group and the tetrad formalism in order to generalize this equation to the case of a curved spacetime. I also derive the form of the Dirac equation and its associated stress--energy tensor for the case of the 3+1 formalism of general relativity, which can be useful for the study of the evolution of the Dirac field in a dynamical spacetime.</description>

      <title>Interrelation among Solvable Potentials and Extensions of SWKB Quantization Condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22381v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The exactly solvable Schr\"{o}dinger equations with the conventional shape-invariant potentials are known to be related with each other through point cannonical transformations. In this paper, we extend the idea to integral formulae called the SWKB integrals. By virtue of this, we derive extended forms of the SWKB quantization condition for certain classes of Natanzon potentials. We further demonstrate that the same idea can also be applied to obtain an exact quantization rule for a subclass of quantum systems with position-dependent effective masses, provided their solutions involve the classical orthogonal polynomials. Based on the findings, we conjecture about the implication of the exactness of the SWKB formula in relation to the classical orthogonal polynomials.</description>
