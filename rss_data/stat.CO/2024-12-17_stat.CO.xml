      <title>Regularized Dikin Walks for Sampling Truncated Logconcave Measures, Mixed Isoperimetry and Beyond Worst-Case Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of drawing samples from a logconcave distribution truncated on a polytope, motivated by computational challenges in Bayesian statistical models with indicator variables, such as probit regression. Building on interior point methods and the Dikin walk for sampling from uniform distributions, we analyze the mixing time of regularized Dikin walks. Our contributions are threefold. First, for a logconcave and log-smooth distribution with condition number $\kappa$, truncated on a polytope in $\mathbb{R}^n$ defined with $m$ linear constraints, we prove that the soft-threshold Dikin walk mixes in $\widetilde{O}((m+\kappa)n)$ iterations from a warm initialization. It improves upon prior work which required the polytope to be bounded and involved a bound dependent on the radius of the bounded region. Moreover, we introduce the regularized Dikin walk using Lewis weights for approximating the John ellipsoid. We show that it mixes in $\widetilde{O}((n^{2.5}+\kappa n)$. Second, we extend the mixing time guarantees mentioned above to weakly log-concave distributions truncated on polytopes, provided that they have a finite covariance matrix. Third, going beyond worst-case mixing time analysis, we demonstrate that soft-threshold Dikin walk can mix significantly faster when only a limited number of constraints intersect the high-probability mass of the distribution, improving the $\widetilde{O}((m+\kappa)n)$ upper bound to $\widetilde{O}(m + \kappa n)$. Additionally, per-iteration complexity of regularized Dikin walk and ways to generate a warm initialization are discussed to facilitate practical implementation.</description>

      <title>Chopin: An Open Source R-language Tool to Support Spatial Analysis on Parallelizable Infrastructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An increasing volume of studies utilize geocomputation methods in large spatial data. There is a bottleneck in scalable computation for general scientific use as the existing solutions require high-performance computing domain knowledge and are tailored for specific use cases. This study presents an R package `chopin` to reduce the technical burden for parallelization in geocomputation. Supporting popular spatial analysis packages in R, `chopin` leverages parallel computing by partitioning data that are involved in a computation task. The partitioning is implemented at regular grids, data hierarchies, and multiple file inputs with flexible input types for interoperability between different packages and efficiency. This approach makes the geospatial covariate calculation to the scale of the available processing power in a wide range of computing assets from laptop computers to high-performance computing infrastructure. Testing use cases in environmental exposure assessment demonstrated that the package reduced the execution time by order of processing units used. The work is expected to provide broader research communities using geospatial data with an efficient tool to process large scale data.</description>

      <title>A partial likelihood approach to tree-based density modeling and its application in Bayesian inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tree-based models for probability distributions are usually specified using a predetermined, data-independent collection of candidate recursive partitions of the sample space. To characterize an unknown target density in detail over the entire sample space, candidate partitions must have the capacity to expand deeply into all areas of the sample space with potential non-zero sampling probability. Such an expansive system of partitions often incurs prohibitive computational costs and makes inference prone to overfitting, especially in regions with little probability mass. Existing models typically make a compromise and rely on relatively shallow trees. This hampers one of the most desirable features of trees, their ability to characterize local features, and results in reduced statistical efficiency. Traditional wisdom suggests that this compromise is inevitable to ensure coherent likelihood-based reasoning, as a data-dependent partition system that allows deeper expansion only in regions with more observations would induce double dipping of the data and thus lead to inconsistent inference. We propose a simple strategy to restore coherency while allowing the candidate partitions to be data-dependent, using Cox's partial likelihood. This strategy parametrizes the tree-based sampling model according to the allocation of probability mass based on the observed data, and yet under appropriate specification, the resulting inference remains valid. Our partial likelihood approach is broadly applicable to existing likelihood-based methods and in particular to Bayesian inference on tree-based models. We give examples in density estimation in which the partial likelihood is endowed with existing priors on tree-based models and compare with the standard, full-likelihood approach. The results show substantial gains in estimation accuracy and computational efficiency from using the partial likelihood.</description>

      <title>Multiplex Dirichlet stochastic block model for clustering multidimensional compositional networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Network data often represent multiple types of relations, which can also denote exchanged quantities, and are typically encompassed in a weighted multiplex. Such data frequently exhibit clustering structures, however, traditional clustering methods are not well-suited for multiplex networks. Additionally, standard methods treat edge weights in their raw form, potentially biasing clustering towards a node's total weight capacity rather than reflecting cluster-related interaction patterns. To address this, we propose transforming edge weights into a compositional format, enabling the analysis of connection strengths in relative terms and removing the impact of nodes' total weights. We introduce a multiplex Dirichlet stochastic block model designed for multiplex networks with compositional layers. This model accounts for sparse compositional networks and enables joint clustering across different types of interactions. We validate the model through a simulation study and apply it to the international export data from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.</description>

      <title>Prior Knowledge Accelerate Variance Computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21922v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Variance is a basic metric to evaluate the degree of data dispersion, and it is also frequently used in the realm of statistics. However, due to the computing variance and the large dataset being time-consuming, there is an urge to accelerate this computing process. The paper suggests a new method to reduce the time of this computation, it assumes a scenario in which we already know the variance of the original dataset, and the whole variance of this merge dataset could be expressed in the form of addition between the original variance and a remainder term. When we want to calculate the total variance after this adds up, the method only needs to calculate the remainder to get the result instead of recalculating the total variance again, which we named this type of method PKA(Prior Knowledge Acceleration). The paper mathematically proves the effectiveness of PKA in variance calculation, and the conditions for this method to accelerate properly.</description>

      <title>Poisson Multi-Bernoulli Mixtures for Sets of Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.08718</link>
      <description>arXiv:1912.08718v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Poisson Multi-Bernoulli Mixture (PMBM) density is a conjugate multi-target density for the standard point target model with Poisson point process birth. This means that both the filtering and predicted densities for the set of targets are PMBM. In this paper, we first show that the PMBM density is also conjugate for sets of trajectories with the standard point target measurement model. Second, based on this theoretical foundation, we develop two trajectory PMBM filters that provide recursions to calculate the posterior density for the set of all trajectories that have ever been present in the surveillance area, and the posterior density of the set of trajectories present at the current time step in the surveillance area. These two filters therefore provide complete probabilistic information on the considered trajectories enabling optimal trajectory estimation. Third, we establish that the density of the set of trajectories in any time window, given the measurements in a possibly different time window, is also a PMBM. Finally, the trajectory PMBM filters are evaluated via simulations, and are shown to yield state-of-the-art performance compared to other multi-target tracking algorithms based on random finite sets and multiple hypothesis tracking.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Levy-Dynamic Spatio-Temporal Process: Towards Big Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.08451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.08451v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this era of big data, all scientific disciplines are evolving fast to cope up with the enormity of the available information. So is statistics, the queen of science. Big data are particularly relevant to spatio-temporal statistics, thanks to much-improved technology in satellite based remote sensing and Geographical Information Systems. However, none of the existing approaches seem to meet the simultaneous demand of reality emulation and cheap computation. In this article, with the Levy random fields as the starting point, e construct a new Bayesian nonparametric, nonstationary and nonseparable dynamic spatio-temporal model with the additional realistic property that the lagged spatio-temporal correlations converge to zero as the lag tends to infinity. Although our Bayesian model seems to be intricately structured and is variable-dimensional with respect to each time index, we are able to devise a fast and efficient parallel Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm for Bayesian inference. Our simulation experiment brings out quite encouraging performance from our Bayesian Levy-dynamic approach. We finally apply our Bayesian Levy-dynamic model and methods to a sea surface temperature dataset consisting of 139,300 data points in space and time. Although not big data in the true sense, this is a large and highly structured data by any standard. Even for this large and complex data, our parallel MCMC algorithm, implemented on 80 processors, generated 110,000 MCMC realizations from the Levy-dynamic posterior within a single day, and the resultant Bayesian posterior predictive analysis turned out to be encouraging. Thus, it is not unreasonable to expect that with significantly more computing resources, it is feasible to analyse terabytes of spatio-temporal data with our new model and methods.</description>

      <title>Variational Inference for Sparse Poisson Regression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.01147v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have utilized the non-conjugate VB method for the problem of the sparse Poisson regression model. To provide an approximated conjugacy in the model, the likelihood is approximated by a quadratic function, which provides the conjugacy of the approximation component with the Gaussian prior to the regression coefficient. Three sparsity-enforcing priors are used for this problem. The proposed models are compared with each other and two frequentist sparse Poisson methods (LASSO and SCAD) to evaluate the estimation, prediction and the sparsing performance of the proposed methods. Throughout a simulated data example, the accuracy of the VB methods is computed compared to the corresponding benchmark MCMC methods. It can be observed that the proposed VB methods have provided a good approximation to the posterior distribution of the parameters, while the VB methods are much faster than the MCMC ones. Using several benchmark count response data sets, the prediction performance of the proposed methods is evaluated in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Simulation study to evaluate when Plasmode simulation is superior to parametric simulation in estimating the mean squared error of the least squares estimator in linear regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04077v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulation is a crucial tool for the evaluation and comparison of statistical methods. How to design fair and neutral simulation studies is therefore of great interest for researchers developing new methods and practitioners confronted with the choice of the most suitable method. The term simulation usually refers to parametric simulation, that is, computer experiments using artificial data made up of pseudo-random numbers. Plasmode simulation, that is, computer experiments using the combination of resampling feature data from a real-life dataset and generating the target variable with a known user-selected outcome-generating model (OGM), is an alternative that is often claimed to produce more realistic data. We compare parametric and Plasmode simulation for the example of estimating the mean squared error (MSE) of the least squares estimator (LSE) in linear regression. If the true underlying data-generating process (DGP) and the OGM were known, parametric simulation would obviously be the best choice in terms of estimating the MSE well. However, in reality, both are usually unknown, so researchers have to make assumptions: in Plasmode simulation for the OGM, in parametric simulation for both DGP and OGM. Most likely, these assumptions do not exactly reflect the truth. Here, we aim to find out how assumptions deviating from the true DGP and the true OGM affect the performance of parametric and Plasmode simulations in the context of MSE estimation for the LSE and in which situations which simulation type is preferable. Our results suggest that the preferable simulation method depends on many factors, including the number of features, and on how and to what extent the assumptions of a parametric simulation differ from the true DGP. Also, the resampling strategy used for Plasmode influences the results. In particular, subsampling with a small sampling proportion can be recommended.</description>

      <title>EM Estimation of the B-Spline Copula with Penalized Pseudo-Likelihood Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07569v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The B-spline copula function is defined by a linear combination of elements of the normalized B-spline basis. We develop a modified EM algorithm, to maximize the penalized pseudo-likelihood function, wherein we use the smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD) penalty function for the penalization term. We conduct simulation studies to demonstrate the stability of the proposed numerical procedure, show that penalization yields estimates with smaller mean-square errors when the true parameter matrix is sparse, and provide methods for determining tuning parameters and for model selection. We analyze as an example a data set consisting of birth and death rates from 237 countries, available at the website, ''Our World in Data,'' and we estimate the marginal density and distribution functions of those rates together with all parameters of our B-spline copula model.</description>
