      <title>Neural Networks Perform Sufficient Dimension Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the connection between neural networks and sufficient dimension reduction (SDR), demonstrating that neural networks inherently perform SDR in regression tasks under appropriate rank regularizations. Specifically, the weights in the first layer span the central mean subspace. We establish the statistical consistency of the neural network-based estimator for the central mean subspace, underscoring the suitability of neural networks in addressing SDR-related challenges. Numerical experiments further validate our theoretical findings, and highlight the underlying capability of neural networks to facilitate SDR compared to the existing methods. Additionally, we discuss an extension to unravel the central subspace, broadening the scope of our investigation.</description>

      <title>Localized exploration in contextual dynamic pricing achieves dimension-free regret</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of contextual dynamic pricing with a linear demand model. We propose a novel localized exploration-then-commit (LetC) algorithm which starts with a pure exploration stage, followed by a refinement stage that explores near the learned optimal pricing policy, and finally enters a pure exploitation stage. The algorithm is shown to achieve a minimax optimal, dimension-free regret bound when the time horizon exceeds a polynomial of the covariate dimension. Furthermore, we provide a general theoretical framework that encompasses the entire time spectrum, demonstrating how to balance exploration and exploitation when the horizon is limited. The analysis is powered by a novel critical inequality that depicts the exploration-exploitation trade-off in dynamic pricing, mirroring its existing counterpart for the bias-variance trade-off in regularized regression. Our theoretical results are validated by extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world data.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Conformal Inference by Betting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conformal prediction is a valuable tool for quantifying predictive uncertainty of machine learning models. However, its applicability relies on the assumption of data exchangeability, a condition which is often not met in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we consider the problem of adaptive conformal inference without any assumptions about the data generating process. Existing approaches for adaptive conformal inference are based on optimizing the pinball loss using variants of online gradient descent. A notable shortcoming of such approaches is in their explicit dependence on and sensitivity to the choice of the learning rates. In this paper, we propose a different approach for adaptive conformal inference that leverages parameter-free online convex optimization techniques. We prove that our method controls long-term miscoverage frequency at a nominal level and demonstrate its convincing empirical performance without any need of performing cumbersome parameter tuning.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically Optimal Search for a Change Point Anomaly under a Composite Hypothesis Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the problem of searching for a change point in an anomalous process among a finite set of M processes. Specifically, we address a composite hypothesis model in which each process generates measurements following a common distribution with an unknown parameter (vector). This parameter belongs to either a normal or abnormal space depending on the current state of the process. Before the change point, all processes, including the anomalous one, are in a normal state; after the change point, the anomalous process transitions to an abnormal state. Our goal is to design a sequential search strategy that minimizes the Bayes risk by balancing sample complexity and detection accuracy. We propose a deterministic search algorithm with the following notable properties. First, we analytically demonstrate that when the distributions of both normal and abnormal processes are unknown, the algorithm is asymptotically optimal in minimizing the Bayes risk as the error probability approaches zero. In the second setting, where the parameter under the null hypothesis is known, the algorithm achieves asymptotic optimality with improved detection time based on the true normal state. Simulation results are presented to validate the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Low-Rank Contextual Reinforcement Learning from Heterogeneous Human Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has become a cornerstone for aligning large language models with human preferences. However, the heterogeneity of human feedback, driven by diverse individual contexts and preferences, poses significant challenges for reward learning. To address this, we propose a Low-rank Contextual RLHF (LoCo-RLHF) framework that integrates contextual information to better model heterogeneous feedback while maintaining computational efficiency. Our approach builds on a contextual preference model, leveraging the intrinsic low-rank structure of the interaction between user contexts and query-answer pairs to mitigate the high dimensionality of feature representations. Furthermore, we address the challenge of distributional shifts in feedback through our Pessimism in Reduced Subspace (PRS) policy, inspired by pessimistic offline reinforcement learning techniques. We theoretically demonstrate that our policy achieves a tighter sub-optimality gap compared to existing methods. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of LoCo-RLHF, showcasing its superior performance in personalized RLHF settings and its robustness to distribution shifts.</description>

      <title>Deep Linear Hawkes Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Marked temporal point processes (MTPPs) are used to model sequences of different types of events with irregular arrival times, with broad applications ranging from healthcare and social networks to finance. We address shortcomings in existing point process models by drawing connections between modern deep state-space models (SSMs) and linear Hawkes processes (LHPs), culminating in an MTPP that we call the deep linear Hawkes process (DLHP). The DLHP modifies the linear differential equations in deep SSMs to be stochastic jump differential equations, akin to LHPs. After discretizing, the resulting recurrence can be implemented efficiently using a parallel scan. This brings parallelism and linear scaling to MTPP models. This contrasts with attention-based MTPPs, which scale quadratically, and RNN-based MTPPs, which do not parallelize across the sequence length. We show empirically that DLHPs match or outperform existing models across a broad range of metrics on eight real-world datasets. Our proposed DLHP model is the first instance of the unique architectural capabilities of SSMs being leveraged to construct a new class of MTPP models.</description>

      <title>Deep ReLU networks -- injectivity capacity upper bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study deep ReLU feed forward neural networks (NN) and their injectivity abilities. The main focus is on \emph{precisely} determining the so-called injectivity capacity. For any given hidden layers architecture, it is defined as the minimal ratio between number of network's outputs and inputs which ensures unique recoverability of the input from a realizable output. A strong recent progress in precisely studying single ReLU layer injectivity properties is here moved to a deep network level. In particular, we develop a program that connects deep $l$-layer net injectivity to an $l$-extension of the $\ell_0$ spherical perceptrons, thereby massively generalizing an isomorphism between studying single layer injectivity and the capacity of the so-called (1-extension) $\ell_0$ spherical perceptrons discussed in [82]. \emph{Random duality theory} (RDT) based machinery is then created and utilized to statistically handle properties of the extended $\ell_0$ spherical perceptrons and implicitly of the deep ReLU NNs. A sizeable set of numerical evaluations is conducted as well to put the entire RDT machinery in practical use. From these we observe a rapidly decreasing tendency in needed layers' expansions, i.e., we observe a rapid \emph{expansion saturation effect}. Only $4$ layers of depth are sufficient to closely approach level of no needed expansion -- a result that fairly closely resembles observations made in practical experiments and that has so far remained completely untouchable by any of the existing mathematical methodologies.</description>

      <title>Causal machine learning for heterogeneous treatment effects in the presence of missing outcome data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When estimating heterogeneous treatment effects, missing outcome data can complicate treatment effect estimation, causing certain subgroups of the population to be poorly represented. In this work, we discuss this commonly overlooked problem and consider the impact that missing at random (MAR) outcome data has on causal machine learning estimators for the conditional average treatment effect (CATE). We then propose two de-biased machine learning estimators for the CATE, the mDR-learner and mEP-learner, which address the issue of under-representation by integrating inverse probability of censoring weights into the DR-learner and EP-learner respectively. We show that under reasonable conditions, these estimators are oracle efficient, and illustrate their favorable performance through simulated data settings, comparing them to existing CATE estimators, including comparison to estimators which use common missing data techniques. Guidance on the implementation of these estimators is provided and we present an example of their application using the ACTG175 trial, exploring treatment effect heterogeneity when comparing Zidovudine mono-therapy against alternative antiretroviral therapies among HIV-1-infected individuals.</description>

      <title>Learning to Forget: Bayesian Time Series Forecasting using Recurrent Sparse Spectrum Signature Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The signature kernel is a kernel between time series of arbitrary length and comes with strong theoretical guarantees from stochastic analysis. It has found applications in machine learning such as covariance functions for Gaussian processes. A strength of the underlying signature features is that they provide a structured global description of a time series. However, this property can quickly become a curse when local information is essential and forgetting is required; so far this has only been addressed with ad-hoc methods such as slicing the time series into subsegments. To overcome this, we propose a principled, data-driven approach by introducing a novel forgetting mechanism for signatures. This allows the model to dynamically adapt its context length to focus on more recent information. To achieve this, we revisit the recently introduced Random Fourier Signature Features, and develop Random Fourier Decayed Signature Features (RFDSF) with Gaussian processes (GPs). This results in a Bayesian time series forecasting algorithm with variational inference, that offers a scalable probabilistic algorithm that processes and transforms a time series into a joint predictive distribution over time steps in one pass using recurrence. For example, processing a sequence of length $10^4$ steps in $\approx 10^{-2}$ seconds and in $&lt; 1\text{GB}$ of GPU memory. We demonstrate that it outperforms other GP-based alternatives and competes with state-of-the-art probabilistic time series forecasting algorithms.</description>

      <title>LASER: A new method for locally adaptive nonparametric regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we introduce \textsf{LASER} (Locally Adaptive Smoothing Estimator for Regression), a computationally efficient locally adaptive nonparametric regression method that performs variable bandwidth local polynomial regression. We prove that it adapts (near-)optimally to the local H\"{o}lder exponent of the underlying regression function \texttt{simultaneously} at all points in its domain. Furthermore, we show that there is a single ideal choice of a global tuning parameter under which the above mentioned local adaptivity holds. Despite the vast literature on nonparametric regression, instances of practicable methods with provable guarantees of such a strong notion of local adaptivity are rare. The proposed method achieves excellent performance across a broad range of numerical experiments in comparison to popular alternative locally adaptive methods.</description>

      <title>An efficient search-and-score algorithm for ancestral graphs using multivariate information scores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a greedy search-and-score algorithm for ancestral graphs, which include directed as well as bidirected edges, originating from unobserved latent variables. The normalized likelihood score of ancestral graphs is estimated in terms of multivariate information over relevant ``ac-connected subsets'' of vertices, C, that are connected through collider paths confined to the ancestor set of C. For computational efficiency, the proposed two-step algorithm relies on local information scores limited to the close surrounding vertices of each node (step 1) and edge (step 2). This computational strategy, although restricted to information contributions from ac-connected subsets containing up to two-collider paths, is shown to outperform state-of-the-art causal discovery methods on challenging benchmark datasets.</description>

      <title>BoostMD: Accelerating molecular sampling by leveraging ML force field features from previous time-steps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulating atomic-scale processes, such as protein dynamics and catalytic reactions, is crucial for advancements in biology, chemistry, and materials science. Machine learning force fields (MLFFs) have emerged as powerful tools that achieve near quantum mechanical accuracy, with promising generalization capabilities. However, their practical use is often limited by long inference times compared to classical force fields, especially when running extensive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations required for many biological applications. In this study, we introduce BoostMD, a surrogate model architecture designed to accelerate MD simulations. BoostMD leverages node features computed at previous time steps to predict energies and forces based on positional changes. This approach reduces the complexity of the learning task, allowing BoostMD to be both smaller and significantly faster than conventional MLFFs. During simulations, the computationally intensive reference MLFF is evaluated only every $N$ steps, while the lightweight BoostMD model handles the intermediate steps at a fraction of the computational cost. Our experiments demonstrate that BoostMD achieves an eight-fold speedup compared to the reference model and generalizes to unseen dipeptides. Furthermore, we find that BoostMD accurately samples the ground-truth Boltzmann distribution when running molecular dynamics. By combining efficient feature reuse with a streamlined architecture, BoostMD offers a robust solution for conducting large-scale, long-timescale molecular simulations, making high-accuracy ML-driven modeling more accessible and practical.</description>

      <title>High-accuracy sampling from constrained spaces with the Metropolis-adjusted Preconditioned Langevin Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a first-order sampling method called the Metropolis-adjusted Preconditioned Langevin Algorithm for approximate sampling from a target distribution whose support is a proper convex subset of $\mathbb{R}^{d}$. Our proposed method is the result of applying a Metropolis-Hastings filter to the Markov chain formed by a single step of the preconditioned Langevin algorithm with a metric $\mathscr{G}$, and is motivated by the natural gradient descent algorithm for optimisation. We derive non-asymptotic upper bounds for the mixing time of this method for sampling from target distributions whose potentials are bounded relative to $\mathscr{G}$, and for exponential distributions restricted to the support. Our analysis suggests that if $\mathscr{G}$ satisfies stronger notions of self-concordance introduced in Kook and Vempala (2024), then these mixing time upper bounds have a strictly better dependence on the dimension than when is merely self-concordant. We also provide numerical experiments that demonstrates the practicality of our proposed method. Our method is a high-accuracy sampler due to the polylogarithmic dependence on the error tolerance in our mixing time upper bounds.</description>

      <title>On Improved Regret Bounds In Bayesian Optimization with Gaussian Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) with Gaussian process (GP) surrogate models is a powerful black-box optimization method. Acquisition functions are a critical part of a BO algorithm as they determine how the new samples are selected. Some of the most widely used acquisition functions include upper confidence bound (UCB) and Thompson sampling (TS). The convergence analysis of BO algorithms has focused on the cumulative regret under both the Bayesian and frequentist settings for the objective. In this paper, we establish new pointwise bounds on the prediction error of GP under the frequentist setting with Gaussian noise. Consequently, we prove improved convergence rates of cumulative regret bound for both GP-UCB and GP-TS. Of note, the new prediction error bound under Gaussian noise can be applied to general BO algorithms and convergence analysis, e.g., the asymptotic convergence of expected improvement (EI) with noise.</description>

      <title>Provable Uncertainty Decomposition via Higher-Order Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a principled method for decomposing the predictive uncertainty of a model into aleatoric and epistemic components with explicit semantics relating them to the real-world data distribution. While many works in the literature have proposed such decompositions, they lack the type of formal guarantees we provide. Our method is based on the new notion of higher-order calibration, which generalizes ordinary calibration to the setting of higher-order predictors that predict mixtures over label distributions at every point. We show how to measure as well as achieve higher-order calibration using access to $k$-snapshots, namely examples where each point has $k$ independent conditional labels. Under higher-order calibration, the estimated aleatoric uncertainty at a point is guaranteed to match the real-world aleatoric uncertainty averaged over all points where the prediction is made. To our knowledge, this is the first formal guarantee of this type that places no assumptions whatsoever on the real-world data distribution. Importantly, higher-order calibration is also applicable to existing higher-order predictors such as Bayesian and ensemble models and provides a natural evaluation metric for such models. We demonstrate through experiments that our method produces meaningful uncertainty decompositions for image classification.</description>

Abstract: Granger causality has become an indispensable tool for analyzing causal relationships between time series. In this paper, we provide a detailed overview of its mathematical foundations, trace its historical development, and explore how recent computational advancements can enhance its application in various fields. We will not hesitate to present the proofs in full if they are simple and transparent. For more complex theorems on which we rely, we will provide supporting citations. We also discuss potential future directions for the method, particularly in the context of largescale data analysis.</description>

      <title>To Predict or Not To Predict? Proportionally Masked Autoencoders for Tabular Data Imputation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Masked autoencoders (MAEs) have recently demonstrated effectiveness in tabular data imputation. However, due to the inherent heterogeneity of tabular data, the uniform random masking strategy commonly used in MAEs can disrupt the distribution of missingness, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose a proportional masking strategy for MAEs. Specifically, we first compute the statistics of missingness based on the observed proportions in the dataset, and then generate masks that align with these statistics, ensuring that the distribution of missingness is preserved after masking. Furthermore, we argue that simple MLP-based token mixing offers competitive or often superior performance compared to attention mechanisms while being more computationally efficient, especially in the tabular domain with the inherent heterogeneity. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed proportional masking strategy across various missing data patterns in tabular datasets.

      <title>Applying the maximum entropy principle to multi-species neural networks improves species distribution models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid expansion of citizen science initiatives has led to a significant growth of biodiversity databases, and particularly presence-only (PO) observations. PO data are invaluable for understanding species distributions and their dynamics, but their use in Species Distribution Models (SDM) is curtailed by sampling biases and the lack of information on absences. Poisson point processes are widely used for SDMs, with Maxent being one of the most popular methods. Maxent maximises the entropy of a probability distribution across sites as a function of predefined transformations of environmental variables, called features. In contrast, neural networks and deep learning have emerged as a promising technique for automatic feature extraction from complex input variables. In this paper, we propose DeepMaxent, which harnesses neural networks to automatically learn shared features among species, using the maximum entropy principle. To do so, it employs a normalised Poisson loss where for each species, presence probabilities across sites are modelled by a neural network. We evaluate DeepMaxent on a benchmark dataset known for its spatial sampling biases, using PO data for calibration and presence-absence (PA) data for validation across six regions with different biological groups and environmental covariates. Our results indicate that DeepMaxent improves model performance over Maxent and other state-of-the-art SDMs across regions and taxonomic groups. The method performs particularly well in regions of uneven sampling, demonstrating substantial potential to improve species distribution modelling. The method opens the possibility to learn more robust environmental features predicting jointly many species and scales to arbitrary large numbers of sites without an increased memory demand.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models for Market Research: A Data-augmentation Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed artificial intelligence by excelling in complex natural language processing tasks. Their ability to generate human-like text has opened new possibilities for market research, particularly in conjoint analysis, where understanding consumer preferences is essential but often resource-intensive. Traditional survey-based methods face limitations in scalability and cost, making LLM-generated data a promising alternative. However, while LLMs have the potential to simulate real consumer behavior, recent studies highlight a significant gap between LLM-generated and human data, with biases introduced when substituting between the two. In this paper, we address this gap by proposing a novel statistical data augmentation approach that efficiently integrates LLM-generated data with real data in conjoint analysis. Our method leverages transfer learning principles to debias the LLM-generated data using a small amount of human data. This results in statistically robust estimators with consistent and asymptotically normal properties, in contrast to naive approaches that simply substitute human data with LLM-generated data, which can exacerbate bias. We validate our framework through an empirical study on COVID-19 vaccine preferences, demonstrating its superior ability to reduce estimation error and save data and costs by 24.9\% to 79.8\%. In contrast, naive approaches fail to save data due to the inherent biases in LLM-generated data compared to human data. Another empirical study on sports car choices validates the robustness of our results. Our findings suggest that while LLM-generated data is not a direct substitute for human responses, it can serve as a valuable complement when used within a robust statistical framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study an approximate controllability problem for the continuity equation and its application to constructing transport maps with normalizing flows. Specifically, we construct time-dependent controls $\theta=(w, a, b)$ in the vector field $w(a^\top x + b)_+$ to approximately transport a known base density $\rho_{\mathrm{B}}$ to a target density $\rho_*$. The approximation error is measured in relative entropy, and $\theta$ are constructed piecewise constant, with bounds on the number of switches being provided. Our main result relies on an assumption on the relative tail decay of $\rho_*$ and $\rho_{\mathrm{B}}$, and provides hints on characterizing the reachable space of the continuity equation in relative entropy.</description>

      <title>Comparing Few to Rank Many: Active Human Preference Learning using Randomized Frank-Wolfe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study learning of human preferences from a limited comparison feedback. This task is ubiquitous in machine learning. Its applications such as reinforcement learning from human feedback, have been transformational. We formulate this problem as learning a Plackett-Luce model over a universe of $N$ choices from $K$-way comparison feedback, where typically $K \ll N$. Our solution is the D-optimal design for the Plackett-Luce objective. The design defines a data logging policy that elicits comparison feedback for a small collection of optimally chosen points from all ${N \choose K}$ feasible subsets. The main algorithmic challenge in this work is that even fast methods for solving D-optimal designs would have $O({N \choose K})$ time complexity. To address this issue, we propose a randomized Frank-Wolfe (FW) algorithm that solves the linear maximization sub-problems in the FW method on randomly chosen variables. We analyze the algorithm, and evaluate it empirically on synthetic and open-source NLP datasets.</description>

Abstract: Optimization algorithms such as AdaGrad and Adam have significantly advanced the training of deep models by dynamically adjusting the learning rate during the optimization process. However, adhoc tuning of learning rates poses a challenge, leading to inefficiencies in practice. To address this issue, recent research has focused on developing "learning-rate-free" or "parameter-free" algorithms that operate effectively without the need for learning rate tuning. Despite these efforts, existing parameter-free variants of AdaGrad and Adam tend to be overly complex and/or lack formal convergence guarantees. In this paper, we present AdaGrad++ and Adam++, novel and simple parameter-free variants of AdaGrad and Adam with convergence guarantees. We prove that AdaGrad++ achieves comparable convergence rates to AdaGrad in convex optimization without predefined learning rate assumptions. Similarly, Adam++ matches the convergence rate of Adam without relying on any conditions on the learning rates. Experimental results across various deep learning tasks validate the competitive performance of AdaGrad++ and Adam++.</description>

      <title>Estimation of System Parameters Including Repeated Cross-Sectional Data through Emulator-Informed Deep Generative Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Differential equations (DEs) are crucial for modeling the evolution of natural or engineered systems. Traditionally, the parameters in DEs are adjusted to fit data from system observations. However, in fields such as politics, economics, and biology, available data are often independently collected at distinct time points from different subjects (i.e., repeated cross-sectional (RCS) data). Conventional optimization techniques struggle to accurately estimate DE parameters when RCS data exhibit various heterogeneities, leading to a significant loss of information. To address this issue, we propose a new estimation method called the emulator-informed deep-generative model (EIDGM), designed to handle RCS data. Specifically, EIDGM integrates a physics-informed neural network-based emulator that immediately generates DE solutions and a Wasserstein generative adversarial network-based parameter generator that can effectively mimic the RCS data. We evaluated EIDGM on exponential growth, logistic population models, and the Lorenz system, demonstrating its superior ability to accurately capture parameter distributions. Additionally, we applied EIDGM to an experimental dataset of Amyloid beta 40 and beta 42, successfully capturing diverse parameter distribution shapes. This shows that EIDGM can be applied to model a wide range of systems and extended to uncover the operating principles of systems based on limited data.</description>

      <title>Nonconvex Stochastic Optimization under Heavy-Tailed Noises: Optimal Convergence without Gradient Clipping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, the study of heavy-tailed noises in first-order nonconvex stochastic optimization has gotten a lot of attention since it was recognized as a more realistic condition as suggested by many empirical observations. Specifically, the stochastic noise (the difference between the stochastic and true gradient) is considered only to have a finite $\mathfrak{p}$-th moment where $\mathfrak{p}\in\left(1,2\right]$ instead of assuming it always satisfies the classical finite variance assumption. To deal with this more challenging setting, people have proposed different algorithms and proved them to converge at an optimal $\mathcal{O}(T^{\frac{1-\mathfrak{p}}{3\mathfrak{p}-2}})$ rate for smooth objectives after $T$ iterations. Notably, all these new-designed algorithms are based on the same technique - gradient clipping. Naturally, one may want to know whether the clipping method is a necessary ingredient and the only way to guarantee convergence under heavy-tailed noises. In this work, by revisiting the existing Batched Normalized Stochastic Gradient Descent with Momentum (Batched NSGDM) algorithm, we provide the first convergence result under heavy-tailed noises but without gradient clipping. Concretely, we prove that Batched NSGDM can achieve the optimal $\mathcal{O}(T^{\frac{1-\mathfrak{p}}{3\mathfrak{p}-2}})$ rate even under the relaxed smooth condition. More interestingly, we also establish the first $\mathcal{O}(T^{\frac{1-\mathfrak{p}}{2\mathfrak{p}}})$ convergence rate in the case where the tail index $\mathfrak{p}$ is unknown in advance, which is arguably the common scenario in practice.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work focuses on the mixed membership models for multivariate categorical data widely used for analyzing survey responses and population genetics data. These grade of membership (GoM) models offer rich modeling power but present significant estimation challenges for high-dimensional polytomous data. Popular existing approaches, such as Bayesian MCMC inference, are not scalable and lack theoretical guarantees in high-dimensional settings. To address this, we first observe that data from this model can be reformulated as a three-way (quasi-)tensor, with many subjects responding to many items with varying numbers of categories. We introduce a novel and simple approach that flattens the three-way quasi-tensor into a "fat" matrix, and then perform a singular value decomposition of it to estimate parameters by exploiting the singular subspace geometry. Our fast spectral method can accommodate a broad range of data distributions with arbitrarily locally dependent noise, which we formalize as the generalized-GoM models. We establish finite-sample entrywise error bounds for the generalized-GoM model parameters. This is supported by a new sharp two-to-infinity singular subspace perturbation theory for locally dependent and flexibly distributed noise, a contribution of independent interest. Simulations and applications to data in political surveys, population genetics, and single-cell sequencing demonstrate our method's superior performance.</description>

Abstract: Causal inference is a critical task across fields such as healthcare, economics, and the social sciences. While recent advances in machine learning, especially those based on the deep-learning architectures, have shown potential in estimating causal effects, existing approaches often fall short in handling complex causal structures and lack adaptability across various causal scenarios. In this paper, we present a novel transformer-based method for causal inference that overcomes these challenges. The core innovation of our model lies in its integration of causal Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) directly into the attention mechanism, enabling it to accurately model the underlying causal structure. This allows for flexible estimation of both average treatment effects (ATE) and conditional average treatment effects (CATE). Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach surpasses existing methods in estimating causal effects across a wide range of scenarios. The flexibility and robustness of our model make it a valuable tool for researchers and practitioners tackling complex causal inference problems.</description>

Abstract: We apply split conformal prediction techniques to regression problems with circular responses by introducing a suitable conformity score, leading to prediction sets with adaptive arc length and finite-sample coverage guarantees for any circular predictive model under exchangeable data. Leveraging the high performance of existing predictive models designed for linear responses, we analyze a general projection procedure that converts any linear response regression model into one suitable for circular responses. When random forests serve as basis models in this projection procedure, we harness the out-of-bag dynamics to eliminate the necessity for a separate calibration sample in the construction of prediction sets. For synthetic and real datasets the resulting projected random forests model produces more efficient out-of-bag conformal prediction sets, with shorter median arc length, when compared to the split conformal prediction sets generated by two existing alternative models.</description>

Abstract: Gaussian processes (GPs) provide a principled and direct approach for inference and learning on graphs. However, the lack of justified graph kernels for spatio-temporal modelling has held back their use in graph problems. We leverage an explicit link between stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) and GPs on graphs, introduce a framework for deriving graph kernels via SPDEs, and derive non-separable spatio-temporal graph kernels that capture interaction across space and time. We formulate the graph kernels for the stochastic heat equation and wave equation. We show that by providing novel tools for spatio-temporal GP modelling on graphs, we outperform pre-existing graph kernels in real-world applications that feature diffusion, oscillation, and other complicated interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.06528v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop an approach for Bayesian learning of spatiotemporal dynamical mechanistic models. Such learning consists of statistical emulation of the mechanistic system that can efficiently interpolate the output of the system from arbitrary inputs. The emulated learner can then be used to train the system from noisy data achieved by melding information from observed data with the emulated mechanistic system. This joint melding of mechanistic systems employ hierarchical state-space models with Gaussian process regression. Assuming the dynamical system is controlled by a finite collection of inputs, Gaussian process regression learns the effect of these parameters through a number of training runs, driving the stochastic innovations of the spatiotemporal state-space component. This enables efficient modeling of the dynamics over space and time. This article details exact inference with analytically accessible posterior distributions in hierarchical matrix-variate Normal and Wishart models in designing the emulator. This step obviates expensive iterative algorithms such as Markov chain Monte Carlo or variational approximations. We also show how emulation is applicable to large-scale emulation by designing a dynamic Bayesian transfer learning framework. Inference on $\bm \eta$ proceeds using Markov chain Monte Carlo as a post-emulation step using the emulator as a regression component. We demonstrate this framework through solving inverse problems arising in the analysis of ordinary and partial nonlinear differential equations and, in addition, to a black-box computer model generating spatiotemporal dynamics across a graphical model.</description>

      <title>Deep Bayes Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05411v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The is no other model or hypothesis verification tool in Bayesian statistics that is as widely used as the Bayes factor. We focus on generative models that are likelihood-free and, therefore, render the computation of Bayes factors (marginal likelihood ratios) far from obvious. We propose a deep learning estimator of the Bayes factor based on simulated data from two competing models using the likelihood ratio trick. This estimator is devoid of summary statistics and obviates some of the difficulties with ABC model choice. We establish sufficient conditions for consistency of our Deep Bayes Factor estimator as well as its consistency as a model selection tool. We investigate the performance of our estimator on various examples using a wide range of quality metrics related to estimation and model decision accuracy. After training, our deep learning approach enables rapid evaluations of the Bayes factor estimator at any fictional data arriving from either hypothesized model, not just the observed data $Y_0$. This allows us to inspect entire Bayes factor distributions under the two models and to quantify the relative location of the Bayes factor evaluated at $Y_0$ in light of these distributions. Such tail area evaluations are not possible for Bayes factor estimators tailored to $Y_0$. We find the performance of our Deep Bayes Factors competitive with existing MCMC techniques that require the knowledge of the likelihood function. We also consider variants for posterior or intrinsic Bayes factors estimation. We demonstrate the usefulness of our approach on a relatively high-dimensional real data example about determining cognitive biases.</description>

      <title>Robust Point Matching with Distance Profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12641v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show the outlier robustness and noise stability of practical matching procedures based on distance profiles. Although the idea of matching points based on invariants like distance profiles has a long history in the literature, there has been little understanding of the theoretical properties of such procedures, especially in the presence of outliers and noise. We provide a theoretical analysis showing that under certain probabilistic settings, the proposed matching procedure is successful with high probability even in the presence of outliers and noise. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed method using a real data example and provide simulation studies to complement the theoretical findings. Lastly, we extend the concept of distance profiles to the abstract setting and connect the proposed matching procedure to the Gromov-Wasserstein distance and its lower bound, with a new sample complexity result derived based on the properties of distance profiles. This paper contributes to the literature by providing theoretical underpinnings of the matching procedures based on invariants like distance profiles, which have been widely used in practice but have rarely been analyzed theoretically.</description>

      <title>Improving GFlowNets for Text-to-Image Diffusion Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00633v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have become the de-facto approach for generating visual data, which are trained to match the distribution of the training dataset. In addition, we also want to control generation to fulfill desired properties such as alignment to a text description, which can be specified with a black-box reward function. Prior works fine-tune pretrained diffusion models to achieve this goal through reinforcement learning-based algorithms. Nonetheless, they suffer from issues including slow credit assignment as well as low quality in their generated samples. In this work, we explore techniques that do not directly maximize the reward but rather generate high-reward images with relatively high probability -- a natural scenario for the framework of generative flow networks (GFlowNets). To this end, we propose the Diffusion Alignment with GFlowNet (DAG) algorithm to post-train diffusion models with black-box property functions. Extensive experiments on Stable Diffusion and various reward specifications corroborate that our method could effectively align large-scale text-to-image diffusion models with given reward information.</description>

      <title>Simplified and Generalized Masked Diffusion for Discrete Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04329v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Masked (or absorbing) diffusion is actively explored as an alternative to autoregressive models for generative modeling of discrete data. However, existing work in this area has been hindered by unnecessarily complex model formulations and unclear relationships between different perspectives, leading to suboptimal parameterization, training objectives, and ad hoc adjustments to counteract these issues. In this work, we aim to provide a simple and general framework that unlocks the full potential of masked diffusion models. We show that the continuous-time variational objective of masked diffusion models is a simple weighted integral of cross-entropy losses. Our framework also enables training generalized masked diffusion models with state-dependent masking schedules. When evaluated by perplexity, our models trained on OpenWebText surpass prior diffusion language models at GPT-2 scale and demonstrate superior performance on 4 out of 5 zero-shot language modeling tasks. Furthermore, our models vastly outperform previous discrete diffusion models on pixel-level image modeling, achieving 2.75 (CIFAR-10) and 3.40 (ImageNet 64x64) bits per dimension that are better than autoregressive models of similar sizes.

      <title>Policy Gradients for Optimal Parallel Tempering MCMC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01574v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Parallel tempering is a meta-algorithm for Markov Chain Monte Carlo that uses multiple chains to sample from tempered versions of the target distribution, enhancing mixing in multi-modal distributions that are challenging for traditional methods. The effectiveness of parallel tempering is heavily influenced by the selection of chain temperatures. Here, we present an adaptive temperature selection algorithm that dynamically adjusts temperatures during sampling using a policy gradient approach. Experiments demonstrate that our method can achieve lower integrated autocorrelation times compared to traditional geometrically spaced temperatures and uniform acceptance rate schemes on benchmark distributions.</description>

      <title>Mitigating optimistic bias in entropic risk estimation and optimization with an application to insurance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19926v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The entropic risk measure is widely used in high-stakes decision making to account for tail risks associated with an uncertain loss. With limited data, the empirical entropic risk estimator, i.e. replacing the expectation in the entropic risk measure with a sample average, underestimates the true risk. To mitigate the bias in the empirical entropic risk estimator, we propose a strongly asymptotically consistent bootstrapping procedure. The first step of the procedure involves fitting a distribution to the data, whereas the second step estimates the bias of the empirical entropic risk estimator using bootstrapping, and corrects for it. Two methods are proposed to fit a Gaussian Mixture Model to the data, a computationally intensive one that fits the distribution of empirical entropic risk, and a simpler one with a component that fits the tail of the empirical distribution. As an application of our approach, we study distributionally robust entropic risk minimization problems with type-$\infty$ Wasserstein ambiguity set and apply our bias correction to debias validation performance. Furthermore, we propose a distributionally robust optimization model for an insurance contract design problem that takes into account the correlations of losses across households. We show that choosing regularization parameters based on the cross validation methods can result in significantly higher out-of-sample risk for the insurer if the bias in validation performance is not corrected for. This improvement in performance can be explained from the observation that our methods suggest a higher (and more accurate) premium to homeowners.</description>

      <title>Generation through the lens of learning theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13714v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study generation through the lens of statistical learning theory. First, we abstract and formalize the results of Gold [1967], Angluin [1979], Angluin [1980] and Kleinberg and Mullainathan [2024] in terms of a binary hypothesis class defined over an abstract example space. Then, we extend the notion of "generation" from Kleinberg and Mullainathan [2024] to two new settings, we call "uniform" and "non-uniform" generation, and provide a characterization of which hypothesis classes are uniformly and non-uniformly generatable. As is standard in learning theory, our characterizations are in terms of the finiteness of a new combinatorial dimension termed the Closure dimension. By doing so, we are able to compare generatability with predictability (captured via PAC and online learnability) and show that these two properties of hypothesis classes are incompatible -- there are classes that are generatable but not predictable and vice versa. Finally, we extend our results to capture prompted generation and give a complete characterization of which classes are prompt generatable, generalizing some of the work by Kleinberg and Mullainathan [2024].</description>

      <title>Sloth: scaling laws for LLM skills to predict multi-benchmark performance across families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06540v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scaling laws for large language models (LLMs) predict model performance based on parameters like size and training data. However, differences in training configurations and data processing across model families lead to significant variations in benchmark performance, making it difficult for a single scaling law to generalize across all LLMs. On the other hand, training family-specific scaling laws requires training models of varying sizes for every family. In this work, we propose Skills Scaling Laws (SSLaws, pronounced as Sloth), a novel scaling law that leverages publicly available benchmark data and assumes LLM performance is driven by low-dimensional latent skills, such as reasoning and instruction following. These latent skills are influenced by computational resources like model size and training tokens but with varying efficiencies across model families. Sloth exploits correlations across benchmarks to provide more accurate and interpretable predictions while alleviating the need to train multiple LLMs per family. We present both theoretical results on parameter identification and empirical evaluations on 12 prominent benchmarks, from Open LLM Leaderboard v1/v2, demonstrating that Sloth predicts LLM performance efficiently and offers insights into scaling behaviors for downstream tasks such as coding and emotional intelligence applications.</description>

      <title>Task Diversity in Bayesian Federated Learning: Simultaneous Processing of Classification and Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10897v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work addresses a key limitation in current federated learning approaches, which predominantly focus on homogeneous tasks, neglecting the task diversity on local devices. We propose a principled integration of multi-task learning using multi-output Gaussian processes (MOGP) at the local level and federated learning at the global level. MOGP handles correlated classification and regression tasks, offering a Bayesian non-parametric approach that naturally quantifies uncertainty. The central server aggregates the posteriors from local devices, updating a global MOGP prior redistributed for training local models until convergence. Challenges in performing posterior inference on local devices are addressed through the P\'{o}lya-Gamma augmentation technique and mean-field variational inference, enhancing computational efficiency and convergence rate. Experimental results on both synthetic and real data demonstrate superior predictive performance, OOD detection, uncertainty calibration and convergence rate, highlighting the method's potential in diverse applications.

      <title>Unveiling Uncertainty: A Deep Dive into Calibration and Performance of Multimodal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14660v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) combine visual and textual data for tasks such as image captioning and visual question answering. Proper uncertainty calibration is crucial, yet challenging, for reliable use in areas like healthcare and autonomous driving. This paper investigates representative MLLMs, focusing on their calibration across various scenarios, including before and after visual fine-tuning, as well as before and after multimodal training of the base LLMs. We observed miscalibration in their performance, and at the same time, no significant differences in calibration across these scenarios. We also highlight how uncertainty differs between text and images and how their integration affects overall uncertainty. To better understand MLLMs' miscalibration and their ability to self-assess uncertainty, we construct the IDK (I don't know) dataset, which is key to evaluating how they handle unknowns. Our findings reveal that MLLMs tend to give answers rather than admit uncertainty, but this self-assessment improves with proper prompt adjustments. Finally, to calibrate MLLMs and enhance model reliability, we propose techniques such as temperature scaling and iterative prompt optimization. Our results provide insights into improving MLLMs for effective and responsible deployment in multimodal applications. Code and IDK dataset: https://github.com/hfutml/Calibration-MLLM.</description>
