      <title>Fabrication of Fibers with Complex Features Using Thermal Drawing of 3D-Printed Preforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-aspect-ratio polymer materials are widely utilized in applications ranging from everyday materials such as clothing to specialized equipment in industrial and medical fields. Traditional fabrication methods, such as extrusion and molding, face challenges in integrating diverse materials and achieving complex geometries. Additionally, these methods are limited in their ability to provide low-cost and rapid prototyping, which are critical for research and development processes. In this work, we investigated the use of commercially available 3D printers to fabricate fiber preforms, which were subsequently thermally drawn into fibers. By optimizing 3D printing parameters, we achieved the fabrication of fibers with diameters as small as 200 um having complex shapes, with features down to a few microns. We demonstrated the versatility of this method by fabricating fibers from diverse set of materials, such as fibers with different stiffnesses and fibers with magnetic characteristics, which are beneficial for developing tendon-driven and magnetically actuated robotic fibers. In addition, by designing novel preform geometries, we produced tapered fibers and fibers with interlocking mechanisms, also tailored for use in medical steerable catheter applications. These advancements highlight the scalability and versatility of this approach, offering a robust platform for producing high-precision polymer fibers for diverse applications.</description>

      <title>Imaging simulation of a dual-panel PET geometry with ultrafast TOF detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In positron emission tomography (PET), time-of-flight (TOF) information localizes source positions along lines of response. Cherenkov-radiator-integrated microchannel-plate photomultiplier tubes have achieved 30 ps TOF resolution, demonstrating cross-sectional imaging without reconstruction. Such ultrafast TOF detectors would free PET from conventional ring geometries. Therefore, this study aimed at investigating imaging characteristics of a dual-panel PET with ultrafast TOF detectors using Geant4 simulation. Two detector panels ($142 \times 142~mm^2$), which consisted of 5.0 mm-thick bismuth germanate pixelized crystals with a 5.75 mm pitch, were placed face-to-face at a 300 mm distance. Spatial resolution and image noise with various TOF resolutions from 30 to 90 ps were evaluated. Because degraded efficiency may cancel TOF gain in image quality, detection efficiency was also parameterized by reducing coincidence counts. A numerical phantom, which consisted of multi-rod and uniform cylindrical activities (21 MBq in total), was simulated for 600 s. Regarding image reconstruction, results of a backprojection (i.e., no reconstruction) were compared with those of the maximum likelihood expectation maximization (MLEM). The dual-panel PET required a 40 ps TOF resolution to have a similar spatial resolution to that of a non-TOF ring PET (300 mm in diameter) for the same detection efficiency. The TOF resolution should be 30 ps with half the efficiency to maintain a similar image noise to that of the 40 ps TOF with complete efficiency. MLEM provided better imaging performance than backprojection, even at 30 ps TOF. The feasibility of the proposed dual-panel PET with ultrafast TOF detectors was shown.</description>

      <title>An Adaptive Proton FLASH Therapy Using Modularized Pin Ridge Filter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we proposed a method to optimize adaptive proton FLASH therapy (ADP FLASH) using modularized pin ridge filters (pRFs) by recycling module pins from the initial plan while reducing pRF adjustments in adaptive FLASH planning. Initially, single energy (250 MeV) FLASH pRF plans were created using pencil beam directions (PBDs) from initial IMPT plans on the planning CT (pCT). PBDs are classified as new/changed ($\Delta$E &gt; &gt; 5 MeV) or unchanged by comparing spot maps for targets between pCT and re-CT. We used an iterative least square regression model to identify recyclable PBDs with minimal relative changes to spot MU weighting. Two PBDs with the least square error were retrieved per iteration and added to the background plan, and the remaining PBDs were reoptimized for the adaptive plan in subsequent iterations. The method was validated on three liver SBRT cases (50 Gy in 5 fractions) by comparing various dosimetric parameters across initial pRF plans on pCT, reCT and the ADP FLASH pRF plans on reCT. V100 for initial pRF plans on pCT, reCT, and ADP FLASH pRF plans for the three cases were as follows: (93.7%, 89.2%, 91.4%), (93.5%, 60.2%, 91.7%), (97.3%, 69.9%, 98.8%). We observe a decline in plan quality when applying the initial pRF to the reCT, whereas the ADP FLASH pRF approach restores quality comparable to the initial pRF on the pCT. FLASH effect of the initial pRF and ADP pRF plans were evaluated with a dose and dose rate threshold of 1Gy and 40Gy/s, respectively, using the FLASH effectiveness model. The proposed method recycled 91.2%, 71%, and 64.7% of PBDs from initial pRF plans for the three cases while maintaining all clinical goals and preserving FLASH effects across all cases.</description>

      <title>Proposal and Evaluation of a Practical CBCT Dose Optimization Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective: To propose a CBCT dose optimization method using readily available measurement equipment in radiation oncology departments.
  Approach: A 0.6cc air kerma (Kair) calibrated Farmer chamber measured Kair at isocenter for five default CBCT protocols (HEAD, PELVIS, LARGE PELVIS, THORAX, SPOTLIGHT) on a Varian TrueBeam linac. Imaging parameters were modified to reduce cumulative exposure by reducing projections (by 25%, 50%, 75%) in FDK reconstruction, or lowering single frame exposure by 25%, 50%, 70 to 75%. Cone Beam Dose Index (CBDI) and weighted CBDI (CBDI_w) were measured in CTDI phantoms to correlate with Kair. Image quality was assessed quantitatively (HU linearity, uniformity, low-contrast visibility, high-contrast resolution, spatial integrity) using Catphan604, and qualitatively via anthropomorphic phantoms.
  Results: A linear relationship between Kair, CTDI, and CBDI_w was established. High-contrast resolution and spatial integrity were unaffected by dose reduction (R &lt; 0.5), while low-contrast visibility strongly correlated with exposure (R &gt; 0.75). HU uniformity and linearity remained stable (&lt;40 HU deviation), except for LARGE PELVIS at &lt;50% single-frame exposure. 80 to 50% dose reduction retained clinically acceptable image quality with minimal artifacts or noise.
  Significance: CBCT protocols on TrueBeam linacs were optimized for dose reduction. The method enables easy implementation by radiotherapy physicists without diagnostic physics equipment or expertise.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Proton Delivery with Pin Ridge Filters (pRFs): A Novel Approach for Motion Management in Proton Therapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active breath-hold techniques effectively mitigate respiratory motion but pose challenges for patients who are ineligible for the procedure. Conventional treatment planning relies on multiple energy layers, extending delivery time due to slow layer switching. We propose to use pin ridge filters (pRFs), initially developed for FLASH radiotherapy, to construct a single energy beam plan and minimize dose delivery time. The conventional ITV--based free--breathing treatment plan served as the reference. A GTV--based IMPT--DS plan with a downstream energy modulation strategy was developed based on a new beam model that was commissioned using the maximum energy of the IMPT plan. Consequently, a nested iterative pencil beam direction (PBD) spot reduction process removed low--weighted spots along each PBD, generating pRFs with coarser resolution. Finally, the IMPT--DS plan was then converted into an IMPT--pRF plan, using a monoenergetic beam with optimized spot positions and weights. This approach was validated on lung and liver SBRT cases (10 Gy RBE x 5). For the lung case, the mean lung--GTV dose decreased from 10.3 Gy to 6.9 Gy, with delivery time reduced from 188.79 to 36.16 seconds. The largest time reduction was at 150{\deg}, from 47.4 to 3.99 seconds. For the liver case, the mean liver--GTV dose decreased from 5.7 Gy to 3.8 Gy, with delivery time reduced from 111.13 to 30.54 seconds. The largest time reduction was at 180{\deg}, from 38.57 to 3.94 seconds. This method significantly reduces dose delivery time and organ at risk dose. Further analysis is needed to validate its clinical feasibility.</description>

      <title>A two-stage dual-task learning strategy for early prediction of pathological complete response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer using dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rationale and Objectives: Early prediction of pathological complete response (pCR) can facilitate personalized treatment for breast cancer patients. To improve prediction accuracy at the early time point of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, we proposed a two-stage dual-task learning strategy to train a deep neural network for early prediction of pCR using early-treatment magnetic resonance images. Methods: We developed and validated the two-stage dual-task learning strategy using the dataset from the national-wide, multi-institutional I-SPY2 clinical trial, which included dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance images acquired at three time points: pretreatment (T0), after 3 weeks (T1), and after 12 weeks of treatment (T2). First, we trained a convolutional long short-term memory network to predict pCR and extract the latent space image features at T2. At the second stage, we trained a dual-task network to simultaneously predict pCR and the image features at T2 using images from T0 and T1. This allowed us to predict pCR earlier without using images from T2. Results: The conventional single-stage single-task strategy gave an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.799 for pCR prediction using all the data at time points T0 and T1. By using the proposed two-stage dual-task learning strategy, the AUROC was improved to 0.820. Conclusions: The proposed two-stage dual-task learning strategy can improve model performance significantly (p=0.0025) for predicting pCR at the early stage (3rd week) of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The early prediction model can potentially help physicians to intervene early and develop personalized plans at the early stage of chemotherapy.</description>

      <title>Actor Critic with Experience Replay-based automatic treatment planning for prostate cancer intensity modulated radiotherapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background: Real-time treatment planning in IMRT is challenging due to complex beam interactions. AI has improved automation, but existing models require large, high-quality datasets and lack universal applicability. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) offers a promising alternative by mimicking human trial-and-error planning.
  Purpose: Develop a stochastic policy-based DRL agent for automatic treatment planning with efficient training, broad applicability, and robustness against adversarial attacks using Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM).
  Methods: Using the Actor-Critic with Experience Replay (ACER) architecture, the agent tunes treatment planning parameters (TPPs) in inverse planning. Training is based on prostate cancer IMRT cases, using dose-volume histograms (DVHs) as input. The model is trained on a single patient case, validated on two independent cases, and tested on 300+ plans across three datasets. Plan quality is assessed using ProKnow scores, and robustness is tested against adversarial attacks.
  Results: Despite training on a single case, the model generalizes well. Before ACER-based planning, the mean plan score was 6.20$\pm$1.84; after, 93.09% of cases achieved a perfect score of 9, with a mean of 8.93$\pm$0.27. The agent effectively prioritizes optimal TPP tuning and remains robust against adversarial attacks.
  Conclusions: The ACER-based DRL agent enables efficient, high-quality treatment planning in prostate cancer IMRT, demonstrating strong generalizability and robustness.</description>

      <title>On Overlap Ratio in Defocused Electron Ptychography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Four-dimensional Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (4D STEM) with data acquired using a defocused electron probe is a promising tool for characterising complex biological specimens and materials through a phase retrieval process known as Electron Ptychography (EP). The efficacy of 4D STEM acquisition and the resulting quality of EP reconstruction depends on the overlap ratio of adjacent illuminated areas. This paper demonstrates how the overlap ratio impacts the data redundancy and the quality of the EP reconstruction. We define two quantities as a function of the overlap ratio that are independent of both the object and the EP algorithm. Subsequently, we evaluate an EP algorithm for varying overlap ratios using simulated 4D STEM datasets. Notably, a 40% or greater overlap ratio yields stable, high-quality reconstructions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.00110v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultrasonography is a vital component of modern clinical care, with handheld probes routinely used for diagnostic imaging and procedural guidance. However, handheld ultrasound imaging is limited by factors such as the partial-cross-sectional field of view, operator dependency, contact-induced distortion, and lack of transmission contrast. Here, we demonstrate a new system enabling whole cross-sectional ultrasound tomography of humans in reflection and transmission modes. We generate 2D images of the entire in vivo human cross-section with uniform in-plane resolution using a custom 512-element circular ultrasound receiver array and a rotating ultrasonic transmitter. We demonstrate this technique in regions such as the abdomen and legs in healthy volunteers. To address unmet clinical needs, we explore two key applications. First, we readily observe abdominal adipose distributions in our images, enabling adipose thickness assessment over the body without ionizing radiation or mechanical deformation. Second, we demonstrate an approach for video-rate (30 frame-per-second) biopsy needle localization with respect to internal tissue features. These capabilities make whole cross-sectional ultrasound tomography a potential practical tool for clinical needs not currently met by other modalities.</description>

      <title>Model-Based Perfusion Reconstruction with Time Separation Technique in Cone-Beam CT Dynamic Liver Perfusion Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16450v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The success of embolisation, a minimally invasive treatment of liver cancer, could be evaluated in the operational room with cone-beam CT by acquiring a dynamic perfusion scan. The reconstruction algorithm must address the issues of low temporal sampling and higher noise levels inherent in cone-beam CT systems, compared to conventional CT. Therefore, a model-based perfusion reconstruction based on the time separation technique (TST) was applied. TST uses basis functions to model time attenuation curves. These functions are either analytical or based on prior knowledge, extracted using singular value decomposition from CT perfusion data. To explore how well the prior knowledge can model perfusion dynamics and what the potential limitations are, the dynamic CBCT perfusion scan was simulated under different noise levels. The TST method was compared to static reconstruction. It was demonstrated that a set consisting of only four basis functions results in perfusion maps that preserve relevant information, denoises the data, and outperforms static reconstruction under higher noise levels. TST with prior knowledge would not only outperform static reconstruction, but also the TST with analytical basis functions. Furthermore, it has been shown that only eight CBCT rotations, unlike previously assumed ten, are sufficient to obtain the perfusion maps comparable to the reference CT perfusion maps. This contributes to saving dose and reconstruction time. The real dynamic CBCT perfusion scan, reconstructed under the same conditions as the simulated scan, shows potential for maintaining the accuracy of the perfusion maps. By visual inspection, the embolised region was matching to that in corresponding CT perfusion maps. Further analysis of a larger cohort of patient data is needed to draw final conclusions regarding the expected advantages of the time separation technique.</description>

      <title>Joint Reconstruction of the Activity and the Attenuation in PET by Diffusion Posterior Sampling: a Feasibility Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11776v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study introduces a novel framework for joint reconstruction of the activity and the attenuation (JRAA) in positron emission tomography (PET) using diffusion posterior sampling (DPS). By leveraging diffusion models (DMs), this approach directly addresses activity-attenuation dependencies, mitigating crosstalk issues prevalent in non-time-of-flight (TOF) settings. Experimental evaluations, conducted using 2-dimensional (2-D) XCAT phantom data, demonstrate that DPS significantly outperforms traditional maximum likelihood activity and attenuation (MLAA) methods, producing consistent and high-quality reconstructions even in the absence of TOF information. Ongoing work aims to extend our method to real 3-dimensional (3-D) data with encouraging preliminary findings.</description>

      <title>Solving Blind Inverse Problems: Adaptive Diffusion Models for Motion-corrected Sparse-view 4DCT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12249v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Four-dimensional computed tomography (4DCT) is essential for medical imaging applications like radiotherapy, which demand precise respiratory motion representation. Traditional methods for reconstructing 4DCT data suffer from artifacts and noise, especially in sparse-view, low-dose contexts. Motion-corrected (MC) reconstruction is a blind inverse problem that we propose to solve with a novel diffusion model (DM) framework that calibrates an adaptive unknown forward model for motion correction. Furthermore, we used a wavelet diffusion model (WDM) to address computational cost and memory usage. By leveraging the prior probability distribution function (PDF) from the DMs, we enhance the joint reconstruction and motion estimation (JRM) process, improving image quality and preserving resolution. Experiments on extended cardiac-torso (XCAT) phantom data demonstrate that our method outperforms existing techniques, yielding artifact-free, high-resolution reconstructions even under irregular breathing conditions. These results showcase the potential of combining DMs with motion correction to advance sparse-view 4DCT imaging.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for learned synergistic reconstruction of medical images using multibranch generative models. Leveraging variational autoencoders (VAEs), our model learns from pairs of images simultaneously, enabling effective denoising and reconstruction. Synergistic image reconstruction is achieved by incorporating the trained models in a regularizer that evaluates the distance between the images and the model. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on both Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) and positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) datasets, showcasing improved image quality for low-dose imaging. Despite challenges such as patch decomposition and model limitations, our results underscore the potential of generative models for enhancing medical imaging reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Advancing MRI Reconstruction: A Systematic Review of Deep Learning and Compressed Sensing Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14158</link>

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a non-invasive imaging modality and provides comprehensive anatomical and functional insights into the human body. However, its long acquisition times can lead to patient discomfort, motion artifacts, and limiting real-time applications. To address these challenges, strategies such as parallel imaging have been applied, which utilize multiple receiver coils to speed up the data acquisition process. Additionally, compressed sensing (CS) is a method that facilitates image reconstruction from sparse data, significantly reducing image acquisition time by minimizing the amount of data collection needed. Recently, deep learning (DL) has emerged as a powerful tool for improving MRI reconstruction. It has been integrated with parallel imaging and CS principles to achieve faster and more accurate MRI reconstructions. This review comprehensively examines DL-based techniques for MRI reconstruction. We categorize and discuss various DL-based methods, including end-to-end approaches, unrolled optimization, and federated learning, highlighting their potential benefits. Our systematic review highlights significant contributions and underscores the potential of DL in MRI reconstruction. Additionally, we summarize key results and trends in DL-based MRI reconstruction, including quantitative metrics, the dataset, acceleration factors, and the progress of and research interest in DL techniques over time. Finally, we discuss potential future directions and the importance of DL-based MRI reconstruction in advancing medical imaging. To facilitate further research in this area, we provide a GitHub repository that includes up-to-date DL-based MRI reconstruction publications and public datasets-https://github.com/mosaf/Awesome-DL-based-CS-MRI.</description>
