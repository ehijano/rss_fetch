      <title>A program for 3D nuclear static and time-dependent density-functional theory with full Skyrme energy density functional: HIT3D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a computer program that performs symmetry-unrestricted 3D nuclear time-dependent density function theory (DFT) calculations. The program features the augmented Lagrangian constraint in the static calculation. This allows for the calculation of the potential energy surface. In addition, the code includes the full energy density functionals derived from the Skyrme interaction, meaning that the time-even and time-odd tensor parts are included for the time-dependent calculations. The results of the hit3d code are carefully compared with the Sky3D and Ev8 programs. The testing cases include unconstrained DFT calculations for doubly magic nuclei, the constrained DFT + BCS calculations for medium-heavy nucleus 110Mo, and the dynamic applications for harmonic vibration and nuclear reactions.</description>

      <title>The structure of the f_0(980) from system size dependent hadronic resonance ratios in p+p, p+Pb, and Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is shown that the hadronic phase in ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions can be used to understand the properties of the $f_0(980)$ resonance. In particular it is shown that the centrality dependence of the $f_0(980)/\pi$ and $f_0(980)/\phi$ ratios depends strongly on the $f_0(980)\rightarrow \overline{K}+K$ branching ratio and whether the $f_0(980)$ is produced as a $\left | \overline{q}q \right \rangle$ or $\left | \overline{s}s \right \rangle$ state. These conclusions are drawn from calculations within the partial chemical equilibrium of the HRG model within Thermal-FIST as well as with the fully non-equilibrium hybrid-transport approach UrQMD. Our findings show how the hadronic phase in heavy ion collisions can be used for studies of exotic hadron properties otherwise possible only in dedicated experiments such as PANDA.</description>

      <title>Compositeness of near-threshold $s$-wave resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The near-threshold clustering phenomenon is well understood by the low-energy universality, for shallow bound states below the threshold. Nevertheless, the characteristics of resonances slightly above the threshold still lack thorough elucidation. We introduce a novel probabilistic interpretation scheme for complex compositeness of resonances, in which the resonances with unphysically large decay widths are inherently excluded. Employing this scheme to analyze resonances via the effective range expansion, we demonstrate that near-threshold resonances have small composite fraction, in sharp contrast to shallow bound states below the threshold.</description>

      <title>An example of the convergence of hydrodynamics in strong external fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The AdS/CFT correspondence is used to provide an estimate of the radius of convergence of the linearized gradient expansion of the hydrodynamic description of $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM theory minimally coupled to $U(1)$ gauge theory subjected to strong magnetic fields. The results of this work demonstrate that the dispersion relations of hydrodynamic modes continue to converge for magnetic field strengths far beyond those values for which a hydrodynamic description is expected. For magnetic field strengths much larger then the temperature scale the bulk dual interpolates between AdS$_{4+1}$ and $\text{BTZ}_{2+1}\times \mathbb{R}^2$ and may be regarded as a renormalization group flow of the $3+1$ CFT dimensional theory to a $1+1$ CFT. In this regime, we clarify past literature on the QNM spectrum of bulk scalar fields by introducing a new way to classify the behavior of QNM collisions in the complex frequency and momentum plane.</description>

      <title>$J/\psi$ production within a jet in high-energy proton-proton and nucleus-nucleus collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Within the framework of leading power factorization formalism of nonrelativistic quantum chromodynamics, we calculate the jet fragmentation function for $J/\psi$ production in proton-proton (pp) collisions ranging from $\sqrt{s}=500$ GeV to $13$ TeV. The reasonable agreements between theory and experimental data indicate that $J/\psi$ production within a jet is mainly dominated by gluon fragmentation. Such a mechanism can be further tested by the predicted jet transverse momentum and radius dependence of jet fragmentation function. Based on the satisfying description of pp baseline, we carry out the first theoretical investigation on medium modification on $J/\psi$ production within jet in heavy-ion collisions at the Large Hadron Collider, using a linear Boltzmann transport model combined with hydrodynamics for the simulation of jet-medium interaction. The consistency with the experimental measurement on nuclear modification factor $R_{\text{AA}}$ by CMS collaboration reveals that the gluon jet quenching is the driving force for the suppression of $J/\psi$ production in jet. Furthermore, we make predictions for the dependence of $R_{\text{AA}}$ on the jet transverse momentum and jet radius $R$, which can be tested in future measurements to further constrain the flavor dependence of jet quenching.</description>

      <title>Extraction of trans-helicity worm-gear distributions and opportunities at the Electron-Ion Collider in China</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a global analysis of the trans-helicity worm-gear distribution function, $g_{1T}^\perp$, by fitting the longitudinal-transverse double spin asymmetry data of the semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering. The analysis is performed within the framework of transverse momentum dependent factorization and evolution. It is found that the $u$-quark favors a positive distribution and the $d$-quark favors a negative distribution, which is consistent with previous model calculations and phenomenological extractions. Based on the fit to existing world data, we also study the impact of the proposed electron-ion collider in China and conclude that it can significantly improve the precision of the worm-gear distribution function and hence enhance our understanding of nucleon spin structures.</description>

      <title>Nuclear structure study of $^{20-23}$Na isotopes with ab initio no-core shell-model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17893v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have done a systematic no-core shell-model study of $^{20-23}$Na isotopes. The low-energy spectra of these sodium isotopes consisting of natural and un-natural parity states were reported, considering three realistic interactions: inside nonlocal outside Yukawa (INOY), charge-dependent Bonn 2000 (CDB2K), and the chiral next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (N$^3$LO). We also present the mirror energy differences in the low-energy spectra of $|T_z|$ = 1/2 mirror pair ($^{21}$Na - $^{21}$Ne). Apart from the energy spectra, we have also reported the electromagnetic transition strengths and moments. Finally, considering all three realistic interactions, we report the point-proton radii and neutron skin thicknesses.</description>

      <title>Relativistic second-order dissipative and anisotropic fluid dynamics in the relaxation-time approximation for an ideal gas of massive particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00351v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study all transport coefficients of second-order dissipative fluid dynamics derived by V. E. Ambrus et al. [Phys. Rev. D 106, 076005 (2022)] from the relativistic Boltzmann equation in the relaxation-time approximation for the collision integral. These transport coefficients are computed for a classical ideal gas of massive particles, with and without taking into account the conservation of intrinsic quantum numbers. Through rigorous comparison between kinetic theory, second-order dissipative fluid dynamics, and leading-order anisotropic fluid dynamics for a (0+1)--dimensional boost-invariant flow scenario, we show that both fluid-dynamical theories describe the early far-from-equilibrium stage of the expansion reasonably well.</description>

      <title>The $GW$ Approximation: A Quantum Chemistry Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05351v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide an in-depth examination of the $GW$ approximation of Green's function many-body perturbation theory by detailing both its theoretical and practical aspects in the realm of quantum chemistry. First, the quasiparticle context is introduced before delving into the derivation of Hedin's equations. From these, we explain how to derive the well-known $GW$ approximation of the self-energy. In a second time, we meticulously explain each step involved in a $GW$ calculation and what type of physical quantities can be computed. To illustrate its versatility, we consider two contrasting systems: the water molecule, a weakly correlated system, and the carbon dimer, a strongly correlated system. Each stage of the process is thoroughly detailed and explained alongside numerical results and illustrative plots. We hope that the contribution will facilitate the dissemination and democratization of Green's function-based formalisms within the computational and theoretical quantum chemistry community.</description>
