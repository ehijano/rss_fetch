      <title>Listening For New Physics With Quantum Acoustics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel application of a qubit-coupled phonon detector to search for new physics, e.g., ultralight dark matter (DM) and high-frequency gravitational waves. The detector, motivated by recent advances in quantum acoustics, is composed of superconducting transmon qubits coupled to high-overtone bulk acoustic resonators ($h$BARs) and operates in the GHz - 10 GHz frequency range. New physics can excite $O(10 \, \mu \text{eV})$ phonons within the $h$BAR, which are then converted to qubit excitations via a transducer. We detail the design, operation, backgrounds, and expected sensitivity of a prototype detector, as well as a next-generation detector optimized for new physics signals. We find that a future detector can complement current haloscope experiments in the search for both dark photon DM and high-frequency gravitational waves. Lastly we comment on such a detector's ability to operate as a $10 \, \mu\text{eV}$ threshold athermal phonon sensor for sub-GeV DM detection.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first complete two-loop calculation of the electric dipole moment of the electron, as well as the rates of the lepton-flavor violating decays $\mu \to e + \gamma$ and $\tau \to e/\mu + \gamma$, in the unconstrained two-Higgs doublet model. We include the most generic Yukawa interactions of the Higgs doublets with the Standard Model fermions up to quadratic order, and allow for generic phases in the Higgs potential.</description>

      <title>Supernova bounds on new scalars from resonant and soft emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study supernova cooling constraints on new light scalars that mix with the Higgs, couple only to nucleons, or couple only to leptons. We show that in all these cases scalars with masses smaller than the plasma frequency in the supernova core are efficiently produced by resonant mixing with the in-medium longitudinal degree of freedom of the photon. The resulting bounds are free from uncertainties associated to the rate of emission of the scalar in nucleon-nucleon scatterings, which would otherwise badly affect the Higgs-mixed and nucleophilic scenarios. Heavier scalars that mix with the Higgs or couple only to nucleons are mostly produced by nucleon bremsstrahlung, and we obtain a conservative approximation for the corresponding rate using a soft theorem. We also analyse the impact of different supernova profiles, nucleon degeneracy, trapping and scalar decays on the constraints.</description>

      <title>Analysis of identified-hadron spectra from fixed-target $\bf p$-A collisions and the nature of the Cronin effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study fixed-target spectra obtained by the Chicago-Princeton (C-P) collaboration at Fermilab in the mid seventies are analyzed with a two-component spectrum model (TCM) that has been applied successfully to a number of collision systems at the RHIC and LHC in the past. It is from C-P data that the Cronin effect was first inferred. TCM analysis leads to factorization of collision-energy and target A dependences. Over the energy range of C-P data energy dependence is restricted to model-function shapes on $p_t$ whereas A dependence is restricted to particle densities for three hadron species and their antiparticles. A dependence for soft and hard components varying separately as power laws $A^{\alpha_s}$ and $A^{\alpha_h}$ with fixed exponents is a central finding of this study. The trends $A^{\alpha(p_t)}$ inferred by the C-P collaboration resulted from treating spectra as monolithic which confuses the distinct $p_t$ (model functions) and A (particle densities) dependences. The Cronin effect resulting from that confusion is easily explained in a TCM context. Power-law trends for pions at 25 GeV are quantitatively compatible with trends at LHC energies. The relation of exponents $a_s$ and $a_h$ to $p$-A centrality is examined in detail. A Glauber model of $p$-A centrality seems invalid.</description>

      <title>Study on Theoretical Derivations in CP Violation of Bottom Hadrons' Weak Decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the phenomenon of CP violation in the weak decay of bottom hadrons (B mesons) through comprehensive theoretical analysis and mathematical derivations. We analyze the fundamental mechanisms of B meson decay, emphasizing the interplay between CP symmetry breaking and the contributions from the quark level. By examining the role of the weak Hamiltonian, we reveal the significance of both short-range and long-range interactions in the decay process. Our theoretical framework highlights the close relationship between differential decay distributions and CP violation, providing a robust foundation for understanding CP violation phenomena in B meson decays. We discuss the implications of our findings for future research, particularly the necessity of improving the precision of CP violation measurements to validate existing theoretical models and explore potential new physics. Through a combination of mathematical derivations and theoretical insights, this study aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of the matter-antimatter asymmetry problem in particle physics.</description>

      <title>Exploring Particle Production and Thermal-Like Behavior through Quantum Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies have shown a potential correlation between the entanglement of initial state partons in elementary particle collisions, as conceptualized by contemporary quantum and particle theory, and the final state multiplicity distribution of hadrons produced in experiments like those at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). It has been proposed that this relation between states can be demonstrated in a measurement of entropy. By showing equality between entanglement entropy in the initial state and thermodynamic entropy in the final state, we hope to demonstrate that not only is entanglement the driving mechanism behind matter generation, but also the thermal-like behavior seen in high energy particle collisions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a brief overview on the theory and phenomenology of generalized parton distributions (GPDs), including the recently developed framework of single-diffractive hard exclusive process for matching GPDs to experimental observables. We concentrate on the extraction of GPDs from experimental processes, especially on the challenges and potential solutions regarding the separation of different GPDs and the extraction of $x$-dependence of GPDs, which is critically important for constructing the tomographic images and matching the $x$-moments of GPDs to various emergent hadron properties.</description>

      <title>Polarization study of the P-wave charmonium radiative decay into a light vector meson at $e^{+}e^{-}$ collider experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, a formalism is presented for the helicity amplitude analysis of the decays $\psi(2S) \to \gamma_1 \chi_{cJ},~ \chi_{cJ} \to \gamma_2 V (V=\rho^0,~\phi,~\omega)$~(the subscript 1,2 is used to distinguish the two radiative photons), and the polarization expressions of the P-wave charmonia $\chi_{cJ}$ and the vector mesons $\rho^0, \phi, \omega$ for experimental measurements at Electron-Positron Collider. In addition, we derive the formulae of the angular distributions of the $\chi_{c1,2} \to \gamma V$ to extract the degree of transverse polarization $P_T$ of $e^+ e^-$ pairs with symmetric beam energy as well as the ratios of two helicity amplitudes $x$ (in $\chi_{c1}$ decays) and $x,~y$ (in $\chi_{c2}$ decays) representing the relative magnitudes of transverse to longitudinal polarization amplitude, and validate it by performing the Monte Carlo simulation. Finally, the statistical sensitivity of $P_T$, $x$ and $y$ are estimated based on the large $\psi(2S)$ data samples collected at the current and proposed future $e^+e^-$ collider experiment.</description>

      <title>A step towards estimation of the neutral-hadron size: the gravitational mass radius of pi0 meson in a relativistic theory of composite particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend our nonperturbative essentially relativistic approach, elaborated previously, to perform an estimation of the size of pi0 meson. We present detailed argumentation for choosing the mass mean square radius (MSR) for this purpose. Its value calculated in our approach, using three model quark-antiquark wave functions in pion, is (0.5-0.53) fm. The neutral-pion electromagnetic form factor is zero in accordance with the charge-conjugation symmetry. We demonstrate ambiguities encountered when using standard definitions of mechanical MSR for the size. We discuss MSRs obtained in various approaches and their comparison with each other and with our results.</description>

      <title>Laser induced Compton Scattering to Dark Photon or Axion-like Particle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The laser of an intense electromagnetic field provides an important tool to study the strong-field particle physics. The nonlinear Compton scattering was observed in the collision of an ultra-relativistic electron beam with a laser pulse in 1990s. The precision measurement of the nonlinear Compton scattering shines the light on the studies of strong-field QED and nonlinear effects in QED. In this work, we propose to produce new massive particles through the nonlinear Compton scattering in the presence of a high intense laser field. We take dark photon or axion-like particle as illustrative new particle. Compared with other collider and beam dump experiments, the laser induced process provides a complementary and competitive search of new invisible particles lighter than 1 MeV.</description>

      <title>New Physics Off the $Z$-Pole: $e^+ e^- \rightarrow f \bar f$ at Future Lepton Colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the prospects for probing new physics (NP) beyond the Standard Model (SM) at future lepton colliders through precision measurements of $e^+e^-\to f{\bar f}$ observables off the $Z$ resonance. We consider interference between SM contributions and those arising from dimension-6, four-fermion effective operators that encode the effects of NP, yielding a linear dependence on the latter. This linear dependence in general increases with magnitude of the collision energy offset from the $Z$ pole. We consider a variety of asymmetries in order to enhance the NP-sensitivity while reducing experimental systematic and theoretical, SM uncertainties: an inclusive above and below $Z$-resonance total cross section asymmetry ($A_\sigma$) as well as the conventional forward-backward ($A_{\rm FB}$) and polarization ($A_{\rm pol}$) asymmetries. Based on projected statistical uncertainties at the Circular Electron-Positron Collider (CEPC), we find that t measurement of $A_\sigma$ could extend the sensitivity to the NP mass scale by as much as a factor of $\sim 7$ compared to the present reach obtained with the CERN Large Electron Positron Collider. Inclusion of projected systematic theoretical SM uncertainties substantially reduce this sensitivity gain. For $A_{\rm FB}$, inclusion of experimental systematic uncertainties has a marginal impact on the gain in NP reach, whereas SM theoretical uncertainties remain a significant barrier to realizing the full NP sensitivity. Analogous conclusions apply to the CERN Future Circular Collider (FCC-ee) and International Linear Collider (ILC).</description>

      <title>Exclusive $c \to u \gamma$ transitions of $B_c$ meson</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the rare decays of the $B_c$ meson induced by the flavour changing neutral current $c \to u \gamma$ transition. In the Standard Model they are strongly suppressed by the Glashow-Iliopoulos-Maiani mechanism, therefore they are sensitive to new physics. The difficulty is to get rid of long-distance contributions. We study such effects in radiative $B_c$ transitions both to $B^*$ and to the axial-vector $B_1^{\prime}$ meson.</description>

      <title>Attenuation of Boosted Dark Matter in Two Component Dark Matter Scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Boosted dark matter constitutes a small fraction of the total dark matter in the universe, with mass ranging from eV to MeV and often exhibiting (semi)relativistic velocity. Hence the likelihood of detecting boosted dark matter in earth-based direct detection experiments is relatively high. There is more than one explanation for the origin of the boosted dark matter(subdominant) including the two-component dark matter models where the heavier dark matter species(dominant) annihilates to nearly monoenergetic light dark matter particles in the galactic halo. If the dominant dark matter species is heavier (MeV-GeV), the subdominant light dark matter achieves very high velocity. These boosted dark matter particles suffer from elastic scattering with electrons and nuclei while crossing the atmosphere and the earth's crust before reaching underground experiments and hence the kinetic energy of the dark matter is attenuated. In the two component dark matter scenario, we show that the boost of the dark matter, kinetic energy and its attenuation highly depend on the dark matter masses. We perform a detailed study of the attenuation of boosted dark matter as a function of the DM-nucleus (without/with form factor) and DM-electron cross sections. For a 10 MeV dark matter with boost $\sim$ 10-100, the effect of DM-electron scattering is found to be severe than the DM-nucleus scattering (with form factor) for scattering cross sections $\sim 10^{-29}$cm$^2$. We also found that the attenuation of the kinetic energy results in a shift in the peak position of the boosted dark matter flux.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a simple modification of space-based gravitational wave (GW) detector optical benches which would enable the measurement of vacuum birefringence of light induced by axion dark matterthrough its coupling to electromagnetism. While marginally affecting the sensitivity to GW by a factor $\sqrt{2}$, we show that such an adjustment would make future detectors such as LISA, TianQin, Taiji and Big-Bang Observer the most sensitive experiments at low axion masses</description>

      <title>The electromagnetic pion form factor and its phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we employ a dispersion relation that allows to recover the electromagnetic form factor of the pion from its modulus along the unitarity cut. Unlike the standard dispersive approach, this method extends in a straightforward manner above the inelastic region, allowing us to obtain the form factor's phase, as well as its real and imaginary parts. As applications, we extract the $P$-wave $\pi\pi$ phase shift, the octet form factor, derive bounds in the spacelike region, and offer insights into the onset of perturbative QCD.</description>

      <title>Dynamical understanding of the first measurement of (anti)hyperon-nucleon scattering from BESIII</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Focusing on the recent measurements of the scattering processes $\bar{\Lambda} p \rightarrow \bar{\Lambda} p$ and $\Lambda p \rightarrow \Lambda p$ reported by BESIII, we offer a dynamical interpretation of the differences in the measured total and differential cross sections for both processes. This discrepancy arises because the $u$-channel contribution is forbidden for $\bar{\Lambda} p \rightarrow \bar{\Lambda} p$ but allowed for $\Lambda p \rightarrow \Lambda p$. Additionally, we examine the enhancement effect in the forward angle region of the differential cross section for $\bar{\Lambda} p$ elastic scattering, attributed to the $t$-channel contribution. This work serves as a test to the scattering mechanism involved in these reactions.</description>

      <title>Probing Light Scalars and Vector-like Quarks at the High-Luminosity LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A model based on a $U(1)_{T^3_R}$ extension of the Standard Model can address the mass hierarchy between generations of fermions, explain thermal dark matter abundance, and the muon $g - 2$, $R_{(D)}$, and $R_{(D^*)}$ anomalies. The model contains a light scalar boson $\phi'$ and a heavy vector-like quark $\chi_\mathrm{u}$ that can be probed at CERN's Large Hadron Collider (LHC). We perform a phenomenology study on the production of $\phi'$ and ${\chi}_u$ particles from proton-proton $(\mathrm{pp})$ collisions at the LHC at $\sqrt{s}=13.6$ TeV, primarily through $g{-g}$ and $t{-\chi_\mathrm{u}}$ fusion. We work under an effective field theory approach, in which the $\chi_\mathrm{u}$ and $\phi'$ masses are free parameters. We perform a phenomenological analysis considering $\chi_\mathrm{u}$ final states to b-quarks, muons, and neutrinos, and $\phi'$ decays to $\mu^+\mu^-$. A machine learning algorithm is used to maximize the signal sensitivity, considering an integrated luminosity of $3000$ $\textrm{fb}^{-1}$. The proposed methodology can be a key mode for discovery over a large mass range, including low masses, traditionally considered difficult due to experimental constraints.</description>

      <title>Vortical effects and the critical end point in the Linear Sigma Model coupled to quark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the effects of vorticity on the QCD phase transition using the Linear Sigma Model coupled to quarks. By going beyond the mean-field approximation and incorporating screening effects via ring diagrams, we explore the chiral symmetry restoration in extreme conditions, such as high temperatures, high densities, and large angular velocities. Our analysis reveals how the critical temperature decreases as the angular velocity increases, suggesting that vorticity catalyzes the symmetry restoration. Additionally, we observe a shift in the Critical End Point (CEP) in the effective QCD phase diagram, where higher angular velocities move the CEP to lower quark chemical potentials and higher temperatures. Moreover, we analyze the baryon number fluctuations through the normalized fourth moment $\kappa \sigma^2 = c_4/c_2$ as a function of the collision energy in heavy-ion reactions $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$, which serves as a key observable to identify the CEP. Our study reveals that for high collision energies, $\kappa \sigma^2$ remains nearly constant; however, as the system approaches the CEP, the ratio increases sharply, indicating the proximity of the critical region. This rise is influenced by the presence of vorticity, which causes the CEP to shift to higher collision energies. These findings provide insight into the role of vorticity in heavy-ion collisions</description>

      <title>A Model-Independent Bound on Light Dark Photon Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a general and robust bound on dark photon dark matter with a mass acquired through the Higgs mechanism:$$m_{\gamma'}/(q_H e_H)\;\gg \;60\,{\rm eV}$$ where $m_{\gamma'}$ is the dark photon mass, $e_H$ is the gauge coupling, and $q_H$ is the charge of the dark Higgs boson. This bound arises from the requirement that the symmetry breaking occurs and the dark photon must acquire mass through the Higgs mechanism by the time of redshift $z \sim 10^6$ to form cold dark matter, independent of any specific production mechanism.</description>

      <title>A Novel Investigation of the ATOMKI Anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ATOMKI nuclear anomaly has suggested a new BSM (Beyond the Standard Model) boson with mass $\sim17$ MeV emitted from excited nuclei and quickly decays into a pair of $e^+e^-$. In order to search for the new particle, we propose a new approach that utilizes the ongoing Coherent CAPTAIN-Mills (CCM) 10-ton LAr (liquid argon) detectors. The neutrons from the Lujan target can scatter inelastically by the PMT glass in the CCM detector can produce the new boson which solves the ATOMKI anomaly. The new boson can be detected from its decay to a $e^+e^-$ pair. We find that CCM probe a large area of the anomaly allowed parameter space. We also show the prediction for a 100 ton LAr detector.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the Standard Model (SM) analysis of Ref. [1], which was limited to light leptons in the final state, to the semileptonic $B \to D^* \tau \nu_\tau$ decay. By using quantities that can be analised without the knowledge of $\vert V_{cb}\vert$, we derive important information about the helicity amplitudes and the hadronic form factors that can be compared with the predictions of lattice QCD calculations. In particular, there is a difficulty in reproducing simultaneously the experimental values of $R(D^*)$ and of other quantities relevant for the semitauonic decays within the SM. As a byproduct of our analysis, we also present a determination of $\vert V_{cb}\vert$ from the total decay rate.</description>

      <title>An improved Bell-CHSH observable for gauge boson pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For particles decaying without parity violation, it is impossible to reconstruct the full spin-density matrix from the velocities of their decay products. In this work, we consider Bell inequalities based on squares of spin operators. The corresponding Bell operators probe only the part of the density matrix that can be reconstructed from any gauge boson decay or splitting to fermions, which is accessible regardless of whether parity is violated. We find that our new choice of Bell operator has promising properties regarding states seen at colliders. In particular, it substantially outperforms the inequality previously used for the $pp \rightarrow ZZ$ process at the LHC in terms of the phase space volume in which it is violated. We also conduct the first investigation of Bell violation in a system involving gauge bosons mediating different interactions, namely the $W$ boson and gluon in the $pp \rightarrow W^{\pm} (g\rightarrow b\bar{b})$ process.</description>

      <title>Scaling density of axion strings in terasite simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on a study of axion string networks using fixed-grid simulations of up to $16384$ points per side. The length of string can be characterised in terms of standard dimensionless parameters $\zeta_\text{w}$ and $\zeta_\text{r}$, the length density measured in the cosmic rest frame and the string rest frame, scaled with the cosmic time. The motion of the string can be characterised by the root-mean-square (RMS) velocity of the string. Starting from a range of initial length densities and velocities, we analyse the string network in the standard scaling framework and find evolution towards a fixed point with estimated values $\hat{\zeta}_{\text{w},*} = 1.220(57)$ and $\hat{\zeta}_{\text{r},*} = 1.491(93)$. The two measures are related by the RMS velocity, which we estimate to be $\hat{v}_{*} = 0.5705(93)$. The length density is consistent with previous measurements, while the velocity is about 5% lower. For simulations starting from low enough density, the length density parameters $\zeta_\text{w}$ and $\zeta_\text{r}$ remain below their fixed point values throughout, while growing slowly, giving rise to an impression of approximately logarithmic increase with time. This has been proposed as the true long-term behaviour. We find that the growth tends to slow down as the values of $\zeta_\text{w}$ and $\zeta_\text{r}$ identified as fixed points are approached. In the case of $\zeta_\text{r}$, the growth stops for simulations which started close to the fixed point length density. The difference between $\zeta_\text{w}$ and $\zeta_\text{r}$ can be understood to result from the continuing velocity evolution. Our results indicate that the growth of $\zeta_\text{w}$ is a transient appearing at low densities and while the velocity is converging. This highlights the importance of studying the string density and the velocity together, and the preparation of initial conditions.</description>

      <title>Towards a Complete Treatment of Scalar-induced Gravitational Waves with Early Matter Domination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large curvature perturbations can source an observable amount of stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB). We consider several scenarios where small-scale curvature perturbations are naturally enhanced due to the presence of additional spectator fields during inflation. The same spectator fields can lead to a period of early matter domination (EMD) after inflation. We compute the inflationary spectrum of curvature perturbation and determine its evolution at later times, taking into account both the onset and the end of the EMD epoch, and also the impact of relative velocity perturbation between matter and radiation. The feature that the same field is responsible for both enhanced perturbations and the EMD era, leads to a predictive framework within which the full frequency dependence of SGWB can be computed. The SGWB can be observed in several detectors, including those focused on the nano-Hz regime. Our numerical framework can also be used to study other non-standard cosmological histories.</description>

      <title>Impact of relativistic waveforms in LISA's science objectives with extreme-mass-ratio inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extreme-Mass-Ratio Inspirals (EMRIs) are one of the key targets for future space-based gravitational wave detectors, such as LISA. The scientific potential of these sources can only be fully realized with fast and accurate waveform models. In this work, we extend the \textsc{FastEMRIWaveform} (\texttt{FEW}) framework by providing fully relativistic waveforms at adiabatic order for circular, equatorial orbits in Kerr spacetime, for mass ratios up to $10^{-3}$. We study the importance of including relativistic corrections in the waveform for both vacuum and non-vacuum environments. For EMRIs in vacuum, we find that non-relativistic waveforms can result in $\sim 35\%$ error in the predicted source's horizon redshift. By developing relativistic non-vacuum EMRI waveforms, we demonstrate significant improvements in detecting environmental effects. Our analysis shows that incorporating relativistic corrections enhances constraints on accretion disks, modeled through power-law torques, and improves the constraints on disk parameters (error $\sim6\%$), representing a significant improvement from previous estimates. We also estimated the evidence for models in a scenario where ignoring the accretion disk causes bias in parameter estimation (PE) and report a $\log_{10}$ Bayes factor of $1.1$ in favor of the accretion disk model. Additionally, in a fully relativistic setup, we estimate the parameters of superradiant scalar clouds with high accuracy, achieving errors below $5\%$ for the scalar cloud's mass and below $0.5\%$ for the ultralight field's mass. These results demonstrate that incorporating relativistic effects greatly enhances the accuracy and reliability of waveform predictions, essential for PE and model selection.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from burdened primordial black holes dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) are the natural candidate of dark matter (DM) as they only interact gravitationally and can evade any experiments on earth. In the standard semiclassical calculation of Hawking radiation, PBHs with mass below $10^{15}\rm g$ evaporated by now and therefore cannot be DM. However, the recently-discovered quantum memory burden effect can significantly suppress the evaporation of PBHs after the half-decay time. This quantum effect could open up a new mass window below $10^{10} \rm g$ where PBHs can still exist today and be DM. In this paper, we compute the gravitational wave (GW) signals associated with the formation of PBHs in this new mass window. We consider two formation scenarios: PBHs formed from inflationary perturbation and PBHs formed from collapse of Fermi-balls in a first-order phase transition (FOPT). GWs produced from these two scenarios have distinct features and, while the GW from inflation peaks at high frequency, the GW from FOPT peaks at lower frequency that can be within the reach of future experiments.</description>

Abstract: Starting from the running coupling in the gradient flow scheme, the QCD Lambda parameter $\Lambda_{\,\overline{\!\rm MS\!}\;}$ is determined analytically with respect to the reference scale $w_0$ in the pure gauge theory. A key element is the gluon condensate, which, being invariant under RG transformations, establishes a formal relationship between $\Lambda_{\,\overline{\!\rm MS\!}\;}$ and $w_0$. Good agreement with numerical estimates is found.</description>

      <title>Fermion Masses and Mixing in String-Inspired Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a class of supersymmetric Froggatt-Nielsen (FN) models with multiple $U(1)$ symmetries and Standard Model (SM) singlets inspired by heterotic string compactifications on Calabi-Yau threefolds. The string-theoretic origin imposes a particular charge pattern on the SM fields and FN singlets, dividing the latter into perturbative and non-perturbative types. Employing systematic and heuristic search strategies, such as genetic algorithms, we identify charge assignments and singlet VEVs that replicate the observed mass and mixing hierarchies in the quark sector, and subsequently refine the Yukawa matrix coefficients to accurately match the observed values for the Higgs VEV, the quark and charged lepton masses and the CKM matrix. This bottom-up approach complements top-down string constructions and our results demonstrate that string FN models possess a sufficiently rich structure to account for flavour physics. On the other hand, the limited number of distinct viable charge patterns identified here indicates that flavour physics imposes tight constraints on string theory models, adding new constraints on particle spectra that are essential for achieving a realistic phenomenology.</description>

Abstract: We derive a systematic perturbative expansion for the finite-volume energy spectrum of the non-linear $O(N)$ $\sigma$-model in the $\delta$-regime. The violation of the power-counting rules that emerges after the separation of the fast and slow modes is dealt with to all orders by use of the threshold expansion. The known result for the rest-frame energy spectrum up-to-and-including next-to-next-to-leading order is reproduced.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a geometric approach to determining the complete set of numerators giving rise to finite Feynman integrals. Our approach proceeds graph by graph, and makes use of the Newton polytope associated to the integral's Symanzik polynomials. It relies on a theorem by Berkesch, Forsg{\aa}rd, and Passare on the convergence of Euler--Mellin integrals, which include Feynman integrals. We conjecture that a necessary in addition to a sufficient condition is that all parameter-space monomials lie in the interior of the polytope. We present an algorithm for finding all finite numerators based on this conjecture. In a variety of examples, we find agreement between the results obtained using the geometric approach, and a Landau-analysis approach developed by Gambuti, Tancredi, and two of the authors.</description>

      <title>Testing Meson Portal Dark Sector Solutions to the MiniBooNE Anomaly at CCM</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.02599v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A solution to the MiniBooNE excess invoking rare three-body decays of the charged pions and kaons to new states in the MeV mass scale was recently proposed as a dark-sector explanation. This class of solution illuminates the fact that, while the charged pions were focused in the target-mode run, their decay products were isotropically suppressed in the beam-dump-mode run in which no excess was observed. This suggests a new physics solution correlated to the mesonic sector. We investigate an extended set of phenomenological models that can explain the MiniBooNE excess as a dark sector solution, utilizing long-lived particles that might be produced in the three-body decays of the charged mesons and the two-body anomalous decays of the neutral mesons. Over a broad set of interactions with the long-lived particles, we show that these scenarios can be compatible with constraints from LSND, KARMEN, and MicroBooNE, and evaluate the sensitivity of the ongoing and future data taken by the Coherent CAPTAIN Mills experiment (CCM) to a potential discovery in this parameter space.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised and lightly supervised learning in particle physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13676v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We review the main applications of machine learning models that are not fully supervised in particle physics, i.e., clustering, anomaly detection, detector simulation, and unfolding. Unsupervised methods are ideal for anomaly detection tasks -- machine learning models can be trained on background data to identify deviations if we model the background data precisely. The learning can also be partially unsupervised when we can provide some information about the anomalies at the data level. Generative models are useful in speeding up detector simulations -- they can mimic the computationally intensive task without large resources. They can also efficiently map detector-level data to parton-level data (i.e., data unfolding). In this review, we focus on interesting ideas and connections and briefly overview the underlying techniques wherever necessary.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05315v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the evolution and dissociation dynamics of $c\bar{c}$ and $b\bar{b}$ pairs within the pre-equilibrium, gluon-dominated stage of high energy nuclear collisions. An attractive potential made of a perturbative Coulomb-like term and of a confining term is used to simulate the attractive strong force in the pairs. Besides, we implement the interaction of the pairs with the evolving Glasma fields by virtue of the Wong equations. The interaction with the classical color fields dominates the dynamics, causing an increase in pair separation and subsequent dissociation. The observed finite probability of dissociation for these states reveals the intricate interplay between QCD dynamics and the suppression of $c\bar{c}$ and $b\bar{b}$ states during the pre-equilibrium stage. The research highlights differences between $c\bar{c}$ and $b\bar{b}$ pairs, revealing the role of quark flavor in the dissociation process. Dissociation spectra analysis indicates a peak shift towards higher momentum, reflecting a slight energy gain by the pairs. This investigation provides valuable insights into the complex dynamics of $c\bar{c}$ and $b\bar{b}$ pairs in the Glasma, which may help in better interpretation of experimental results on further integration with subsequent phases of the created matter.</description>

      <title>Understanding small neutrino mass and its implication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16626v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have derived previously the relations between the neutrino masses and mixing angles in a dispersive analysis on the mixing of neutral leptonic states. The only involved assumption is that the electroweak symmetry of the Standard Model (SM) is restored at a high energy scale in some new physics scenario, which diminishes the box diagrams responsible for the mixing. Here we include corrections to the analysis up to three loops, arising from exchanges of additional neutral and charged scalars in the electroweak symmetric phase. The solution to the dispersion relation for the $\mu^-e^+$-$\mu^+e^-$ mixing generates a typical neutrino mass $m_\nu\sim O(1)$ eV in the SM unambiguously. The solution also favors the normal ordering of the neutrino masses over the inverted one, and links the large electroweak symmetry restoration, i.e., new physics scale to the small neutrino mass.</description>

      <title>How Viable Is a QCD Axion near 10 MeV?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13425v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There has been an attempt to revive the visible QCD axion at the 10 MeV scale assuming that it exclusively couples to the first-generation quarks and the electron. This variant of the QCD axion is claimed to remain phenomenologically viable, partly due to a clever model construction that induces tree-level pion-phobia and exploits uncertainties inherent in the chiral perturbation theory. We confront this model with the cosmological domain wall problem, the quality issue and constraints arising from the electron electric dipole moment. It is also pointed out that the gluon loop-generated axion-top coupling can provide a very large contribution to rare $B$-meson decays, such that the present LHCb data for $B^0 \to K^{*0} e^+ e^-$ rule out the model for the axion mass larger than 30 MeV. There is a strong motivation for pushing the experimental analysis of $B \to K^{(*)} e^+ e^-$ to a lower $e^+ e^-$ invariant mass window, which will conclusively determine the fate of the model, as its contribution to this branching ratio significantly exceeds the Standard Model prediction.</description>

      <title>Small Neutrino Masses from a Decoupled Singlet Scalar Field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13595v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a unified solution with $Z_4$ discrete symmetry for small neutrino masses and stability of dark matter. The Standard Model is extended with an inert doublet scalar, a dark singlet scalar, a spurion scalar and right-handed neutrinos, which all transform nontrivially under $Z_4$. After the $Z_4$ symmetry is broken to $Z_2$ by the VEV of the spurion, much below the mass scale of the dark singlet scalar, a small lepton number violating coupling for the inert doublet is generated at tree level, so small neutrino masses are obtained at one-loops. We discuss the important roles of the $Z_4$ symmetry for neutrino masses, dark matter physics and thermal leptogenesis.</description>

      <title>A simple high-accuracy method for solving bound-state equations with the Cornell potential in momentum space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21789v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The well-known Cornell quark-antiquark potential in momentum space contains singularities both in its one-gluon-exchange (OGE) and linear confining parts, which prevents a direct use of the convenient Nystr\"om method to solve the corresponding bound-state integral equation for the meson masses. While it has been known for a long time how the Coulomb-type singularity in the OGE potential can be treated with a subtraction technique, only very complicated methods have been developed to deal with the stronger singularity in the linear potential. In this work, we present a simple subtraction method to remove this singularity from the kernel, such that the Nystr\"om method becomes applicable. Derivatives of the wave function, that appear as a result of the subtraction, are represented by means of interpolating functions, for which we found Lagrange polynomials to be very efficient. Test calculations show excellent agreement with exactly known energy eigenvalues. By increasing the number of integration points and the order of the Lagrange interpolation polynomials, extremely high accuracy can be achieved. This method can also be extended to relativistic Bethe-Salpeter type equations with singular kernels.</description>

Abstract: In overview of the recent activity of the newly funded EXCLusives with AI and Machine learning (EXCLAIM) collaboration is presented. The main goal of the collaboration is to develop a framework to implement AI and machine learning techniques in problems emerging from the phenomenology of high energy exclusive scattering processes from nucleons and nuclei, maximizing the information that can be extracted from various sets of experimental data, while implementing theoretical constraints from lattice QCD. A specific perspective embraced by EXCLAIM is to use the methods of theoretical physics to understand the working of ML, beyond its standardized applications to physics analyses which most often rely on industrially provided tools, in an automated way.</description>

      <title>Tetraquark nature of the $a_0(980)$ meson in hadronic $D$ decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13942v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The internal structure of the light scalar meson $a_0(980)$ is explored in the three-body $D$ decays of $D\to a_0(980)P\to P_1P_2P$ through the intermediate state $a_0(980)$, where $P$ denotes a pseudoscalar meson. The quasi-two-body $D\to a_0(980)^+P$ decays are governed by the external $W$-emission diagram in which $a_0(980)^+$ is emitted. The predicted branching fractions in the $q\bar q$ model of $a_0(980)$ are too small by one to two orders of magnitude compared to experiment as the amplitude is suppressed by the smallness of the $a_0(980)^+$ decay constant, while those for $D^+\to a_0(980)^0 P$ and $D^0\to a_0(980)^{-}P$ are usually too large. These discrepancies can be resolved provided that $a_0(980)$ is a tetraquark state. In this case, there exist two additional $T$-like topological amplitudes, denoted by $\overline{T}$ and $\tilde T$ which readily account for the discrepancies. An important implication of the tetraquark model is that the $D_s^+\to a_0(980)^+\pi^0+a_0(980)^0\pi^+$ decay is not a purely $W$-annihilation process as in the diquark model of $a_0(980)$; it receives dominant contributions from $\overline{T}$ newly noticed in this work. Therefore, measurements of $(D,D_s^+)\to a_0(980)P$ decays lend strong support to the tetraquark picture of $a_0(980)$.</description>

Abstract: We suggest a resonant $c \bar b \to H^+$ production search, followed by bosonic $H^+ \to W^+ H$ weak decay at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). In the general two Higgs doublet model (G2HDM) that has flavor-changing neutral Higgs couplings, $H^+$ is resonantly produced via the top-charm $\rho_{tc} V_{tb}$ coupling at tree level, while $H^+ \to W^+ H$ weak decay occurs within the exotic second doublet, leading eventually to same sign dilepton signals. We perform a signal-to-background analysis at the 14 TeV LHC and show that discovery seems possible with LHC Run 2 data already at hand.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11598v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the framework of modular transformations, we reformulate the recently proposed hadron-quark hybrid model when the imaginary baryonic chemical potential is introduced. As a result, we can consider the torus, which is characterized by the complex number densities of baryons (antibaryons) and quarks (antiquarks). We apply this model to analyze the Roberge-Weiss transition. It is shown that the torus vanishes at the baryonic chemical potential where the Roberge-Weiss transition appears because the number density of baryons (antibaryons) is not linearly independent of the number density of quarks (antiquarks). When the temperature T is lower than the Roberge-Weiss transition temperature TRW, the torus shrinks smoothly to the one-dimensional object at the Roberge-Weiss transition point, but the discontinuity does not appear. On the other hand, the discontinuity of the geometrical object appears when T&gt;TRW. We also calculate the modulus of the torus and transform it into the fundamental region. The transformed moduli are symmetric below TRW, but the symmetry is broken above TRW.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Roles of Dark Photons in Axion-induced Electroweak Baryogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12517v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By coupling to both the Higgs and electroweak gauge sectors, an axion can generate the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe via electroweak baryogenesis when the axion decay constant lies within the range of approximately $10^5$ and $10^7$GeV, corresponding to axion masses between the MeV and GeV scales. In this work, we explore the intriguing possibility that the axion interacts with a dark sector, particularly with dark photons through anomalous couplings. Notably, axion-coupled dark photons can play multiple roles, including $(i)$ suppressing the branching ratio of axion decay to Standard Model (SM) particles, which would otherwise conflict with the constraints from supernovae explosions, Big Bang nucleosynthesis, and neutron star merger events, $(ii)$ serving as a candidate for cold dark matter if they are massive and stable, and $(iii)$ contributing to dark radiation if they are ultralight. The axion decouples from the SM thermal bath when it becomes non-relativistic, facilitating the production of dark matter dark photons through the freeze-in mechanism, while dark radiation dark photons are thermally generated prior to the electroweak phase transition.</description>

      <title>Double $\phi$ Production in $\bar{p}p$ Reactions Near Threshold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16615v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use an effective Lagrangian approach to investigate the double $\phi$ production processes in $\bar{p}p$ reactions near the threshold. We describe a notable violation of the Okubo-Zweig-Iizuka rule in $\bar{p}p\to\phi\phi$ reactions near the threshold by meson and baryon exchanges with hadronic degrees of freedom. Our study includes $t$- and $u$-channel diagrams that incorporate nucleon ground ($N$) and excited states ($N^\ast$), as well as $f$ and $\eta(2225)$ mesons in the $s$ channel. The excited states of the nucleon in the $t$ and $u$ channels encompass $N^\ast(1535, 1/2^-)$, $N^\ast(1650, 1/2^-)$, and $N^\ast(1895, 1/2^-)$, all of which are known to have significant coupling to strangeness. Our calculations suggest that the $N$ exchange in $t$ and $u$ diagrams contributes to a rapid increase in the total cross-section of $\bar{p}p\to\phi\phi$ reactions very close to the threshold. The diagrams involving $N^\ast(1650, 1/2^-)$ and $N^\ast(1895, 1/2^-)$ make a prominent contribution to the near-threshold cross sections, compared to the $N^\ast(1535, 1/2^-)$ exchange diagram. In the $s$ channel, the presence of three $f_0$ mesons ($f_0(2020)$, $f_0(2100)$, and $f_0(2200)$) and three $f_2$ mesons ($f_2(1950)$, $f_2(2010)$, and $f_2(2150)$) leads to a distinct peaking structure in the total cross sections, while the $\eta(2225)$ appears to contribute negligibly. Furthermore, the $\bar{\Lambda}\Lambda$ threshold results in a cusp structure in the total cross sections near 2231 MeV. Additionally, polarization observables offer crucial insights into the individual processes involved in the $\bar{p}p\to\phi\phi$ reactions.</description>

Abstract: The Migdal transition probabilities for dark matter scattering are compared to the total single-electron inelastic cross sections of electron-atom scattering for isolated Ar and Xe. The comparison is done by expressing the electron-atom scattering cross section by connecting the Migdal probability. The resultant errors are around $20 \ \%$ for Ar but can be factors for Xe in $\sim$ 1 keV of incoming electron energy. The calculation is also compared with the cases of Coulomb potential and screened Coulomb potential.</description>

Abstract: Pulsar timing arrays seek and study gravitational waves (GWs) through the angular two-point correlation function of timing residuals they induce in pulsars. The two-point correlation function induced by the standard transverse-traceless GWs is the famous Hellings-Downs curve, a function only of the angle between the two pulsars. Additional polarization modes (vector/scalar) that may arise in alternative-gravity theories have different angular correlation functions. Furthermore, anisotropy, linear, or circular polarization in the stochastic GW background gives rise to additional structure in the two-point correlation function that cannot be written simply in terms of the angular separation of the two pulsars. In this paper, we provide a simple formula for the most general two-point correlation function--or overlap reduction function (ORF)--for a gravitational-wave background with an arbitrary polarization state, possibly containing anisotropies in its intensity and polarization (linear or circular). We provide specific expressions for the ORFs sourced by the general-relativistic transverse-traceless GW modes as well as vector (or spin-1) modes that may arise in alternative-gravity theories.</description>

      <title>Effect of dark matter interaction on hybrid star in the light of the recent astrophysical observations</title>

Abstract: We have explored the effect of dark matter interaction on hybrid star (HS) in the light of recent astrophysical observational constraints. The presence of dark matter is assumed to be there in both the hadron as well as the quark sector. The dark matter particle interacts with both hadron and quark matter through the exchange of a scalar as well as a vector meson. The equation of state (EOS) of the hadron part is computed using the NL3 version of the relativistic mean field(RMF) model, whereas the quark part is taken care of using the well-known MIT Bag model with the vector interaction. We investigate the effect of the dark matter density and the mass of the dark matter particle on various observables like mass, radius, tidal deformability of the dark matter admixed hybrid star(DMAHS). In this study, we have noted an intriguing aspect that is the speed of sound in the DMAHS is insensitive to both the mass as well as the density of dark matter. We also observe a striking similarity in the variation of transition mass and its corresponding radius, as well as the maximum mass of neutron stars, with dark matter density and mass. We employ observational constraints from neutron stars to narrow down the allowed range of the parameters of dark matter.</description>

      <title>Cosmological inhomogeneities, primordial black holes, and a hypothesis on the death of the universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12050v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the impact of the expansion of the universe on a broad class of objects, including black holes, neutron stars, white dwarfs, and others. Using metrics that incorporate primordial inhomogeneities, the effects of a hypothetical "center of the universe" on inflation are calculated. Dynamic coordinates for black holes that account for expansions or contractions with arbitrary rates are provided. We consider the possibility that the universe may be bound to evolve into an ultimate state of "total dilution", wherein stable particles are so widely separated that physical communication among them will be impossible for eternity. This is also a scenario of "cosmic virtuality", as no wave-function collapse would occur again. We provide classical models evolving this way, based on the Majumdar-Papapetrou geometries. More realistic configurations, instead, indicate that gravitational forces locally counteract expansion, except in the universe's early stages. We comment on whether quantum phenomena may dictate that total dilution is indeed the cosmos' ultimate destiny.</description>

      <title>Matching current observational constraints with nonminimally coupled dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17019v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that a universe with a nonminimally coupled scalar field can fit current measurements of the expansion rate of the Universe better than the standard $\Lambda$-Cold Dark Matter model or other minimally coupled dark energy models. While we find a clear improvement in the goodness of fit for this dark energy model with respect to others that have been considered in the recent literature, using various information theoretic criteria, we show that the evidence for it is still inconclusive.</description>
