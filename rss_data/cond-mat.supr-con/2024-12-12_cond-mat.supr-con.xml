      <title>Comment on "Trapped magnetic flux in hydrogen-rich high-temperature superconductors" by V.S. Minkov, V. Ksenofontov, S.L. Bud'ko, E.F. Talantsev and M.I. Eremets</title>

Abstract: In their paper arXiv:2206.14108, Nat. Phys. 19, 1293 (2023), Eremets et al. present experimental results for flux creep measurements using H$_{3}$S under high pressure in a diamond anvil cell, the pioneering material for the era of hydride superconductivity, with the aim of providing evidence that magnetic flux is trapped in H$_{3}$S under high pressure and that persistent currents are circulating there. Initially, it was thought that the measurements started immediately after switching off the applied magnetic field, as indicated by the labeling of the horizontal axis of Fig. 4c of arXiv:2206.14108, Nat. Phys. 19, 1293 (2023). However, it was revealed in private communications by Eremets et al. to the author and in a later paper by Bud'ko et al. (2024) [1] that there was a large delay time in starting the flux creep measurements. If that's the case, the measurement period of 10$^{4}$ s or 10$^{5}$ s as shown in Fig. 4c is too short to draw any conclusions about flux creep, or even to determine whether flux creep was being measured.</description>

      <title>Effects of Chemical Pressure on Superconductivity in Electrochemically Intercalated (TMA)yFe2(Se1-xSx)2 (TMA = Tetramethylammonium)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The beta-modification of FeSe, which has an anti-PbO type structure, achieves superconductivity at 8 K without external doping or pressure and exhibits a nematic phase, which has been crucial for studies of unconventional pairing mechanisms. Although the critical temperature (Tc) in FeSe increases significantly with applied pressure, intercalation, and in thin films, the effect of replacing selenium with sulfur in FeSe1-xSx has remained unclear. To investigate the effects of chemical pressure, we have synthesized FeSe1-xSx crystals (up to x = 0.52) and intercalated them with tetramethylammonium ions (TMA+). Our results show that both Tc and unit cell volume decrease linearly with sulfur content in both host and intercalated (TMA)yFe2(Se1-xSx)2. The unexpected common rate of normalized decrease of Tc suggests that chemical pressure affects the electron-doped intercalates in the same way as the host compounds. This result highlights the unique role of chemical pressure and electron doping in tuning superconductivity in FeSe systems and provides new insights into their complex behavior.</description>

      <title>Larger grains in high-Tc superconductors synthesized by the solid-state reaction route</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solid-state synthesis is widely used in exploratory research to study various structural modifications that affect the properties (critical temperature, critical current density, irreversibility field, etc.) of superconductors. The popularity of this method is due to its relative simplicity and availability of the necessary equipment. Combining solid-state synthesis and top-seeded melt growth allows us to increase the grain size in a Tm- and Nd-based 1-2-3 superconductor. Samples with a grain size up to 0.1 mm have been obtained. X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and magnetization measurements have been used for investigating this superconducting material. The magnetization width {\Delta}M has increased significantly in the synthesized samples. However the temperature dependence of the intragrain critical current density and the pinning force scaling give evidences that the pinning mechanism in the obtained superconductor is essentially the same as in polycrystalline superconductors synthesized by standard solid-state technology. The increase in grain size in the synthesized samples is the main reason for the high values of {\Delta}M.</description>

      <title>Two-gap superconductivity in a Janus MoSeLi monolayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) lithium-decorated materials have emerged as a significant area of study since the prediction of superconductivity in lithium-decorated graphene at temperatures around 8.1 K, with experimental evidence observed at Tc = 5.9 K. Following earlier studies, this paper focuses on the hexagonal Janus MoSeLi monolayer as a promising candidate for Li-decorated 2D materials. Our research reveals that lithium substitution on a selenium layer of MoSe2 can produce a hexagonal Janus MoSeLi monolayer, which exhibits metallic behavior with potential phonon-mediated superconductivity with a critical temperature Tc of 4.5 K. Additionally, by solving the anisotropic gap equations derived from Migdal-Eliashberg theory, we found that the Janus MoSeLi monolayer exhibits two-gap superconductivity. This finding underscores the potential of hexagonal Janus MoSeLi as a significant Li-decorated 2D material for exploring two-dimensional superconductivity and sets the stage for further investigations into new families of Janus transition-metal chalcogenides.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of superconductivity in electron-hole coexisting Sr$_{1-x}$Eu$_{x}$CuO$_{2+y}$ films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report transport measurements of infinite-layer cuprate Sr$_{1-x}$Eu$_{x}$CuO$_{2+y}$ films with controlled electron (by trivalent europium) and hole (by interstitial apical oxygen) carriers grown on SrTiO$_3$(001) with molecular beam epitaxy. An unusual enhancement of superconductivity upon moderate electron-hole coexistence in the films is found, which spans over the whole superconducting phase diagram and becomes more prominent in the underdoped regime. The superconductivity exhibits a two-dimensional nature with a thickness of approximately 5.2 nm, irrespective of the varying carriers, confirmed by angle-resolved magnetoresistance measurements and the Berzzinsky-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition. Nevertheless, the electron-hole coexistence enlarges the thermal activation energy of vortex motion that deviates obviously from the usual logarithmic evolution with the magnetic field. Our results offer a promising perspective to understand and enhance the high-temperature superconductivity in cuprates.</description>

      <title>Local electronic properties of La3Ni2O7 under pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent discovery of superconductivity in $\rm La_3Ni_2O_7$ has attracted significant attention due to its high critical temperature and analogy to cuprate oxides. The oxidation and spin states of Ni ions are among the most important local properties in this compound, extensively discussed in the context of its superconductivity. Despite their direct link to the electron filling configurations of the relevant $\rm 3d_{x^2-y^2}$ and $\rm 3d_{z^2}$ orbitals, these local electronic properties of $\rm La_3Ni_2O_7$ yet to be systematically investigated. In this work, we address this issue using x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and x-ray emission spectroscopy (XES) measurements under pressure. Comparison of Ni \textit{K}-edge XAS and $\rm K\beta$ XES with the reference spectra of $\rm NiO$ and $\rm LaNiO_3$ shows that Ni ions, with an average valence of $\sim 2.53+$, are in a low-spin ($\rm S = 1/2$) ground state under ambient conditions. High pressure XAS and XES data clearly show that the oxidation ($\sim 2.5+$) and spin ($\rm S = 1/2$) states of Ni ions remain stable across the investigated pressure (up to 30 GPa) and temperature (down to 10 K) ranges, ruling out previously proposed spin transition scenarios.</description>

      <title>Broken time-reversal symmetry detected by tunneling spectroscopy of superconducting Pd-doped CaAgP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The appearance of broken time-reversal symmetry (TRS) in superconducting states is an intriguing issue in solid-state physics because of the incompatibility of the spontaneous magnetic field and the Meissner effect. We identify broken TRS in Pd-doped CaAgP (CaAg$_{0.9}$Pd$_{0.1}$P) by tunneling spectroscopy through the magnetic field response of conductance spectra. CaAg$_{0.9}$Pd$_{0.1}$P is a nodal-line semimetal with exotic electronic states such as drumhead surface states and surface superconductivity. Tunneling conductance spectra acquired at the side surfaces of CaAg$_{0.9}$Pd$_{0.1}$P under an applied magnetic field exhibit broad zero-bias peaks with small asymmetric structures. Surprisingly, the asymmetric structures are reversed exactly by flipping the field direction. On the basis of an analysis which stands on the formula of tunneling junctions for unconventional superconductors, these results are consistent with the pair potential of the superconductivity breaks the TRS and is strongly coupled to an external magnetic field. We reveal the novel character of superconducting nodal-line semimetals by developing the TRS sensitivity of tunneling spectroscopy. Our results serve as an exploration of broken TRS in superconducting states realized in topological materials.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in the medium entropy alloys Nb2TiW and Nb2TiMo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study describes the synthesis and characterization of Nb2TiW and Nb2TiMo medium entropy alloys (MEAs). The Nb2TiW and Nb2TiMo MEAs can be successfully synthesized by an arc melting method. Their structures and superconducting properties are investigated by detailed characterization of X ray diffraction (XRD), resistivity, magnetization, and specific heat measurements. XRD results confirm that the obtained Nb2TiW and Nb2TiMo compounds have the same body-centered cubic (BCC) structures. Experimental results show that the superconducting transition temperatures Tcs of Nb2TiW and Nb2TiMo are around 4.86 K and 3.22 K, respectively. The upper and lower critical fields of Nb2TiW are 3.52(2) T and 53.36(2) Oe, respectively, and those of Nb2TiMo are 2.11(2) T and 68.23(3) Oe, respectively. First-principles calculations reveal that the d electrons of Nb, Ti, and Mo or W are the dominant contribution of the density of states near the Fermi level. Specific heat measurement results indicate that Nb2TiW and Nb2TiMo display BCS full-gap s-wave superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Evidence for multiband gapless superconductivity in the topological superconductor candidate 4Hb-TaS2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the ultralow-temperature thermal conductivity measurements on single crystals of transition-metal dichalcogenide material 4Hb-TaS$_{2}$, which has recently been proposed as a topological superconductor candidate. In zero field, a small residual linear term $\kappa_{0}/T$ is observed, indicating the existence of a residual density of states in the superconducting state. The slow field dependence of $\kappa_{0}/T$ at low fields rules out the presence of nodes in the superconducting gap, and the S-shaped field dependence across the full field range suggests multiple superconducting gaps in 4Hb-TaS$_{2}$. Our results provide evidence for multiband gapless superconductivity in 4Hb-TaS$_{2}$, and the residual density of states come from certain gapless Fermi surfaces.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Thermo-Spintronic Response of Superconducting Quasiparticles: Berry Curvature Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose two thermo-spintronic responses of spin-orbit coupled superconductors - the intrinsic thermal Edelstein effect and intrinsic spin Nernst effect - stemming from phase-space and momentum-space Berry curvatures of Bogoliubov quasiparticles. We unveil that the Bloch band spin-orbit coupling and superconducting pairing are entangled in shaping the quasiparticle Berry curvatures rather than in an additive manner. The resulting thermo-spintronic responses are significantly enhanced at low temperatures by the emergence of Bogoliubov Fermi surface, and can be effectively modulated by tuning the latter. Our work reveals unique Berry curvature properties in topologically trivial superconductors with spin-orbit coupling, and opens a new route to superconducting spintronics.</description>

      <title>Interplay of coupling, residual, and quasiparticle losses for the frequency- and temperature-dependent quality factor of superconducting resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The overall, loaded quality factor $Q_\mathrm{L}$ quantifies the loss of energy stored in a resonator. Here we discuss on general grounds how $Q_\mathrm{L}$ of a planar microwave resonator made of a conventional superconductor should depend on temperature and frequency. We consider contributions to $Q_\mathrm{L}$ due to dissipation by thermal quasiparticles ($Q_\mathrm{QP}$), due to residual dissipation ($Q_\mathrm{Res}$), and due to coupling ($Q_\mathrm{C}$). We present experimental data obtained with superconducting stripline resonators fabricated from lead (Pb), with different center conductor widths and different coupling gaps. We probe the resonators at various harmonics between 0.7 GHz and 6 GHz and at temperatures between 1.5 K and 7 K. We find a strongly frequency- and temperature-dependent $Q_\mathrm{L}$, which we can describe by a lumped-element model. For certain resonators at lowest temperatures we observe a maximum in the frequency-dependent $Q_\mathrm{L}$ when $Q_\mathrm{Res}$ and $Q_\mathrm{C}$ match, and here the measured $Q_\mathrm{L}$ can exceed $2\times 10^5$.</description>

      <title>Topological columnar nano-SQUID based on a 3D topological insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A 3D topological insulator (TI) is wrapped by a metallic surface that is topologically protected. While this surface is promising for generating non-Abelian Majorana zero-modes (MZMs) for topological quantum computing, it is a challenge to gap out the whole surface to get rid of low-energy quasiparticles to realize a well-defined fermion parity. Here we propose a novel TI platform that solves this problem and gives rise to a robust topological phase. It consists of a bulk-insulating rectangular TI nanowire laterally sandwiched by two superconductors. In this structure, the top and bottom surfaces individually work as SNS line junctions, forming a nanometer-scale columnar SQUID in which the nanowire cross-section defines the threading flux $\Phi$. We demonstrate that a TI device of this structure indeed presents SQUID-type oscillations of the critical current $I_c$ as a function of the axial magnetic field with period $\Phi_{0}^s=\frac{h}{2e}$ and can be tuned by a back gate to attain vanishing $I_c$ minima, an indication that the supercurrent is completely surface-dominated. Our theory shows that, when the two junctions are asymmetric, a robust topological phase hosting MZMs occurs periodically for $(n-\frac{1}{2})\Phi_{0}^s &lt; \Phi &lt; (n+\frac{1}{2})\Phi_{0}^s$ with odd-integer $n$.</description>

      <title>DFT+DMFT study of correlated electronic structure in the monolayer-trilayer phase of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08601v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By preforming DFT+DMFT calculations, we systematically investigate the correlated electronic structure in the newly discovered monolayer-trilayer (ML-TL) phase of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ (1313-La327). Our calculated Fermi surfaces are in good agreement with the result of angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. We find that 1313-La327 is a multiorbital correlated metal. An unstable orbital-selective Mott behavior is found in ML. The ML Ni-3$d_{z^2}$ orbital exhibits a Mott behavior, while the ML Ni-3$d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital is metallic due to self-doping. Quasi-particle peaks appear at the Fermi level due to an interorbital hopping between the localized ML Ni-3$d_{z^2}$ and delocalized Ni-3$d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals. We also find a large static local spin susceptibility of ML Ni, suggesting that there is large spin fluctuation in 1313-La327. The TL Ni-$e_g$ orbitals possess similar electronic correlation to those in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$. The $e_g$ orbitals of the outer-layer Ni in TL show non-Fermi liquid behaviors. Besides, large weight of high-spin states are found in TL-outer Ni and ML Ni, implying Hundness. Under 16 GPa, a Lifshitz transition is revealed by our calculations and a La-related band crosses the Fermi level. Our work provides a theoretical reference for studying other potential mixed-stacked nickelate superconductors.</description>
