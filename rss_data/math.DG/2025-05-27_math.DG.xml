      <title>Connected sum of manifolds with spectral Ricci lower bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $n &gt; 2$, $\gamma &gt; \frac{n-1}{n-2}$, and $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$. We prove that if $M$ and $N$ are two smooth $n$-manifolds that admit a complete Riemannian metric satisfying
  \[
  -\gamma\Delta + \mathrm{Ric} &gt; \lambda,
  \]
  then the connected sum $M \# N$ also admits such a metric. The construction geometrically resembles a Gromov-Lawson tunnel; the range $ \gamma &gt; \frac{n-1}{n-2} $ is sharp for this to hold.</description>

      <title>On the PPW Conjecture For Hopf-symmetric Sets In Non-compact Rank One Symmetric Space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we proved that for a bounded Hopf-symmetric domain $\Omega$ in a noncompact rank one symmetric space $M$, the second Dirichlet eigenvalue $\lambda_2 (\Omega) \leq \lambda_2 (B_1)$ where $B_1$ is a geodesic ball in $M$ such that $\lambda_1 (\Omega) =\lambda_1 (B_1)$. This generalizes the work of Ashbaugh &amp; Benguria, Benguria &amp; Linde for bounded domains in constant curvature spaces.</description>

      <title>Local rigidity of convex hypersurfaces in spaces of constant curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove a local rigidity of convex hypersurfaces in the spaces of constant curvature of dimension $n\ge4$. Namely, we show that two convex isometric hypersurfaces are congruent locally around their corresponding under the isometry points of strict convexity. This result extends the result of E.P. Senkin, who showed such rigidity under the additional assumption of $C^1$-smoothness of the hypersurfaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study quasi-Einstein manifolds with constant scalar curvature. We provide a classification of compact and noncompact (possibly with boundary) $T$-flat quasi-Einstein manifolds with constant scalar curvature, where the $T$-tensor is directly related to the Cotton and Weyl tensors. Moreover, we construct new explicit examples of noncompact quasi-Einstein manifolds. In addition, we prove a complete classification of compact and noncompact (possibly with boundary) $3$-dimensional $m$-quasi-Einstein manifolds with constant scalar curvature.</description>

      <title>Heat kernel estimate on weighted Riemannian manifolds under lower $N$-Ricci curvature bounds with $\epsilon$-range and it's application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a parabolic Harnack inequality for positive solutions of the $\phi$-heat equation and prove Gaussian upper and lower bounds for the $\phi$-heat kernel on weighted Riemannian manifolds under lower $N$-Ricci curvature bound with $\varepsilon$-range. Building on these results, we demonstrate: The $L^1_\phi$-Liouville theorem for $\phi$-subharmonic functions, $L^1_\phi$-uniqueness property for solutions of the $\phi$-heat equation and lower bounds for eigenvalues of the weighted Laplacian $\Delta_\phi$.
  Furthermore, leveraging the Gaussian upper bound of the weighted heat kernel, we construct a Li-Yau-type gradient estimate for the positive solution of weighted heat equation under a weighted $L^p(\mu)$-norm constraint on $|\nabla\phi|^2$.</description>

Abstract: We study conformal product structures on compact reducible Riemannian manifolds, and show that under a suitable technical assumption, the underlying Riemannian mani\-folds are either conformally flat, or triple products, \emph{i.e.} locally isometric to Riemannian manifolds of the form $(M,g)$ with $M=M_1\times M_2\times M_3$ and $g=e^{2f}g_1+g_2+g_3$, where $g_i$ is a Riemannian metric on $M_i$, for $i\in\{1,2,3\}$, and $f\in C^\infty(M_1\times M_2)$.</description>

      <title>Constant Harmonic Mean Curvature Foliation in Asymptotic Schwarzschild Spaces-II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper extends the results of [GLS24], where the existence of a constant harmonic mean curvature foliation was established in the setting of a 3-dimensional asymptotically Schwarzschild manifold. Here, we generalize this construction to higher dimensions, proving the existence of foliations by constant harmonic mean curvature hypersurfaces in an asymptotically Schwarzschild manifold of arbitrary dimension. Furthermore, in 3 dimensional case, we demonstrate the local uniqueness of this foliation under a stronger decay conditions on the asymptotically Schwarzschild metric</description>

      <title>Existence of Conical Higher cscK Metrics on a Minimal Ruled Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A `higher extremal K\"ahler metric' is defined (motivated by analogy with the definition of an extremal K\"ahler metric) as a K\"ahler metric whose top Chern form and volume form ``differ'' by a smooth function whose gradient is a holomorphic vector field. A special case of this kind of metric is a `higher constant scalar curvature K\"ahler (higher cscK) metric' which is defined (again by analogy with the definition of a constant scalar curvature K\"ahler (cscK) metric) as a K\"ahler metric whose top Chern form is a real constant multiple of its volume form or equivalently whose top Chern form is harmonic. In our previous paper on higher extremal K\"ahler metrics we had looked at a special class of minimal ruled surfaces called as `pseudo-Hirzebruch surfaces' all of which contain two special divisors (viz. the zero and infinity divisors) and have got some nice symmetries which enable the use of the momentum construction method for finding explicit examples of these kinds of ``canonical'' metrics. We had proven that every K\"ahler class on such a surface admits a higher extremal K\"ahler metric which is not higher cscK and we had further proven that higher cscK metrics do not exist in any K\"ahler class on such a surface. In this paper we will see that if we allow our metrics to develop `conical singularities' along at least one of the two divisors then we do get `conical higher cscK metrics' in each K\"ahler class of the surface by the momentum construction method. We will show that our constructed metrics are ``genuine'' conical K\"ahler metrics and we will interpret the conical higher cscK equation globally on the surface in terms of currents. We will then introduce and employ the `top $\log$ Bando-Futaki invariant' to obtain the linear relationship between the cone angles of the conical singularities of our constructed metrics along the zero and infinity divisors.</description>

      <title>Holomorphic disks with boundary on compact Lagrangian surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $L$ be a compact oriented Lagrangian surface in a K\"ahler surface endowed with a complete Riemannian metric (compatible with the symplectic structure and the complex structure) with bounded sectional curvatures and a positive lower bound on injectivity radius. We show that for every nontrivial class $[\gamma]$ of the fundamental group $\pi_1(L)$ such that $\gamma$ bounds a topological disk in $M$, there exists a holomorphic disk whose boundary belongs to $L$ and is freely homotopic to $\gamma$ on $L$. This answers a question of Bennequin on existence of $J$-holomorphic disks. Nonexistence of exact Lagrangian embeddings of certain surfaces is established in such K\"ahler surface if the fundamental form is exact. In the almost K\"ahler setting, especially, the cotangent bundles of compact manifolds, results on nonexistence of $J$-holomorphic disks and existence of minimizers of the partial energies in the sense of A. Lichnerowicz are obtained.</description>

      <title>The biharmonic hypersurface flow and the Willmore flow in higher dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The biharmonic flow of hypersurfaces $M^n$ immersed in the Euclidean space $\mathbb {R}^{n+1}$ for $n\geq 2$ is given by a fourth order geometric evolution equation, which is similar to the Willmore flow. We apply the Michael-Simon-Sobolev inequality to establish new Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequalities on hypersurfaces. Based on these Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequalities, we apply local energy estimates to extend the solution by a covering argument and obtain an estimate on the maximal existence time of the biharmonic flow of hypersurfaces in higher dimensions. In particular, we solve a problem in \cite{BWW} on the biharmonic hypersurface flow for $n=4$. Finally, we apply our new approach to prove global existence of the Willmore flow in higher dimensions.</description>

Abstract: We establish an energy quantization for constrained Willmore surfaces, where the constraints are given by area, volume, and total mean curvature, assuming that the underlying conformal structures remain bounded. Furthermore, we show strong compactness of constrained Willmore surfaces under some energy threshold, proving in particular the strong compactness of minimizers of two previously studied problems.</description>

      <title>Area-charge inequality and local rigidity in charged initial data sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the geometric consequences of equality in area-charge inequalities for spherical minimal surfaces and, more generally, for marginally outer trapped surfaces (MOTS), within the framework of the Einstein-Maxwell equations. We show that, under appropriate energy and curvature conditions, saturation of the inequality $\mathcal{A} \geq 4\pi(\mathcal{Q}_{\rm E}^2 + \mathcal{Q}_{\rm M}^2)$ imposes a rigid geometric structure in a neighborhood of the surface. In particular, the electric and magnetic fields must be normal to the foliation, and the local geometry is isometric to a Riemannian product. We establish two main rigidity theorems: one in the time-symmetric case and another for initial data sets that are not necessarily time-symmetric. In both cases, equality in the area-charge bound leads to a precise characterization of the intrinsic and extrinsic geometry of the initial data near the critical surface.</description>

Abstract: Let $X$ be an irreducible smooth complex projective variety. Let $G$ be a linear algebraic group over $\mathbb{C}$. We define the notion of Lie algebroid valued connection on holomorphic principal $G$--bundles on $X$, and study their basic properties under extension and reduction of structure group. Finally we investigate criterions for existence of a Lie algebroid connection on principal $G$--bundles over smooth complex projective curves.</description>

      <title>A prescribed curvature flow on hyperbolic surfaces with infinite topological type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the prescribed total geodesic curvature problem for generalized circle packing metrics in hyperbolic background geometry on surfaces with infinite cellular decompositions. To address this problem, we introduce a prescribed curvature flow-a discrete analogue of the Ricci flow on noncompact surfaces-specifically adapted to the setting of infinite cellular decompositions. We establish the well-posedness of the flow and prove two convergence results under certain conditions. Our approach resolves the prescribed total geodesic curvature problem for a broad class of surfaces with infinite cellular decompositions, yielding, in certain cases, smooth hyperbolic surfaces of infinite topological type with geodesic boundaries or cusps. Moreover, the proposed flow provides a method for constructing hyperbolic metrics from appropriate initial data.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12971v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a volume preserving curvature evolution of surfaces in an asymptotically Euclidean initial data set with positive ADM-energy. The speed is given by a nonlinear function of the mean curvature which generalizes the spacetime mean curvature recently considered by Cederbaum-Sakovich (Calc. Var. PDE, 2021). Following a classical approach by Huisken-Yau (Invent. Math., 1996), we show that the flow starting from suitably round initial surfaces exists for all times and converges to a constant (spacetime) curvature limit. This provides an alternative construction of the CSTMC foliation by Cederbaum-Sakovich and has applications in the definition of center of mass of an isolated system in General Relativity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03886v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using co-homogeneity one symmetries, we construct a two-parameter family of non-abelian $G_2$-instantons on every member of the asymptotically locally conical $\mathbb{B}_7$-family of $G_2$-metrics on $S^3 \times \mathbb{R}^4 $, and classify the resulting solutions. These solutions can be described as perturbations of a one-parameter family of abelian instantons, arising from the Killing vector-field generating the asymptotic circle fibre. Generically, these perturbations decay exponentially to the model, but we find a one-parameter family of instantons with polynomial decay. Moreover, we relate the two-parameter family to a lift of an explicit two-parameter family of anti-self-dual instantons on Taub-NUT $\mathbb{R}^4$, fibred over $S^3$ in an adiabatic limit.</description>

      <title>The uniqueness of Poincar\'e type constant scalar curvature K\"ahler metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14130v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $D$ be a smooth divisor on a closed K\"ahler manifold $X$. First, we prove that Poincar\'e type constant scalar curvature K\"ahler (cscK) metric with a singularity at $D$ is unique up to a holomorphic transformation on $X$ that preserves $D$, if there are no nontrivial holomorphic vector fields on $D$. For the general case, we propose a conjecture relating the uniqueness of Poincar\'e type cscK metric to its asymptotic behavior near $D$. We give an affirmative answer to this conjecture for those Poincar\'e type cscK metrics whose asymptotic behavior is invariant under any holomorphic transformation of $X$ that preserve $D$. We also show that this conjecture can be reduced to a fixed point problem.</description>

      <title>Remark on Laplacians and Riemannian Submersions with Totally Geodesic Fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17078v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a Riemannian submersion $(M,g) \to (B,j)$ each of whose fibers is connected and totally geodesic, we consider a certain 1-parameter family of Riemannian metrics $(g_{t})_{t &gt; 0}$ on $M$, which is called the canonical variation. Let $\lambda_{1}(g_{t})$ be the first positive eigenvalue of the Laplace--Beltrami operator $\Delta^{M}_{g_{t}}$ and $\mbox{Vol}(M,g_{t})$ the volume of $(M, g_{t})$. In 1982, B\'{e}rard-Bergery and Bourguignon showed that the scale-invariant quantity $\lambda_{1}(g_{t})\mbox{Vol}(M,g_{t})^{2/\mbox{dim}M}$ goes to $0$ with $t$. In this paper, we show that if each fiber is Einstein and $(M,g)$ satisfies a certain condition about its Ricci curvature, then bounds for $\lambda_{1}(g_{t})$ can be obtained. In particular this implies $\lambda_{1}(g_{t})\mbox{Vol}(M,g_{t})^{2/\mbox{dim}M}$ goes to $\infty$ with $t$. Moreover, using the bounds, we consider stability of critical points of the Yamabe functional. We will see that our results can be applied to many examples. In particular, we consider the twistor fibration of a quaternionic K\"{a}hler manifold of positive scalar curvature.</description>

      <title>Torsion-free $H$-structures on almost Abelian solvmanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11316v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we provide a general set-up for arbitrary linear Lie groups $H\leq \mathrm{GL}(n,\mathbb{R})$ which allows to characterise the almost Abelian Lie algebras admitting a torsion-free $H$-structure. In more concrete terms, using that an $n$-dimensional almost Abelian Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}=\mathfrak{g}_f$ is fully determined by an endomorphism $f$ of $\mathbb{R}^{n-1}$, we give a description of the subspace $\mathcal{F}_{\mathfrak{h}}$ of all $f\in\mathrm{End}(\mathbb{R}^{n-1})$ for which $\mathfrak{g}_f$ admits a ``special'' torsion-free $H$-structure in terms of the image of a certain linear map. For large classes of linear Lie groups $H$, we are able to explicitly compute $\mathcal{F}_{\mathfrak{h}}$ and so give characterisations of the almost Abelian Lie algebras admitting a torsion-free $H$-structure.
  Our results reprove all the known characterisations of the almost Abelian Lie algebras admitting a torsion-free $H$-structure for different single linear Lie groups $H$ and extends them to big classes of linear Lie groups $H$. For example, we are able to provide characterisations in the case $n=2m$, $H\leq \mathrm{GL}(m,\mathbb{C})$ and $H$ either being a complex Lie group or being totally real, or in the case that $H$ preserves a pseudo-Riemannian metric. In many cases, we show that the space $\mathcal{F}_{\mathfrak{h}}$ coincides with what we call the \emph{characteristic subalgebra} $\tilde{\mathfrak{k}}_{\mathfrak{h}}$ associated to $\mathfrak{h}$, and that then the torsion-free condition is equivalent to the left-invariant flatness condition. In particular, we prove this to be the case if $H$ is a complex linear Lie group or if $\mathfrak{h}$ does not contain any elements of rank one or two and is either metric or totally real.</description>

Abstract: We prove a splitting theorem for a smooth noncompact manifold with (possibly noncompact) boundary. We show that if a noncompact manifold of dimension $n\geq 2$ has $\lambda_1(-\alpha\Delta+\operatorname{Ric})\geq 0$ for some $\alpha&lt;\frac{4}{n-1}$ and mean-convex boundary, then it is either isometric to $\Sigma\times \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$ for a closed manifold $\Sigma$ with nonnegative Ricci curvature or it has no interior ends.</description>

      <title>Optimal boundary regularity of harmonic maps from $RCD(K,N)$-spaces to $CAT(0)$-spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02442v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1983, Schoen-Uhlenbeck \cite{SU83} established boundary regularity for energy-minimizing maps between smooth manifolds with the Dirichlet boundary condition under the assumption that both the boundary and the data are of $C^{2,\alpha}$. A natural problem is to study the qualitative boundary behavior of harmonic maps with rough boundary and/or non-smooth boundary data.
  For the special case where $u$ is a harmonic function on a domain $\Omega\subset \mathbb R^n$, this problem has been extensively studied (see, for instance, the monograph \cite{Kenig94}, the proceedings of ICM 2010 \cite{Tor10} and the recent work of Mourgoglou-Tolsa \cite{MT24}). The $W^{1,p}$-regularity ($1&lt;p&lt;\infty$) has been well-established when $\partial\Omega$ is Lipschitz (or even more general) and the boundary data belongs to $W^{1,p}(\partial\Omega)$. However, for the endpoint case where the boundary data is Lipschitz continous, as demonstrated by Hardy-Littlewood's classical examples \cite{HL32}, the gradient $|\nabla u|(x)$ may have logarithmic growth as $x$ approaches the boundary $\partial \Omega$ even if the boundary is smooth.
  In this paper, we first establish a version of the Gauss-Green formula for bounded domains in $RCD(K, N)$ metric measure space. We then apply it to obtain the optimal boundary regularity of harmonic maps from $RCD(K, N)$ metric measure spaces into $CAT(0)$ metric spaces. Our result is new even for harmonic functions on Lipschitz domains of Euclidean spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17892v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we study the existence of solutions to the Mean Curvature Flow for which the initial condition has the structure of a two-dimensional Lie subgroup within a Lie group of dimension three. We consider Lie groups with a fixed left-invariant metric and first observe that if the Lie group is unimodular, then every Lie subgroup is a minimal surface (hence a trivial solution). For this reason we focus on non-unimodular Lie groups, finding the evolution of every Lie subgroup of dimension 2 (within a 3 dimensional Lie group). These evolutions are self-similar for abelian subgroups (i.e. evolve by isometries), but not self-similar in the other cases.</description>

Abstract: Let $M$ be a smooth closed oriented surface. Gaussian thermostats on $M$ correspond to the geodesic flows arising from metric connections, including those with non-zero torsion. These flows may not preserve any absolutely continuous measure. We prove that if two Gaussian thermostats on $M$ with negative thermostat curvature are related by a smooth orbit equivalence isotopic to the identity, then the two background metrics are conformally equivalent via a smooth diffeomorphism of $M$ isotopic to the identity. We also give a relationship between the thermostat forms themselves. Finally, we prove the same result for Anosov magnetic flows.</description>

      <title>A family of instanton-invariants for four-manifolds and their relation to Khovanov homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13285v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article reviews Witten's gauge-theoretic approach to Khovanov homology from the perspective of Haydys-Witten instanton Floer theory. Expanding on Witten's arguments, we introduce a one-parameter family of instanton Floer homology groups $HF_{\theta}(W^4)$, which, based on physical arguments, are expected to be topological invariants of the four-manifold $W^4$. In analogy to the original Yang-Mills instanton Floer theory, these groups are defined by the solutions of the $\theta$-Kapustin-Witten equations on $W^4$ modulo instanton solutions of the Haydys-Witten equations that interpolate between them on the five-dimensional cylinder $\mathbb{R}_s \times W^4$. The relation to knot invariants arises when the four-manifold is the geometric blowup $W^4 = [X^3 \times \mathbb{R}^+, K]$ along a knot $K \subset X^3 \times \{0\}$ embedded in its three-dimensional boundary. The boundaries and corners of this manifold require the specification of boundary conditions that preserve the topological invariance of the construction and are fundamentally linked to various dimensional reductions of the Haydys-Witten equations. We provide a comprehensive discussion of these dimensional reductions and relate them to well-known gauge-theoretic equations in lower dimensions, including the $\theta$-Kapustin-Witten equations, twisted extended Bogomolny equations, and twisted octonionic Nahm equations. Along the way, we record novel results on the elliptic regularity of the Haydys-Witten equations with twisted Nahm pole boundary conditions. The upshot of the article is a tentative definition of Haydys-Witten Floer theory and a precise restatement of Witten's conjecture: an equality between the Haydys-Witten Floer homology $HF^\bullet_{\pi/2}([S^3 \times \mathbb{R}^+, K])$ and Khovanov homology $Kh^\bullet(K)$.</description>

      <title>On the Resolution of Partial Differential Equations for Lattice Structures on Smooth Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08128v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the embedding of lattice structures $L \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ into smooth manifolds $M \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ through a rigorous mathematical framework. Building upon the foundational results established in "Embedding of a Discrete Lattice Structure in a Smooth Manifold," this work investigates the existence and solvability of partial differential equations (PDEs) governing the embedding process. The primary aim is to derive and analyze solutions to these PDEs while preserving the geometric and topological properties of $L$ and $M$.
  The solutions are shown to exist under initial boundary conditions, with the geometric structure of $M$ and the discrete topology of $L$ playing crucial roles in ensuring well-posedness and regularity.
  This paper provides a detailed exposition of the mathematical interplay between discrete and continuous spaces, offering novel insights into embedding theory and the geometry of manifolds interacting with discrete substructures.</description>

      <title>Cancellation properties for exotic $4$-dimensional positive scalar curvature metrics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16542v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ruberman constructed families $\{g_n\vert n \in \mathbb{N}\} \subset \mathcal{R}^+ (M)$ of metrics of positive scalar curvature on certain $4$-manifolds which are concordant but lie in different path components of $\mathcal{R}^+ (M)$. We prove a cancellation result along the following lines. For each closed manifold $N$, there is a map $\nu_N: \mathcal{R}^+ (M) \to \mathcal{R}^+ (M \times N)$, well-defined up to homotopy, that takes the product with $N$. We prove that when $N$ has positive dimension $\nu_N$ takes all metrics of Ruberman's family to the same path component. This is trivial when $N$ has a psc metric and follows from pseudoisotopy theory when $\dim (N) \geq 3$. Our proof is cobordism theoretic in nature and also applies to $\dim(N) =1,2$. The proof relies on rigidity properties for the action of the diffeomorphism group on $\mathcal{R}^+(L)$ for high-dimensional $N$ and a calculation of $\pi_1(\mathrm{MTSO(4)})$ that we also carry out.
  Recently, Auckly and Ruberman exhibited examples of elements in higher homotopy groups of $\mathcal{R}^+(M^4)$ for certain $M$. Using the same method, we also prove that these elements lie in the kernel of the induced map $(\nu_N)_*$ on rational homotopy.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Geometric Theory of Principal Bundle Constrained Systems: Strong Transversality Conditions and Variational Framework for Gauge Field Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16766v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a geometric mechanics framework for constrained systems on principal bundles through \emph{compatible pairs} $(\mathcal{D}, \lambda)$, addressing fundamental challenges in gauge-constrained physical systems. We characterize the strong transversality condition by pairing constraint distributions $\mathcal{D}$ with Lie algebra dual functions $\lambda: P \to \mathfrak{g}^*$ satisfying compatibility $\mathcal{D}_p = \{v : \langle\lambda(p), \omega(v)\rangle = 0\}$ and differential consistency $d\lambda + \mathrm{ad}^*_\omega \lambda = 0$. This framework proves equivalent to $G$-equivariant Atiyah sequence splittings. We establish bidirectional construction enabling computation: forward (from $\lambda$ to compatible $\mathcal{D}$) and inverse (via variational minimization). Key mathematical contributions include existence theorems for bundles with $\mathrm{ad}^*_\Omega\lambda = 0$ and uniqueness results for semi-simple groups with $\mathfrak{z}(\mathfrak{g}) = 0$, providing rigorous foundations for constraint classification. Our central physical insight emerges from variational principles, deriving dynamic connection equations $\partial_t\omega = d^{\omega}\eta - \iota_{X_H}\Omega$ revealing constraint-curvature coupling: $P_{\text{constraint}} = \langle\lambda,\Omega(\dot{q},\delta q)\rangle$. This explains non-trivial constraint-field interactions in magnetohydrodynamics and Yang-Mills systems absent in kinematic theories. We construct Spencer cohomology for compatible pairs, establishing deep connections between topological invariants and conservation laws. Systematic comparison demonstrates that strong transversality captures essential constraint-curvature physics invisible to standard approaches. Applications span fluid dynamics, gauge theories, and geometric control, providing new tools for complex physical systems with intrinsic gauge-constraint coupling.</description>
