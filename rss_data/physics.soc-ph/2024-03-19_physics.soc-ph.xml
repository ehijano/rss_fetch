      <title>Resilient by Design: Simulating Street Network Disruptions across Every Urban Area in the World</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Street networks allow people and goods to move through cities, but they are vulnerable to disasters like floods, earthquakes, and terrorist attacks. Well-planned network design can make a city more resilient and robust to such disruptions, but we still know little about worldwide patterns of vulnerability, or worldwide empirical relationships between specific design characteristics and resilience. This study quantifies and measures the vulnerability of the street networks of every urban area in the world then models the relationships between vulnerability and street network design characteristics. To do so, we simulate over 2.4 billion trips across more than 8,000 urban areas in 178 countries, while also simulating network disruption events representing floods, earthquakes, and targeted attacks. We find that disrupting high-centrality nodes severely impacts network function. All else equal, networks with higher connectivity, fewer chokepoints, or less circuity are less vulnerable to disruption's impacts. This study thus contributes a new global understanding of network design and vulnerability to the literature. We argue that these design characteristics offer high leverage points for street network resilience and robustness that planners should emphasize when designing or retrofitting urban networks.</description>

      <title>Modelling co-evolution of resource feedback and social network dynamics in human-environmental systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Games with environmental feedback have become a crucial area of study across various scientific domains, modelling the dynamic interplay between human decisions and environmental changes, and highlighting the consequences of our choices on natural resources and biodiversity. In this work, we propose a co-evolutionary model for human-environment systems that incorporates the effects of knowledge feedback and social interaction on the sustainability of common pool resources. The model represents consumers as agents who adjust their resource extraction based on the resource's state. These agents are connected through social networks, where links symbolize either affinity or aversion among them. The interplay between social dynamics and resource dynamics is explored, with the system's evolution analyzed across various network topologies and initial conditions. We find that knowledge feedback can independently sustain common pool resources. However, the impact of social interactions on sustainability is dual-faceted: it can either support or impede sustainability, influenced by the network's connectivity and heterogeneity. A notable finding is the identification of a critical network mean degree, beyond which a depletion/repletion transition parallels an absorbing/active state transition in social dynamics, i.e., individual agents and their connections are/are not prone to being frozen in their social states. Furthermore, the study examines the evolution of the social network, revealing the emergence of two polarized groups where agents within each community have the same affinity. Comparative analyses using Monte-Carlo simulations and rate equations are employed, along with analytical arguments, to reinforce the study's findings. The model successfully captures how information spread and social dynamics may impact the sustanebility of common pool resource.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking and Panic Escape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Panic-induced herding in individuals often leads to social disasters, resulting in people being trapped and trampled in crowd stampedes triggered by panic. We introduce a novel approach that offers fresh insights into studying the phenomenon of asymmetrical panic-induced escape. Our approach is based on the concept of Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking (SSB), a fundamental governing mechanism in the Physical Sciences. By applying the principles of SSB, we elucidate how asymmetrical panic-induced herding in individuals occurs. We highlight that understanding panic escape and preventing catastrophic situations can be achieved through two crucial parameters: "population density" control and "communication (or information transfer)" among individuals in a crowd. The interplay of these two parameters is responsible for either breaking or restoring the symmetry of a system. We describe how these parameters are set by design conditions as well as crowd control. Based on these parameters, we discuss strategies for preventing potential social disasters caused by asymmetrical panic escape.</description>

      <title>Reckoning with the wicked problems of nuclear technology: Philosophy, design, and pedagogical method underlying a course on Nuclear Technology, Policy, and Society</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper describes the underlying philosophy, design, and implementation of a course on "Nuclear Technology, Policy, and Society" taught in the Department of Nuclear Engineering and Radiological Sciences at the University of Michigan. The course explores some of nuclear technology's most pressing challenges or its 'wicked problems'. Through this course students explore the origins of these problems be they social or technical and, they are offered tools, both conceptual and methodological to make sense of these problems, and guided through a semester-long exploration of how scientists engineers can work towards their resolution, and to what degree these problems can be solved through institutional transformation or a transformation in our own practices and norms as a field. The underlying pedagogical philosophy, implementation, and response to the course are described here for other instructors who might wish to create a similar course, or for non-academic nuclear scientists and engineers, who might perhaps, in these pages, find a vocabulary for articulating and reflecting on the nature of these problems as encountered in their praxis.</description>

      <title>Stochastic compartment model with mortality and its application to epidemic spreading in complex networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study epidemic spreading in complex networks by a multiple random walker approach. Each walker performs an independent simple Markovian random walk on a complex undirected (ergodic) random graph where we focus on Barab\'asi-Albert (BA), Erd\"os-R\'enyi (ER) and Watts-Strogatz (WS) types. Both, walkers and nodes can be either susceptible (S) or infected and infectious (I) representing their states of health. Susceptible nodes may be infected by visits of infected walkers, and susceptible walkers may be infected by visiting infected nodes. No direct transmission of the disease among walkers (or among nodes) is possible. This model mimics a large class of diseases such as Dengue and Malaria with transmission of the disease via vectors (mosquitos). Infected walkers may die during the time span of their infection introducing an additional compartment D of dead walkers. Infected nodes never die and always recover from their infection after a random finite time. We derive stochastic evolution equations for the mean-field compartmental populations with mortality of walkers and delayed transitions among the compartments. From linear stability analysis, we derive the basic reproduction numbers R M , R 0 with and without mortality, respectively, and prove that R M &lt; R 0 . For R M , R 0 &gt; 1 the healthy state is unstable whereas for zero mortality a stable endemic equilibrium exists (independent of the initial conditions) which we obtained explicitly. We observe that the solutions of the random walk simulations in the considered networks agree well with the mean-field solutions for strongly connected graph topologies, whereas less well for weakly connected structures and for diseases with high mortality.</description>

      <title>Studying speed-accuracy trade-offs in best-of-n collective decision-making through heterogeneous mean-field modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.13694v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To succeed in their objectives, groups of individuals must be able to make quick and accurate collective decisions on the best option among a set of alternatives with different qualities. Group-living animals aim to do that all the time. Plants and fungi are thought to do so too. Swarms of autonomous robots can also be programmed to make best-of-n decisions for solving tasks collaboratively. Ultimately, humans critically need it and so many times they should be better at it. Thanks to their mathematical tractability, simple models like the voter model and the local majority rule model have proven useful to describe the dynamics of such collective decision-making processes. To reach a consensus, individuals change their opinion by interacting with neighbors in their social network. At least among animals and robots, options with a better quality are exchanged more often and therefore spread faster than lower-quality options, leading to the collective selection of the best option. With our work, we study the impact of individuals making errors in pooling others' opinions caused, for example, by the need to reduce the cognitive load. Our analysis is grounded on the introduction of a model that generalizes the two existing models (local majority rule and voter model), showing a speed-accuracy trade-off regulated by the cognitive effort of individuals. We also investigate the impact of the interaction network topology on the collective dynamics. To do so, we extend our model and, by using the heterogeneous mean-field approach, we show the presence of another speed-accuracy trade-off regulated by network connectivity. An interesting result is that reduced network connectivity corresponds to an increase in collective decision accuracy.</description>

      <title>Revealing behavioral impact on mobility prediction networks through causal interventions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11749v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep neural networks are increasingly utilized in mobility prediction tasks, yet their intricate internal workings pose challenges for interpretability, especially in comprehending how various aspects of mobility behavior affect predictions. This study introduces a causal intervention framework to assess the impact of mobility-related factors on neural networks designed for next location prediction -- a task focusing on predicting the immediate next location of an individual. To achieve this, we employ individual mobility models to generate synthetic location visit sequences and control behavior dynamics by intervening in their data generation process. We evaluate the interventional location sequences using mobility metrics and input them into well-trained networks to analyze performance variations. The results demonstrate the effectiveness in producing location sequences with distinct mobility behaviors, thereby facilitating the simulation of diverse yet realistic spatial and temporal changes. These changes result in performance fluctuations in next location prediction networks, revealing impacts of critical mobility behavior factors, including sequential patterns in location transitions, proclivity for exploring new locations, and preferences in location choices at population and individual levels. The gained insights hold significant value for the real-world application of mobility prediction networks, and the framework is expected to promote the use of causal inference for enhancing the interpretability and robustness of neural networks in mobility applications.</description>

      <title>Criminal organizations exhibit hysteresis, resilience, and robustness by balancing security and efficiency</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03720v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interplay between criminal organizations and law enforcement disruption strategies is crucial in criminology. Criminal enterprises, like legitimate businesses, balance visibility and security to thrive. This study uses evolutionary game theory to analyze criminal networks' dynamics, resilience to interventions, and responses to external conditions. We find strong hysteresis effects, challenging traditional deterrence-focused strategies. Optimal thresholds for organization formation or dissolution are defined by these effects. Stricter punishment doesn't always deter organized crime linearly. Network structure, particularly link density and skill assortativity, significantly influences organization formation and stability. These insights advocate for adaptive policy-making and strategic law enforcement to effectively disrupt criminal networks.</description>

      <title>Toward environmental sustainability: an empirical study on airports efficiency</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.02736v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The transition to more environmentally sustainable production processes and managerial practices is an increasingly important topic. Many industries need to undergo radical change to meet environmental sustainability requirements; the tourism industry is no exception. In this respect, a particular aspect that needs further attention is the relationship between airport performances and investments in environmental sustainability policies. This work represents a first attempt to provide empirical evidences about this relationship. Through the application of a non-parametrical method, we first assess the efficiency of the Italian airports industry. Secondly, we investigated the relationship between airports performance and management commitment toward the ecological transition using a Tobit regression model. The results show that airports adherence to formal multi-year ecological transition programs has a positive and consistent impact on their performance.</description>

      <title>Complex Couplings -- A universal, adaptive and bilinear formulation of power grid dynamics</title>

Abstract: The paper is now published in PRX Enegry. Please refer to the PRX version from now on.
  Anna B\"uttner and Frank Hellmann. "Complex Couplings-A Universal, Adaptive, and Bilinear Formulation of Power Grid Dynamics."
  The energy transition introduces new classes of dynamical actors into the power grid. There is a growing need for so-called grid-forming inverters (GFIs) that can contribute to dynamic grid stability as the share of synchronous generators decreases. Understanding the collective behavior and stability of future grids, featuring a heterogeneous mix of dynamics, remains an urgent and challenging task. Two recent advances in describing such modern power grid dynamics have made this problem more tractable: First, the normal form for grid-forming actors provides a uniform, technology-neutral description of plausible grid dynamics, including grid-forming inverters and synchronous machines. Secondly, the notion of the complex frequency has been introduced to effortlessly describe how the nodal dynamics influence the power flows in the grid. The major contribution of this paper is to show how the normal form approach and the complex frequency dynamics of power grids combine, and how they relate naturally to adaptive dynamical networks and control affine systems. Using normal form and complex frequency, we derive a remarkably elementary and universal equation for the collective grid dynamics. Notably, we obtain an elegant equation entirely in terms of a matrix of complex couplings, in which the network topology does not explicitly appear. These complex couplings give rise to new adaptive network formulations of future power grid dynamics. We give a new formulation of the Kuramoto model with inertia as a special case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09438v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a study on the spatio-temporal pattern underlying the climate dynamics in various locations spread over India, including the Himalayan region, coastal region, central and northeastern parts of India. We try to capture the variations in the complexity of their dynamics derived from temperature and relative humidity data from 1948-2022. By estimating the recurrence-based measures from the reconstructed phase space dynamics using a sliding window analysis on the data sets, we study the climate variability in different spatial locations. The study brings out the variations in the complexity of the underlying dynamics as well as their heterogeneity across the locations in India. We find almost all locations indicate shifts to more irregular and stochastic dynamics for temperature data around 1972-79 and shifts back to more regular dynamics beyond 2000. These patterns correlate with reported shifts in the climate and Indian Summer Monsoon related to strong and moderate ENSO events and confirm their associated regional variability.</description>
