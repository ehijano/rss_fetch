      <title>Identity Testing for Stochastic Languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Determining whether an unknown distribution matches a known reference is a cornerstone problem in distributional analysis. While classical results establish a rigorous framework in the case of distributions over finite domains, real-world applications in computational linguistics, bioinformatics, and program analysis demand testing over infinite combinatorial structures, particularly strings. In this paper, we initiate the theoretical study of identity testing for stochastic languages, bridging formal language theory with modern distribution property testing.
  We first propose a polynomial-time algorithm to verify if a finite state machine represents a stochastic language, and then prove that rational stochastic languages can approximate an arbitrary probability distribution. Building on these representations, we develop a truncation-based identity testing algorithm that distinguishes between a known and an unknown distributions with sample complexity $\widetilde{\Theta}\left( \frac{\sqrt{n}}{\varepsilon^2} + \frac{n}{\log n} \right)$ where $n$ is the size of the truncated support. Our approach leverages the exponential decay inherent in rational stochastic languages to bound truncation error, then applies classical finite-domain testers to the restricted problem.
  This work establishes the first identity testing framework for infinite discrete distributions, opening new directions in probabilistic formal methods and statistical analysis of structured data.</description>

      <title>Componentwise Automata Learning for System Integration (Extended Version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compositional automata learning is attracting attention as an analysis technique for complex black-box systems. It exploits a target system's internal compositional structure to reduce complexity. In this paper, we identify system integration -- the process of building a new system as a composite of potentially third-party and black-box components -- as a new application domain of compositional automata learning. Accordingly, we propose a new problem setting, where the learner has direct access to black-box components. This is in contrast with the usual problem settings of compositional learning, where the target is a legacy black-box system and queries can only be made to the whole system (but not to components). We call our problem componentwise automata learning for distinction. We identify a challenge there called component redundancies: some parts of components may not contribute to system-level behaviors, and learning them incurs unnecessary effort. We introduce a contextual componentwise learning algorithm that systematically removes such redundancies. We experimentally evaluate our proposal and show its practical relevance.</description>

      <title>Membership and Conjugacy in Inverse Semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10103v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The membership problem for an algebraic structure asks whether a given element is contained in some substructure, which is usually given by generators. In this work we study the membership problem, as well as the conjugacy problem, for finite inverse semigroups. The closely related membership problem for finite semigroups has been shown to be PSPACE-complete in the transformation model by Kozen (1977) and NL-complete in the Cayley table model by Jones, Lien, and Laaser (1976). In the partial bijection model, the membership and the conjugacy problem for finite inverse semigroups were shown to be PSPACE-complete by Birget and Margolis (2008) and by Jack (2023).
  Here we present a more detailed analysis of the complexity of the membership and conjugacy problems parametrized by varieties of finite inverse semigroups. We establish dichotomy theorems for the partial bijection model and for the Cayley table model. In the partial bijection model these problems are in NC (resp. NP for conjugacy) for strict inverse semigroups and PSPACE-complete otherwise. In the Cayley table model we obtain general LOGSPACE-algorithms as well as NPOLYLOGTIME upper bounds for Clifford semigroups and LOGSPACE-completeness otherwise.
  Furthermore, by applying our findings, we show the following: the intersection non-emptiness problem for inverse automata is PSPACE-complete even for automata with only two states; the subpower membership problem is in NC for every strict inverse semi-group and PSPACE-complete otherwise; the minimum generating set and the equation satisfiability problems are in NP for varieties of finite strict inverse semigroups and PSPACE-complete otherwise.</description>
