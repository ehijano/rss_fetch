      <title>A remark concerning normal families and shared values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We improve well-known results concerning normal families and shared values of meromorphic functions in the plane. In particular, we get as a corollary that a meromorphic function $f \colon \C \to \Cd$ that shares a non-zero finite value with $f'$, and such that $f'$ is bounded on the preimages of $f$ for a second value, is normal.</description>

Abstract: Based on a judicious partitioning of the preimage of the pseudohyperbolic disk under the composition symbols, in this article, we show that the boundedness and compactness of the sum of two generalized weighted composition operators with different symbols and orders between Bergman spaces are properly determined by each of individual summands.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish that the $p$-conformal energy, $p\geq 1$, defined by the $L^p$-norms of the distortion of Sobolev mappings, is a proper functional on the Teichm\"uller space of Riemann surfaces of a fixed genus. This result is an application of a result herein identifying explicitly both the unique extremal mappings of finite distortion between hyperbolic annuli of given modulus, and their $p$-conformal energy.</description>

      <title>On the Fermat-type partial differential-difference equations on $\mathbb{C}^n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assume that $n$ is a positive integer, $p_{j}$ ($j=1,2, \cdots, 6)$ are polynomials, $p$ is an irreducible polynomial, and $f$ is an entire function on $\mathbb{C}^{n}.$ Let $ L(f)=\sum_{j=1}^s q_{t_j}f_{z_{t_j}}$ and $\overline{f}(z)=f(z_{1}+c_{1}, \ldots, z_{n}+c_{n})$, where $q_{t_j}$ ($j=1,2, \cdots, s\le n$) are non-zero polynomials on $\mathbb{C}^{n}$ and $c=(c_{1}, \ldots, c_{n})\in \mathbb{C}^{n}\setminus\{0\}$. We show the structures of all entire solutions to the non-linear partial differential-difference equation $$(p_{1} L(f)+p_{2}\overline{f}+p_5 f)^{2}+(p_{3}L(f)+p_{4}\overline{f}+p_6 f)^{2}=p.$$ The partial differential-difference equation is called a Fermat-type partial differential-difference equation (PDDE). Further, we find many sufficient conditions and/or necessary conditions for the existence, as well as the concrete representations, of entire solutions to the Fermat-type PDDE. We also demonstrate several examples on $\mathbb{C}^2$ with non-constant coefficients to verify that all representations in our theorems exist and are accurate and that the entire solutions to the Fermat-type PDDEs could have finite or infinite growth order. Our theorems unify and extend previous results (see, e.g., [2, 3, 10, 12, 32]).</description>

      <title>On boundary H\"{o}lder continuity of Sobolev and Orlicz-Sobolev classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study problems about estimates of distortion for mappings at boundary points of a domain. We consider mappings of the Sobolev and Orlicz-Sobolev classes and some other classes of mappings that do not preserve the boundary of the original domain. We establish estimates of the distortion of distance at boundary points. In particular, under certain conditions on the characteristics of the mappings, we show they are H\"{o}lder continuous in some neighborhoods of the boundary points. In the manuscript we consider both the case of good boundaries and domains with prime ends. We have obtained not only H\"{o}lder-type estimates, but also some more general ones under appropriate (more general) conditions on the characteristic.</description>

      <title>On Koebe's theorem for mappings with integral constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study mappings that satisfy the inverse modulus inequality of Poletsky type with respect to $p$-modulus. Given $n-1&lt;p\leqslant n,$ we show that, the image of some ball contains a fixed ball under mappings mentioned above. This statement can be interpreted as the well-known analogue of Koebe's theorem for analytic functions. As a consequence, we obtain the openness and discreteness of the limit mapping in the class under study. The paper also studies mappings of the Orlicz-Sobolev classes, for which an analogue of the Koebe one-quarter theorem is obtained as a consequence of the main results</description>

      <title>Definable Galois theory for bimeromorphic geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The outlines of a "Galois theory" for bimeromorphic geometry is here developed, via the study of model-theoretic definable binding groups in the theory CCM of compact complex spaces. As an application, a structure theorem about principal meromorphic bundles with algebraic structure group, and admitting no horizontal subvarieties, is deduced. Examples of algebraic groups arising as binding groups are provided, as is a characterisation of when they are linear. Using binding groups in CCM it is shown that, in contrast to the situation in differentially closed fields, there are many algebraic groups which admit nontrivial definable torsors over acl-closed sets in the theory DCCM of existentially closed differential CCM-structures. A self-contained exposition of the binding group theorem in totally transcendental theories, that emphasises the bitorsorial nature of the construction, is also included.</description>

      <title>Transverse slices and Zariski's multiplicity conjecture for quasihomogeneous surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study finitely determined, quasihomogeneous, corank 1 map germs $f$ from $(\mathbb{C}^2,0)$ to $(\mathbb{C}^3,0)$. We introduce the notion of the $\mu_{\boldsymbol{m},\boldsymbol{k}}$-minimal transverse slice of $f.$ Since this slice is a plane curve, we provide its (topological) normal form. In the irreducible case, under certain conditions, we prove that the number of characteristic exponents of the curve is upper semicontinuous. Furthermore, we show that every topologically trivial 1-parameter unfolding of $f=(f_1,f_2,f_3)$ (not necessarily with $\mu_{\boldsymbol{m},\boldsymbol{k}}$-minimal transverse slice) is of non-negative degree (i.e., for any additional term $\alpha$ in the deformation of $f_i$, the weighted degree of $\alpha$ is not smaller than the weighted degree of $f_i$). As a consequence, we present a proof of Zariski\' s multiplicity conjecture for families in this setting. Finally, under the $\mu_{\boldsymbol{m},\boldsymbol{k}}$-minimal transverse slice assumption, we show that Ruas\' conjecture holds.</description>

      <title>Toric geometry of generalized K\"ahler-Ricci solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01639v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a local equivalence between toric steady K\"ahler-Ricci solitons and $A$-type toric generalized K\"ahler-Ricci solitons (GKRS). Under natural global conditions we show this equivalence extends to complete GKRS, yielding a general construction of new examples in all dimensions. We show that in four dimensions, all GKRS are either described by the generalized K\"ahler Gibbons-Hawking ansatz, or have split tangent bundle, or are $A$-type toric. This yields a local classification in four dimensions, together with a conjecturally exhaustive construction of complete symplectic-type examples.</description>

      <title>The Conjugate Function Method for Surfaces with Elaborate Topological Types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The conjugate function method is an algorithm for numerical computation of conformal mappings for simply and multiply connected domains on surfaces. In this paper the conjugate function method is generalized and refined to achieve the same level of accuracy on simply and multiply connected planar domains and Riemann surfaces. The main challenge addressed here is the accurate and efficient construction of the conjugate problem for multiply connected domains. The method relies on high-order finite element methods which allow for highly accurate computations of mappings on surfaces, including domains of complex boundary geometry containing strong singularities and cusps. The efficacy of the proposed method is illustrated via an extensive set of numerical experiments with error estimates.</description>

Abstract: This note examines sufficient conditions for the quasiconformal extendibility of harmonic mappings defined in the unit disk. It is demonstrated that a harmonic strongly starlike mapping admits a quasiconformal extension to the entire plane, and an explicit formulation of its extension function is provided. Additionally, the quasiconformal extendibility of harmonic mappings defined in the exterior of the unit disk is explored.</description>

Abstract: We study the Lipschitz continuity of pluriharmonic Bloch mappings in the unit ball $\mathbb{B}^n$ with respect to the Bergman metric. We apply this to obtain a sufficient condition such that the composition operator on the pluriharmonic Bloch space is bounded below. As a partial converse, we also give a necessary condition for the boundedness (from below) of the composition operator on the Bloch space of holomorphic mappings in $\mathbb{B}^n$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2205.11235v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, the well-known relationship between theta functions and Heisenberg group actions thereon is resumed by combining complex algebraic and noncommutative geometric techniques in that we describe Hermitian-Einstein vector bundles on 2-tori via representations of noncommutative tori, thereby reconstructing Matsushima's setup and elucidating the ensuing Fourier-Mukai-Nahm (FMN) aspects. We prove the existence of noncommutative torus actions on the space of smooth sections of Hermitian-Einstein vector bundles on 2-tori preserving the eigenspaces of a natural Laplace operator. Motivated by the Coherent State Transform approach to theta functions, we extend the latter to vector valued thetas and develop an additional algebraic reinterpretation of Matsushima's theory making FMN-duality manifest again.</description>

      <title>Coupling of radial multiple SLE with Gaussian free field, and the hydrodynamic limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13622v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Schramm--Loewner evolution (SLE) has been one of the central topics in the probabilistic study of two-dimensional critical systems. It is a random curve in two dimensions to which a cluster interface in a critical lattice system is supposed, or has been proved, to converge. The most archetypical setting for SLE is called chordal, where a random curve evolves in a simply-connected domain from a boundary point to another, whereas in its variant called radial, a random curve evolves from a boundary point to a distinguished interior point. Multiple SLE is a variant to another direction; it deals with multiple random curves, and it is a natural direction as there are certainly multiple cluster interfaces found in critical lattice systems. In this paper, we study multiple SLE in the radial setting, namely, radial multiple SLE.
  We report two main results. One is regarding coupling between radial multiple SLE and Gaussian free field (GFF). Coupling between SLE and GFF has been extensively studied in the chordal setting, and serves as a foundation for many recent developments. We show that coupling between radial multiple SLE and GFF occurs if and only if the radial multiple SLE is driven by the circular Dyson Brownian motions.
  The circular Dyson Brownian motions are a typical example of stochastic log-gases. This fact motivates us to study the hydrodynamic limit of the corresponding radial multiple SLE, which refers to the dynamical law of large numbers, when the number of curves tends to infinity. In our other main result, we provide explicit description of the hydrodynamic limit.</description>
