      <title>Surprise non-detection of Upsilon Andromedae b with MIRC-X and MYSTIC at the CHARA Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ground-based long baseline interferometry is a powerful tool for characterizing exoplanets which are too close to their host star to be imaged with single-dish telescopes. The CHARA Array can resolve companions down to 0.5 milli-arcseconds, allowing us in principle to directly measure the near-infrared spectra of non-transiting "Hot Jupiter" exoplanets. We present data taken with the MIRC-X and MYSTIC instruments at the CHARA Array on the Hot Jupiter Upsilon Andromedae b. By resolving the star-planet system, we attempt to directly detect the flux from the planet. We describe our self-calibration methods for modeling systematics in the closure phase data, which allows us to reach sub-degree precision. Through combining multiple nights of data across two MIRC-X runs in 2019 and 2021, we achieved a very tentative detection of Ups And b in the H-band at a planet/star contrast of 2-3 x 10^-4. Unfortunately, we cannot confirm this detection with 2021 MYSTIC data in the K-band, or in a 2023 joint MIRC-X and MYSTIC dataset. We run updated global circulation models and create post-processed spectra for this planet, and report the resulting model spectra in H- and K-bands as a function of orbital phase. We then run planetary injection tests to explore H/K-band contrast limits, and find that we can confidently recover planets down to a planet/star contrast of 1-2 x 10^-4. We show that we are probing contrasts fainter than predicted by the model, making our non-detection surprising. We discuss prospects for the future in using this method to characterize companions with interferometry.</description>

      <title>Order-by-order Modeling of Exoplanet Radial Velocity Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise radial velocity (RV) measurements are a crucial tool for exoplanet discovery and characterization. Today, the majority of these measurements are derived from Echelle spectra in the optical wavelength region using cross-correlation techniques. Although for certain stars these approaches can produce RVs with sub-1 m~s$^{-1}$ measurement errors, for many others, we are now in a regime where instrumental precision is fundamentally below the intrinsic RV variations of the star that result from astrophysical processes that can be correlated in both time and wavelength. We explore new methods for measuring exoplanet orbital parameters that take advantage of the fact that RV data sets are fundamentally multi-wavelength. By analyzing NEID extremely precise radial velocity (EPRV) data of three known exoplanet systems, we show that fitting a single Keplerian model to multi-wavelength RVs can produce a factor of 1.5 -- 6.8 better $M_p \sin i$ uncertainties compared to fitting RVs that are derived from a weighted average across wavelength.</description>

      <title>Deuteration of water in protoplanetary discs during luminosity outbursts: model predictions for FU Ori discs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Luminosity outbursts of FU Ori-type objects (FUors) allow us to observe in the gas the molecules that are typically present in the ice in protoplanetary discs. In particular, the fraction of deuterated water, which is usually is mostly frozen in the midplane of a protoplanetary disc, has been measured for the first time in the gas of the disc around a FUor V883 Ori. We test the hypothesis that the observed high HDO/H$_{2}$O ratio in the V883 Ori protoplanetary disc can be explained by luminosity outbursts of different amplitude, including a series of two consecutive outbursts. Using the ANDES astrochemical code, we modelled the distributions of water and deuterated water abundances under the action of luminosity outbursts of different amplitudes (from 400 to 10 000 $L_{\odot}$) and at different stellar luminosities at the pre-outburst stage. We show that the best agreement with the observed HDO/H$_{2}$O profile is obtained for outburst amplitudes of 2 000 and 10 000 $L_{\odot}$, while the observed bolometric luminosity of V883 Ori does not exceed 400 $L_{\odot}$. We discuss possible reasons for this discrepancy, including the presence of past luminosity outbursts, the age of the star, and the influence of additional heating mechanisms in the midplane of the protoplanetary disc. We also consider how the high observed $\rm HDO/H_{2}O$ ratio may be related to the evolution of the chemical composition of the ice in the protoplanetary disc and the chemical processes activated under outburst conditions.</description>

      <title>Resolving star spots on WASP-85 A using high-resolution transit spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar surface inhomogeneities such as spots and faculae introduce Doppler variations that challenge exoplanet detection via the radial velocity method. While their impact on disc-integrated spectra is well established, detailed studies of the underlying local line profiles have so far been limited to the Sun. We present an observational campaign targeting the active star WASP-85 A during transits of its hot Jupiter companion. The transits span two stellar rotation periods, allowing us to probe the evolution of active regions. From ground-based photometry we identify seven active regions, six containing dark spots. Using simultaneous ESPRESSO transit spectroscopy, we spatially resolve these regions on the stellar surface by using the planet as a probe. We detect significant bisector shape changes, line broadening, and net redshifts during spot occultations, with velocity shifts of 108-333 m/s (mean uncertainty 50 m/s). The observed broadening is consistent with the Zeeman effect, implying magnetic field strengths (Stokes $I$) $B$ = 2.7-4.4 kG (mean uncertainty 0.6 kG), comparable to solar umbrae. Combined with our photometric spot model, this yields lower limits to the disc-integrated field $Bf = 16 \pm 3$ G and $61 \pm 9$ G for the two hemispheres probed -- at least three times higher than Sun-as-a-star values. We also measure centre-to-limb variations in FWHM, line depth, equivalent width, and convective blueshift, which broadly agree with solar observations and 3D MHD models. This work demonstrates a new way to characterise the surfaces of exoplanet host stars, paving the way for future analyses incorporating synthetic line profiles from 3D MHD simulations.</description>

      <title>Estimating Orbital Parameters of Direct Imaging Exoplanet Using Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a new flow-matching Markov chain Monte Carlo (FM-MCMC) algorithm for estimating the orbital parameters of exoplanetary systems, especially for those only one exoplanet is involved. Compared to traditional methods that rely on random sampling within the Bayesian framework, our approach first leverages flow matching posterior estimation (FMPE) to efficiently constrain the prior range of physical parameters, and then employs MCMC to accurately infer the posterior distribution. For example, in the orbital parameter inference of beta Pictoris b, our model achieved a substantial speed-up while maintaining comparable accuracy-running 77.8 times faster than Parallel Tempered MCMC (PTMCMC) and 365.4 times faster than nested sampling. Moreover, our FM-MCMC method also attained the highest average log-likelihood among all approaches, demonstrating its superior sampling efficiency and accuracy. This highlights the scalability and efficiency of our approach, making it well-suited for processing the massive datasets expected from future exoplanet surveys. Beyond astrophysics, our methodology establishes a versatile paradigm for synergizing deep generative models with traditional sampling, which can be adopted to tackle complex inference problems in other fields, such as cosmology, biomedical imaging, and particle physics.</description>

      <title>Formation of super-Earths around low-mass stars: evolution of an icy dead zone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exoplanet observations show that close-in super-Earths are more common around M-dwarfs than around solar mass stars. Since the snow line in a protoplanetary disc plays a crucial role in determining the amount of solid material available for planet formation, we explore the icy regions of protoplanetary discs around stars with masses 0.1, 0.5 and 1 $\rm M_\odot$. In a protoplanetary disc, a dead zone, where the magneto-rotational instability (MRI) is suppressed, provides a quiescent region for solids to settle to the mid-plane and planets to form. Viscosity may be driven in the dead zone by gravitational instability if enough material builds up. Heating from the gravitational instability can trigger the MRI and an accretion outburst onto the star. There may be two icy regions in a disc: (1) far from the star and (2) in the dead zone close to the star. We solve the 1D disc equations to find steady state solutions and time-dependent evolution with different values for the critical surface density in the MRI-active surface layers. Larger surface density in the MRI-active surface layers reduces the extent and lifetime of the inner icy region. The inner icy region in the dead zone around a solar mass star is small and short-lived. Around M-dwarfs, the size of the inner icy region is more persistent and oscillates between the accretion outbursts in the region 0.1-1 au. An extended icy region within the dead zone of a disc around M-dwarfs may promote the formation of more numerous and massive close-in super-Earths.</description>

      <title>A High-Resolution Spectroscopic Survey of Directly Imaged Companion Hosts: II. Diversity in C/O Ratios among Host Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The era of JWST has enabled measurements of abundances of elements such as C, O, and even Na, S, K, and Fe in planetary atmospheres to very high precisions ($\sim$0.1 dex). Accurate inference of planet formation using these elemental abundances require the corresponding abundance measurements for the host star. We present the second set of results from our high-resolution spectroscopic survey of directly imaged companion host stars, measuring abundances of 16 elements (including C, O, Na, Mg, Si, S, K and Fe) for five directly imaged companion host stars. Using both the spectral fitting and the equivalent width methods, we find solar C/O ratios for HR 2562 (0.58 $\pm$ 0.09), AB Pic (0.50 $\pm$ 0.14), and YSES 1 (0.45 $\pm$ 0.05), and sub-solar C/O ratios for PZ Tel (0.28 $\pm$ 0.05) and $\beta$ Pic (0.22 $\pm$ 0.06). The $4\sigma$ sub-solar C/O detections for PZ Tel and $\beta$ Pic highlight the importance of accurate stellar C/O estimates for constraining planet formation. Subsequently, we combine our abundances with those from our previous work to measure population-level average elemental abundances. We find super-solar carbon and oxygen for this stellar population, indicating that the protoplanetary disks around these stars were potentially rich in volatiles. We compare stellar C/O to those of their companions, revealing super-stellar C/O for several objects that suggest planet-like formation mechanisms. We also compare the C/O of our directly imaged companion host star population with other planet host stars using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test, which indicates insufficient evidence to differentiate between the various stellar populations</description>

      <title>Trade-off Analysis for Lunar Augmented Navigation Service (LANS) Constellation Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The establishment of a sustainable human presence on the Moon demands robust positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) services capable of supporting both surface and orbital operations. This paper presents a comprehensive trade-off analysis of lunar frozen-orbit constellations for the Lunar Augmented Navigation Service (LANS), focusing on how the number of satellites and orbital parameters influence coverage, position dilution of precision (PDOP), orbit determination accuracy, receiver noise, and orbit insertion cost. Three Walker-constellation families based on frozen elliptical and circular orbits are examined to characterize their relative advantages across different semi-major axes and inclinations. Results show that larger semi-major axes enhance both polar and global coverage, though the optimal inclination depends on the constellation type and target service region. The south elliptical lunar frozen orbit (ELFO) Walker constellation provides superior performance for polar coverage and PDOP, whereas the circular lunar frozen orbit (CLFO) Walker configuration achieves the best global uniformity. Orbit determination errors and receiver noise both increase with larger semi-major axes and higher inclinations, reflecting weaker geometric observability and reduced received signal power at apolune for eccentric orbits. Orbit insertion analysis reveals clear trade-offs among transfer duration, characteristic energy ($C_3$) at trans-lunar injection, and insertion $\Delta V$: shorter transfers require higher insertion $\Delta V$, while low-energy transfers achieve smaller $\Delta V$ at the cost of months-long durations and higher $C_3$. These findings provide a systematic framework for designing LANS constellations for both regional and global coverage.</description>

      <title>Searching for Exotrojans in Pulsar Binary Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trojan asteroids are found in the equilateral triangle Lagrange points of the Sun-Jupiter system in great number, though they also exist less prolifically in other Sun-planet systems. Despite up to planetary mass Trojans being predicted in extrasolar systems (i.e. exotrojans), they remain largely unconfirmed, though with recent strong candidate evidence emerging. We turn the current search for exotrojans to radio pulsars with low-mass companions ($\sim0.01\,\rm{M}_\odot$) using accurately measured pulse times of arrival. With techniques developed for detecting the reflex motion of a star due to a librating Trojan, we place reasonable mass constraints ($\sim 1\,\rm{M}_\oplus$) on potential exotrojans around binary pulsars observed in the NANOGrav 15-year data set. We find weak evidence consistent with $\sim1\,\rm{M}_{\rm J}$ exotrojans in the PSR~J0023+0923 and PSR~J1705$-$1903 systems, though the signals likely have a different, unknown source. We also place a libration-independent upper mass constraint of $\sim8$\,M$_{\rm J}$ on exotrojans in the PSR~1641+8049 binary system by looking for an inconsistency between the times of superior conjunction as measured by optical light curves and those predicted by radio timing.</description>

      <title>Readout of Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detector (MKID) Arrays for Habitable Worlds Observatory Using a Polyphase Filterbank Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO), a nextgeneration ultraviolet/optical/infrared space telescope, will require detector technologies capable of supporting substantially larger pixel-count arrays than those flown on previous missions. Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detectors (MKIDs) provide a scalable solution through microwave multiplexing and have already been demonstrated in balloon-borne instruments using Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) for real-time signal processing. A central element of MKID readout is the Polyphase Filter Bank (PFB) spectrometer, which converts digitized timedomain signals into finely resolved frequency channels for subsequent analysis. To meet the demands for broader bandwidths and higher spectral resolution driven by emerging science goals, efficient FPGA-based implementations of the PFB are essential. This work presents current results from a fixed-point digital design methodology for deploying the PFB architecture on spacequalified FPGAs. The approach emphasizes efficient resource utilization and numerical precision while satisfying stringent performance constraints, enabling scalable, high-resolution spectral processing for future space observatories and remote sensing applications.</description>

      <title>Dynamically New Comet C/2025 D1 (Groeller) with Record Perihelion Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09829v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We studied C/2025 D1 (Groeller), a long-period comet with an unprecedented perihelion distance of 14.1 au, using archival observations. The data reveals that it had been active at inbound heliocentric distances $r_{\rm H} \gtrsim 20$ au. Initially, the comet intrinsically brightened at $r_{\rm H} \gtrsim 16$ au, with brightening parameters comparable to those of other long-period comets. However, observations after late 2023 showed a gradual decay, despite the inbound trajectory of the comet. To our knowledge, such behaviours have not been observed for other long-period comets at similar heliocentric distances. We speculate that this might be linked to the onset of CO$_{2}$ sublimation and/or crystallisation processes. Alternatively, the activity source might have been exhausted. The surface brightness profile of the coma indicates a steady-state mass loss, implying supervolatile sublimation as the primary driver of the observed activity. Despite changes in the orbital plane angle, the circularly symmetric coma persisted throughout the observed period, indicative of the dominance of large grains in the coma. Assuming the activity trend is independent of bandpass, we found that comet was redder than many other solar system comets. Our model-dependent constraint estimates the nucleus radius to be $\gtrsim\!0.4$ km. We performed astrometric measurements, refined the orbital solution, and derived the original and future orbits of the comet. Our N-body integration, accounting for the Galactic tide, strongly favours that the comet is dynamically new, with its previous perihelion at $\gtrsim\!60$ au from the Sun $\gtrsim\!6$ Myr ago. It is highly likely that the comet will be lost from our solar system after the current apparition.</description>

Abstract: Under the core-accretion model, gas giants form via runaway accretion. This process starts when the mass of the accreted envelope becomes equal to the mass of the core. Here, we model a population of warm sub-Saturns to search for imprints of their formation history in their internal structure. Using the GAS gianT modeL for Interiors (GASTLI), we calculate a grid of interior structure models on which we perform retrievals for our sample of 28 sub-Saturns to derive their envelope mass fractions ($f_{env}$). For each planet, we run three different retrievals assuming low (-2.0 &lt; log(Fe/H) &lt; 0.5), medium ( 0.5 &lt; log(Fe/H) &lt; 1.4), and high (1.4 &lt; log(Fe/H) &lt; 1.7) atmospheric metallicity. The distribution of $f_{env}$ in our sample is then compared to predictions of planet formation models. When compared to the outcomes of a planetesimal accretion model, we find that we require medium to high atmospheric metallicities to reproduce the simulated planet population. Additionally, we find a bimodal distribution of $f_{env}$ in our sample with a gap that is located at different values of $f_{env}$ for different atmospheric metallicities. For the high atmospheric metallicity case, the gap in the $f_{env}$ distribution is located between 0.5 and 0.7, which is consistent with assumptions by the core-accretion model where runaway accretion starts when $M_{env} \approx M_{core}$ ($f_{env} \sim 0.5$). We also find a bimodal distribution of the hydrogen and helium mass fraction ($f_{H/He}$) with a gap at $f_{H/He} = 0.3$. The location of this gap is independent of the assumed atmospheric metallicity. Lastly, we compare the distributions of our sub-Saturns in the Neptunian savanna to a population of sub-Saturns in the Neptune desert and ridge. We find that the observed $f_{env}$ distribution of savanna and ridge sub-Saturns is consistent with the planets coming from the same underlying population.</description>

      <title>Atmospheric Dispersion Measurement at Hanle Site</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17300v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Atmospheric dispersion introduces wavelength-dependent effects that significantly impact ground-based observations, particularly in slit- and fibre-fed spectroscopic studies. These effects reduce the signal entering the spectrograph and introduce systematic errors in radial velocity measurements. To address this challenge, atmospheric dispersion correctors are utilised. However, many existing designs of these correctors, which are based on theoretical models, often lack practical validation and consistency. The forthcoming National Large Optical Telescope (NLOT) will be installed at Hanle, a site known for its favourable astronomical sky conditions. Thus, the design of an effective dispersion corrector for the instruments on the NLOT, specifically one that compensates for the measured dispersion, is crucial. For the first time, we have directly measured atmospheric dispersion at the Hanle site using the Himalayan Faint Object Spectrograph mounted on the Himalayan Chandra Telescope. In this study, we present our methodology, the dispersion measurements obtained within the 400 to 700 nm wavelength range, and a comparison with modelled dispersion values.</description>
