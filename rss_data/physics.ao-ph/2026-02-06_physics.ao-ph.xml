      <title>Large-Ensemble Simulations Reveal Links Between Atmospheric Blocking Frequency and Sea Surface Temperature Variability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atmospheric blocking events drive persistent weather extremes in midlatitudes, but isolating the influence of sea surface temperature (SST) from chaotic internal atmospheric variability on these events remains a challenge. We address this challenge using century-long (1900-2010), large-ensemble simulations with two computationally efficient deep-learning general circulation models. We find these models skillfully reproduce the observed blocking climatology, matching or exceeding the performance of a traditional high-resolution model and representative CMIP6 models. Averaging the large ensembles filters internal atmospheric noise to isolate the SST-forced component of blocking variability, yielding substantially higher correlations with reanalysis than for individual ensemble members. We identify robust teleconnections linking Greenland blocking frequency to North Atlantic SST and El Ni\~no-like patterns. Furthermore, SST-forced trends in blocking frequency show a consistent decline in winter over Greenland, and an increase over Europe. These results demonstrate that SST variability exerts a significant and physically interpretable influence on blocking frequency and establishes large ensembles from deep learning models as a powerful tool for separating forced SST signals from internal noise.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Origin of Degree-Day Scaling in Phase-Change Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase transitions impose topological constraints on thermodynamic state variables, masking energetic fluctuations at the phase boundary. This constraint is most apparent in melting systems, where temperature remains pinned despite continued energy input. Here we resolve this information loss by introducing a latent temperature-a counterfactual trajectory describing the system's unconstrained thermal evolution. We show that energy conservation alone enforces a rigorous duality between the total latent heat dissipated during phase change and the accumulated exceedance of the latent temperature above the melting point. This duality is mathematically equivalent to the one-dimensional Wasserstein-1 distance between the latent and observed temperature trajectories, with the transport cost set by a characteristic surface dissipation timescale and melting energy. Applied to ice-sheet surface melting, this timescale admits a direct physical interpretation in terms of radiative and turbulent heat loss. The same framework yields a first-principles derivation of the empirical Positive Degree Day law and predicts realistic degree-day factors that emerge from surface energy balance, without ad hoc calibration. More broadly, phase change emerges as an optimal transport process that projects continuous energetic variability onto a constrained thermodynamic boundary.</description>

      <title>Reduced-Order Surrogates for Forced Flexible Mesh Coastal-Ocean Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While POD-based surrogates are widely explored for hydrodynamic applications, the use of Koopman Autoencoders for real-world coastal-ocean modelling remains relatively limited. This paper introduces a flexible Koopman autoencoder formulation that incorporates meteorological forcings and boundary conditions, and systematically compares its performance against POD-based surrogates. The Koopman autoencoder employs a learned linear temporal operator in latent space, enabling eigenvalue regularization to promote temporal stability. This strategy is evaluated alongside temporal unrolling techniques for achieving stable and accurate long-term predictions. The models are assessed on three test cases spanning distinct dynamical regimes, with prediction horizons up to one year at 30-minute temporal resolution. Across all cases, the Koopman autoencoder with temporal unrolling yields the best overall accuracy compared to the POD-based surrogates, achieving relative root-mean-squared-errors of 0.01-0.13 and $R^2$-values of 0.65-0.996. Prediction errors are largest for current velocities, and smallest for water surface elevations. Comparing to in-situ observations, the surrogate yields -0.65% to 12% change in water surface elevation prediction error when compared to prediction errors of the physics-based model. These error levels, corresponding to a few centimeters, are acceptable for many practical applications, while inference speed-ups of 300-1400x enables workflows such as ensemble forecasting and long climate simulations for coastal-ocean modelling.</description>

      <title>Depth estimation of a monoharmonic source using a vertical linear array at fixed distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimating the depth of a monoharmonic sound source at a fixed range using a vertical linear array (VLA) is challenging in the absence of seabed environmental parameters, and relevant research remains scarce. The orthogonality constrained modal search based depth estimation (OCMS-D) method is proposed in this paper, which enables the estimation of the depth of a monoharmonic source at a fixed range using a VLA under unknown seabed parameters. Using the sparsity of propagating normal modes and the orthogonality of mode depth functions, OCMS-D estimates the normal mode parameters under a fixed source-array distance at first. The estimated normal mode parameters are then used to estimate the source depth. To ensure the precision of the source depth estimation, the method utilizes information on both the amplitude distribution and the sign (positive/negative) patterns of the estimated mode depth functions at the inferred source depth. Numerical simulations evaluate the performance of OCMS-D under different conditions. The effectiveness of OCMS-D is also verified by the Yellow Sea experiment and the SWellEx-96 experiment. In the Yellow Sea experiment, the depth estimation absolute errors by OCMS-D with a 4-second time window are less than 2.4 m. And the depth estimation absolute errors in the SWellEx-96 experiment with a 10-second time window are less than 5.4 m for the shallow source and less than 10.8 m for the deep source.</description>

      <title>Quantification of the cascading tipping probability from the AMOC to the Amazon rainforest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13383v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Amazon rainforest and the AMOC are considered to be tipping elements: they are important components of the Earth system, but may collapse under climate change. Moreover, an AMOC collapse may favor the transition of the rainforest to a degraded forest by influencing the precipitation patterns over the Amazon. This phenomenon is known as tipping cascade and better understanding it is key to anticipating the impact of tipping events. Here, we investigate in a coupled conceptual AMOC-Amazon model the probability that an AMOC weakening affects tree cover loss in two regions of the rainforest. To get more insight into the mechanisms behind the tipping cascade, we also analyze the dynamics of both systems and their evolution during the Amazon transition. Namely, we track the transition probability and the transition time of the Amazon, and reconstruct the distribution of AMOC strength at every stage of this transition. These tasks require a large ensemble simulation, containing in particular a large number of transitions. Since such events may be too rare to be sampled by direct numerical simulation, the collapse of both systems is studied using TAMS, a "rare-event" algorithm designed to efficiently sample rare transitions. We find that, in the northwest of Brazil, a transition of the Amazon rainforest to a degraded forest within 200 years is very unlikely. However, in this region, such transition can only occur after an AMOC collapse, which would have a large drying effect that favors the development of extreme wildfires.</description>
