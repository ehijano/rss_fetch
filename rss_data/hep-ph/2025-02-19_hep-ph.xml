      <title>Searching For Superheavy Decaying Particles With Ultra-High-Energy Neutrino Observatories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If there exist unstable but long-lived relics of the early universe, their decays could produce detectable fluxes of gamma rays and neutrinos. In this paper, we point out that the decays of superheavy particles, $m_{\chi} \gtrsim 10^{10} \, \text{GeV}$,would produce an enhanced flux of ultra-high-energy neutrinos through the processes of muon and pion pair production in the resulting electromagnetic cascades. These processes transfer energy from electromagnetic decay products into neutrinos, relaxing the constraints that can be derived from gamma-ray observations, and increasing the sensitivity of high-energy neutrino telescopes to superheavy particle decays. Taking this into account, we derive new constraints on long-lived superheavy relics from the IceCube Neutrino Observatory, and from the Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope. We find that IceCube-Gen2, and other next generation neutrino telescopes, will provide unprecedented sensitivity to the decays of superheavy dark matter particles and other long-lived relics.</description>

      <title>Filtered cogenesis of PBH dark matter and baryons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel cogenesis of baryon and dark matter (DM) in the Universe by utilising a first-order phase transition (FOPT) in the dark sector containing an asymmetric Dirac fermion $\chi$. Due to the mass difference of $\chi$ across the bubble walls, it is energetically favourable for $\chi$ to get trapped in the false vacuum leading to the formation of Fermi-ball, which can self-collapse to form primordial black hole (PBH) if $\chi$ has a sufficiently large Yukawa interaction. While such PBH formed out of false vacuum collapse can give rise to the DM in the Universe, a tiny amount of asymmetric $\chi$ leaking into the true vacuum through the bubble walls can transfer the dark asymmetry into the visible sector via decay. The same mass difference of $\chi$ across the two minima which decides the amount of trapping or filtering of $\chi$, also allows $\chi$ decay into visible sector in the true minima while keeping it stable in the false vacuum. Our filtered cogenesis scenario can be probed via FOPT generated stochastic gravitational waves (GW) at near future detectors in addition to the well-known detection aspects of asteroid mass PBH constituting DM in the Universe.</description>

      <title>Total Drell-Yan in the flavorful SMEFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a global analysis of Drell-Yan production of charged leptons and dineutrinos, the latter in missing energy plus jet events, in proton-proton collisions within the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). The combination allows for the removal of flat directions, sharper limits and to probe more couplings than the individual observables, which we show performing a fit to LHC-data. We also find that limits have only mild dependence on lepton flavor patterns; hierarchies in quark flavors are driven by the parton distribution functions. The strongest constraints are on couplings involving the first and second generation quarks, exceeding 10 TeV. Combining flavor and high-$p_T$ data, the limits on electroweak and gluon dipole operators can be improved, by up to a factor of three, highlighting once more that a more global approach increases sensitivities significantly. We also estimate the improvements in reach over existing data for the high-luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) by $\sim 1.5$, and future collider options such as the high-energy LHC (HE-LHC) by $\sim 3$ and FCC-hh by $\sim 8$. To maximize the new physics reach kinematic cuts and binning needs to be adjusted to each quark-flavor separately.</description>

      <title>A Precise Determination of $\alpha_s$ from the Heavy Jet Mass Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A global fit for $\alpha_s(m_Z)$ is performed on available $e^+e^-$ data for the heavy jet mass distribution. The state-of-the-art theory prediction includes $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^3)$ fixed-order results, N$^3$LL$^\prime$ dijet resummation, N$^2$LL Sudakov shoulder resummation, and a first-principles treatment of power corrections in the dijet region. Theoretical correlations are incorporated through a flat random-scan covariance matrix. The global fit results in $0.1145^{+0.0021}_{-0.0019}$, compatible with similar determinations from thrust and $C$-parameter. Dijet resummation is essential for a robust fit, as it engenders insensitivity to the fit-range lower cutoff; without resummation the fit-range sensitivity is overwhelming. In addition, we find evidence for a negative power correction in the trijet region if and only if Sudakov shoulder resummation is included.</description>

      <title>Multiple realizations of modular flavor symmetries and their phenomenology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We point out that specifying the finite modular group does not uniquely fix a modular flavor symmetry. We illustrate this using the finite modular group $T'$. Otherwise equivalent models based on different $T'$ lead to modular forms with different properties and, hence, produce different phenomenological features. We exemplify this in various scenarios, and show that the ability of a given model to accommodate mass and other observed hierarchies depends sensitively on the way the $T'$ is implemented.</description>

      <title>New Physics versus Quenching Factors in Coherent Neutrino Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent results on the Coherent Elastic Neutrino-Nucleus Scattering (CE$\nu$NS) on germanium present significant discrepancies among experiments. We perform a combined analysis of the Dresden-II, CONUS+ and COHERENT data, quantifying the impact of quenching factor uncertainties on their CE$\nu$NS cross section measurement. No choice of quenching factor can bring these three data sets into mutual agreement, whereas the combination of COHERENT with either Dresden-II or CONUS+ agrees well albeit for very different quenching factors. We further study the quenching factor dependence on the sensitivity of these experiments to a large neutrino magnetic moment, finding that the constraints can vary by up to an order of magnitude. Our work highlights the importance of reducing this uncertainty on quenching factors in order to probe new physics from neutrinos at the low-energy frontier.</description>

      <title>Searching for exotic scalars at fusion reactors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The energy created in deuterium-tritium fusion reactors originates from a high-intensity neutron flux interacting with the reactor's inner walls. The neutron flux can also be used to produce a self-sustaining reaction by lining the walls with lithium-rich `breeding blankets', in which a fraction of neutrons interacts with lithium, creating the tritium fuel. The high-intensity neutron flux can also result in the production of dark sector particles, feebly interacting light scalars or pseudoscalars, via nuclear transitions within the breeding blanket. We estimate the potential size of such dark sector flux outside the reactor, taking into account all current constraints, and consider possible detection methods at current and future thermonuclear fusion reactors. As a by-product, we also recast the SNO axion bound for a CP even scalar. We find that year-long searches at current and future reactors can set leading constraints on dark scalar -- and dark pseudoscalar -- nucleon couplings.</description>

      <title>Bubble wall velocity for first-order QCD phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although the QCD phase transition is a crossover in the standard model, nonstandard effects such as a large lepton asymmetry are known to make it first order, with possible applications to gravitational wave production. This process is sensitive to the speed of the bubble walls during the phase transition, which is difficult to compute from first principles. We take advantage of recent progress on wall speed determinations to provide a simple estimate which constrains the wall speed to be significantly lower than what has been used in previous literature. This in turn strongly suppresses the production of gravitational waves, to a level that is just out of reach of the most sensitive projected experiment for this signal, $\mu$Ares.</description>

      <title>Considering momentum dependence of heavy quarks interaction rate in calculating drag coefficient, and its impact on energy loss of b and c quarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines the effect of heavy particle momentum on their scattering frequency and calculates the drag coefficient by expanding the energy loss terms as polynomial expansions of momentum ($p$). This approach allows for a more precise investigation of momentum dependence of drag coefficient by incorporating the linear terms of these expansions. Additionally, the influence of particle's momentum on radiative and collisional energy loss is more clearly determined. The study focuses on calculation of the nuclear modification factor ($R_{AA}$) of charm and bottom quarks in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{S_{NN}} = 5.02 \: TeV$. The results are compared with the latest data from ALICE and ATLAS experiments, conducted in 2021 and 2022. In this article, the initial distribution functions have been evolved numerically based on the Fokker-Planck equation.</description>

      <title>Quantum-mechanical numerical model of interaction between dark atom and nucleus of substance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hypothesis of composite $XHe$ dark atoms may provide solution to the long-standing problem of direct searches for dark matter particles. The main problem of the $XHe$ dark atom is its ability to strongly interact with the nucleus of substance, arising from the unshielded nuclear attraction between the helium nucleus and the nucleus of matter. It is assumed that in order to prevent the destruction of the bound structure of dark atom, the effective potential of interaction between $XHe$ and the nucleus of substance must have dipole Coulomb barrier that prevents the fusion of dark matter atom particles with the nucleus of substance. The problem in describing the interaction between dark atom and substance nucleus is the three-body problem, for which an exact analytical solution is not available. Consequently, to assess the physical meaning of the proposed scenario, it is essential to develop a numerical approach. Our approach involves consistently developing an accurate quantum mechanical description of this three-body system, comprising bound dark atom and the external nucleus of substance. We incorporate the necessary effects and interactions to enhance the precision of the results, which helps to elucidate the most significant aspects of the proposed dark atom scenario.</description>

      <title>Contributions from the color-octet matrix elements to the $\overline{B}$ ${\to}$ ${\pi}{\pi}$ decays with QCD factorization approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the ${\pi}{\pi}$ puzzle in nonleptonic $B$ decays in the time of high-precision and huge-data for particle physics, we restudy the $\overline{B}$ ${\to}$ ${\pi}{\pi}$ decays with QCD factorization approach. An additional contributions from the color-octet current matrix elements (COCME) which are unnoticed in almost all the previous calculation, are taken into consideration and parameterized by $X$. It is found that (1) form factor $F_{0}^{B{\pi}}$ ${\approx}$ $0.22$ is favored by the available latest measurements. (2) The COCME contributions are helpful to interpret the experimental data on branching ratios rather than $CP$ asymmetries for the $\overline{B}$ ${\to}$ ${\pi}{\pi}$ decays.</description>

      <title>$\lambda$ and $\rho$ trajectories for the doubly heavy baryons in the diquark picture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the explicit form of the Regge trajectory relations for the doubly heavy baryons $\Xi_{QQ'}$ and $\Omega_{QQ'}$ $(Q,Q'=b,c)$ in the diquark picture. Using the derived Regge trajectory relations, we estimate the masses of the $\lambda$-excited states and the $\rho$-excited states, which are consistent with other theoretical predictions. Both the $\lambda$-trajectories and $\rho$-trajectories are discussed. We show that the $\rho$-trajectories behave differently from the $\lambda$-trajectories. Specifically, the $\rho$-trajectories behave as $M{\sim}x_{\rho}^{2/3}$ $(x_{\rho}=n_r,l)$, whereas the $\lambda$-trajectories follow $M{\sim}x_{\lambda}^{1/2}$ $(x_{\lambda}=N_r,L)$. By using the obtained relations, the baryon Regge trajectory provides a straightforward and easy method for estimating the spectra of both the $\lambda$-excited states and $\rho$-excited states.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we extend our previous work on the $D^*\bar{D}^*$ molecular states with the $J^{PC}=0^{++}$, $1^{+-}$ and $2^{++}$ to investigate their two-body strong decays via the QCD sum rules based on rigorous quark-hadron duality. We obtain the partial decay widths therefore total widths of the ground states with the $J^{PC}=0^{++}$, $1^{+-}$ and $2^{++}$, which indicate that it is reasonable to assign the $X_2(4014)$ as the $D^*\bar{D}^*$ tetraquark molecular states with the $J^{PC}=2^{++}$.</description>

      <title>Quantum entanglement of final particle states in the resonant trident pair production in a strong electromagnetic wave</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12619v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The resonant trident pair production process in the collision of ultrarelativistic electrons with a strong electromagnetic wave is theoretically studied. Under resonant conditions, the intermediate virtual gamma-quantum becomes real. As a result, the original resonant trident pair production process effectively splits into two first-order processes by the fine structure constant: the electromagnetic field-stimulated Compton-effect and the electromagnetic field-stimulated Breit-Wheeler process. The kinematics of the resonant trident pair production process are studied in detail. It is shown that there are two different cases for the energies and outgoing angles of final particles (an electron and an electron-positron pair) in which their quantum entanglement is realized. In the first case, the energy and outgoing angles of final ultrarelativistic particles are uniquely determined by the parameters of the electromagnetic field-stimulated Compton-effect (the outgoing angle of the final electron and the quantum parameter of the Compton effect). In the second case, the energy and outgoing angles of final particles are uniquely determined by the electromagnetic field-stimulated Breit-Wheeler process (the electron-positron pair outgoing angle and the Breit-Wheeler quantum parameter). It is shown that in a sufficiently wide range of frequencies and intensities of a strong electromagnetic wave, and in the case of ultrarelativistic initial electrons, the differential probability of the resonant trident pair production process with simultaneous registration of the outgoing angles of final particles can significantly (by several orders of magnitude) exceed the total probability of the electromagnetic field-stimulated Compton-effect.</description>

      <title>Zee-Babu model in a non-holomorphic modular $A_4$ symmetry and modular stabilization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a Zee-Babu neutrino model in a non-holomorphic modular $A_4$ symmetry, and we construct a model so that there are minimum free parameters (two complex parameters). We find only the normal hierarchy is allowed. Moreover, the allowed region to satisfy the neutrino oscillation data is localized at nearby $\tau=\omega$. The small absolute deviation plays a crucial role in fitting two mixings of $s^2_{23}$ and $s^2_{12}$. In addition, we obtain several predictions on Majorana and Dirac CP phases, and neutrinoless double beta decay as shown in our chi square numerical analysis. We also study modulus stabilization within the framework of non-supersymmetric models. In the end, we compute the expansion of modular forms at nearby $\tau=\omega$ in the Appendix so that one can apply them for a model and understand its analytical structure.</description>

      <title>Large CP Asymmetries from Final-State Interactions in Charmful Baryonic Decays of $B^0 \to \Xi_c^+ \overline{\Xi}_c^-$ and $B_s^0 \to \Lambda_c^+ \overline{\Lambda}_c^-$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the direct CP asymmetries in the decays of $B^0 \to \Xi_c^+ \overline{\Xi}_c^-$ and $B_s^0 \to \Lambda_c^+ \overline{\Lambda}_c^-$, emphasizing the critical role of final-state interactions (FSIs). In these channels, the small energy release suppresses short-distance contributions while enhancing long-distance effects. By separating the decay amplitudes into S and P waves, we show that the P-wave component, carrying only a single weak phase, contributes negligibly to CP asymmetries. In contrast, the S-wave amplitude, strongly modified by FSIs, acquires a substantial strong phase that enables interference among multiple weak phases, producing large CP-violating effects. Numerically, we find sizable asymmetries of $a_{CP}^{\text{dir}}= 0.65_{-0.34}^{+0.33}$ for $B^0 \to \Xi_c^+ \overline{\Xi}_c^-$ and $a_{CP}^{\text{dir}}= 0.26_{-0.15}^{+0.31}$ for $B_s^0 \to \Lambda_c^+ \overline{\Lambda}_c^-$, where the main uncertainties stem from poorly measured hadron couplings. These results, combined with the relatively large branching fractions, make these modes prime targets for experimental searches at LHCb and Belle II, potentially offering new insights into strong dynamics and nonperturbative QCD in heavy-hadron decays.</description>

Abstract: We study the impact of $q \bar q' W$ and $q \bar q' WH$ interactions, originating from dimension-six operators of the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), on the Higgs boson associated production $pp \to W^+H$ at the LHC.

      <title>Universality and emergent effective fluid from jets and string breaking in the massive Schwinger model using tensor networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the correlation between the energy, momentum and spatial entanglement produced by two luminal jets in the massive Schwinger model. Using tensor network methods, we show that for m/g &gt; 1/{\pi}, in the vicinity of the strong to weak coupling transition, a nearly perfect and chargeless effective fluid behavior appears around the mid-rapidity region with a universal energy-pressure relationship. The evolution of energy and pressure is strongly correlated with the rise of the spatial entanglement entropy, indicating a key role of quantum dynamics. Some of these observations may be used to analyze high multiplicity jet fragmentation events, energy-energy and energy-charge correlators at current collider energies.</description>

      <title>Resonant axion-plasmon conversion in neutron star magnetospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resonant axion-plasmon conversion in the magnetospheres of magnetars may substantially impact the landscape of dark-matter axion detection. This work explores how resonant axion-plasmon conversion, through a mechanism that is analogous to the Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein (NSW) effect in neutrinos, modify the expected radio signals from axion-photon conversions observed on Earth. Critically, the resonant conversion radius lies within the region expected for axion-photon conversion, introducing a nonradiative power loss that diminishes the anticipated photon flux. Our analysis demonstrates that this effect can reduce radio telescope sensitivities, shifting them into regions excluded by previous experiments. These findings compel a reassessment of experimental constraints derived from radio signatures of axion-photon conversions and highlight the necessity of accounting for plasmon effects in astrophysical axion searches. The presented corrections provide critical insights for refining the detection strategies of future telescope-based dark matter axion experiments.</description>

      <title>Inverse Seesaw Mechanism and Axion Portal Fermionic Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a minimal extension of the Standard Model (SM) that addresses both the smallness of neutrino masses and the dark matter (DM) puzzle via the inverse seesaw mechanism and an axion portal fermionic DM. This model generates light neutrino masses without requiring high energy scales, enhancing its testability in future collider experiments. An axion-like particle (ALP) connects the SM and DM sectors, yielding a distinct phenomenology and a positive contribution to the muon anomalous magnetic moment $(g-2)$ anomaly. Our analysis shows that the model is consistent with constraints from neutrino oscillations, DM relic density, and indirect detection, as well as providing a solution to the $g-2$ anomaly. The TeV-scale scalar sector and ALP interactions suggest potential signals in collider experiments and astrophysical observations. This work offers a unified framework to address neutrino masses and DM, with implications for particle physics and cosmology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12192v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kaon condensation in hyperon-mixed matter [($Y$+$K$) phase], which may be realized in neutron stars, is discussed on the basis of chiral symmetry. With the use of the effective chiral Lagrangian for kaon--baryon and kaon--kaon interactions; coupled with the relativistic mean field theory and universal three-baryon repulsive interaction, we clarify the effects of the $s$-wave kaon--baryon scalar interaction simulated by the kaon--baryon sigma terms and vector interaction (Tomozawa--Weinberg term) on kaon properties in hyperon-mixed matter, the onset density of kaon condensation, and the equation of state with the ($Y$+$K$) phase. In particular, the quark condensates in the ($Y$+$K$) phase are obtained, and their relevance to chiral symmetry restoration is discussed.</description>

      <title>Constraining circular polarization of high-frequency gravitational waves with CMB</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Circular polarization in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) offers a promising probe of the parity-violating physics of the early universe. In this paper, we propose a novel method to constrain the primordial circular polarization of high-frequency gravitational waves (GW) in the GHz range. An efficient conversion of gravitons to photons in a transverse cosmological magnetic field at the epoch of last scattering can generate excess chiral photons if the GW background is chiral in nature. This excess radiation distorts the CMB thermal black-body spectrum, which can be estimated by measuring the V-Stokes parameter in the CMB polarization. Using current upper limits on the angular power spectrum of circular polarization $C_l^{VV}$ from the CLASS, MIPOL, and SPIDER experiments, we obtain the most stringent constraints on the characteristic strain and circular polarization of the isotropic background of stochastic GWs at ${40\,\rm GHz}$ and ${150\,\rm GHz}$, respectively. Our work, therefore, provides an interesting possibility to constrain the circular polarization of high-frequency GWs using the V-mode polarization measurements of CMB.</description>

      <title>Detecting stochastic gravitational wave background from cosmic strings with next-generation detector networks: Component separation based on a multi-source astrophysical foreground noise model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) from cosmic strings is crucial for unveiling the evolutionary laws of the early universe and validating non-standard cosmological models. This study presents the first systematic evaluation of the detection capabilities of next-generation ground-based gravitational wave detector networks for cosmic strings. By constructing a hybrid signal model incorporating multi-source astrophysical foreground noise, including compact binary coalescences (CBCs) and compact binary hyperbolic encounters (CBHEs), we propose an innovative parameter estimation methodology based on multi-component signal separation. Numerical simulations using one-year observational data reveal three key findings: (1) The CE4020ET network, comprising the Einstein Telescope (ET-10 km) and the Cosmic Explorer (CE-40 km and CE-20 km), achieves nearly one order of magnitude improvement in constraining the cosmic string tension $G\mu$ compared to individual detectors, reaching a relative uncertainty $\Delta G\mu / G\mu &lt; 0.5$ for $G\mu &gt; 3.5 \times 10^{-15}$ under standard cosmological framework; (2) The network demonstrates enhanced parameter resolution in non-standard cosmological scenarios, providing a novel approach to probe pre-Big Bang Nucleosynthesis cosmic evolution; (3) Enhanced detector sensitivity amplifies CBHE foreground interference in parameter estimation, while precise modeling of such signals could further refine $G\mu$ constraints by $1-2$ orders of magnitude. This research not only quantifies the detection potential of third-generation detector networks for cosmic string models but also elucidates the intrinsic connection between foreground modeling precision and cosmological parameter estimation accuracy, offering theoretical foundations for optimizing scientific objectives of next-generation gravitational wave observatories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a neural network training method capable of accounting for the effects of systematic variations of the data model in the training process and describe its extension towards neural network multiclass classification. The procedure is evaluated on the realistic case of the measurement of Higgs boson production via gluon fusion and vector boson fusion in the $\tau\tau$ decay channel at the CMS experiment. The neural network output functions are used to infer the signal strengths for inclusive production of Higgs bosons as well as for their production via gluon fusion and vector boson fusion. We observe improvements of 12 and 16% in the uncertainty in the signal strengths for gluon and vector-boson fusion, respectively, compared with a conventional neural network training based on cross-entropy.</description>

      <title>Initial-state-driven spin correlations in high-energy nuclear collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the study of spin-polarization phenomena in heavy-ion collisions, it is typically assumed that final-state particles are polarized through thermal vorticity and shear. In this sense, polarization is a final-state effect. Here, we propose a different mechanism. We postulate that the collision of spin-carrying nucleons generates an initial transverse spin density, inducing a net polarization of the QCD fireball along a random direction. If the net spin is conserved throughout the evolution of the fireball, the final-state particles should exhibit measurable polarization. Within a wounded nucleon picture, we estimate that initial-state fluctuations induce a net polarization of $\Lambda$ baryons which is around $1\%$ in central collisions and over $10\%$ in noncentral collisions, significantly exceeding the contributions from thermal vorticity and shear. We introduce a two-particle angular correlation observable designed to reveal initial net-spin fluctuations, and emphasize the main signatures to look for in experiments. We argue that the discovery of these phenomena would have profound implications for nuclear structure and our understanding of spin in relativistic hydrodynamics.</description>

Abstract: We initiate the study of `bubbletrons', by which we mean ultra-high-energy collisions of the particle shells that generically form at the walls of relativistic bubbles in cosmological first-order phase transitions (PT). As an application, we calculate the maximal dark matter mass $M_{DM}$ that bubbletrons can produce in a $U(1)$ gauge PT, finding $M_{DM} \sim 10^5/10^{11}/10^{15}$ GeV for PT scales $v_\phi \sim 10^{-2}/10^3/10^9$ GeV. Bubbletrons realise a novel link between ultra-high-energy phenomena and gravitational waves (GW) sourced at the PT, from nanohertz to megahertz frequencies.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00758v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study focuses on the decay of the $B_c$ meson to S-wave charmonia. Starting with lattice inputs on $B_c\to J/\psi$ form factors, we have obtained the $B_c\to\eta_c$ form factors using heavy quark spin symmetry (HQSS) relations between the associated form factors after parametrizing and extracting the possible symmetry breaking corrections. Using the $q^2$ shapes of these form factors, we have computed the branching fractions $\mathcal{B}(B_c^-\to \eta_c\ell^-\bar{\nu})$ (with $\ell =\tau, \mu (e)$) and the decay rate distributions and have predicted the Standard model estimate for the observable $R(\eta_c)=\Gamma(B_c^-\to \eta_c\tau^-\bar{\nu})/\Gamma(B_c^-\to \eta_c\mu^-\bar{\nu}) =0.310 \pm 0.042$. In addition, we have estimated the radial wave functions $\psi_{B_c}^R(0)$, $\psi_{J/\psi}^R(0)$ and $\psi_{\eta_c}^R(0)$ at small quark-antiquark distances from the available information on the form factors from lattice, the lattice inputs on the decay constants $f_{J/\psi}$, $f_{\eta_c}$, $f_{B_c}$ and experimental data on radiative and rare decays of the $J/\psi$ and $\eta_c$ mesons. To do so, we choose the theory framework of non-relativistic QCD (NRQCD) effective theory. Using our results, we have predicted the branching fractions of a few non-leptonic decays of $B_c \to J/\psi$ or $\eta_c$ and other light mesons. We have also updated the numerical estimates of the cross sections $\sigma(e^+e^- \to J/\psi \eta_c, \eta_c\gamma)$ and predicted the branching fractions of $Z$ boson decays to either $J/\psi$ or $\eta_c$ final states or both.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04846v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use QCD kinetic theory to compute dilepton production coming from the pre-equilibrium phase of the Quark-Gluon Plasma created in high-energy heavy-ion collisions. We demonstrate that the dilepton spectrum exhibits a simple scaling in terms of the specific shear viscosity $\eta/s$ and entropy density $dS/d\zeta \sim {\scriptstyle \left(T\tau^{1/3}\right)_\infty^{3/2}}$, which can be derived from dimensional analysis in the presence of a pre-equilibrium attractor. Based on this scaling we perform event-by-event calculations of in-medium dilepton production and determine the invariant mass range where the pre-equilibrium yield is the leading contribution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16091v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Foundation Models are neural networks that are capable of simultaneously solving many problems. Large Language Foundation Models like ChatGPT have revolutionized many aspects of daily life, but their impact for science is not yet clear. In this paper, we use a new Foundation Model for hadronic jets to solve three key challenges in collider physics. In particular, we show how experiments can (1) save significant computing power when developing reconstruction algorithms, (2) perform a complete uncertainty quantification for high-dimensional measurements, and (3) search for new physics with model agnostic methods using low-level inputs. In each case, there are significant computational or methodological challenges with current methods that limit the science potential of deep learning algorithms. By solving each problem, we take jet Foundation Models beyond proof-of-principle studies and into the toolkit of practitioners.</description>

      <title>Modified hybrid inflation in no-scale SUGRA with suppressed $R$-symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05702v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A well-motivated cosmological hybrid inflation scenario based on no-scale SUGRA is considered. It is demonstrated that an extra suppressed $R$-symmetry breaking term $S^n$ with $n\geq 4$ needs to be included in order to realize successful inflation. The resulting potential is found to be similar (but not identical) to the one in the Starobinsky inflation model. A relatively larger tensor-to-scalar ratio $r\sim 10^{-2}$ and a spectral index $n_s\approx 0.965$ are obtained, which are approximately independent of $n$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13610v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Next-to-leading-order (NLO) quantum electrodynamics (QED) corrections to the production of muon and tau pairs in photon-photon collisions, $\gamma\gamma\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-},\tau^{+}\tau^{-}$, are calculated in the equivalent photon approximation. We mostly consider $\gamma\gamma$ processes in ultraperipheral collisions of hadrons at the LHC, but the $\gamma\gamma\to\tau^{+}\tau^{-}$ process in $\mathrm{e}^+\mathrm{e}^-$ collisions at LEP is also discussed. The NLO terms are found to modify the total fiducial cross sections by up to 5%, increasing the tails of the dilepton acoplanarity and transverse momentum distributions, and depleting by up to 15% the yields at high masses, with respect to the leading-order predictions including the very small virtuality of the colliding photons. At the LHC, the calculations obtained with the charge form factor for protons and lead ions including the NLO QED corrections improve the data--theory agreement for all measured differential distributions, and prove an indispensable ingredient for the extraction of precision quantities in photon-photon processes, such as the anomalous magnetic moment of the tau lepton.</description>

      <title>$\rm{SU}(3)_F$ sum rules for CP asymmetry of $D_{(s)}$ decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03227v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Charge-parity (CP) asymmetries in charm decays are extremely suppressed in the Standard Model and may well be dominated by new physics contributions. The LHCb collaboration reported the results of direct CP asymmetry measurements in $D^0\to K^+ K^-$ and $D^0\to \pi^+\pi^-$ decays with unprecedented accuracy: $a_{\rm{CP}}(K^+ K^-)=(7.7\pm5.7)\times 10^{-4}$ and $a_{\rm{CP}}(\pi^+\pi^-)=(23.2\pm6.1)\times 10^{-4}$, with the latter quantity inferred from the precise measurement of $\Delta a_{\rm{CP}} =\, a_{\rm{CP}}(K^+ K^-) -a_{\rm{CP}}(\pi^+\pi^-) =\, (-15.7\pm2.9)\times 10^{-4}$. When interpreted within the Standard Model, these values indicate a breakdown of the approximate $U$-spin symmetry of QCD. If, however, this symmetry holds and the data stem from new physics, other CP asymmetries should be enhanced as well. We derive CP asymmetry sum rules based on $\rm{SU}(3)$ flavor symmetry for $D$ meson decays into a pair of pseudoscalar mesons as well as a pair of a pseudoscalar and a vector meson for two generic scenarios, with $\Delta U=0$ and $|\Delta U|=1$ interactions, respectively. The correlations implied by the sum rules can be used to check the consistency between different measurements and to discriminate between these scenarios with future data. For instance, we find $a_{\mathrm{CP}}(\pi^{+}K^{* 0}) + a_{\mathrm{CP}}(K^{+}\overline{K}^{* 0}) = 0$ for $\Delta U=0$ new physics and the opposite relative sign for the $|\Delta U|=1$ case. One sum rule, connecting four decay modes, holds in both scenarios. We further extend our sum rules to certain differences of CP asymmetries from which the $D$ production asymmetries drop out.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06788v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute baryon and electric charge deposition in high-energy heavy-ion collisions using the Color Glass Condensate (CGC) Effective Field Theory, where at leading order charge is deposited through multiple scatterings of valence quarks with a saturated gluon target. A simplified phenomenological formula is derived to describe charge deposition, from which the parametrical dependence with collisional energy and geometry can be extracted. We present an approximate analytical prediction of the so-called baryon stopping parameter $\alpha_B$, which shows excellent agreement with the state-of-the art extractions of $\alpha_B$ from experimental data. These results are further validated using the McDIPPER framework, by computing charge deposition at midrapidity across a range of collision energies ($\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}= 62.4 - 5020$ GeV).</description>

      <title>Axion effects on gamma-ray spectral irregularities. II: Implications of EBL absorption</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14791v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The extragalactic background light (EBL) plays a crucial role in the propagation of high-energy particles throughout the Universe. In this work, we explore the impact of the EBL absorption effect on photon to axionlike particle (ALP) conversions from the very-high-energy gamma-ray spectral irregularities. For our purpose, we select four BL Lac blazars: Markarian 501, 1ES 0229+200, PKS 0301-243, and PKS 0447-439 for analysis. Their redshifts range from approximately 0.03 to 0.34. We first discuss the EBL absorption effect on the gamma-ray spectral energy distributions (SEDs) using three common EBL spectral models: Finke-10, Franceschini-17, and Saldana-Lopez-21. Then we consider the photon-ALP conversions in astrophysical magnetic fields. The best-fit chi-square distributions of these EBL models under the ALP assumption in the ALP parameter $\{m_a, g_{a\gamma}\}$ plane are provided, showing similar distributions. For comparison, we define a new delta chi-square, $\chi_d^2$, to quantify the difference in chi-square values. The distributions of $\chi_d^2$ and the gamma-ray SEDs corresponding to the maximum delta chi-square, $\chi^2_{d, \rm max}$, are also presented for comparison. Our results indicate that the influence of these different EBL models is non-dominant at the low-redshift gamma-ray axionscope. In these cases, choosing the latest model, Saldana-Lopez-21, is sufficient. However, as the redshift of the sources increases, this influence becomes more significant.</description>

      <title>Spin dynamics with realistic hydrodynamic background for relativistic heavy-ion collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08223v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The equations of perfect spin hydrodynamics are solved for the first time using a realistic (3+1)-dimensional hydrodynamic background, calibrated to reproduce a comprehensive set of hadronic observables, including rapidity distributions, transverse momentum spectra, and elliptic flow coefficients for Au+Au collisions at the beam energy of $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = 200$ GeV. The spin dynamics is governed by the conservation of the spin tensor, describing spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ particles, with particle mass in the spin tensor treated as an effective parameter. We investigate several scenarios, varying both the effective mass and the initial evolution time for the spin polarization tensor. The model predictions are then compared with experimental measurements of global and longitudinal spin polarization of Lambda hyperons. Our results indicate that a successful description of the data requires a delayed initial evolution time for the perfect spin hydrodynamics of about 4 fm/$c$ (in contrast to the standard initial time of 1 fm/$c$ used for the hydrodynamic background). This delay marks a transition from the phase where spin-orbit interaction is significant to the regime where spin-conserving processes dominate. Our findings suggest that the spin-orbit dissipative interaction plays a significant role only in the very early stages of the system's evolution.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from supercooled phase transitions in conformal Majoron models of neutrino mass</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02645v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study supercooled first-order phase transitions above the QCD scale in a wide class of conformal Majoron-like U(1)' models that explain the totality of active neutrino oscillation data and produce a detectable stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) at LIGO, LISA and ET. We place constraints on the U(1)' breaking scale and gauge coupling using current LIGO-Virgo-Kagra data. We find that strong supercooling can be ruled out in large regions of parameter space if a SGWB is not detected by these experiments. A null signal at LIGO and ET will disfavor a type-I seesaw scale above $10^{14}$ GeV, while a positive signal is a signature of heavy right-handed neutrinos. On the other hand, LISA will be sensitive to seesaw scales as low as a TeV, and could detect a SGWB even if the right-handed neutrinos are decoupled.</description>

      <title>In Search of an Invisible $Z^\prime$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07694v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider extending the Standard Model by an anomaly-free and possibly flavour non-universal $U(1)_X$ gauge symmetry, whose breaking gives a $Z^\prime$ boson that does not affect electroweak precision observables at tree-level or via 1-loop renormalisation group (RG) running. Provided it does not also couple to electrons, such a $Z^\prime$ boson would be largely invisible to an electroweak precision machine like FCC-ee or CEPC (up to small finite 1-loop matching contributions that we quantify). We show that, while this class of $Z^\prime$ models can also evade tests of quark flavour violation, the constraint of anomaly-cancellation implies that valence quarks, muons, and taus are all charged under $U(1)_X$, with the up quark charge being necessarily large. The conclusion holds even if one augments the SM by three right-handed neutrinos to try and absorb anomalies. This means such $Z^\prime$ bosons cannot simultaneously hide below the TeV scale from $pp \to \ell\ell$ Drell--Yan measurements at the LHC and, even if we entertain esoteric models in which the lepton charges are numerically very small, we cannot escape dijet searches at the LHC. For equitable quark and lepton charges, $pp\to\ell\ell$ already excludes such a $Z^\prime$ up to $M/g \gtrsim$ 10 TeV, with a reach of 20 TeV expected by the end of the High-Luminosity LHC. The dijet bounds currently sit around 5 TeV, while sensitivity up to 10 TeV could be achieved at HL-LHC. We thus find an excellent complementarity between FCC-ee and HL-LHC in covering all anomaly-free $Z^\prime$ bosons up to several TeV.</description>

Abstract: Taking clue from the minimal structure of texture 4-zero hermitian mass matrices, which are very successful in accommodating quark mixing data, we propose a form of texture 2-zero complex symmetric neutrino mass matrix with only one phase parameter. This minimal mass matrix not only accommodates the available neutrino oscillation data, but also makes interesting predictions for the unknown parameters like the lightest neutrino mass $m_{\nu_1}$ (for normal ordering(NO)), Jarlskog's rephasing invariant $J_{CP}$, Dirac type CP violating phase $\delta_{CP}$ and effective neutrino mass $\left&lt; m_{ee} \right&gt;$. We also explore the correlations between the parameters of the model, that lead us to minimizing the parameters further.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20774v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most studies on baryon number violating (BNV) processes in the literature focus on free or bound nucleons in nuclei, with limited attention given to the decay of bound atoms. Given that hydrogen is the most abundant atom in the universe, it is particularly intriguing to investigate the decay of hydrogen atom as a means to probe BNV interactions. In this study, for the first time, we employ a robust effective field theory (EFT) approach to estimate the decay widths of two-body decays of hydrogen atom into standard model particles, by utilizing the constraints on the EFT cutoff scale derived from conventional nucleon decay processes. We integrate low energy effective field theory (LEFT), chiral perturbation theory (ChPT), and standard model effective field theory (SMEFT) to formulate the decay widths in terms of the LEFT and SMEFT Wilson coefficients (WCs), respectively. By applying the bounds on the WCs from conventional nucleon decays, we provide a conservative estimate on hydrogen BNV decays. Our findings indicate that the bounds on the inverse partial widths of all dominant two-body decays exceed $10^{44}$ years. Among these modes, the least constrained diphoton decay $\Hy\to \gamma\gamma$ might be astrophysically interesting, although the monochromatic photon signal from our Sun is difficult to detect with current near-Earth telescopes.</description>

Abstract: We study nonequilibrium spin dynamics in differentially rotating systems, deriving an effective Hamiltonian for conduction electrons in the comoving frame. In contrast to conventional spin current generation mechanisms that require vorticity, our theory describes spins and spin currents arising from differentially rotating systems regardless of vorticity. We demonstrate the generation of spin currents in differentially rotating systems, such as liquid metals with Taylor-Couette flow. Our alternative mechanism will be important in the development of nanomechanical spin devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04076v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we aim to explore the interplay between neutrinos and quantum gravity, illustrating some proposals about the use of these particles as probes for the supposed quantized structure of spacetime. The residual signatures of a more fundamental theory of quantum gravity can manifest themselves modifying the free particle dispersion relations and the connected velocity. In neutrino sector these supposed effects can modify the time of flight for astrophysical particles with different energies and can affect the usual neutrino oscillation pattern introducing species depending perturbations. We will highlight how perturbations caused by non-standard interactions in the solar neutrino sector can mimic the presumed quantum gravity effects. In fact, the mathematical formulation of non-standard interactions is equivalent to that of CPT-odd perturbations. We will, therefore, emphasize the need to identify the nature of different contributions in order to disentangle them in the search for quantum gravity effects. As a final point we will discuss the possibility to detect in the neutrino sector decoherence effects caused by the quantum gravity supposed perturbations. By reviewing current experimental constraints and observations, we seek to shed light on the intricate relationship between neutrinos and quantum gravity, and discuss the challenges and future directions in this fascinating field of research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06681v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been shown that some Lorentz-invariant quantum field theories, such as those with higher-dimensional operators with negative coefficients, lead to superluminality on some classical backgrounds. While superluminality by itself is not logically inconsistent, these theories also predict the formation of closed time-like curves at the classical level, starting from initial conditions without such curves. This leads to the formation of a Cauchy Horizon which prevents a complete description of the time evolution of such systems. Inspired by the chronology protection arguments of General Relativity, we show that quantum mechanical effects from low energy quanta strongly backreact on such configurations, exciting unknown short-distance degrees of freedom and invalidating the classical predictions. Thus, there is no obvious low-energy obstruction to the existence of these operators.</description>

      <title>Effects of the Lorentz symmetry violation on relativistic neutral scalar bosons: Scattering and bound states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14624v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this letter, we investigate the effects of Lorentz symmetry violation on a relativistic neutral scalar boson within the framework of the Klein-Gordon formalism. We consider a tensor $(K_F)_{\mu \nu \alpha \beta}$ out of the Standard Model Extension, which describes the field configuration consisting of a constant magnetic field $\vec{B}=B\hat{z}$ and a cylindrical electric field $\vec{E}=\frac{\lambda}{r}\hat{r}$. We analyze and discuss the effects of Lorentz symmetry violation on the equation of motion and show that the presence of a specific Lorentz symmetry violation parameter is essential to obtain analytical solutions for scattering and bound states. Employing the partial wave approach in cylindrical coordinates, we calculate the relativistic phase shift, scattering amplitude and $S$-matrix, and discuss the effects of Lorentz symmetry violation on the phase shift. Furthermore, we obtain bound-state solutions by examining the poles of the $S$-matrix and compare our findings with those reported in the literature. Our results reveal that bound-state solutions are only feasible for a restrict range of Lorentz symmetry violation parameters, which contradict previous studies.</description>

Abstract: We compute the conservative and radiation-reaction contributions to classical observables in the gravitational scattering between a spinning and a spinless black hole to the fourth order in spin and third order in the gravitational constant. The conservative results are obtained from two-loop amplitudes for the scattering process of a massive scalar with a massive spin-$s$ field $(s=0, 1, 2)$ minimally coupled to gravity, employing the recently introduced spin interpolation method to resolve all spin-Casimir terms. The two-loop amplitude exhibits a spin-shift symmetry in both probe limits, which we conjecture to be a sign of yet unknown integrability of Kerr orbits through the quartic order in spin and to all orders in the gravitational constant. We obtain the radial action from the finite part of the amplitude and use it to compute classical observables, including the impulse and spin kick. This is done using the recently introduced covariant Dirac brackets, which allow for the computation of classical scattering observables for general (non-aligned) spin configurations. Finally, employing the radiation-reaction amplitude proposed by Alessio and Di Vecchia, together with the Dirac brackets, we obtain radiation-reaction contributions to observables at all orders in spin and beyond the aligned-spin limit. We find agreement with known results up to the quadratic order in spin for both conservative and radiation-reaction contributions. Our results advance the state of the art in the understanding of spinning binary dynamics in general relativity and demonstrate the power and simplicity of the Dirac bracket formalism for relating scattering amplitudes to classical observables.</description>
