      <title>Calculations of some doping nanostructurations and patterns improving the functionality of high-temperature superconductors for bolometer device applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the effects of doping nanostructuration and the patterning of thin films of high-temperature superconductors (HTS) with the aim of optimizing their functionality as sensing materials for resistive transition-edge bolometer devices (TES). We focus, in particular, on spatial variations of the carrier doping into the CuO$_2$ layers due to oxygen off-stoichiometry, (that induce, in turn, critical temperature variations) and explore following two major cases of such structurations: First, the random nanoscale disorder intrinsically associated to doping levels that do not maximize the superconducting critical temperature; our studies suggest that this first simple structuration already improves some of the bolometric operational parameters with respect to the conventional, nonstructured HTS materials used until now. Secondly, we consider the imposition of regular arrangements of zones with different nominal doping levels (patterning); we find that such regular patterns may improve the bolometer performance even further. We find one design that improves, with respect to nonstructured HTS materials, both the saturation power and the operating temperature width by more than one order of magnitude. It also almost doubles the response of the sensor to radiation.</description>

      <title>Dimensional crossovers in the Gaussian critical fluctuations above $T_c$ of two-layer and three-layer superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By using a Ginzburg-Landau functional in the Gaussian approximation, we calculate the energy of superconducting fluctuations above the transition, at zero external magnetic field, of a system composed by a small number $N$ of parallel two-dimensional superconducting planes, each of them Josephson coupled to its first neighbour, with special focus in the $N=2$ and $3$ cases. This allows us to obtain expressions for the critical contributions to various observables (fluctuation specific heat and magnetic susceptibility and Aslamazov-Larkin paraconductivity). Our results suggest that these systems may display deviations from pure 2D behaviour and interesting crossover effects, with both similitudes and differences to those known to occur in infinite-layers superconductors. Some challenges for future related research are also outlined.</description>

      <title>Low-temperature mean valence of nickel ions in pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of high critical temperature (Tc) superconductivity in pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ has ignited renewed excitement in the search of novel high-Tc superconducting compounds with 3d transition metals. Compared to other ambient-pressure superconductors, such as copper-oxide and iron-oxypnictides, unraveling the mechanisms of the pressure-induced superconductivity poses significant and unique challenges. A critical factor in this phenomenon seems to be related to the electronic configuration of 3d orbitals, which may play a fundamental role in driving high-Tc superconductivity. However, the pressure effects on the mixed-valence states of 3d-orbital cations and their influence on the emergence of high-Tc superconductivity remain poorly understood. Here, we use high-pressure (P) and low-temperature synchrotron X-ray absorption spectroscopy to investigate the influence of pressure on the mean valence change of Ni ions in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. Our results demonstrate that at a low-temperature of 20 K, the mean valence remains relatively stable across the pressures range from 1 atm to 40 GPa. Based on analyzing the absorption data, we find that, at a critical pressure, the ambient-pressure ordered phases disappear and both the structural and the superconducting phase transition occur. The pressure-induced structural phase transition revealed by our absorption results is consistent with that determined by X-ray diffraction, offering new information for a comprehensive understanding on the pressure-induced superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.</description>

      <title>Gap Anisotropy in Layered Superconductors Due to Rashba and Dresselhaus Spin-Orbit Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theory of layered superconductors is extended in the presence of Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit interactions (SOIs). Using the intralayer BCS-like pairing interaction and employing the Gor'kov formalism, we obtain analytical expressions for the temperature Green's functions and determine the gap function $\Delta$ which becomes complex in the presence of SOIs. In the absence of SOIs, $\Delta$ is isotropic at both zero and finite temperatures, but it becomes anisotropic even in the presence of a single SOI. This anisotropy is related to the extra $\cos{k_z}$ factors in which the $k_z$ momentum along the $z$ direction contributes to the magnitude of the gap function. It is also found that SOIs suppress $\Delta$ at both zero and finite temperatures, and for certain critical values of SOIs and beyond $\Delta$ vanishes. Analytical expressions for the critical values of SOIs at zero temperature are obtained. Additionally, how the BCS equation for layered superconductors changes in the presence of SOIs is determined.</description>

      <title>Ultralow-temperature heat transport evidence for residual density of states in the superconducting state of CsV3Sb5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The V-based kagome superconductors $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ ($A$ = K, Rb, and Cs) host charge density wave (CDW) and a topological nontrivial band structure, thereby provide a great platform to study the interplay of superconductivity (SC), CDW, frustration, and topology. Here, we report ultralow-temperature thermal conductivity measurements on CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ and Ta-doped Cs(V$_{0.86}$Ta$_{0.14}$)$_3$Sb$_5$ and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) measurements on CsV$_3$Sb$_5$. The finite residual linear term of thermal conductivity at zero magnetic field suggests the existence of a residual density of states (DOS) in the superconducting state of CsV$_3$Sb$_5$. This is supported by the observation of non-zero conductance at zero bias in STM spectrum at an electronic temperature of 90 mK. However, in Cs(V$_{0.86}$Ta$_{0.14}$)$_3$Sb$_5$, which does not have CDW order, there is no evidence for residual DOS. These results show the importance of CDW order for the residual DOS, and a nodal $s$-wave gap or residual Fermi arc may be the origin of the residual DOS in such an unusual multiband kagome superconductor, CsV$_3$Sb$_5$.</description>

      <title>Infinitely Stable Disordered Systems on Emergent Fractal Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In quenched disordered systems, the existence of ordering is generally believed to be only possible in the weak disorder regime (disregarding models of spin-glass type). In particular, sufficiently large random field is expected to prohibit any finite temperature ordering. Here, we show that this is not necessarily true. We provide physically motivated examples of systems in which disorder induces an ordering that is *infinitely stable* in the sense that: (1) there exists ordering at arbitrarily large disorder strength and (2) the transition temperature remains, asymptotically, nonzero in the limit of infinite disorder. The ordering is spatially localized on the boundary of a disorder-induced, emergent percolating fractal structure. The examples we give are most naturally described when the spatial dimension $d \ge 3$, but can also be formulated when $d=2$, provided that the underlying graph is non-planar.</description>

      <title>Contemporary implementations of spiking bio-inspired neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The extensive development of the field of spiking neural networks has led to many areas of research that have a direct impact on people's lives. As the most bio-similar of all neural networks, spiking neural networks not only allow the solution of recognition and clustering problems (including dynamics), but also contribute to the growing knowledge of the human nervous system. Our analysis has shown that the hardware implementation is of great importance, since the specifics of the physical processes in the network cells affect their ability to simulate the neural activity of living neural tissue, the efficiency of certain stages of information processing, storage and transmission. This survey reviews existing hardware neuromorphic implementations of bio-inspired spiking networks in the "semiconductor", "superconductor" and "optical" domains. Special attention is given to the possibility of effective "hybrids" of different approaches</description>

      <title>Altermagnetic Spin-Splitting Magnetoresistance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recently discovered altermagnets, featured by the exotic correlation of magnetic exchange interaction and alternating crystal environments, have offered exciting cutting-edge opportunities for spintronics. Here, we report the experimental observation of an altermagnetic spin-splitting magnetoresistance effect, which is driven by a spin current associated with the giant nonrelativistic spin splitting of an altermagnet. The spin current polarization and the corresponding magnetic field direction associated with the magnetoresistance extrema are largely determined by the Neel vector of the altermagnet, leading to a remarkable phase shift compared to that driven by a conventional relativistic spin current. Our work opens a door to unearthing luxuriant nonrelativistic quantum states of matter in emergent materials with unconventional spin degeneracy lifting.</description>

      <title>Quantum Anharmonic Effects on the Superconductivity of I-43m CH4-H3S at High Pressures: a First-Principles Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Making use of first-principles calculations we analyze the effect of quantum ionic fluctuations and lattice anharmonicity on the crystal structure and superconductivity of I-43m CH4-H3S, one of the lowest enthalpy structures in the C-S-H system, in the 150-300 GPa pressure range within the stochastic self-consistent harmonic approximation. We predict a correction to the crystal structure, which is formed by an H3S lattice and CH4 molecules, the phonon spectra, and the pressure-dependent superconducting critical temperatures, which have been estimated in previous calculations without considering ionic fluctuations on the crystal structure and assuming the harmonic approximation for the lattice dynamics. Our results show that quantum ionic fluctuations have an impact on the distance between H atoms and S atoms in the H3S host lattice, pushing it towards more symmetric bonds, while the methane molecules are barely affected. According to our anharmonic phonon spectra, this structure is dynamically stable above 150 GPa, which is 30 GPa lower than the pressure at which the harmonic approximation predicts the emergence of an instability. As a consequence of the strong anharmonic enhancement of the phonon frequencies, the electron-phonon coupling constant is suppressed by 46% at 200 GPa, and even more at lower pressures. As a result, the superconducting critical temperature is overestimated by around 50 K at 200 GPa, such that it falls below 150 K in the whole pressure range studied. Our results underline that ternary hydrides are subject to strong anharmonic effects on their structural, vibrational, and superconducting properties.</description>

      <title>Self-doped Molecular Mott Insulator for Bilayer High-Temperature Superconducting La3Ni2O7</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The bilayer structure of recently discovered high-temperature superconducting nickelates La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ provides a new platform for investigating correlation and superconductivity. Starting from a bilayer Hubbard model, we show that there is a molecular Mott insulator limit forming by the bonding band owing to Hubbard interaction and large interlayer coupling. This molecular Mott insulator becomes self-doped from electrons transferred to the antibonding bands at a weaker interlayer coupling strength. The self-doped molecular Mott insulator is similar to the doped Mott insulator studied in cuprates. We propose La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ is a self-doped molecular Mott insulator, whose molecular Mott limit is formed by two nearly degenerate antisymmetric $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and $d_{z^2}$ orbitals. Partial occupation of higher energy symmetric $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital leads to self-doping, which may be responsible for high-temperature superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.</description>

      <title>Binding zero modes with fluxons in Josephson junctions of time-reversal invariant topological superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14277v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the joint dynamics of the phase bias $\phi$ and the propagating Majorana fermions of the edge modes in Josephson junctions containing 2D time-reversal invariant topological superconductors (TRITOPS). We consider TRITOPS-TRITOPS junctions, as well as junctions between topological and non-topological superconductors (TRITOPS-S). Both types of junctions are described by effective Dirac Hamiltonians with a $\phi$-dependent mass. We analyze the effect of the phase fluctuations in the junction, as well as solitonic solutions of $\phi$ generated by fluxons trapped in the junction. We show that these solitons generate a spatial-dependent mass with a sign change akin to the Jackiw-Rebbi model. This enables the formation of zero-energy fermionic states localized at the fluxon. For the TRITOPS-TRITOPS junction these consist of a Kramers pair of Majorana modes, while for the TRITOPS-S one, there is a single Majorana fermion. The localized bound states hybridize in soliton-antisoliton configurations. Depending on the occupation state, these modes generate an effective attraction or repulsion in the dynamics of the soliton-antisoliton collision.</description>

      <title>New Limits for Existence of Transverse Zero Sound in Fermi Liquid 3He</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10795v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Landau predicted that transverse sound propagates in a Fermi liquid with sufficiently strong Fermi liquid interactions, unlike a classical fluid which cannot support shear oscillations. Previous attempts to observe this unique collective mode yielded inconclusive results due to contributions from single particle excitations. Here, we have microfabricated acoustic cavities with a micron-scale path length that is suitable for direct detection of this sound mode. The interference fringes of these acoustic Fabry-Perot cavities can be used to determine both the real and imaginary parts of the acoustic impedance. We report a null-result in this search as no clear interference fringe has been observed in the Fermi liquid, indicating the attenuation of TZS is likely above 2000 cm^-1. We provide theoretical justification for why the sound mode may yet exist but not being directly detectable due to high attenuation.</description>

      <title>Improved RF Performance of Niobium Cavities via In-situ Vacuum Heat Treatment Technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.09094v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vacuum thermal treatments (baking) are known to improve the superconducting properties of the RF surface layer of niobium cavities, and are employed as a last processing step to increase their efficiency determined by intrinsic quality factor Q0. A new method to perform the baking has been demonstrated. It consists in annealing of an evacuated cavity with the local heaters installed on its outer surface in a cryostat which ensures an exterior vacuum and protects the outer cavity surface from oxidation. Such a set-up has a number of advantages as it does not require to cool the cavity flanges during baking, and allows to perform the "cold" RF characterization of the cavity in situ, immediately after the thermal treatment without disassembly of heating elements. Moreover, the air exposure that causes partial degradation of Q0 by surface reoxidation is avoided. The heat treatment of a single-cell 1.3 GHz niobium cavity at 230 {\deg}C for 24 h demonstrated the doubling of Q0 at Eacc=10 MV/m (from 1.20e10 to 2.4e10) and retained the maximal accelerating field of 35 MV/m without quenching. The selection of treatment parameters is based on our previous XPS studies. This treatment ensures incomplete dissolution of the native oxide by oxygen diffusion, thereby preventing interaction of niobium surface with external contaminants. We propose to bake the cavities directly in a cryomodule, which would allow to use the treatment to improve their performance. The potential impact of material parameters on the components of surface resistance has been briefly examined.</description>
