      <title>Stochastic Norton Dynamics: An Alternative Approach for the Computation of Transport Coefficients in Dissipative Particle Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a novel alternative approach for the computation of transport coefficients at mesoscales. While standard nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) approaches fix the forcing and measure the average induced flux in the system driven out of equilibrium, the so-called ``stochastic Norton dynamics'' instead fixes the value of the flux and measures the average magnitude of the forcing needed to induce it. We extend recent results obtained in Langevin dynamics to consider the generalisation of the stochastic Norton dynamics in the popular dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) at mesoscales, important for a wide range of complex fluids and soft matter applications. We demonstrate that the responses profiles for both the NEMD and stochastic Norton dynamics approaches coincide in both linear and nonlinear regimes, indicating that the stochastic Norton dynamics can indeed act as an alternative approach for the computation of transport coefficients, including the mobility and the shear viscosity, as the NEMD dynamics. In addition, based on the linear response of the DPD system with small perturbations, we derive a closed-form expression for the shear viscosity, and numerically validate its effectiveness with various types of external forces. Moreover, our numerical experiments demonstrate that the stochastic Norton dynamics approach clearly outperforms the NEMD dynamics in controlling the asymptotic variance, a key metric to measure the associated computational costs, particularly in the high friction limit.</description>

      <title>clusttraj: A Solvent-Informed Clustering Tool for Molecular Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14978v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clustering techniques are consolidated as a powerful strategy for analyzing the extensive data generated from molecular modeling. In particular, some tools have been developed to cluster configurations from classical simulations with a standard focus on individual units, ranging from small molecules to complex proteins. Since the standard approach includes computing the Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD) of atomic positions, accounting for the permutation between atoms is crucial for optimizing the clustering procedure in the presence of identical molecules. To address this issue, we present the clusttraj program, a solvent-informed clustering package that fixes inflated RMSD values by finding the optimal pairing between configurations. The program combines reordering schemes with the Kabsch algorithm to minimize the RMSD of molecular configurations before running a hierarchical clustering protocol. By considering evaluation metrics, one can determine the ideal threshold in an automated fashion and compare the different linkage schemes available. The program capabilities are exemplified by considering solute-solvent systems ranging from pure water clusters to a solvated protein or a small solute in different solvents. As a result, we investigate the dependence on different parameters, such as the system size and reordering method, and also the representativeness of the cluster medoids for the characterization of optical properties. clusttraj is implemented as a Python library and can be employed to cluster generic ensembles of molecular configurations that go beyond solute-solvent systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply the physics-learning duality to molecular systems by complementing the physical description of interacting particles with a dual learning description, where each particle is modeled as an agent minimizing a loss function. In the traditional physics framework, the equations of motion are derived from the Lagrangian function, while in the learning framework, the same equations emerge from learning dynamics driven by the agent loss function. The loss function depends on scalar quantities that describe invariant properties of all other agents or particles. To demonstrate this approach, we first infer the loss functions of oxygen and hydrogen directly from a dataset generated by the CP2K physics-based simulation of water molecules. We then employ the loss functions to develop a learning-based simulation of water molecules, which achieves comparable accuracy while being significantly more computationally efficient than standard physics-based simulations.</description>

      <title>Using Machine Learning and Neural Networks to Analyze and Predict Chaos in Multi-Pendulum and Chaotic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A chaotic system is a highly volatile system characterized by its sensitive dependence on initial conditions and outside factors. Chaotic systems are prevalent throughout the world today: in weather patterns, disease outbreaks, and even financial markets. Chaotic systems are seen in every field of science and humanities, so being able to predict these systems is greatly beneficial to society. In this study, we evaluate 10 different machine learning models and neural networks [1] based on Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and R^2 values for their ability to predict one of these systems, the multi-pendulum. We begin by generating synthetic data representing the angles of the pendulum over time using the Runge Kutta Method for solving 4th Order Differential Equations (ODE-RK4) [2]. At first, we used the single-step sliding window approach, predicting the 50st step after training for steps 0-49 and so forth. However, to more accurately cover chaotic motion and behavior in these systems, we transitioned to a time-step based approach. Here, we trained the model/network on many initial angles and tested it on a completely new set of initial angles, or 'in-between' to capture chaotic motion to its fullest extent. We also evaluated the stability of the system using Lyapunov exponents. We concluded that for a double pendulum, the best model was the Long Short Term Memory Network (LSTM)[3] for the sliding window and time step approaches in both friction and frictionless scenarios. For triple pendulum, the Vanilla Recurrent Neural Network (VRNN)[4] was the best for the sliding window and Gated Recurrent Network (GRU) [5] was the best for the time step approach, but for friction, LSTM was the best.</description>

      <title>Learning the nature of viscoelasticity in geologic materials with MCMC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rock and ice are ubiquitous geologic materials. While apparently solid, they also exhibit fluid behavior under stress - a property termed viscoelasticity. Viscoelastic convection of Earth's mantle drives tectonic plate motion with consequences for earthquakes and sea-level rise, while viscoelastic deformation of ice controls glacier flow and the flexure of icy moons. For crystalline materials, "flow laws" describing bulk rheology can be derived from understanding microstructural dynamics such as crystal-defect migration. Common geologic materials like ice and olivine have grain sizes and crystal orientations that evolve with strain; this complexity precludes a first principles approach. Here we use a Bayesian inference method to learn the connection between microstructure and flow in ice and olivine, from fits to experimental data of these materials undergoing steady-state deformation and forced oscillations. We demonstrate that this method can constrain a nonlinear viscoelastic model for each material, that is capable of capturing both steady and transient dynamics and can also predict dynamics for data it was not trained on. Our results may improve geodynamic models that rely on parameterized constitutive equations, while our approach will be useful for experimental design and hypothesis testing.</description>

      <title>A thermodynamically consistent and robust four-equation model for multi-phase multi-component compressible flows using ENO-type schemes including interface regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, a concise and robust computational framework is proposed to simulate compressible multi-phase multi-component flows. To handle both shocks and material interfaces, a positivity-preserving ENO-type scheme is coupled with multi-phase interface regularization terms. The positivity-preserving limiter is conservative and is applied locally for minimal degradation of the baseline ENO-type scheme. The interface regularization terms are extended from the conservative diffuse interface (CDI) model to accommodate multi-phase, multi-component flows. The ENO-type scheme is designed to be consistent with the thermodynamic equilibrium assumptions of the four-equation multi-phase model, naturally enforcing the interface equilibrium condition - preventing oscillations in pressure, velocity, and temperature around isothermal material interfaces - without requiring additional equations for volume fraction or mixture equation of state parameters, as is commonly done for the five-equation model. Additionally, non-dilute species diffusion models are extended to the multi-phase, multi-component setting. We show that this consistent framework is equally applicable for regimes ranging from single-phase to multi-phase multi-component flows. The proposed models and numerical schemes are implemented in the highly parallel Hypersonic Task based Research (HTR) Solver, and high-resolution simulations are performed using both CPUs and GPUs.</description>

      <title>A Binary Collision Method for Screened Coulomb Collisions in weakly and moderately coupled Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A binary-pairing Monte Carlo collision method is presented here for screened Coulomb collisions in plasmas that is valid in the weakly and moderately coupled regimes. The method models the Fokker-Planck collision operator with first order corrections with respect to the Coulomb logarithm in the appropriate limits and identically reduces to a standard Monte Carlo method for solving the Boltzmann collision integral for screened Rutherford collisions when the time step is sufficiently small. The method is exceptionally simple and can be integrated into existing binary methods for cumulative scattering with the addition of about 10 lines of code.</description>

      <title>Retrieval of fundamental material parameters of monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides from experimental exciton energies: An analytical approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a straightforward and highly accurate method for determining material parameters such as screening length, bandgap energy, exciton reduced mass, and dielectric constant of the surrounding medium using experimental magnetoexciton energies available for monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs). Our approach is based on analytical formulations that allow us to calculate the screening length $r_0$ and bandgap energy $E_g$ directly from the experimental $s$-state exciton energies $E_{1s}$, $E_{2s}$, and $E_{3s}$. We also establish a relationship between the surrounding dielectric constant $\kappa$ and the exciton reduced mass $\mu$. This relationship simplifies the Schr{\"o}dinger equation for a magnetoexciton in a TMDC monolayer, transforming it into a one-parameter equation that depends only on a single material parameter, $\mu$. Therefore, the fitting method is easy to implement, as it compares calculated magnetoexciton energies with experimental data to determine the true exciton reduced mass, the best-fit value of $\mu$. By applying this method, we extract material parameters $E_g$, $r_0$, $\mu$, and $\kappa$ from the magnetoexciton energies of monolayer TMDCs (WSe$_2$, WS$_2$, MoSe$_2$, and MoS$_2$) encapsulated by hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) slabs in various current experiments. Additionally, we provide key material properties such as diamagnetic coefficients and exciton radii, which are calculated using the extracted parameters.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity-aware rock physics enhanced digital shadow for underground-energy storage monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Underground energy storage, which includes storage of hydrogen, compressed air, and CO2, requires careful monitoring to track potential leakage pathways, a situation where time-lapse seismic imaging alone may be inadequate. A recently developed Digital Shadow (DS) enhances forecasting using machine learning and Bayesian inference, yet their accuracy depends on assumed rock physics models, the mismatch of which can lead to unreliable predictions for the reservoir's state (saturation/pressure). Augmenting DS training with multiple rock physics models mitigates errors but averages over uncertainties, obscuring their sources. To address this challenge, we introduce context-aware sensitivity analysis inspired by amortized Bayesian inference, allowing the DS to learn explicit dependencies between seismic data, the reservoir state, e.g., CO2 saturation, and rock physics models. At inference time, this approach allows for real-time ''what if'' scenario testing rather than relying on costly retraining, thereby enhancing interpretability and decision-making for safer, more reliable underground storage.</description>

      <title>Optimal Lattice Boltzmann Closures through Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) offers a powerful and versatile approach to simulating diverse hydrodynamic phenomena, spanning microfluidics to aerodynamics. The vast range of spatiotemporal scales inherent in these systems currently renders full resolution impractical, necessitating the development of effective closure models for under-resolved simulations. Under-resolved LBMs are unstable, and while there is a number of important efforts to stabilize them, they often face limitations in generalizing across scales and physical systems. We present a novel, data-driven, multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL) approach that drastically improves stability and accuracy of coarse-grained LBM simulations. The proposed method uses a convolutional neural network to dynamically control the local relaxation parameter for the LB across the simulation grid. The LB-MARL framework is showcased in turbulent Kolmogorov flows. We find that the MARL closures stabilize the simulations and recover the energy spectra of significantly more expensive fully resolved simulations while maintaining computational efficiency. The learned closure model can be transferred to flow scenarios unseen during training and has improved robustness and spectral accuracy compared to traditional LBM models. We believe that MARL closures open new frontiers for efficient and accurate simulations of a multitude of complex problems not accessible to present-day LB methods alone.</description>

      <title>Invariance-embedded Machine Learning Sub-grid-scale Stress Models for Meso-scale Hurricane Boundary Layer Flow Simulation I: Model Development and $\textit{a priori}$ Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study develops invariance-embedded machine learning sub-grid-scale (SGS) stress models admitting turbulence kinetic energy (TKE) backscatter towards more accurate large eddy simulation (LES) of meso-scale turbulent hurricane boundary layer flows. The new machine learning SGS model consists of two parts: a classification model used to distinguish regions with either strong energy cascade or energy backscatter from those with mild TKE transfer and a regression model used to calculate SGS stresses in regions with strong TKE transfer. To ease model implementation in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solvers, the Smagorinsky model with a signed coefficient $C_s$, where a positive value indicates energy cascade while a negative one indicates energy backscatter, is employed as the carrier of the machine learning model. To improve its robustness and generality, both physical invariance and geometric invariance features of turbulent flows are embedded into the model input for classification and regression, and the signed Smagorinsky model coefficient is used as the output of the regression model. Different machine-learning methods and input setups have been used to test the classification model's performance. The F1-scores, which measure balanced precision and recall of a model, of the classification models with physical and geometric invariance embedded can be improved by about $17\%$ over those without considering geometric invariance. Regression models based on ensemble neural networks have demonstrated superior performance in predicting the signed Smagorinsky model coefficient, exceeding that of the dynamic Smagorinsky model in $\textit{a priori}$ tests.</description>

      <title>Path sampling challenges in large biomolecular systems: RETIS and REPPTIS for ABL-imatinib kinetics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting the kinetics of drug-protein interactions is crucial for understanding drug efficacy, particularly in personalized medicine, where protein mutations can significantly alter drug residence times. This study applies Replica Exchange Transition Interface Sampling (RETIS) and its Partial Path variant (REPPTIS) to investigate the dissociation kinetics of imatinib from Abelson nonreceptor tyrosine kinase (ABL) and mutants relevant to chronic myeloid leukemia therapy. These path-sampling methods offer a bias-free alternative to conventional approaches requiring qualitative predefined reaction coordinates. Nevertheless, the complex free-energy landscape of ABL-imatinib dissociation presents significant challenges. Multiple metastable states and orthogonal barriers lead to parallel unbinding pathways, complicating convergence in TIS-based methods. Despite employing computational efficiency strategies such as asynchronous replica exchange, full convergence remained elusive. This work provides a critical assessment of path sampling in high-dimensional biological systems, discussing the need for enhanced initialization strategies, advanced Monte Carlo path generation moves, and machine learning-derived reaction coordinates to improve kinetic predictions of drug dissociation with minimal prior knowledge.</description>

      <title>Metamizer: a versatile neural optimizer for fast and accurate physics simulations</title>

Abstract: Efficient physics simulations are essential for numerous applications, ranging from realistic cloth animations or smoke effects in video games, to analyzing pollutant dispersion in environmental sciences, to calculating vehicle drag coefficients in engineering applications. Unfortunately, analytical solutions to the underlying physical equations are rarely available, and numerical solutions require high computational resources. Latest developments in the field of physics-based Deep Learning have led to promising efficiency improvements but still suffer from limited generalization capabilities and low accuracy compared to numerical solvers.
  In this work, we introduce Metamizer, a novel neural optimizer that iteratively solves a wide range of physical systems with high accuracy by minimizing a physics-based loss function. To this end, our approach leverages a scale-invariant architecture that enhances gradient descent updates to accelerate convergence. Since the neural network itself acts as an optimizer, training this neural optimizer falls into the category of meta-optimization approaches.
  We demonstrate that Metamizer achieves unprecedented accuracy for deep learning based approaches - sometimes approaching machine precision - across multiple PDEs after training on the Laplace, advection-diffusion and incompressible Navier-Stokes equation as well as on cloth simulations. Remarkably, the model also generalizes to PDEs that were not covered during training such as the Poisson, wave and Burgers equation.
  Our results suggest that Metamizer could have a profound impact on future numerical solvers, paving the way for fast and accurate neural physics simulations without the need for retraining.</description>

Here, we propose a novel method, named Exploratory dynamics Sampling with recursion (EdSr), which is inspired by Langevin dynamics, Stochastic Differential Equation and Taylor expansion formula, can be used in MD simulation with flexible timestep. By setting up four groups of experiments including simple function, ideal physical model, all-atom simulation and coarse-grained simulation, we demonstrate that EdSr can dynamically and flexibly adjust the simulation timestep according to the requirements during simulation period, and can work with larger timestep than the widely used velocity-Verlet integrator. Although this method can not perform perfectly at flexible timestep with all simulation systems, we believe that it will be a promising approach in the future.</description>

      <title>Fully GPU-Accelerated Immersed Boundary Method for Fluid-Structure Interaction in Complex Cardiac Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22695v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fluid-structure interaction (FSI) plays a crucial role in cardiac mechanics, where the strong coupling between fluid flow and deformable structures presents significant computational challenges. The immersed boundary (IB) method efficiently handles large deformations and contact without requiring mesh regeneration. However, solving complex FSI problems demands high computational efficiency, making GPU acceleration essential to leverage massive parallelism, high throughput, and memory bandwidth. We present a fully GPU-accelerated algorithm for the IB method to solve FSI problems in complex cardiac models. The Navier-Stokes equations are discretized using the finite difference method, while the finite element method is employed for structural mechanics. Traditionally, IB methods are not GPU-friendly due to irregular memory access and limited parallelism. The novelty of this work lies in eliminating sparse matrix storage and operations entirely, significantly improving memory access efficiency and fully utilizing GPU computational capability. Additionally, the structural materials can be modeled using general hyperelastic constitutive laws, including fiber-reinforced anisotropic biological tissues such as the Holzapfel-Ogden (HO) model. Furthermore, a combined geometric multigrid solver is used to accelerate the convergence. The full FSI system, consisting of millions of degrees of freedom, achieves a per-timestep computation time of just 0.1 seconds. We conduct FSI simulations of the left ventricle, mitral valve, and aortic valve, achieving results with high consistency. Compared to single-core CPU computations, our fully GPU-accelerated approach delivers speedups exceeding 100 times.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Stochastic Closure Modeling via Conditional Diffusion Model and Neural Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02965v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Closure models are widely used in simulating complex multiscale dynamical systems such as turbulence and the earth system, for which direct numerical simulation that resolves all scales is often too expensive. For those systems without a clear scale separation, deterministic and local closure models often lack enough generalization capability, which limits their performance in many real-world applications. In this work, we propose a data-driven modeling framework for constructing stochastic and non-local closure models via conditional diffusion model and neural operator. Specifically, the Fourier neural operator is incorporated into a score-based diffusion model, which serves as a data-driven stochastic closure model for complex dynamical systems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). We also demonstrate how accelerated sampling methods can improve the efficiency of the data-driven stochastic closure model. The results show that the proposed methodology provides a systematic approach via generative machine learning techniques to construct data-driven stochastic closure models for multiscale dynamical systems with continuous spatiotemporal fields.</description>

      <title>Learning Non-Ideal Single Vortex Flows Using the Differentiable Vortex Particle Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17012v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study extends the differentiable vortex particle method (DVPM) beyond idealized flow scenarios to encompass more realistic, non-ideal conditions, including viscous flow and flow subjected to non-conservative body forces. We establish the Lamb-Oseen vortex as a benchmark case, representing a fundamental viscous single vortex flow in fluid mechanics. This selection offers significant analytical advantages, as the Lamb-Oseen vortex possesses an exact analytical solution derived from the Navier-Stokes (NS) equations, thereby providing definitive ground truth data for training and validation purposes. Through rigorous evaluation across a spectrum of Reynolds numbers, we demonstrate that DVPM achieves superior accuracy in modeling the Lamb-Oseen vortex compared to conventional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). Our results substantiate DVPM's robust capabilities in modeling non-ideal single vortex flows, establishing its distinct advantages over contemporary deep learning methodologies in fluid dynamics applications. The dataset and source code are publicly available on GitHub at the following link: https://github.com/jh36714753/Learning_Non-Ideal_Single_Vortex_Flows.</description>

      <title>Jeff = 1/2 Diamond Magnet CaCo2TeO6: A Pathway toward New Spin Physics and Quantum Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18977v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diamond lattice magnets, formed by a framework of corner-sharing tetrahedra of magnetic cations, offer unique opportunities to realize novel states of matter for potential utility in information technology. However, research has mostly focused on AB2X4 spinels with Td magnetic ions. This hinders the atomically enabled tunability of competing interactions at different energy scales and the ability to harness many-body electronic states in quantum materials, making the discovery of quantum fluctuations and spin dynamics less accessible. We discover a new material CaCo2TeO6 featuring a diamond lattice of two distinct Oh-Co2+ sites. This material displays strong quantum fluctuations, increased competing magnetic exchange interactions, and field-induced tunability of magnetic structures. The results demonstrate how simple, fundamental refinements in ligand fields can profoundly influence the phase space of quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Parton Distribution Functions in the Schwinger model from Tensor Network States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07508v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Parton distribution functions (PDFs) describe the inner, non-perturbative structure of hadrons. Their computation involves matrix elements with a Wilson line along a direction on the light cone, posing significant challenges in Euclidean lattice calculations, where the time direction is not directly accessible. We propose implementing the light-front Wilson line within the Hamiltonian formalism using tensor network techniques. The approach is demonstrated in the massive Schwinger model (quantum electrodynamics in 1+1 dimensions), a toy model that shares key features with quantum chromodynamics. We present accurate continuum results for the fermion PDF of the vector meson at varying fermion masses, obtained from first principle calculations directly in Minkowski space. Our strategy also provides a useful path for quantum simulations and quantum computing.</description>
