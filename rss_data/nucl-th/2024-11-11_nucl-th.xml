      <title>Configuration interaction relativistic Hartree-Fock model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The configuration interaction relativistic Hartree-Fock (CI-RHF) model is developed in this work. Compared to the conventional configuration interaction shell model calculations, the CI-RHF model can be applied to study the structural properties of a wide range of nuclei without readjusting any parameters, because the effective Hamiltonian for different model space can be deduced consistently from a universal density-dependent Lagrangian based on the Hartree-Fock single-particle basis. The convergence of intermediate-state excitations has been examined in evaluating the effective interactions, and the core-polarization effects are illustrated, by using $^{18}$O as an example. Employing the CI-RHF model, both the bulk properties and low-lying spectra of neon isotopes in the $sd$ shell have been well reproduced without introducing additional parameters besides those well-defined in the phenomenological Lagrangian. Moreover, the study of the isotopic evolution of charge radii and low-lying spectra highlights the shell closure at $N=14$ for neon isotopes.</description>

      <title>Radiative and exchange corrections for two-neutrino double-beta decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of radiative and atomic exchange corrections in the two-neutrino double-beta ($2\nu\beta\beta$)-decay of $^{100}$Mo. In the calculation of the exchange correction, the electron wave functions are obtained from a modified Dirac-Hartree-Fock-Slater self-consistent framework that ensures orthogonality between continuum and bound states. The atomic exchange correction causes a steep increase in the low-energy region of the single-electron spectrum, consistent with previous studies on $\beta$-decay, while the radiative correction primarily accounts for a 5\% increase in the decay rate of $^{100}$Mo. When combined, the radiative and exchange effects cause a leftward shift of approximately 10 keV in the maximum of the summed electron spectrum. This shift may impact current constraints on parameters governing potential new physics scenarios in $2\nu\beta\beta$-decay. The exchange and radiative corrections are introduced on top of our previous description of $2\nu\beta\beta$-decay, where we used a Taylor expansion for the lepton energy parameters within the nuclear matrix elements denominators. This approach results in multiple components for each observable, controlled by the measurable $\xi_{31}$ and $\xi_{51}$ parameters. We explore the effects of different $\xi_{31}$ and $\xi_{51}$ values, including their experimental measurements, on the total corrected spectra. These refined theoretical predictions can serve as precise inputs for double-beta decay experiments investigating standard and new physics scenarios within $2\nu\beta\beta$-decay.</description>

      <title>Exploring entanglement and spectral split correlations in three-flavor collective neutrino oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In environments with prodigious numbers of neutrinos, such as core-collapse supernovae, neutron star mergers, or the early universe, neutrino-neutrino interactions are dynamically significant. They can dominate neutrino flavor evolution and force it to be nonlinear, causing collective neutrino oscillations. Such collective oscillations have been studied numerically, for systems with up to millions of neutrinos, using mean-field or one-particle effective approximations. However, such a system of interacting neutrinos is a quantum many-body system, wherein quantum correlations could play a significant in the flavor evolution-thereby motivating the exploration of many-body treatments which follow the time evolution of these correlations. In many-body flavor evolution calculations with two neutrino flavors, the emergence of spectral splits in the neutrino energy distributions has been found to be correlated with the degree of quantum entanglement across the spectrum. In this work, for the first time, we investigate the emergence of spectral-splits in the three-flavor many-body collective neutrino oscillations. We find that the emergence of spectral splits resembles the number and location found in the mean-field approximation but not in the width. Moreover, unlike in the two-flavor many-body calculations, we find that additional degrees of freedom make it more difficult to establish a correlation between the location of the spectral splits and the degree of quantum entanglement across the neutrino energy spectrum.</description>

      <title>Condensation and prescaling in spatial Polyakov loop correlations far from equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The far-from-equilibrium dynamics of spatial Polyakov loop correlations, which provide gauge-invariant observables akin to effective particle numbers for gluon plasmas, are investigated within real-time $\mathrm{SU}(N_c)$ lattice gauge theory at weak couplings and large gluon occupations. The momentum zero mode of these correlations reveals the dynamic formation of a condensate, while at nonzero momenta, energy is transported toward the ultraviolet. We demonstrate that the non-zero momentum dynamics is well described by a direct cascade in terms of gauge-invariant Polyakov loop excitations, exhibiting self-similar prescaling indicative of a nonthermal attractor. This behavior can be analytically understood through perturbation theory for the Polyakov loop correlations and the established dynamics of gauge field correlations. We perform simulations for both $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ and $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ gauge groups, providing further consistency checks on the $N_c$-dependence of perturbative expectations. No evidence of an inverse cascade toward lower momenta is found for momenta above the electric screening scale.</description>

      <title>Bayesian location of the QCD critical point from a holographic perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.00579v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A fundamental question in QCD is the existence of a phase transition at large doping of quarks over antiquarks. We present the first prediction of a QCD critical point (CP) from a Bayesian analysis constrained by first principle results at zero doping. We employ the gauge/gravity duality to map QCD onto a theory of dual black holes. Predictions for the CP location in different realizations of the model overlap at one sigma. Even if many prior samples do not include a CP, one is found in nearly 100\% of posterior samples, indicating a strong preference for a CP.</description>

      <title>Role of momentum in the generator-coordinate method applied to barrier penetration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11427v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nuclear fission at barrier-top energies is conventionally modeled by a one-dimensional Schr\"odinger equation applied to internal fission channels, but that treatment is hard to justify in the configuration-interaction approach to nuclear Hamiltonians. Here we show that inclusion of states of finite momentum by the Generator Coordinate Method (GCM) considerably extends the range of energies at which GCM-based Hamiltonians could reproduce the Schr\"odinger treatment. The transmission probabilities for crossing the barrier are calculated by a discrete version of Kohn's variational method, which may also be useful for other systems of interacting fermions.</description>

      <title>Convergence of the hydrodynamic gradient expansion in relativistic kinetic theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14316v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We rigorously prove that, in any relativistic kinetic theory whose non-hydrodynamic sector has a finite gap, the Taylor series of all hydrodynamic dispersion relations has a finite radius of convergence. Furthermore, we prove that, for shear waves, such radius of convergence cannot be smaller than $1/2$ times the gap size. Finally, we prove that the non-hydrodynamic sector is gapped whenever the total scattering cross-section (expressed as a function of the energy) is bounded below by a positive non-zero constant. These results, combined with well-established covariant stability criteria, allow us to derive a rigorous upper bound on the shear viscosity of relativistic dilute gases.</description>

      <title>Pauli energy contribution to nucleus-nucleus interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23489v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The investigation delves into understanding how the Pauli exclusion principle influences the bare potential between atomic nuclei through the application of advanced theoretical methodologies. Specifically, the application of the novel Frozen-Hartree-Fock (DCFHF) technique is employed. The resulting potentials demonstrate a noticeable repulsion at short distances, attributed to the effects of the Pauli exclusion principle. To account for dynamic phenomena, such as nucleon transfer processes, the density-constrained time-dependent Hartree-Fock (DC-TDHF) method is utilized. This approach integrates isovector contributions into the potential, shedding light on their influence on fusion reactions. Notably, the inclusion of isovector effects leads to a reduction or enhancement in the inner part of the potential, suggesting a nuanced role of transfer in the fusion process.</description>

      <title>Neutron beta decay and exact conservation of charged weak hadronic vector current in the Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03066v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a reliability of the hypothesis of exact conservation of the charged weak hadronic vector current in the neutron $\beta^-$-decay with polarized neutron and unpolarized proton and electron. We calculate the contributions of the phenomenological term, responsible for Exact Conservation of the charged weak hadronic Vector Current (or the ECVC effect) in the neutron $\beta^-$-decay even for different masses of the neutron and proton (see Leitner et al. Phys. Rev. C73, 065502 (2006)), to the correlation coefficients together with a complete set of contributions of scalar and tensor interactions beyond the Standard Model (SM). We argue if total contributions of scalar and tensor interactions beyond the SM (Phys. Rev. D88, 073002 (2013); arXiv: 1212.0332v4 [hep-ph]) will not be able to reconcile the experimental data on the correlation coefficients with the contributions of the ECVC effect, one may conclude that the charged weak hadronic vector current is not conserved in the hadronic transitions of weak processes with different masses of incoming and outgoing hadrons.</description>

      <title>Covariant formulation of spinodal decomposition in rapidly expanding quark gluon plasma</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16963v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is expected to have a first order phase transition between the confined hadron gas and the deconfined quark gluon plasma at high baryon densities. This will result in phase boundary effects in the metastable and unstable regions. It is important to include these effects in phenomenological models of heavy ion collisions to identify experimental signatures of a phase transition. This requires building intuition on phase separation in rapidly expanding fluids. In this work we present the covariant equations of relativistic hydrodynamics with a phase boundary, provide prescriptions to extend the equation of state to metastable and unstable regions, and show the effects of spinodal separation in a Bjorken flow.</description>

      <title>Effect of isoscalar and isovector scalar fields on baryon semileptonic decays in nuclear matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14764v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The precise determination of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix elements is very important, because it could be a clue to new physics beyond Standard Theory. This is particular true of $V_{ud}$, because it is the main contribution to the unitary condition of the CKM matrix elements. The level of accuracy for the test of the unitarity involving the element $V_{ud}$ is now of the order of $10^{-4}$. Because the precise data for $V_{ud}$ is usually extracted from super-allowed nuclear $\beta$ decay, it is quite significant to investigate the breaking of SU(3) flavor symmetry on the weak vector coupling constant in nuclear matter. The purpose of this paper is to investigate how the isoscalar scalar ($\sigma$) and the isovector scalar ($\delta$ or $a_0$) mean-fields affect the weak vector and axial-vector coupling constants for semileptonic baryon (neutron, $\Lambda$ or $\Xi^-$) decay in asymmetric nuclear matter. To do so, we use the quark-meson coupling (QMC) model, where nuclear matter consists of nucleons including quark degrees of freedom bound by the self-consistent exchange of scalar and vector mesons. We pay careful attention to the center of mass correction to the quark currents in matter. We then find that, for neutron $\beta$ decay in asymmetric nuclear matter, the defect of the vector coupling constant due to the $\delta$ field can be of the order of $10^{-4}$ at the nuclear saturation density, which is the same amount as the level of the current uncertainty in the measurements. It is also interesting that, in neutron-rich matter, there exists a certain low density at which isospin symmetry is restored, that is, the $u$-$d$ quark mass difference vanishes. We conclude that the effect of the isoscalar scalar and the isovector scalar fields should be considered in baryon semileptonic decays in nuclei.</description>
