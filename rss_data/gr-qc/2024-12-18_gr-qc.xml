      <title>On the Field Theoretical Description of an Alternative Model to Generalized Chaplygin Gas and its Thermodynamic Behaviour</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims to study a newly proposed fluid description of dark energy in the context of late-time accelerated expansion of the universe. We examine the probable origin of the proposed equation of state in correspondence with some vastly discussed scalar field models of dark energy and reconstruct the field parameters like scalar field $\phi$ and scalar potential $V(\phi)$, analyzing their behavior in the evolution of the universe. The study also incorporates an analysis of fundamental energy conditions: Null Energy Condition (NEC), Dominant Energy Condition (DEC), and Strong Energy Condition (SEC), to assess the physical consistency and cosmological implications of the model. We perform a detailed stability analysis and investigate the evolutionary dynamics of the proposed fluid model from a thermodynamic perspective. Additionally, the model is analyzed using some of the latest observational datasets, such as Cosmic Chronometers (CC), Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO), and Supernova Type-Ia (using Pantheon+SH0ES compilation and Union 2.1), to determine its viability and consistency with observations. The results suggest that the model offers a robust description of dark energy dynamics while maintaining agreement with current observational data.</description>

      <title>Cosmic reverberations on a constrained $ f(Q,T) $-model of the Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct an isotropic cosmological model in the $ f(Q, T) $ theory of gravity in the frame of a flat FLRW spacetime being $ Q $ the non-metricity tensor and $ T $ the trace of the energy-momentum tensor. The gravity function is taken to be a quadratic equation, $ f(Q, T)=\zeta Q^2 + \gamma T $, where $ \zeta&lt;0 $ and $ \gamma $ are the arbitrary constants. We constrain the model parameters $ \alpha $ and $ H_0 $ using the recent observational datasets: the Hubble dataset (OHD), the Pantheon dataset of $ 1048 $ points, and the joint dataset (OHD + Pantheon). The universe model transits from an early deceleration state to an acceleration in late times. This model also provides the ekpyrotic phase of the universe on the high redshift $ z&gt;12.32 $. In this model, the Big Bang is described as a collision of branes, and thus, the Big Bang is not the beginning of time. Before the Big Bang, there is an ekpyrotic phase with the equation of state $ \omega &gt;&gt; 1 $. In late times, the undeviating Hubble measurements reduce the $ H_0 $ tension in the reconstructed $ f(Q, T) $ function. Additionally, we study various physical parameters of the model. Finally, our model describes a quintessence dark energy model at later times.</description>

      <title>Nonadditive entropy of the gravitational wave signal from GW150914</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the first gravitational wave, GW150914, detected by advanced LIGO and constructed from the data of measurement of strain relative deformation of the fabric of spacetime. We show that the time series from the gravitational wave obeys a nonadditive entropy, and its dynamics evolve with the three associated Tsallis indices named q-triplet. This fact strongly suggests that these black hole merger systems behave in a non-extensive framework. Furthermore, our results point out that the entropic indexes obtained as a function of frequency are proper statistical parameters to determine the dominant frequency when black hole coalescence is achieved.</description>

      <title>Gravitational memory and Ward identities in the local detector frame</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational memory, which describes the permanent shift in the strain after the passage of gravitational waves, is directly related to Weinberg's soft graviton theorems and the Bondi-Metzner-Sachs (BMS) symmetry group of asymptotically flat space-times. In this work, we provide an equivalent description of the phenomenon in local coordinates around gravitational wave detectors, such as transverse-traceless (TT) gauge. We show that gravitational memory is encoded in large residual diffeomorphisms in this gauge, which include time-dependent anisotropic spatial rescalings, and prove their equivalence to BMS transformations when translated to TT gauge. We then derive the associated Ward identities and associated soft theorems, for both scattering amplitudes and equal-time (in-in) correlation functions, and explicitly check their validity for planar gravitational waves. The in-in identities are recognized as the flat space analogue of the well-known inflationary consistency relations.</description>

      <title>Ekpyrosis in Quantum Gravitational Anisotropic Bouncing Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the isotropization of the universe starting from potentially large anisotropies in the bouncing models using the ekpyrotic mechanism. As an example of a concrete non-singular bouncing mechanism, we consider the effective description of loop quantum cosmology for Bianchi-I and Bianchi-IX spacetimes for ekpyrotic and ekpyrotic-like potentials. For both of these spacetimes the cosmological singularity is resolved via multiple short-duration non-singular bounces. We perform a large number of numerical simulations for a wide range of initial conditions and find that the relative strength of the anisotropies at the end of the bounce regime is noticeably reduced in more than $90\%$ of the simulations, providing strong evidence for the isotropization ability of the ekpyrotic potentials. While the ekpyrosis phase in all the simulations is found to be rather short-lived, isotropization occurs over cycles of rapid non-singular bounces in the Planck regime via enhancement of the contribution of the (isotropic) energy density relative to the anisotropies at the bounces. Achieving isotropization is found to be easier in Bianchi-I spacetimes when compared to Bianchi-IX spacetimes. Our results demonstrate that, while ekpyrosis might itself be insufficient to tame anisotropies at a single bounce, it can be significant when coupled with non-singular cycles in the bounce regime.</description>

      <title>Mixture equivalence principles and post-quantum theories of gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the mixture equivalence principle (MEP), which states that proper and improper mixed states with the same density matrix are always experimentally indistinguishable, and a weaker version, which states that this is sometimes true in gravity theories. We point out that Moller-Rosenfeld semiclassical gravity violates the weak MEP and that nonlinear extensions of quantum mechanics violate the MEP. We further demonstrate that modifications of the Born rule in quantum theory also typically violate the MEP. We analyse such violations in the context of thermal baths, where proper and improper thermal states induce different physical situations. This has significant implications in the context of black hole physics. We argue that Moller-Rosenfeld semiclassical gravity is not the semiclassical limit of quantum gravity in the context of black hole spacetimes, even in the presence of $N\gg1$ matter fields.</description>

      <title>Revolutionizing $f(Q)$ Gravity Studies: Observational Cosmology through Deep Learning and Bayesian Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12323v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the most exciting elements of cosmology is researching the potential of anisotropy in the early cosmos. We examine the expansion of the cosmos over time using an anisotropic Bianchi type-I spacetime subjected to the $f(Q)$ gravity. We do this by limiting the number of cosmological parameters used. The approach, we used is known as CoLFI, which stands for "Estimating Cosmological Parameters with deep learning." This paper presents a revolutionary deep learning-based technique to the parameter inference. The deep learning methodology clearly outperforms the MCMC method in terms of best-fit values, parameter errors, and correlations between parameters. This is the result of comparing the two different ways. Moreover, we obtained the transition redshift $z_{t} = 0.63$ which leads the transitioning model of the Universe from early deceleration to current acceleration phase. The dynamics of jerk parameter and validation of energy conditions of the model are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Atoms and Black Hole Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several models of physics beyond the Standard Model predict the existence of new ultralight bosons. This thesis investigates a way to discover such particles through observations of gravitational waves from binary black holes. This is possible through black hole superradiance, which spontaneously creates a "boson cloud" around a rapidly spinning black hole. The system is also known as a gravitational atom, due to its similarities with the hydrogen atom. The thesis focuses on a scenario where a gravitational atom is orbited by a binary companion. The goal is to characterize the dynamics of the system and identify the signatures left by the boson cloud on the gravitational waves emitted by the binary. The predictions can be tested with current and future interferometers, such as LISA, LIGO, DECIGO, Einstein Telescope and TianQin. First, I demonstrate that the cloud catalyzes the binary formation by increasing the dynamical capture cross section. I then introduce and study the ionization of the cloud, wherein the perturbation from the binary unbinds the bosons, analogous to the photoelectric effect in atomic physics. After that, I examine the accretion of the cloud on the companion black hole. To achieve realistic and complete results, I proceed to extend the treatment of ionization, as well as of the orbital resonances discussed in earlier works, to orbits with generic inclination and eccentricity. This allows to study the entire history of the system, from formation to merger. The most distinctive observational signatures of the cloud are found to be the orbital energy lost through ionization and the preference for specific inclinations and eccentricities induced by the orbital resonances.</description>

      <title>Inflation and primordial fluctuations in $f(Q,T)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study slow roll inflation and the generation of primordial density fluctuations within the context of $f(Q,T)$ gravity. We consider the slow roll approximation in the modified Friedmann equations within the $f(Q,T)$ gravity, specifically in the form $f(Q,T)=\alpha Q+g(T)$, where $g(T)$ is an arbitrary function of the trace of stress energy tensor $T$. Subsequently, we derive the Mukhanov-Sasaki equations for both scalar and tensor perturbations. By solving these equations in the slow-roll regime, we calculate the power spectrum and spectral index for scalar and tensor modes within the $f(Q,T)=\alpha Q+g(T)$ model. In particular, we examine two distinct functional forms of $g(T)$ to calculate the slow roll parameters, the scalar spectral index and the tensor to scalar ratio. By imposing constraints on the parameters of the model, we achieve results that align well with the Planck 2018 data. Interestingly, a model including a $T^2$ dependence showed good agreement with the observational data.</description>

      <title>Existence of photon region for stationary axisymmetric black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The black hole shadow is fundamentally connected to the structure of light rings and photon region in the background geometry. We investigate spherical photon orbits (SPOs) and photon regions in generic asymptotically flat, stationary, axisymmetric black hole spacetimes. We formally define the photon region's boundary purely in terms of the background metric functions, independent of the photon's parameters like energy or angular momentum, and establish the existence of at least one photon region for such spacetimes. We further analyze its common features including overlap with the ergoregion and rotation sense of SPOs. Additionally, light rings are identified at the extrema of the photon region boundary curves in the $(r,\theta)$ plane. Our approach is validated against a few exact black hole solutions. Implications are discussed.</description>

      <title>Accurate waveforms for eccentric, aligned-spin binary black holes: The multipolar effective-one-body model SEOBNRv5EHM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The measurement of orbital eccentricity in gravitational-wave (GW) signals will provide unique insights into the astrophysical origin of binary systems, while ignoring eccentricity in waveform models could introduce significant biases in parameter estimation and tests of General Relativity. Upcoming LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observing runs are expected to detect a subpopulation of eccentric signals, making it vital to develop accurate waveform models for eccentric orbits. Here, employing recent analytical results through the third post-Newtonian order, we develop SEOBNRv5EHM: a new time-domain, effective-one-body, multipolar waveform model for eccentric binary black holes with spins aligned (or antialigned) with the orbital angular momentum. Besides the dominant (2,2) mode, the model includes the (2,1), (3,3), (3,2), (4,4) and (4,3) modes. We validate the model's accuracy by computing its unfaithfulness against 99 (28 public and 71 private) eccentric numerical-relativity (NR) simulations, produced by the Simulating eXtreme Spacetimes Collaboration. Importantly, for NR waveforms with initial GW eccentricities below 0.5, the maximum (2,2)-mode unfaithfulness across the total mass range 20-200 $M_\odot$ is consistently below or close to $1 \%$, with a median value of $ \sim 0.02 \% $, reflecting an accuracy improvement of approximately an order of magnitude compared to the previous-generation SEOBNRv4EHM and the state-of-the-art TEOBResumS-Dal\'i eccentric model. In the quasi-circular-orbit limit, SEOBNRv5EHM is in excellent agreement with the highly accurate SEOBNRv5HM model. The accuracy, robustness, and speed of SEOBNRv5EHM make it suitable for data analysis and astrophysical studies. We demonstrate this by performing a set of recovery studies of synthetic NR-signal injections, and parameter-estimation analyses of the events GW150914 and GW190521, which we find to have no eccentricity signatures.</description>

      <title>Third post-Newtonian dynamics for eccentric orbits and aligned spins in the effective-one-body waveform model SEOBNRv5EHM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate waveform models for coalescing binaries on eccentric orbits are crucial for avoiding biases in the analysis of eccentric gravitational-wave signals. The effective-one-body (EOB) formalism combines various analytical approximation methods with information derived from numerical-relativity simulations, and it has proven reliable in modeling the inspiral-merger-ringdown waveform of binaries on generic orbits. In this work, we derive new analytical results within the EOB formalism, specifically addressing eccentric, aligned-spin binaries. For the first time, we obtain EOB results for eccentric orbits that are accurate up to the third post-Newtonian (PN) order for the complete far-zone energy and angular-momentum fluxes, the radiation-reaction (RR) force, and waveform modes (including memory contributions). We obtain these results by deriving transformations from the harmonic to EOB coordinates and from the quasi-Keplerian to the Keplerian parametrization, that properly account for the spin-supplementary condition, post-adiabatic contributions, and the gauge freedom in the RR force. We employ these findings to build the inspiral part of the SEOBNRv5EHM waveform model, which includes the 3PN eccentricity contributions in the RR force and waveform modes using the Keplerian parametrization, and augments the EOB equations of motion with PN evolution equations for the Keplerian parameters. The new SEOBNR model achieves much better accuracy than its predecessor SEOBNRv4EHM and other eccentric models, even for eccentricities as high as $\lesssim 0.5$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the quantum fate of the classical singularities that occur by gravitational collapse of a dust cloud. For this purpose, we address the quantization of a model first proposed by Georges Lemaitre in 1933. We find that the singularities can generically be avoided. This is a consequence of unitary evolution in the quantum theory, whereby the quantum dust cloud collapses, bounces at a minimal radius and re-expands.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically Conically Minkowskian spacetimes from self-gravitating dust</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we investigate some non-Newtonian effects in exact solutions of the Einstein equations, which describe stationary and axisymmetric configurations of self-gravitating dust. A distinctive feature of these solutions is the potential presence of conical singularities along the rotation axis, manifesting as angular deficits. While such singularities can be removed by imposing suitable boundary conditions along the axis, asymptotically far away from it the geometry becomes locally flat, in the sense that the Riemann tensor vanishes, but globally, instead of reducing to Minkowski space, it takes the form of a cone. We refer to these spacetimes as Asymptotically Conically Minkowskian (ACM). We show that such conical structure can originate some interesting effects as seen by asymptotic local observers. These include modifications to the gravitational lensing and the misinterpretation of the vacuum state of a scalar field as a distribution of scalar particles.</description>

      <title>Effect of Type II Strong Gravitational Lensing on Tests of General Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational wave (GW) observations of binary black hole (BBH) coalescences provide a unique opportunity to test general relativity (GR) in the strong-field regime. To ensure the reliability of these tests, it is essential to identify and address potential sources of error, particularly those arising from missing physics in the waveform models used in GW data analysis. This paper investigates potential biases in these tests arising from strong gravitational lensing, an effect not currently incorporated into the standard framework for GR tests. In the geometric optics approximation, strong lensing produces three types of images: Type I, Type II, and Type III. While Type I and Type III images do not distort the signal, Type II images introduce a characteristic phase shift that can mimic GR deviations for signals with higher-order modes, precession, or eccentricity. We assess the response of four standard GR tests on simulated Type II lensed BBH signals, including the two parameterized tests (TIGER and FTI), the modified dispersion relation test and the inspiral-merger-ringdown consistency test. We focus on precessing waveforms for binaries with total masses of $20M_{\odot}$ and $80M_{\odot}$, and dimensionless spins of 0.5 and 0.95, considering a fixed signal-to-noise ratio of 25 using the design A+ sensitivity of the LIGO-Virgo network. Our findings indicate that more mass-asymmetric and higher-spin binaries show larger false deviations from GR in the TIGER and modified dispersion relation tests when applying GR tests to Type II lensed signals. These results highlight the risk of false GR violations as detector sensitivity improves in future observational runs. Therefore, it is crucial to consider the possibility of strong lensing before drawing conclusions about deviations from GR in GW signals.</description>

      <title>Super-exponential Primordial Black Hole Production via Delayed Vacuum Decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: If a cosmological first-order phase transition occurs sufficiently slowly, delayed vacuum decay may lead to the formation of primordial black holes. Here we consider a simple model as a case study of how the abundance of the produced black holes depends on the model's input parameters. We demonstrate, both numerically and analytically, that the black hole abundance is controlled by a double, ``super''-exponential dependence on the three-dimensional Euclidean action over temperature at peak nucleation. We show that a modified expansion rate during the phase transition, such as one driven by an additional energy density component, leads to a weaker dependence on the underlying model parameters, but maintains the same super-exponential structure. We argue that our findings generalize to any framework of black hole production via delayed vacuum decay.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Topology and Phase Space Analysis of AdS Black Holes Through Non-Extensive Entropy Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the thermodynamic topology through the bulk-boundary and restricted phase space (RPS) frameworks. In bulk-boundary framework, we observe two topological charges $(\omega = +1, -1)$ concerning the non-extensive Barrow parameter and with ($\delta=0$) in Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. For Renyi entropy, different topological charges are observed depending on the value of the $\lambda$ with a notable transition from three topological charges $(\omega = +1, -1, +1)$ to a single topological charge $(\omega = +1)$ as $\lambda$ increases. Also, by setting $\lambda$ to zero results in two topological charges $(\omega = +1, -1)$. Sharma-Mittal entropy exhibits three distinct ranges of topological charges influenced by the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ with different classifications viz $\beta$ exceeds $\alpha$, we will have $(\omega = +1, -1, +1)$, $\beta = \alpha$, we have $(\omega = +1, -1)$ and for $\alpha$ exceeds $\beta$ we face $(\omega = -1)$. Also, Kaniadakis entropy shows variations in topological charges viz we observe $(\omega = +1, -1)$ for any acceptable value of $K$, except when $K = 0$, where a single topological charge $(\omega = -1)$. In the case of Tsallis-Cirto entropy, for small parameter $\Delta$ values, we have $(\omega = +1)$ and when $\Delta$ increases to 0.9, we will have $(\omega = +1, -1)$. When we extend our analysis to the RPS framework, we find that the topological charge consistently remains $(\omega = +1)$ independent of the specific values of the free parameters for Renyi, Sharma-Mittal, and Tsallis-Cirto. Additionally, for Barrow entropy in RPS, the number of topological charges rises when $\delta$ increases from 0 to 0.8. Finally for Kaniadakis entropy, at small values of $K$, we observe $(\omega = +1)$. However, as the non-extensive parameter $K$ increases, we encounter different topological charges and classifications with $(\omega = +1, -1)$.</description>

      <title>Observational constraints on mutated hilltop inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here, a single field inflationary model driven by a mutated hilltop potential, as a subclass of the hilltop models of inflation, is investigated. In order to constrain the parameter space of the model, the $r-n_{\rm s}$ constraint of Planck and BICEP/Keck 2018 data as well as the reheating parameters such as the duration $N_{\rm{re}}$, the temperature $T_{\rm{re}}$, and the equation of state parameter $\omega_{\rm{re}}$, are employed. In addition, a model independent bound on the duration of the radiation dominated (RD) era $N_{\rm{rd}}$ is applied to improve the parameter space. Furthermore, the density spectra of relic gravitational waves (GWs) in light of the sensitivity domains of GW detectors, for specific inflationary durations $N$, are analyzed. Finally, by combining constraints from the cosmic microwave background (CMB), reheating, RD era, and relic GWs, the permissible inflationary duration is constrained to $46\leq N \leq 56$ (95\% CL) and $48.1\leq N\leq 56$ (68\% CL). Moreover, the model parameter $\alpha$ is confined to $0.161\leq\alpha \leq 0.890$ (95\% CL) and $0.217\leq\alpha \leq 0.815$ (68\% CL).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We generalise the $\eta$ regularisation scheme in order to develop a framework for systematically studying regularisation of loops in quantum field theory. This allows us to "solve" a set of gauge consistency conditions for families of gauge invariant regularisation schemes. We recover several known examples such as dimensional and denominator regularisations, as well as some more general solutions. We also study anomalies in chiral theories in order to carefully describe how our formalism should be properly implemented.</description>

      <title>Mass and Force Relations for Extremal EMDA Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate various properties of extremal dyonic static black holes in Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton-Axion theory. We obtain a simple first-order ordinary differential equation for the black hole mass in terms of its electric and magnetic charges, which we can solve explicitly for certain special values of the scalar couplings. For one such case we also construct new dyonic black hole solutions, making use of the presence of an enhanced SL(2,R) symmetry. Finally, we investigate the structure of long range forces and binding energies between non-equivalent extremal black holes. For certain special cases, we can identify regions of parameter space where the force is always attractive or repulsive. Unlike in the case without an axion, the force and binding energies between distinct black holes are not always correlated with each other. Our work is motivated in part by the question of whether long range forces between non-identical states can potentially encode information about UV constraints on low-energy physics.</description>

      <title>Uncovering Correlations and Biases in Parameter Inference from Neutron-Star Pulse Profile Modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling of X-ray pulse profiles from millisecond pulsars offers a promising method of inferring the mass-to-radius ratios of neutron stars. Recent observations with NICER resulted in measurements of radii for three neutron stars using this technique. In this paper, we explore correlations between model parameters and the degree to which individual parameters can be inferred from pulse profiles, using an analytic model that allows for an efficient and interpretable exploration. We introduce a new set of model parameters that reduce the most prominent correlations and allow for an efficient sampling of posteriors. We then demonstrate that the degree of beaming of radiation emerging from the neutron star surface has a large impact on the uncertainties in the inferred model parameters. Finally, we show that the uncertainties in the model parameters for neutron stars for which the polar cap temperature falls outside of the NICER energy range are significantly degraded.</description>

      <title>A Counterintuitive Correlation Between Neutron-Star Radii Inferred from Pulse Modeling and Surface Emission Beaming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermal X-ray emission from rotation-powered millisecond pulsars, shaped by gravitational lensing and the beaming of the surface radiation, provides critical insights into neutron star properties. This approach has been the focus of observations with the NICER mission. Using a semi-analytic model to calculate pulse profiles, we investigate the effects of adopting incorrect beaming models on the inferred compactness of neutron stars. We demonstrate that assuming a more centrally peaked beaming pattern when fitting data from a more isotropic emitter leads to an underestimation of compactness in the case of two antipodal polar caps. We present a detailed analysis of this counterintuitive result, offering both qualitative insights and quantitative estimates. If the atmospheric heating in the millisecond pulsars observed with NICER is shallow, the inferred radii for these sources could be significantly overestimated, with important implications for neutron star structure and equation-of-state constraints.</description>

      <title>Multi-Messenger Cosmology: A Route to Accurate Inference of Dark Energy Beyond CPL Parametrization from XG Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the central challenges in modern cosmology is understanding the nature of dark energy and its evolution throughout the history of the Universe. Dark energy is commonly modeled as a perfect fluid with a time-varying equation-of-state parameter, w(z), often modeled under CPL parametrization using two parameters $w_0$ and $w_a$. In this study, we explore both parametric and non-parametric methods to reconstruct the dark energy Equation of State (EoS) using Gravitational Wave (GW) sources, with and without electromagnetic (EM) counterparts called as bright sirens and dark sirens respectively. In the parametric approach, we extend the widely used $w_0$-$w_a$ model by introducing an additional term, $w_b$, to better capture the evolving dynamics of dark energy up to high redshift which is accessible from GW sources. This extension provides increased flexibility in modeling the EoS and enables a more detailed investigation of dark energy's evolution. Our analysis indicates that, with five years of observation time and a $75\%$ duty cycle using Cosmic Explorer and the Einstein Telescope, it will be possible to measure the dark energy EoS with remarkable precision better than any other cosmological probes in the coming years from bright standard sirens using multi-messenger avenue. These findings highlight the potential of GW observations in synergy with EM telescopes to offer valuable insights into the nature of dark energy, overcoming the current limitations in cosmological measurements.</description>

Abstract: Affleck-Dine (AD) baryogenesis is compelling yet challenging to probe because of the high energy physics involved. We demonstrate that this mechanism can be realized generically with low-energy new physics without supersymmetry while producing detectable gravitational waves (GWs) sourced by parametric resonance of a light scalar field. In viable benchmark models, the scalar has a mass of ${\cal O}(0.1-10)$ GeV, yielding GWs with peak frequencies of ${\cal O}(10-100)$ Hz. This study further reveals a new complementarity between upcoming LIGO-frequency GW detectors and laboratory searches across multiple frontiers of particle physics.</description>

Abstract: We compute the leading order corrections to the expected value of the squared field amplitude of a massless real scalar quantum field due to curvature in a localized region of spacetime. We use Riemann normal coordinates to define localized field operators in a curved spacetime that are analogous to their flat space counterparts, and the Hadamard condition to find the leading order curvature corrections to the field correlations. We then apply our results to particle detector models, quantifying the effect of spacetime curvature in localized field probes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In many scenarios of interest, a quantum system interacts with an unknown environment, necessitating the use of open quantum system methods to capture dissipative effects and environmental noise. With the long-term goal of developing a perturbative theory for open quantum gravity, we take an important step by studying Abelian gauge theories within the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism. We begin with a pedagogical review of general results for open free theories, setting the stage for our primary focus: constructing the most general open effective field theory for electromagnetism in a medium. We assume locality in time and space, but allow for an arbitrary finite number of derivatives. Crucially, we demonstrate that the two copies of the gauge group associated with the two branches of the Schwinger-Keldysh contour are not broken but are instead deformed by dissipative effects. We provide a thorough discussion of gauge fixing, define covariant gauges, and calculate the photon propagators, proving that they yield gauge-invariant results. A notable result is the discovery that gauge invariance is accompanied by non-trivial constraints on noise fluctuations. We derive these constraints through three independent methods, highlighting their fundamental significance for the consistent formulation of open quantum gauge theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate quantum chaotic features of the brickwall model, which is obtained by introducing a stretched horizon -- a Dirichlet wall placed outside the event horizon -- within the BTZ geometry. This simple yet effective model has been shown to capture key properties of quantum black holes and is motivated by the stringy fuzzball proposal. We analyze the dynamics of both scalar and fermionic probe fields, deriving their normal mode spectra with Gaussian-distributed boundary conditions on the stretched horizon. By interpreting these normal modes as energy eigenvalues, we examine spectral statistics, including level spacing distributions, the spectral form factor, and Krylov state complexity as diagnostics for quantum chaos. Our results show that the brickwall model exhibits features consistent with random matrix theory across various ensembles as the standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution is varied. Specifically, we observe Wigner-Dyson distributions, a linear ramp in the spectral form factor, and a characteristic peak in Krylov complexity, all without the need for a classical interior geometry. We also demonstrate that non-vanishing spectral rigidity alone is sufficient to produce a peak in Krylov complexity, without requiring Wigner-Dyson level repulsion. Finally, we identify signatures of integrability at extreme values of the Dirichlet boundary condition parameter.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we construct an exact solution of the Einstein $SU(N)$-Skyrme model in $D=4$ space-time dimensions describing a charged and rotating black hole with toroidal horizon. Rotation is added by applying an improper coordinate transformation to the known static toroidal black hole with Skyrme hair, while the electric charge is supplemented by considering a $U(1)$ gauge field interacting with Einstein gravity. We perform the thermal analysis in the grand canonical ensemble, explicitly showing the role that the flavor number plays. Some discussions about stability are also considered.</description>

Abstract: We explore the correspondence between the parallel surfaces framework, and the minimal surfaces framework, to uncover and apply new aspects of the geometrical and mechanical content behind the so-called Lovelock-type brane gravity (LBG). We show how this type of brane gravity emerges naturally from a Dirac-Nambu-Goto (DNG) action functional built up from the volume element associated with a world volume shifted a distance $\alpha$ along the normal vector of a germinal world volume, and provide all known geometric structures for such a theory. Our development highlights the dependence of the geometry for the displaced world volume on the fundamental forms, as well as on certain conserved tensors, defined on the outset world volume. Based on this, LBG represents a natural and elegant generalization of the DNG theory to higher dimensions. Moreover, our development allows for exploring disformal transformations in Lovelock brane gravity and analyzing their relations with scalar-tensor theories defined on the brane trajectory. Likewise, this geometrical correspondence would enable us to establish contact with tractable Hamiltonian approximations for this brane gravity theory, by exploiting the linkage with a DNG model, and thus start building a suitable quantum version.</description>

      <title>Can quasars, triggered by mergers, account for NANOGrav's stochastic gravitational wave background?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stochastic gravitational wave background (GWB) recently discovered by several pulsar timing array (PTA) experiments is consistent with arising from a population of coalescing super-massive black hole binaries (SMBHBs). The amplitude of the background is somewhat higher than expected in most previous population models or from the local mass density of SMBHs. SMBHBs are expected to be produced in galaxy mergers, which are also thought to trigger bright quasar activity. Under the assumptions that (i) a fraction $f_{bin} \sim 1$ of all quasars are associated with SMBHB mergers, (ii) the typical quasar lifetime is $t_{Q} \sim 10^{8} yr$, and (iii) adopting Eddington ratios $f_{Edd} \sim 0.3$ for the luminosity of bright quasars, we compute the GWB associated directly with the empirically measured quasar luminosity function (QLF). This approach bypasses the need to model the cosmological evolution of SMBH or galaxy mergers from simulations or semi-analytical models. We find a GWB amplitude approximately matching the value measured by NANOGrav. Our results are consistent with most quasars being associated with SMBH binaries and being the sources of the GWB, and imply a joint constraint on $t_{Q}$, $f_{Edd}$ and the typical mass ratio $q \equiv M_{2}/M_{1}$. The GWB in this case would be dominated by relatively distant $\sim 10^{9} M_{\odot}$ SMBHs at $z \approx 2 - 3$, at the peak of quasar activity. Similarly to other population models, our results remain in tension with the local SMBH mass density.</description>

      <title>The long-short GRB connection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long and short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are thought to arise from different and unrelated astrophysical progenitors. The association of long GRBs with supernovae (SNe) and the difference in the distributions of galactocentric offsets of long and short GRBs within their host galaxies have often been considered strong evidence of their unrelated origins. Long GRBs have been thought to result from the collapse of single massive stars, while short GRBs come from mergers of compact object binaries. Our present study challenges this conventional view. We demonstrate that the observational properties, such as the association with SNe and the different galactic offsets, are naturally explained within the framework of the binary-driven hypernova model, suggesting an evolutionary connection between long and short GRBs.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we analyze the scattering of fermionic quasiparticles in the presence of radial disgyrations and symmetric vortices in the superfluid 3He-A. We consider a Volovik analog model for the description of these defects and investigate the scattering of fermionic quasiparticles in this background. Furthermore, we solve the massless Dirac equation employing this methodology to gain comprehensive insights into the scattering phenomena and its dependence on the geometric properties. These results validate the optical theorem and highlight the role of defect topology in the scattering process.</description>

      <title>Comparative analysis of the NANOgrav Hellings-Downs as a window into new physics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pulsar timing array (PTA) experiments have recently provided strong evidence for the signal of the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) in the nHz-frequency band. These experiments have shown a statistical preference for the Hellings-Downs (HD) correlation between pulsars, which is widely regarded as a definitive signature of the SGWB. Using the NANOGrav 15-year dataset, we perform a comparative Bayesian analysis of four different models that go beyond the standard cosmological framework and influence the overlap reduction function. Specifically, we analyze ultralight vector dark matter (DM), spin-2 ultralight DM, massive gravity, and a folded non-Gaussian component to the SGWB. We find that the spin-2 ultralight DM and the massive gravity model are statistically equivalent to the HD prediction, and there is weak evidence in favor of the non-Gaussian component and the ultralight vector DM model. We also perform a non-parametric test using the Genetic Algorithms, which suggests a weak deviation from the HD curve. However, improved data quality is required before drawing definitive conclusions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dipole anisotropy induced by our peculiar motion in the sky distribution of cosmologically distant sources is an important consistency test of the standard FLRW cosmology. In this work, we formalize how to compute the kinematic matter dipole in redshift bins. Apart from the usual terms arising from angular aberration and flux boosting, there is a contribution from the boosting of the redshifts that becomes important when considering a sample selected on observed redshift, leading to non-vanishing correction terms. We discuss examples and provide expressions to incorporate arbitrary redshift selection functions. We also discuss the effect of redshift measurement uncertainties in this context, in particular in upcoming surveys for which we provide estimates of the correction terms. Depending on the shape of a sample's redshift distribution and on the applied redshift cuts, the correction terms can become substantial, even to the degree that the direction of the dipole is reversed. Lastly, we discuss how cuts on variables correlated with observed redshift, such as color, can induce additional correction terms.</description>

      <title>Search for new interactions at the micron scale with a vector force sensor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The search for new gravity-like interactions at the sub-millimeter scale is a compelling area of research, with important implications for the understanding of classical gravity and its connections with quantum physics. We report improved constraints on Yukawa-type interactions in the $10\,\mathrm{\mu m}$ regime using optically levitated dielectric microspheres as test masses. The search is performed, for the first time, sensing multiple spatial components of the force vector, and with sensitivity improved by a factor of $\sim 100$ with respect to previous measurements using the same technique. The resulting upper limit on the strength of a hypothetical new force is $10^7$ at a Yukawa range $\lambda\simeq 5\;\mu$m and close to $10^6$ for $\lambda \gtrsim 10\;\mu$m. This result also advances our efforts to measure gravitational effects using micrometer-size objects, with important implications for embryonic ideas to investigate the quantum nature of gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2109.12037v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the emergence of classical inflationary universes in a kinetic-dominated stage using a suitable class of solutions of the Wheeler-De Witt equation with a constant potential. These solutions are eigenfunctions of the inflaton momentum operator that are strongly peaked on classical solutions exhibiting either or both a kinetic dominated period and an inflation period. Our analysis is based on semiclassical WKB solutions of the Wheeler-De Witt equation interpreted in the sense of Borel (to perform a correct connection between classically allowed regions) and on the relationship of these solutions to the solutions of the classical model. For large values of the scale factor the WKB Vilenkin tunneling wavefunction and the Hartle-Hawking no-boundary wavefunctions are recovered as particular instances of our class of wavefunctions.</description>

      <title>Using massless fields for observing black hole features in the collapsed phase of Euclidean dynamical triangulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.07081v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on an old computation of propagators of massless scalar fields on an ensemble of configurations in 4D Euclidean dynamical triangulations in the collapsed (crumpled) phase. The resulting quantum average is used to construct the scale factor of a 4-D rotational invariant metric. This new scale factor is non-zero at the origin, which we assume to be caused the presence of the well-known singular structure in the collapsed phase. The scale factor depends on an overall integration constant, which is determined by comparison with the implied volume at intermediate distances. We construct a transformation to a 3-D rotational invariant metric, which reveals Euclidean black hole features at an instant in time, with a horizon separating interior and exterior parts. Effective Einstein equations in the presence of a `geometric condensate' are assumed, and computed with the software OGRe. Also explored briefly is a qualitatively different (not preferred) interpretation of the data which follows from comparison with an inversely transformed Euclidean regular black hole metric.</description>

      <title>Klein-Gordon oscillators in traversable wormhole rainbow gravity spacetime: Conditional exact solvability via a throat radius and oscillator frequency correlation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09342v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we discuss an analytical solution for a set of the Klein-Gordon (KG) oscillators' energies through a correlation between the frequency of the KG-oscillators and the traversable wormhole (TWH) throat radius. Under such restricted parametric correlation (hence the notion of conditionally exact solvability is unavoidable in the process), we report the effects of throat radius, rainbow parameter, disclination parameter, and oscillator frequency on the spectroscopic structure of a vast number of $\left( n,m\right) $-states (the radial and magnetic quantum numbers, respectively). In the process, we only use two loop quantum gravity motivated rainbow functions pairs. The only rainbow functions that clearly and reliably fully adhere to the rainbow gravity model and secure Planck energy $E_p$ as the maximum possible energy for particles and anti-particles alike. Near the asymptotically flat upper and lower universes connected by the TWH, i.e., for the throat radius $r_{0 }&gt;&gt;1 $, the energies tend to cluster around the rest mass energies, i.e., $|E_{\pm }|\sim m_{0 }$. Whereas, for $r_{0 }&lt;&lt;1$ the energies tend to approach $|E_{\pm }| \leq E_{P}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09861v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Certain precessing black-hole mergers produce gravitational waves with net circular polarization, understood as an imbalance between right- and left-handed amplitudes. According to the Cosmological Principle, such emission must average to zero across all binary mergers in our Universe to preserve mirror-reflection symmetry at very large scales. We present a new independent gravitational-wave test of this hypothesis. Using a novel observable based on the Chern-Pontryagin pseudo-scalar, we measure the emission of net circular polarization across 47 black-hole mergers recently analyzed by Islam et. al. with a state-of-the art model for precessing black-hole mergers in General Relativity. The average value obtained is consistent with zero. Remarkably, however, we find that at least $82\%$ of the analysed sources must have produced net circular polarization. Of these, GW200129 shows strong evidence for mirror asymmetry, with a Bayes Factor of 12.6 or, equivalently, $93.1\%$ probability. We obtain consistent (although stronger) results of $97.5\%$ and $94.3\%$ respectively using public results on this event from Hannam et. al. and performing our own parameter inference. This finding further implies evidence of astrophysical sources that can spontaneously emit circularly polarized photons by quantum effects. Forthcoming black-hole merger detections will enable stronger constraints on large-scale mirror asymmetry and the Cosmological Principle.</description>

      <title>Research on high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations in black bounce-type spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19942v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the high frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (HFQPOs) phenomenon around the black bounce-type (BBT) spacetime using the resonance models. We calculated the location of the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) for different types of celestial bodies, and derived the expression for the epicyclic frequencies of test particles. The results show that the BBT spacetime possesses unique observational characteristics, where the ordering of epicyclic frequencies varies with the regularization parameter $a$, enabling the excitation of low-order resonances and producing stronger observational signals. Using parametric and forced resonance models, we compared theoretical results with the observed 3:2 twin-peak HFQPOs in microquasars (GRO 1655-40, XTE 1550-564, GRS $1915+105$ ), analyzed the formation mechanisms of HFQPOs, constrained the parameters of the BBT model, and explored the possible types of celestial objects corresponding to microquasars. The study indicates that, certain parametric resonance conditions (e.g., $n=1, 2$) lead to traversable wormhole models in BBT that closely align with observations. And forced resonance corresponding to BH or wormhole models can be verified through observations. These results deviate from the data fits of the original black-bounce model. It is found that the oscillatory behavior of three types of microquasars can also be explained by particle oscillations generated in BBT theory, providing evidence for exploring the existence of wormholes, under the assumptions of parametric resonance and forced resonance.</description>

Abstract: Using properties of diffusion according to a quantum heat kernel constructed as an expectation over classical heat kernels on $S^1$, we probe the non-manifold-like nature of quantized space in a model of (1+1)-dimensional quantum gravity. By computing the mean squared displacement of a diffusing particle, we find that diffusion is anomalous, behaving similarly to that on a porous substrate, network, or fractal over short distances. The walk dimension of the path for a particle diffusing in quantized space is calculated to have an infimum of 4, rising to arbitrarily large values depending on a parameter labeling the choice of factor ordering in the quantum Hamiltonian for our model and figuring in the asymptotic behavior of the wavefunction used to construct the quantum heat kernel. Additionally, we derive an expansion for return probability of a diffusing particle, whose modifications from the classical power-series form depend on the factor-ordering parameter.</description>

Abstract: Binary stars are as frequency as single stars in the Universe, and at least 70% of the massive stars located in our Galaxy belong to a binary system. We produce the gravitational waveforms for the extreme mass ratio inspiral systems (EMRIs) of binary stars moving around central supermassive black hole (SBH), or called B-EMRIs.
  We calculate the orbits of such systems via the Hamilton-Jacobi approach. To improve accuracy we adopt the quadrupole-octupole expression of gravitational wave (GW) and study the contribution of radiation reaction. Compared to the waveforms of EMRIs, there are higher frequency oscillations superposed on the waveforms of B-EMRIs. We perform frequency spectrum analysis of the GW waveforms, and find that higher frequency signals give their prominency in the waveforms of B-EMRIs. We study the binary compact objects with different masses and inclination angles of the binary internal orbit plane, and obtain the frequency spectrum variation with respect to the parameters. To obtain more precise result for future observation of GWs from space-based detector, we take into account gravito-electromagnetic (GEM) force for the binary orbit on the equatorial plane, and compare the waveforms with that of EMRIs without GEM force. The result of mismatch shows that the waveforms of B-EMRIs are credibly distinguishable by the space-based GW detectors when GEM force is considered.</description>

      <title>Toward a computationally-efficient follow-up pipeline for blind continuous gravitational-wave searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18934v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The sensitivity of continuous gravitational-wave (CW) searches for unknown neutron stars (NSs) is limited by their parameter space breadth. To fit within reasonable computing budgets, hierarchical schemes are used to identify interesting candidates using affordable methods. The resulting sensitivity depends on the number of candidates selected to follow-up. In this work, we present a novel framework to evaluate the effectiveness of stochastic CW follow-ups. Our results allow for a significant reduction of the computing cost of pyfstat, a well-established follow-up method. We also simplify the setup of multistage follow-ups by removing the need for parameter-space metrics. The study was conducted on Gaussian and real O3 Advanced LIGO data covering both isolated and binary sources. These results will have a positive impact on the sensitivity of all-sky searches in the forthcoming observing runs of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave polarisations in nonminimally coupled gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07625v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The properties of metric perturbations are determined in the context of an expanding Universe governed by a modified theory of gravity with a non-minimal coupling between curvature and matter. We analyse the dynamics of the 6 components of a general helicity decomposition of the metric and stress-energy perturbations, consisting of scalar, vector and tensor sectors. The tensor polarisations are shown to still propagate luminally, in agreement with recent data from gravitational interferometry experiments, while their magnitude decays with an additional factor sourced by the nonminimal coupling. We show that the production of these modes is associated with a modified quadrupole formula at leading order. The vector perturbations still exhibit no radiative behaviour, although their temporal evolution is found to be modified, with spatial dependence remaining unaffected. We establish that the scalar perturbations can no longer be treated as identical. We investigate the scalar sector by writing the modified model as an equivalent two-field scalar-tensor theory and find the same scalar degrees of freedom as in previous literature. The different sectors are paired with the corresponding polarisation modes, which can be observationally measured by their effects on the relative motion of test particles, thus providing the possibility of testing the modified theory and constraining its parameters.</description>

      <title>Floating orbits and energy extraction from magnetized Kerr black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17225v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study electromagnetic radiation reaction on a charged particle around a weakly magnetized Kerr black hole. We solve numerically the Teukolsky equation to find energy fluxes in electromagnetic radiation at the horizon and at spatial infinity. We also employ analytical methods in the low-frequency limit, finding excellent agreement with the numerical results. For a wide range of parameters, energy fluxes on the horizon are negative for all orbital radii: the modes are amplified through superradiance. More interestingly, the flux on the horizon is larger (in absolute value) than the flux at infinity for orbits with orbital radius $r_0 \gtrsim 9M$ -- floating orbits are a generic outcome of having magnetic fields around black holes. Particles on these orbits extract energy from the BH through their radiation field; the net effect is an increase in the particles' kinetic energy, so that they outspiral to infinity. Although in realistic accretion disks viscous forces are expected to dominate, floating orbits remain an interesting feature of the existence of ergoregions in black hole spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Space-based optical lattice clocks as gravitational wave detectors in search for new physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04340v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the sensitivity and performance of space-based Optical Lattice Clocks (OLCs) in detecting gravitational waves, in particular the Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background (SGWB) at low frequencies $(10^{-4}, 1) \rm Hz$, which are inaccessible to ground-based detectors. We first analyze the response characteristics of a single OLC detector for SGWB detection and compare its sensitivity with that of Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). Due to longer arm lengths, space-based OLC detectors can exhibit unique frequency responses and enhance the capability to detect SGWB in the low-frequency range, but the sensitivity of a single OLC detector remains insufficient overall compared to LISA. Then, as a preliminary plan, we adopt a method of cross-correlation on two OLC detectors to improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). This method leverages the uncorrelated origins but statistically similar properties of noise in two detectors while the SGWB signal is correlated between them, thus achieving effective noise suppression and sensitivity enhancement. Future advancements in OLC stability are expected to further enhance their detection performance. This work highlights the potential of OLC detectors as a promising platform for SGWB detection, offering complementary capabilities to LISA, and opening an observational window into more astrophysical sources and the early universe.</description>

      <title>A bimetric cosmological model based on Andrei Sakharov's twin universe approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04644v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The standard cosmological model, based on Cold Dark Matter and Dark Energy ({\Lambda}CDM), faces several challenges. Among these is the need to adjust the scenario to account for he presence of vast voids in the large-scale structure of the universe, as well as the early formation of the first stars and galaxies. Additionally, the observed matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe remains an unresolved issue. To address this latter question, Andrei Sakharov proposed a twin universe model in 1967. Building upon this idea and introducing interactions between these two universe sheets through a bimetric model, we propose an alternative interpretation of the large-scale structure of the universe, including its voids and the acceleration of cosmic expansion.</description>

      <title>Computable Cross Norm in Tensor Networks and Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.11978v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Computable Cross Norm (CCNR) was recently discussed in Ref.~\cite{Yin:2022toc} as a measure of multipartite entanglement in a condensed matter context. In this short note, we point out that it is closely related to the $(2,n)$-R\'enyi reflected entropy, which has been studied in the context of AdS/CFT. We discuss the calculation of the CCNR in random tensor networks as well as holographic CFTs. The holographic dual involves a backreacted entanglement wedge cross section in a geometry sourced by R\'enyi-2 cosmic branes. We perform explicit calculations for two intervals in a hyperbolic random tensor network as well the vacuum state of a 2D holographic CFT, and analyze the occurence of a connected-to-disconnected phase transition. The example illustrates the validity of the proposal for analytic continuation in holography for arbitrary values of R\'enyi parameter $n$. We comment on a symmetry-resolved generalization of this quantity.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves and primordial black holes from axion domain walls in level crossing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09138v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the nano-Hertz gravitational waves (GWs) emission and the massive primordial black holes (PBHs) formation from the light QCD axion scenario. We consider the axion domain walls formation from the level crossing induced by the mass mixing between the light $Z_{\mathcal N}$ QCD axion and axion-like particle. A general mixing case is considered that the heavy and light mass eigenvalues do not necessarily have to coincide with the axion masses. In order to form the domain walls, the axions should start to oscillate slightly before the level crossing. The domain walls must annihilate before dominating the Universe to avoid the cosmological catastrophe. Then we focus our attention on the GWs emission from the domain walls annihilation and the PBHs formation from the domain walls collapse. We show the predicted GWs spectra with the peak frequency $\sim 0.2\, \rm nHz$ and the peak amplitude $\sim 5\times 10^{-9}$, which can be tested by the future pulsar timing array projects. In addition, during the domain walls annihilation, the closed walls could shrink to the Schwarzschild radius and collapse into the PBHs. We find that the PBHs in the mass range of $\mathcal{O}(10^5-10^8) M_\odot$ could potentially form in this scenario and account for a small fraction $\sim 10^{-5}$ of the cold dark matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15134v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We apply and extend standard tools for void statistics to cosmological simulations that solve Einstein's equations with numerical relativity (NR). We obtain a simulated void catalogue without Newtonian approximations, using a new watershed void finder which operates on fluid-based NR simulations produced with the Einstein Toolkit. We compare and contrast measures of void size and void fraction, and compare radial stacked density profiles to empirically-derived Hamaus-Sutter-Wandelt (HSW) density profiles and profiles based on distance to void boundaries. We recover statistics roughly consistent with Newtonian N-body simulations where such a comparison is meaningful. We study variation of dynamical spatial curvature and local expansion explicitly demonstrating the spatial fluctuations of these quantities in void regions. We find that voids in our simulations expand ~10-30% faster than the global average and the spatial curvature density parameter in the centre of voids reaches ~60-80%.</description>

      <title>Constraining Post-Newtonian Parameters with the Cosmic Microwave Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20388v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Parameterised Post-Newtonian (PPN) approach is the default framework for performing precision tests of gravity in nearby astrophysical systems. In recent works we have extended this approach for cosmological applications, and in this paper we use observations of the anisotropies in the Cosmic Microwave Background to constrain the time variation of the PPN parameters $\alpha$ and $\gamma$ between last scattering and the present day. We find their time-averages over cosmological history should be within $\sim 20\%$ of their values in GR, with $\bar{\alpha}=0.89^{+0.08}_{-0.09}$ and $\bar{\gamma}=0.90^{+0.07}_{-0.08}$ at the $68\%$ confidence level. We also constrain the time derivatives of these parameters, and find that their present-day values should be within a factor of two of the best Solar System constraints. Many of these results have no counter-part from Solar System observations, and are entirely new constraints on the gravitational interaction. In all cases, we find that the data strongly prefer $\bar{\alpha}\simeq \bar{\gamma}$, meaning that observers would typically find local gravitational physics to be compatible with GR, despite considerable variation of $\alpha$ and $\gamma$ being allowed over cosmic history. This study lays the groundwork for future precision tests of gravity that combine observations made over all cosmological and astrophysical scales of length and time.</description>

      <title>New black ring with all independent conserved charges in five-dimensional minimal supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18142v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new exact solution for a general non-BPS black ring in the bosonic sector of five-dimensional minimal supergravity. This obtained solution carries four independent conserved charges: the mass, two angular momenta, an electric charge, and an additional dipole charge related to other charges. By employing the Ehlers-Harrison transformation, we derive this solution by transforming a five-dimensional vacuum solution into a charged solution in the theory. Previously, our work produced a vacuum doubly rotating black ring solution possessing a Dirac-Misner string singularity by using the Ehlers transformation. In this study, we use the singular black ring as the seed for the Harrison transformation. The resultant solution is regular, free from curvature singularities, conical singularities, orbifold singularities, Dirac-Misner string singularities, and closed timelike curves both on and outside the horizon. We show that within a specific parameter range, the black ring presents two branches for the same mass, two angular momenta and electric charge but these are distinguished by a dipole charge, which exhibits discontinuous non-uniqueness. Furthermore, this newly obtained black ring seamlessly connects to various physically significant solutions, such as the Pomeransky-Sen'kov black ring, the extremal black ring, the supersymmetric black ring, and the charged singly-spinning black ring.</description>

      <title>How the QCD trace anomaly behaves at the core of twin stars?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11614v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the behavior of the dense and cold (normalized) QCD trace anomaly, $\Delta$, in the interior of twin neutron stars (obtained from several sets of equations of state in agreement with modern compact-star and multimessenger data) satisfying static and dynamic stability conditions. We scan the formed twin-star parameter space in order to look for effects caused by the presence of a strong first-order phase transition connecting hadron and quark phases by means of a Maxwell construction. We found robustly that $\Delta$ suffers an abrupt decrease around the transition point, even reaching large negative values ($\Delta\simeq-0.35$), in marked contrast to current studies pointing out a smooth behavior with $\Delta\gtrsim 0$ at all densities. Besides, we characterize the behavior of {the recently defined} conformal factor, $d_{c}$, in our four categories of twin stars for which we perform comparisons with theoretical constraints put, e.g. by Bayesian studies sometimes adjusted to agree with perturbative QCD at high densities. These analyses allow us to hypothesize modifications in the strong QCD coupling in dense nuclear matter with a strong thermodynamic discontinuity.</description>

Abstract: We generalize the potential reconstruction method to set up a dynamical Einstein-Born-Infeld-dilaton model, which we then use to study holographic quarkonium melting in an external magnetic field. The non-linear nature of the model allows to couple the magnetic field to the quarkonium inner structure without having to introduce back-reacting charged flavour degrees of freedom. The magnetic field dependent melting temperature is computed from the spectral functions and suggests a switch from inverse magnetic to magnetic catalysis when the magnetic field increases. We also discuss the differences due to the anisotropy brought in by the external field.</description>

      <title>The anti-de Sitter supergeometry revisited</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03172v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a supergravity framework, the $\cal N$-extended anti-de Sitter (AdS) superspace in four spacetime dimensions, $\text{AdS}^{4|4\cal N} $, is a maximally symmetric background that is described by a curved superspace geometry with structure group $\mathsf{SL}(2, \mathbb{C}) \times \mathsf{U}({\cal N})$. On the other hand, within the group-theoretic setting, $\text{AdS}^{4|4{\cal N}} $ is realised as the coset superspace $\mathsf{OSp}({\cal N}|4;\mathbb{R}) /\big[ \mathsf{SL}(2, \mathbb{C}) \times \mathsf{O}({\cal N}) \big]$, with its structure group being $\mathsf{SL}(2, \mathbb{C}) \times \mathsf{O}({\cal N})$. Here we explain how the two frameworks are related. We give two explicit realisations of $\text{AdS}^{4|4{\cal N}} $ as a conformally flat superspace, thus extending the ${\cal N}=1$ and ${\cal N}=2$ results available in the literature. As applications, we describe: (i) a two-parameter deformation of the $\text{AdS}^{4|4{\cal N}} $ interval and the corresponding superparticle model; (ii) some implications of conformal flatness for superconformal higher-spin multiplets and an effective action generating the $\mathcal{N}=2$ super-Weyl anomaly; and (iii) $\kappa$-symmetry of the massless AdS superparticle.</description>

      <title>Counting microstates of out-of-equilibrium black hole fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06884v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct and count the microstates of out-of-equilibrium eternal AdS black holes in which a shell carrying an order one fraction of the black hole mass is emitted from the past horizon and re-absorbed at the future horizon. Our microstates have semiclassical interpretations in terms of matter propagating behind the horizon. We show that they span a Hilbert space with a dimension equal to the exponential of the horizon area of the intermediate black hole. This is consistent with the idea that, in a non-equilibrium setting, entropy is the logarithm of the number of microscopic configurations consistent with the dynamical macroscopic state. In our case, therefore, the entropy should measure the number of microstates consistent with a large and atypical macroscopic black hole fluctuation due to which part of the early time state becomes fully known to an external observer.</description>

Abstract: We discuss the effect of wave function renormalization (WFR) in asymptotically safe gravity. We show that there are two WFR-invariant quantities, and the renormalization (RG) equations may be written entirely in terms of these quantities. The same set of RG equations can be obtained whether we fix the vacuum energy or Newton coupling along the RG trajectory. The flow of the Newton constant and the vacuum energy is also discussed in detail. In particular we discuss how the vacuum energy behaves near the singular barrier in the low energy.</description>
