      <title>Weakly universal dynamical correlations between eigenvalues of large random matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It was shown roughly thirty years ago that the density correlations of eigenvalues of large random matrices display a universal form, independent of most of the details of the distribution of the random matrix itself. We show that when the matrix elements evolve according to a Dyson Brownian motion, dynamical correlations retain a large degree of the universality found at equal times when expressed in terms of the characteristics of some partial differential equation in the complex plane.</description>

      <title>Ground states of the Ising model at fixed magnetization on a triangular ladder with three-spin interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Ising model at fixed magnetization on a triangular ladder with three-spin interactions. By recasting the ground-state determination as a linear programming (LP) problem, we solve it exactly using standard LP techniques. We construct the phase diagram for arbitrary fixed magnetization and identify three types of ground states: periodic, phase-separated, and ordered but aperiodic. When magnetization is treated as a free parameter, the ground state adopts only periodic configurations with the average magnetization per site $0$, $\pm 1/3$ or $\pm 1$, except for the phase boundaries.</description>

      <title>The number of spanning trees as an indicator of critical phenomena: When Kirchhoff meets Ising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visibility graphs are spatial interpretations of time series. When derived from the time evolution of physical systems, the graphs associated with such series may exhibit properties that can reflect aspects such as ergodicity, criticality, or other dynamical behaviors. It is important to describe how the criticality of a system is manifested in the structure of the corresponding graphs or, in a particular way, in the spectra of certain matrices constructed from them. In this paper, we show how the critical behavior of an Ising spin system manifests in the spectra of the adjacency and Laplacian matrices constructed from an ensemble of time evolutions simulated via Monte Carlo (MC) Markov Chains, even for small systems and short MC steps. In particular, we show that the number of spanning trees -- or its logarithm -- , which represents a kind of \emph{structural entropy} or \emph{topological complexity} here obtained from Kirchhoff's theorem, can, in an alternative way, describe the criticality of the spin system. These findings parallel those obtained from the spectra of correlation matrices, which similarly encode signatures of critical and chaotic behavior.</description>

      <title>Ordering in statistical systems on the way to the thermodynamic limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that the mathematically accurate description of ordering and related symmetry breaking in statistical systems requires to consider the thermodynamic limit. But the order does not appear from nowhere, and yet before the thermodynamic limit is reached, there should exist some kind of preordering that appears and grows in the process of increasing the system size. The quantitative description of growing order, under the growing system size, is developed by introducing the notion of {\it order indices}. The rigorous proof of the phase transition existence is a separate difficult problem that is not the topic of the present paper. We illustrate the approach resorting to several models in the mean-field approximation, which makes it possible to demonstrate the notion of order indices for finite systems in a clear way. We show how the order grows on the way to the thermodynamic limit for Bose-Einstein condensation, arising superconductivity, magnetization, and crystallization phenomena.</description>

      <title>On the thermodynamic analogy of intracellular diffusivity fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two recent topics on a formal thermodynamic analogy of intracellular diffusivity fluctuations observed experimentally in normal/anomalous diffusion are reported. Not only the analogs of the quantity of heat and work as well as the internal energy but also that of the Clausius inequality are identified. Then, the analog of the heat engine is constructed to characterize extraction of the diffusivity change as the analog of work during a cycle, the efficiency of which is formally equivalent to that of the Carnot engine, making the total change of the entropy concerning the fluctuations vanish. The effect of the slow variation of the fluctuations on the efficiency is also briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Electrical conductivity of randomly placed linear wires: a mean field approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the mean-field approximation, a formula for the effective electrical conductivity of a two-dimensional system of randomly arranged conducting sticks with a given orientation distribution was obtained. Both the resistance of the sticks themselves and the resistance of the contacts between them were taken into account. The accuracy in the resulting formula was analyzed. A comparison of the theoretical predictions of mean-field approach with the results of direct electrical conductivity calculations for several model orientation distributions describing systems with crossed sticks demonstrated good agreement.</description>

      <title>Relaxation time for competing short- and long-range interactions in the model A dynamic universality class</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the relaxation dynamics at criticality in the one-dimensional spin-$1/2$ Nagle-Kardar model, where short- and long-range interactions can compete. The phase diagram of this model shows lines of first and second-order phase transitions, separated by a tricritical point. We consider Glauber dynamics, focusing on the slowing-down of the magnetization $m$ both along the critical line and at the tricritical point. Starting from the master equation and performing a coarse-graining procedure, we obtain a Fokker-Planck equation for $m$ and the fraction of defects. Using central manifold theory, we analytically show that $m$ decays asymptotically as $t^{-1/2}$ along the critical line, and as $t^{-1/4}$ at the tricritical point. This result implies that the dynamical critical exponent is $z=2$, proving that the macroscopic critical dynamics of the Nagle-Kardar model falls within the dynamic universality class of purely relaxational dynamics with a non-conserved order parameter (model A). Large deviation techniques enable us to show that the average first passage time between local equilibrium states follows an Arrhenius law.</description>

      <title>Persistence of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition with long-range couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition is an archetypal example of a topological phase transition, which is driven by the proliferation of vortices. In this Letter, we analyze the persistence of the BKT transition in the XY model under the influence of long-range algebraically decaying interactions of the form $\sim 1/{r^{2+\sigma}}$. The model hosts a magnetized low temperature phase for sufficiently small $\sigma$. Crucially, in the presence of long-range interactions, spin waves renormalize the interaction between vortices, which stabilizes the BKT transition. As a result, we find that there is no direct transition from the magnetized to the disordered phase and that the BKT transition persists for arbitrary long-range exponents, which is distinct from previous results. We use both Landau-Peierls-type arguments and renormalization group calculations - including a coupling between spin wave and topological excitations - and obtain similar results. We emphasize that Landau-Peierls-type arguments are a powerful tool for analyzing continuous spin models. We discuss the relevance of our findings for current Rydberg atom experiments, and highlight the importance of long-range couplings for other types of topological defects.</description>

      <title>Cluster percolation in the three-dimensional $\pm J$ random-bond Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on extensive parallel-tempering Monte Carlo simulations, we investigate the relationship between cluster percolation and equilibrium ordering phenomena in the three-dimensional $\pm J$ random-bond Ising model as one varies the fraction of antiferromagnetic bonds. We consider a range of cluster definitions, most of which are constructed in the space of overlaps between two independent real replicas of the system. In the pure ferromagnet that is contained as a limiting case in the class of problems considered, the relevant percolation point coincides with the thermodynamic ordering transition. For the disordered ferromagnet encountered first on introducing antiferromagnetic bonds and the adjacent spin-glass phase of strong disorder this connection is altered, and one finds a percolation transition above the thermodynamic ordering point that is accompanied by the appearance of /two/ percolating clusters of equal density. Only at the lower (disordered) ferromagnetic or spin-glass transition points the densities of these two clusters start to diverge, thus providing a percolation signature of these thermodynamic transitions. We compare the scaling behavior at this secondary percolation transition with the thermodynamic behavior at the corresponding ferromagnetic and spin-glass phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Two variants of the friendship paradox: The condition for inequality between them</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The friendship paradox -- the observation that, on average, one's friends have more friends than oneself -- admits two common formulations depending on whether averaging is performed over edges or over nodes. These two definitions, the "alter-based" and "ego-based" means, are often treated as distinct but related quantities. This document establishes their exact analytical relationship, showing that the difference between them is governed by the degree-degree covariance normalized by the mean degree. Explicit examples demonstrate the three possible cases of positive, zero, and negative covariance, corresponding respectively to assortative, neutral, and disassortative mixing patterns. The derivation further connects the covariance form to the moment-based expression introduced by Kumar, Krackhardt, and Feld [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 121, e2306412121 (2024)], which involves the (-1)st, 1st, 2nd, and 3rd moments of the degree distribution. The two formulations are shown to be equivalent, as they should be: the moment-based representation expands the same structural dependence that the covariance form expresses in its most compact and interpretable form. The analysis thus unifies node-level and moment-level perspectives on the friendship paradox, offering both a pedagogically transparent derivation and a direct bridge to recent theoretical developments.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive Validation of Replica Symmetry Breaking via Quantum Annealing: From Ground States to Topological Collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Giorgio Parisi's exact solution of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick spin glass, recognized with the 2021 Nobel Prize in Physics, revealed revolutionary hierarchical organization in disordered systems, yet systematic validation has remained computationally intractable beyond $N \sim 100$ spins, and the topological limits of this complexity remain unexplored. Here we leverage quantum annealing to extend ground-state computations to 4000 spins and systematically probe both the emergence and breakdown of replica symmetry breaking. Three independent measurements validate core RSB predictions: ground-state energies converge to Parisi's value $E_\infty/N = -0.7633$ with predicted $N^{-2/3}$ finite-size corrections; chaos exponent $\theta = 0.51 \pm 0.02$ confirms mean-field square-root scaling ($R^2 = 0.989$); and state-space overlap distribution exhibits broad continuous structure ($\sigma_q = 0.19$) characteristic of hierarchical landscape organization. We then investigate RSB robustness by introducing controlled network dilution via the Blume-Capel model with vacancy formation. Remarkably, hierarchical complexity remains invariant under 36\% dilution, proving RSB is a topological property of network connectivity rather than spin density. Beyond a critical threshold in the range $0.8 &lt; D_c &lt; 0.9$, the hierarchy collapses discontinuously as the system undergoes complete conversion to the all-vacancy state within a narrow parameter window an abrupt avalanche-driven transition where independent-vacancy mean-field theory correctly predicts the energy scale but fails to capture the cooperative dynamics. This comprehensive validation across thermodynamics, universality, landscape geometry, and topological limits establishes quantum advantage for probing fundamental statistical mechanics in complex systems relevant to neural networks, optimization, and materials science.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Equal-time scaling exponents in fully developed turbulence typically exhibit non anomalous scaling in the inverse cascade of two-dimensional (2D) turbulence and anomalous scaling in three dimensions. We demonstrate that multiscaling is not confined to longitudinal, scalar velocity increments, but also emerges in increments associated with the magnitude and orientation of the velocity vector. This decomposition uncovers a multiscaling in the 2D inverse cascade, which remains obscured when using conventional structure functions. Our results highlight a decoupling between velocity amplitude and flow geometry, offering new insight into the statistical structure of turbulent cascades as well as showing how different classes of multiscaling emerge.</description>

      <title>Metamagnetic Transition in Low-Dimensional Site-Decorated Quantum Heisenberg Ferrimagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The prohibition of finite-temperature phase transition in one-dimensional (1D) Ising models and 1D/2D quantum Heisenberg models with short-range interactions fundamentally constrains the application potentials of low-dimensional magnetic materials. Recently, ultranarrow phase crossover (UNPC), which can approach a transition at a desirable finite temperature $T_0$ arbitrarily closely, was discovered in 1D decorated Ising chains and ladders. Here we present a theoretical study of similarly decorated, yet much more challenging, quantum Heisenberg ferrimagnets in a magnetic field, which features ferromagnetic backbone exchange $J$, antiferromagnetic site-decoration coupling $J_{AF}$, and different magnetic moments for the backbone and decorating spins $\mu_aS_a&lt;\mu_bS_b$. We exactly solved the model in the large $J$ limit -- as a central-macrospin model -- and found two finite-temperature second-order transitions; just above $T_{c2}$ a ``half-ice, half-fire'' regime appears. Finite-$J$ weak-field results follow from an effective-field mapping, suggesting the emergence of UNPC at finite $T_0$ in 2D square lattices thanks to its exponentially strong initial magnetic susceptibility $\chi_0\propto e^{4\pi S_a^2 J/T_0}$, though less likely in 1D chains where $\chi_0\propto J/T_0$. These results may shed light on new technological applications of low-dimensional quantum spin systems and attract experimental and computational tests.</description>

      <title>Emergent self-inhibition governs the landscape of stable states in complex ecosystems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Species-rich ecosystems often exhibit multiple stable states with distinct species compositions. Yet, the factors determining the likelihood of each state's occurrence remain poorly understood. Here, we characterize and explain the landscape of stable states in the random Generalized Lotka-Volterra (GLV) model, in which multistability is widespread. We find that the same pool of species with random initial abundances can result in different stable states, whose likelihoods typically differ by orders of magnitude. A state's likelihood increases sharply with its total biomass, or inverse self-inhibition. We develop a simplified model to predict and explain this behavior, by coarse-graining ecological interactions so that each stable state behaves as a unit. In this setting, we can accurately predict the entire landscape of stable states using only two macroscopic properties: the biomass of each state and species diversity. Our theory also provides insight into the biomass-likelihood relationship: High-biomass states have low self-inhibition and thus grow faster, outcompete others, and become much more likely. These results reveal emergent self-inhibition as a fundamental organizing principle for the attractor landscape of complex ecosystems - and provide a path to predict ecosystem outcomes without knowing microscopic interactions.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of number entropy for free fermionic systems in presence of defects and stochastic processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of number entropy in a chain of free fermions subjected to both defects and stochastic processes. For a special class of defects, namely conformal defects, we present analytical and numerical results for the temporal growth of number entropy, the time evolution of the number distribution, and the eigenvalue profile of the associated correlation matrix within a subsystem. We show that the number entropy exhibits logarithmic growth in time, originating from the Gaussian structure of the number distribution. We find that the eigenvalue dynamics reveal a profound connection to the reflection and transmission coefficients of the associated scattering problem for a broad range of defects. When stochastic processes are introduced, specifically Stochastic Unitary Processes (SUP) and Quantum State Diffusion (QSD), the number entropy scales as $\ln(t)$ in the SUP case and shows strong hints of $\ln [\ln(t)]$ scaling in the QSD case. These findings establish compelling evidence that number entropy grows logarithmically slower than the corresponding von Neumann entanglement entropy across a wide class of systems.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Enhancement of Yield Strength due to Static Friction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Friction is fundamental to mechanical stability across scales, from geological faults and architectural structures to granular materials and animal feet. We study the mechanical stability of a minimal friction-stabilized structure composed of three cylindrical particles arranged in a triangular stack on a floor under gravity. We analyze the yield force, defined as the threshold compressive force applied quasi-statically from above at which the structure collapses due to sliding at the floor contact. Using singular perturbation analysis, we derive an expression which quantitatively predicts the yield force as a function of the static friction coefficient and a small dimensionless parameter $\epsilon$ characterizing elastic deformation.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Thermodynamic Formalism: Mean-field Phase Transitions, Large Deviations and Bogoliubov's Variational Principle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\Omega =\{1,2,\ldots ,d\}^{\mathbb{N}}$, $T$ be the shift acting on $\Omega $, $\mathcal{P}(T)$ the set of $T$-invariant probabilities. Given a H\"{o}lder potential $A$ and a continuous function $F$, we investigate the probabilities $\rho _{F,A}$ that are maximizers of the nonlinear pressure
  $\mathfrak{P}_{F,A}:=\sup_{\rho \in \mathcal{P}(T)}\{ F(\int A(x)\rho (\mathrm{d}x))+h(\rho )\} .$
  $\rho _{F,A}$} is called a nonlinear equilibrium; a nonlinear phase transition occurs when there is more than one. In the case $F$\ is convex or concave, we combine Varadhan's lemma and Bogoliubov's variational principle to characterize them via the linear pressure problem and self-consistency conditions. Let $\mu \in \mathcal{P}(T)$ be the maximal entropy measure, $\varphi _{n}(x)=n^{-1}(\varphi (x)+\varphi (T(x))+\cdots +\varphi (T^{n-1}(x)))$ and $\beta &gt;0$.}\newline
  (I) We also consider the limit measure $\mathfrak{m}$ on $ \Omega $, so that $\forall \psi \in C(\Omega )$,
  $\int \psi (x)\,\mathfrak{m}\,( \mathrm{d}x)\,\,=\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty }\frac{\,\int \,\psi (x)\,\,\,e^{ \frac{\beta n}{2}\,\,A_{n}((x)^{2}}\,\,\mu \,(\mathrm{d}x)\,}{\int e^{\frac{ \beta n}{2}\,\,A_{n}((x)^{2}}\mu \,(\mathrm{d}x)\,\,}.$
  We call $\mathfrak{m}$ a \textit{quadratic mean-field Gibbs probability
  (II) Via subsequences $n_{k}$, $k\in \mathbb{N}$, we study the limit measure $\mathfrak{M}$ on $\Omega $, so that $\forall \psi \in C(\Omega )$,
  $\int \psi (x)\mathfrak{M}(\mathrm{d} x)=\lim_{k\rightarrow \infty }\frac{\,\int \psi _{n_{k}}(x)e^{\frac{\beta n_{k}}{2}A_{n_{k}}(x)^{2}}\mu (\mathrm{d}x)}{\int e^{\frac{\beta n_{k}}{2} A_{n_{k}}(x)^{2}}\mu (\mathrm{d}x)}.$
  We call $\mathfrak{M}$ a quadratic mean-field equilibrium probability; it is shift-invariant.
  Explicit examples are given.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Approach to Finite-Bath Open Quantum Systems: Exact Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here, we develop the exact dynamics of the central spin model, modeling a finite-bath open quantum system. Particularly, two different types of interactions are investigated between the system and the bath: Heisenberg interaction with constant interaction strength, and a stochastic time-dependent interaction. In the former case, a new quantum channel is characterized, while the latter elucidates the microscopic understanding of a very well-known non-Markovian quantum channel. Exact master equations are provided in both scenarios. This is achieved by developing a new technique for obtaining a master equation from the map, making use of the concept of a minimal dissipator. This paves the way for a foundational understanding of finite-bath open quantum systems and a number of novel applications in the vast domain of quantum physics, one of which, implemented here, is in quantum thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Matrix-product state skeletons in Onsager-integrable quantum chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Matrix-product state (MPS) skeletons are connected networks of Hamiltonians with exact MPS ground states that underlie a phase diagram. Such skeletons have previously been found in classes of free-fermion models. For the translation-invariant BDI and AIII free-fermion classes, it has been shown that the underlying skeleton is dense, giving an analytic approach to MPS approximation of ground states anywhere in the class. In this paper, we partially expose the skeleton in certain interacting spin chains: the $N$-state Onsager-integrable chiral clock families. We construct MPS that form a dense MPS skeleton in the gapped regions surrounding a sequence of fixed-point Hamiltonians (the generators of the Onsager algebra). Outside these gapped regions, these MPS remain eigenstates, but no longer give the many-body ground state. Rather, they are ground states in particular sectors of the spectrum. Our methods also allow us to find further MPS eigenstates; these correspond to low-lying excited states within the aforementioned gapped regions. This set of MPS excited states goes beyond the previous analysis of ground states on the $N=2$ free-fermion MPS skeleton. As an application of our results, we find a closed form for the disorder parameter in a family of interacting models. Finally, we remark that many of our results use only the Onsager algebra and are not specific to the chiral clock model representation.</description>

      <title>Thermal Tensor Network Simulations of Fermions with a Fixed Filling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.07303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerical simulations of strongly correlated fermions at finite temperature are essential for studying high-temperature superconductivity and other quantum many-body phenomena. The recently developed tangent-space tensor renormalization group (tanTRG) provides an efficient and accurate framework by representing thermal density operators as matrix product operators. However, the particle number generally varies during the cooling process. The conventional strategy of fine-tuning chemical potentials to reach a target filling is computationally demanding. Here we propose a fixed-$N$ tanTRG algorithm that stabilizes the average particle number by adaptively tuning the chemical potential within the imaginary-time evolution. We benchmark its accuracy on exactly solvable free fermions, and further apply it to the square-lattice Hubbard model. For hole-doped cases, we study the temperature evolution of charge and spin correlations, identifying several characteristic temperature scales for stripe formation. Our results establish fixed-$N$ tanTRG as an efficient and reliable tool for finite-temperature studies of correlated fermion systems.</description>

      <title>Decoupling of clusters in independent sets in a percolated hypercube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Independent sets in graphs are sets of vertices containing no neighbors, and they represent a canonical spin system with hardcore constraints. Of particular interest is the setting of the boolean hypercube, where counting independent sets was the original motivator for Sapozhenko's famous graph container method. A modern perspective on such problems is to consider the effect of disorder, and the study of independent sets in random subgraphs of the hypercube obtained via bond percolation with parameter $p$ was initiated by Kronenberg and Spinka. They employed tools from statistical mechanics to obtain detailed information about the moments of the number of independent sets (now a random variable), and posed many interesting questions. Previous work by the authors addressed many of these questions in the regime $p \geq \frac{2}{3}$, where the behavior is relatively simple and can be modeled well by a related family of independent particles.
  As $p$ decreases, though, typical independent sets become larger and feature more intricate clustering behavior. In the present article we overcome many of the challenges presented by this phenomenon and analyze the model for all $p&gt; 0.465$. We obtain a sharp in-probability approximation for the number of independent sets in the percolated hypercube in terms of explicit random variables, as well as provide a sampling algorithm. Note that this shows, curiously, that $p = \frac{1}{2}$ is not a natural barrier for this problem unlike in many other problems where it appears as a point of a phase transition. A key contribution of this work is the introduction of a new probabilistic framework to handle the clustering behavior for these low values of $p$. Although our analysis is restricted to $p &gt; 0.465$, our arguments are expected to be helpful for studying this model at even lower values of $p$, and possibly for other related problems.</description>

Abstract: We study a one-dimensional gas of $N$ Brownian particles that diffuse independently, but are {\it simultaneously} reset to the origin at a constant rate $r$. The system approaches a non-equilibrium stationary state (NESS) with long-range interactions induced by the simultaneous resetting. Despite the presence of strong correlations, we show that several observables can be computed exactly, which include the global average density, the distribution of the position of the $k$-th rightmost particle and the spacing distribution between two successive particles. Our analytical results are confirmed by numerical simulations. We also discuss a possible experimental realisation of this resetting gas using optical traps.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.08290v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze F\"urth's 1933 classical uncertainty relations in the modern language of stochastic differential equations. Our interest is motivated by applications to non-equilibrium classical statistical mechanics. We show that F\"urth's uncertainty relations are a property enjoyed by martingales under the measure of a diffusion process. This result implies a lower bound on fluctuations in current velocities of entropic quantifiers of transitions in stochastic thermodynamics. In cases of particular interest, we recover an inequality well known in optimal mass transport relating the mean kinetic energy of the current velocity and the squared quadratic Wasserstein distance between the probability distributions of the entropy. In performing our analysis, we also avail us of an unpublished argument due to Krzysztof Gaw\c{e}dzki to derive a lower bound to the entropy production by transition described by Langevin-Kramers process in terms of the squared quadratic Wasserstein distance between the initial and final states of the transition. Finally, we illustrate how F\"urth's relations admit a straightforward extension to piecewise deterministic processes. We thus show that the results in the paper concern properties enjoyed by general Markov processes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07737v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Collisional Brownian engines have attracted significant attention due to their simplicity, experimental accessibility, and amenability to exact analytical solutions. While previous research has predominantly focused on optimizing mean values of power and efficiency, the joint statistical properties of these performance metrics remain largely unexplored. Using stochastic thermodynamics, we investigate the joint probability distributions of power and efficiency for collisional Brownian engines, revealing how thermodynamic fluctuations influence the probability of observing values exceeding their respective mean maxima. Our conditional probability analysis demonstrates that when power fluctuates above its maximum mean value, the probability of achieving high efficiency increases substantially, suggesting fluctuation regimes where the classical power-efficiency trade-off can be probabilistically overcome. Notably, our framework extends to a broader class of engines, as the essential features of the statistics of the system are fully determined by the Onsager coefficients. Our results contribute to a deeper understanding of the role of fluctuations in Brownian engines, highlighting how stochastic behavior can enable performance beyond traditional thermodynamic bounds.</description>

      <title>Microcanonical simulated annealing: Massively parallel Monte Carlo simulations with sporadic random-number generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16240v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Numerical simulations of models and theories that describe complex experimental systems $\unicode{x2014}$in fields like high-energy and condensed-matter physics$\unicode{x2014}$ are becoming increasingly important. Examples include lattice gauge theories, which can describe, among others, quantum chromodynamics (the Standard Model description of strong interactions between elementary particles), and spin-glass systems. Beyond fundamental research, these computational methods also find practical applications, among many others, in optimization, finance, and complex biological problems. However, Monte Carlo simulations, an important subcategory of these methods, are plagued by a major drawback: they are extremely greedy for (pseudo) random numbers. The total fraction of computer time dedicated to random-number generation increases as the hardware grows more sophisticated, and can get prohibitive for special-purpose computing platforms. We propose here a general-purpose microcanonical simulated annealing (MicSA) formalism that dramatically reduces such a burden. The algorithm is fully adapted to a massively parallel computation, as we show in the particularly demanding benchmark of the three-dimensional Ising spin glass. We carry out very stringent numerical tests of the new algorithm by comparing our results, obtained on GPUs, with high-precision standard (i.e., random-number-greedy) simulations performed on the Janus II custom-built supercomputer. In those cases where thermal equilibrium is reachable (i.e., in the paramagnetic phase), both simulations reach compatible values. More significantly, barring short-time corrections, a simple time rescaling suffices to map the MicSA off-equilibrium dynamics onto the results obtained with standard simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03957v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that long-wavelength interfacial fluctuations are strongly suppressed in non-equilibrium phase coexistence between bulk hyperuniform systems. Using simulations of three distinct microscopic models, we demonstrate that hyperuniform interfaces are much smoother than equilibrium ones, with a universal reduction of height fluctuations at large scale. We derive a non-equilibrium interface equation from the field theory of the bulk order parameter, and predict a reduction in height fluctuations, $S_h(\boldsymbol k)\equiv \langle |h(\boldsymbol k)|^2\rangle\sim |\boldsymbol k|^{-1}$, in stark contrast to equilibrium capillary wave theory where $S_h(\boldsymbol k)\sim |\boldsymbol k|^{-2}$. Our results establish a new universality class for non-equilibrium interfaces, highlighting the fundamental role of suppressed bulk fluctuations in shaping interfacial dynamics far from equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Excess dissipation shapes symmetry breaking in non-equilibrium currents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05882v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most natural thermodynamic systems operate far from equilibrium, developing persistent currents and organizing into non-equilibrium stationary states (NESSs). Yet, the principles by which such systems self-organize, breaking equilibrium symmetries under external and internal constraints, remain unclear. Here, we establish a general connection between symmetry breaking and dissipation in mesoscopic stochastic systems described by Langevin dynamics. Using a geometric framework based on the inverse diffusion matrix, we decompose the velocity field into excess (gradient) and housekeeping (residual) components. This provides a natural entropy production split: the excess part captures internal reorganization under non-equilibrium conditions, while the housekeeping part quantifies detailed-balance violation due to external forces. We derive an exact equality linking the two, along with an inequality identifying accessible thermodynamics. A weak-noise expansion of the stationary solution reveals the general geometry of the NESS velocity field, enabling a unified classification of steady states. We apply this framework to systems ranging from molecular machines to coupled oscillators, showing how symmetry breaking in trajectory space constrains NESS organization. We further extend our approach to systems with multiplicative noise, deriving how additional symmetry breaking relates to curved (space-dependent) metrics. Finally, we show that both the NESS velocity field and stationary distribution can be derived through variational functionals based on excess dissipation. This work sheds light on the intimate connection between geometric features, dissipative properties, and symmetry breaking, uncovering a classification of NESSs that reflects how emergent organization reflects physical non-equilibrium conditions.</description>

Abstract: We show that when a Brownian bridge is physically constrained to satisfy a canonical condition, its time evolution exactly coincides with an m-geodesic on the statistical manifold of Gaussian distributions. This identification provides a direct physical realization of a geometric concept in information geometry. It implies that purely random processes evolve along informationally straight trajectories, analogous to geodesics in general relativity. Our findings suggest that the asymmetry of informational ``distance" (divergence) plays a fundamental physical role, offering a concrete step toward an equivalence principle for information.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01926v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Building upon the framework established in our recent work [M. Seifi et al., Phys. Rev. E 111, 054114 (2025)], wherein a generalized Maxwell Boltzmann distribution was formulated using the Mittag Leffler function within the superstatistical formalism, we extend this approach to the quantum domain. Specifically, we introduce two statistical distributions,termed the Mittag Leffler Bose Einstein (MLBE) and Mittag Leffler Fermi Dirac (MLFD) distributions, constructed by generalizing the conventional Bose-Einstein and Fermi-Dirac distributions through the Mittag-Leffler function. This generalization incorporates a deformation parameter (\alpha), which facilitates a continuous interpolation between bosonic and fermionic statistics, while inherently capturing nonequilibrium effects and generalized thermodynamic behavior. We analyze the thermodynamic geometry associated with these distributions and identify significant departures from standard statistical models. Notably, the MLBE distribution manifests a Bose-Einstein-like condensation even in the absence of interactions, whereas the MLFD distribution exhibits unconventional features, such as negative heat capacity in the low-temperature regime. These findings highlight the pivotal role of statistical deformation in determining emergent macroscopic thermodynamic phenomena.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.05490v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct exact strong zero mode operators (ESZM) in integrable quantum circuits and the spin-1/2 XXZ chain for general open boundary conditions, which break the bulk U(1) symmetry of the time evolution operators. We show that the ESZM is localized around one of the boundaries and induces infinite boundary coherence times. Finally, we prove that the ESZM becomes spatially non-local under the map that relates the spin-1/2 XXZ chain to the asymmetric simple exclusion process, which suggests that it does not play a significant role in the dynamics of the latter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08805v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the application of Newton-Cartan geometry to the kinetic theory of gases that includes non-relativistic gravitational effects and the principle of general covariance. Starting with an introduction to the basics of Newton-Cartan geometry, we examine the motion of point particles within this framework, leading to a detailed analysis of kinetic theory and the derivation of conservation equations. The equilibrium distribution function is explored, and the example of a rotating gas in a gravitational field is discussed. Further, we develop covariant hydrodynamic equations and extend our analysis through a gradient expansion approach to assess first-order constitutive relations for rotating gases. Finally, we address the frame-dependence paradox, presenting a novel resolution that addresses apparent discrepancies. Our construction resolves a fifty-year-old debate about the frame-indifferent formulation of kinetic theory. The resolution is presented in a modern, symmetry-based approach.</description>

      <title>Localized RG flows on composite defects and $\mathcal{C}$-theorem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04428v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a composite defect system where a lower-dimensional defect (sub-defect) is embedded to a higher-dimensional one, and examine renormalization group (RG) flows localized on the defect. A composite defect is constructed in the $(3-\epsilon)$-dimensional free $\text{O}(N)$ vector model with line and surface interactions by triggering localized RG flows to non-trivial IR fixed points. Focusing on the case where the symmetry group $\text{O}(N)$ is broken to a subgroup $\text{O}(m)\times\text{O}(N-m)$ on the line defect, there is an $\text{O}(N)$ symmetric fixed point for all $N$, while two additional $\text{O}(N)$ symmetry breaking ones appear for $N\ge 23$. We also examine a $\mathcal{C}$-theorem for localized RG flows along the sub-defect and show that the $\mathcal{C}$-theorem holds in our model by perturbative calculations.</description>

      <title>Geometric expansion of fluctuations and average shadows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08364v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fluctuations of observables provide unique insights into the nature of physical systems, and their study stands as a cornerstone of both theoretical and experimental science. Generalized fluctuations, or cumulants, provide information beyond the mean and variance of an observable. In this paper, we develop a systematic method to determine the asymptotic behavior of cumulants of local observables as the region becomes large. Our analysis reveals that the expansion is closely tied to the geometric characteristics of the region and its boundary, with coefficients given by convex moments of the connected correlation function: the latter is integrated against intrinsic volumes of convex polytopes built from the coordinates, which can be interpreted as average shadows. A particular application of our method shows that, in two dimensions, the leading behavior of odd cumulants of conserved quantities is topological, specifically depending on the Euler characteristic of the region. We illustrate these results with the paradigmatic strongly-interacting system of two-dimensional quantum Hall state at filling fraction $1/2$, by performing Monte-Carlo calculations of the skewness (third cumulant) of particle number in the Laughlin state.</description>

      <title>Neural Thermodynamics: Entropic Forces in Deep and Universal Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12387v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the rapid discovery of emergent phenomena in deep learning and large language models, understanding their cause has become an urgent need. Here, we propose a rigorous entropic-force theory for understanding the learning dynamics of neural networks trained with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and its variants. Building on the theory of parameter symmetries and an entropic loss landscape, we show that representation learning is crucially governed by emergent entropic forces arising from stochasticity and discrete-time updates. These forces systematically break continuous parameter symmetries and preserve discrete ones, leading to a series of gradient balance phenomena that resemble the equipartition property of thermal systems. These phenomena, in turn, (a) explain the universal alignment of neural representations between AI models and lead to a proof of the Platonic Representation Hypothesis, and (b) reconcile the seemingly contradictory observations of sharpness- and flatness-seeking behavior of deep learning optimization. Our theory and experiments demonstrate that a combination of entropic forces and symmetry breaking is key to understanding emergent phenomena in deep learning.</description>

      <title>Beyond one-loop calculation: Higher-order effects on Gross-Neveu-Yukawa tensorial criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20710v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa field theory for the SO($N$) symmetric traceless rank-two tensor order parameter coupled to Majorana fermions using the $\epsilon$-expansion around upper critical dimensions of $3+1$ to two loops. Previously we established in the one-loop calculation that the theory does not exhibit a critical fixed point for $N \geq 4$, but that nevertheless the stable fixed point inevitably emerges at a large number of fermion flavors $N_f$. For $N_f &lt; N_{f,c1} \approx N/2$, no critical fixed point exists; for $N_{f,c1} &lt; N_f &lt; N_{f,c2}$, a real critical fixed point emerges from the complex plane but fails to satisfy the additional stability conditions necessary for a continuous phase transition; and finally only for $N_f &gt; N_{f,c2} \approx N$, the fixed point satisfies the stability conditions as well. In the present work we compute the $O(\epsilon)$ (two-loop) corrections to the critical flavour numbers $N_{f,c1} $ and $N_{f,c2}$. Most importantly, we observe a sharp decrease in $N_{f,c2}$ from its one-loop value, which brings it closer to the point $N_f =1$ relevant to the standard Gross-Neveu model. Some three-loop results are also presented and discussed.</description>

      <title>Probing forced responses and causality in data-driven climate emulators: conceptual limitations and the role of reduced-order models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22552v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A central challenge in climate science and applied mathematics is developing data-driven models of multiscale systems that capture both stationary statistics and responses to external perturbations. Current neural climate emulators aim to resolve the atmosphere-ocean system in all its complexity but often fail to reproduce forced responses, limiting their use in causal studies such as Green's function experiments. To investigate the origin of these limitations, we first focus on a simplified dynamical system that retains key features of climate variability. We interpret the results through linear response theory, providing a rigorous framework to evaluate neural models beyond stationary statistics and probe causal mechanisms. We argue that the ability of multiscale systems' emulators to reproduce perturbed statistics depends critically on (i) identifying an appropriate coarse-grained representation and (ii) careful parameterizations of unresolved processes. For low-frequency climate dynamics, these insights highlight reduced-order models, tailored to specific processes and scales, as valuable alternatives to general-purpose emulators. We next consider a real-world application, developing a neural model to investigate the joint variability of the surface temperature field and radiative fluxes. The model infers a multiplicative noise process directly from data, largely reproduces the system's probability distribution, and enables causal studies through forced responses. We discuss its limitations and outline directions for future work. These results expose fundamental challenges in data-driven modeling of multiscale physical systems and underscore the value of coarse-grained, stochastic approaches, with response theory as a principled framework to guide model design.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09892v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the 1970s, the renowned physicist Victor Weisskopf famously developed a research program to qualitatively explain properties of matter in terms of the fundamental constants of physics. But there was one type of matter prominently missing from Weisskopf's analysis: life. Here, we develop Weisskopf-style arguments demonstrating how the fundamental constants of physics can be used to understand the properties of living systems. By combining biophysical arguments and dimensional analysis, we show that vital properties of chemical self-replicators, such as growth yield, minimum doubling time, and minimum power consumption in dormancy, can be quantitatively estimated using fundamental physical constants. The calculations highlight how the laws of physics constrain chemistry-based life on Earth, and if it exists, elsewhere in our universe.</description>

      <title>Going beyond Landauer: Information-cost relations from inference based on the maximum entropy principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17060v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Landauer's principle, a cornerstone of information thermodynamics, provides a fundamental lower bound on the energetic cost of information erasure in terms of the information content change. However, its traditional formulation is largely confined to systems exchanging solely energy with an ideal thermal bath. In this work, we derive general information-cost trade-off relations that go beyond the scope of Landauer's principle by developing a thermodynamic inference approach based on the maximum entropy principle. These relations require only information about the system and are applicable to complex quantum scenarios involving multiple conserved charges and non-thermal environments. Specifically, we present two key results: (i) In scenarios where only the mean values of observables are accessible, we derive an information-content-informed upper bound on the thermodynamic cost which complements an existing generalized Landauer lower bound. (ii) When second-order fluctuations can also be measured, we obtain an information-content-informed lower bound on the change in variances of observables, thereby extending the Landauer's principle to constrain higher-order fluctuation costs. We numerically validate our information-cost trade-off relations using a coupled-qubit system exchanging energy and excitations, a driven qubit implementing an information erasure process, and a driven double quantum dot system that can operate as an inelastic heat engine. Our results underscore the broad utility of maximum-entropy inference in constraining thermodynamic costs for generic finite-time quantum processes, with direct relevance to quantum information processing and quantum thermodynamic applications.</description>

      <title>Scrambling Without Chaos in Random Free-Fermionic Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.21217v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the role of randomness in the scrambling of quantum information within integrable free-fermionic systems. Considering quadratic Hamiltonians with varying degrees of randomness, we analyze entanglement-based measures to characterize the scrambling structure. We show that the memory effect in the entanglement of disjoint subsystems of Gaussian states vanishes when the local couplings are random, indicating information delocalization. The tripartite mutual information exhibits negative saturation values similar to those in chaotic systems, albeit with a smaller magnitude, revealing weaker scrambling under integrable quadratic dynamics. Despite integrability, spectral analyses reveal that local random models display a spectral-form-factor ramp and a partial crossover in the single-particle level-spacing ratio from Poisson-like to Wigner--Dyson-like behavior within a certain range of random couplings. These results demonstrate that randomness can act as a minimal ingredient for inducing information scrambling in integrable quadratic fermionic models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.22542v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a unified framework connecting decoherence and quantum complexity. By vectorizing the density matrix into a pure state in a double Hilbert space, a decoherence process is mapped to an imaginary-time evolution. Expanding this evolution in the Krylov space, we find that the $n$-th Krylov basis corresponds to an $n$-error state generated by the decoherence, providing a natural bridge between error proliferation and complexity growth. Using two dephasing quantum channels as concrete examples, we show that the Krylov complexity remains nonsingular for strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry-breaking (SWSSB) crossovers, while it exhibits a singular area-to-volume-law transition for genuine SWSSB phase transitions, intrinsic to mixed states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24091v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the mirrors model in $d$ dimensions on an infinite slab and with unit density. This is a deterministic dynamics in a random environment. We argue that the crossing probability of the slab goes like $\kappa/(\kappa+N)$ where $N$ is the width of the slab. We are able to compute $\kappa$ perturbatively by using a multiscale approach. The only small parameter involved in the expansion is the inverse of the size of the system. This approach rests on an inductive process and a closure assumption adapted to the mirrors model. For $d=3$, we propose the recursive relation for the conductivity $\kappa_n$ at scale $n$ : $\kappa_{n+1}=\kappa_n(1+\frac{\kappa_n}{2^{n}}\alpha)$, up to $o(1/2^n)$ terms and with $\alpha\simeq 0.0374$. This sequence has a finite limit.</description>

      <title>Emergent Dynamical Translational Symmetry Breaking as an Order Principle for Localization and Topological Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04360v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Localization transitions represent a fundamental class of continuous phase transitions, yet they occur without any accompanying symmetry breaking. We resolve this by introducing the concept of dynamical translational symmetry (DTS), which is defined not by the Hamiltonian but by the long-time dynamics of local observables. Its order parameter, the time-averaged local translational contrast (TLTC), quantitatively diagnoses whether evolution restores or breaks translational equivalence. We demonstrate that the TLTC universally captures the Anderson localization transition, the many-body localization transition, and topological phase transitions, revealing that these disparate phenomena are unified by the emergent breaking of DTS. This work establishes a unified dynamical-symmetry framework for phases transitions beyond the equilibrium paradigm.</description>
