      <title>Design and Analysis of Parallel Artificial Protozoa Optimizer (P-APO) using CUDA Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metaheuristic algorithms are widely used for solving complex problems due to their ability to provide near-optimal solutions. But the execution time of these algorithms increases with the problem size and solution space. And, to get more promising results, we have to execute these algorithms for a large number of iterations, requiring a large amount of time and this is one of the main issues found with these algorithms. To handle the same, researchers are now-adays working on design and development of parallel versions of state of the art metaheuristic optimization algorithms. We, in this paper, present a parallel implementation of state of the art Artificial Protozoa Optimizer using NVIDIA CUDA framework to leverage GPU acceleration. Our implementation optimizes the state of the art Artificial Protozoa Optimizer (APO) to achieve high performance. We implement both the existing sequential version and the proposed parallel version of Artificial Protozoa Optimizer in this paper. The experimental results calculated over benchmarks functions of CEC2022 demonstrate a significant performance gain i.e. up to 6.7 times speed up achieved in case of proposed parallel version. We also use two real world applications (1) Tension/Compression Spring Design in engineering optimization and (2) Image Thresholding using otsu method for testing the performance of proposed implementation in handling real tasks.</description>

      <title>Hypergraph Contrastive Sensor Fusion for Multimodal Fault Diagnosis in Induction Motors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reliable induction motor (IM) fault diagnosis is vital for industrial safety and operational continuity, mitigating costly unplanned downtime. Conventional approaches often struggle to capture complex multimodal signal relationships, are constrained to unimodal data or single fault types, and exhibit performance degradation under noisy or cross-domain conditions. This paper proposes the Multimodal Hypergraph Contrastive Attention Network (MM-HCAN), a unified framework for robust fault diagnosis. To the best of our knowledge, MM-HCAN is the first to integrate contrastive learning within a hypergraph topology specifically designed for multimodal sensor fusion, enabling the joint modelling of intra- and inter-modal dependencies and enhancing generalisation beyond Euclidean embedding spaces. The model facilitates simultaneous diagnosis of bearing, stator, and rotor faults, addressing the engineering need for consolidated di- agnostic capabilities. Evaluated on three real-world benchmarks, MM-HCAN achieves up to 99.82% accuracy with strong cross-domain generalisation and resilience to noise, demonstrating its suitability for real-world deployment. An ablation study validates the contribution of each component. MM-HCAN provides a scalable and robust solution for comprehensive multi-fault diagnosis, supporting predictive maintenance and extended asset longevity in industrial environments.</description>

      <title>Solving the 3D Heat Equation with VQA via Remeshing-Based Warm Starts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing holds great promise for solving classically intractable problems such as linear systems and partial differential equations (PDEs). While fully fault-tolerant quantum computers remain out of reach, current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices enable the exploration of hybrid quantum-classical algorithms. Among these, Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) have emerged as a leading candidate for near-term applications. In this work, we investigate the use of VQAs to solve PDEs arising in stationary heat transfer. These problems are discretized via the finite element method (FEM), yielding linear systems of the form Ku=f, where K is the stiffness matrix. We define a cost function that encodes the thermal energy of the system, and optimize it using various ansatz families. To improve trainability and bypass barren plateaus, we introduce a remeshing strategy which gradually increases resolution by reusing optimized parameters from coarser discretizations. Our results demonstrate convergence of scalar quantities with mesh refinement. This work provides a practical methodology for applying VQAs to PDEs, offering insight into the capabilities and limitations of current quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Photovoltaic power forecasting using quantum machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16379v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate forecasting of photovoltaic power is essential for reliable grid integration, yet remains difficult due to highly variable irradiance, complex meteorological drivers, site geography, and device-specific behavior. Although contemporary machine learning has achieved successes, it is not clear that these approaches are optimal: new model classes may further enhance performance and data efficiency. We investigate hybrid quantum neural networks for time-series forecasting of photovoltaic power and introduce two architectures. The first, a Hybrid Quantum Long Short-Term Memory model, reduces mean absolute error and mean squared error by more than 40% relative to the strongest baselines evaluated. The second, a Hybrid Quantum Sequence-to-Sequence model, once trained, it predicts power for arbitrary forecast horizons without requiring prior meteorological inputs and achieves a 16% lower mean absolute error than the best baseline on this task. Both hybrid models maintain superior accuracy when training data are limited, indicating improved data efficiency. These results show that hybrid quantum models address key challenges in photovoltaic power forecasting and offer a practical route to more reliable, data-efficient energy predictions.</description>

      <title>Solving Distributed Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problems in the Wool Textile Industry with Quantum Annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06699v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many modern manufacturing companies have evolved from a single production facility to a multifactory production environment that must manage both regionally dispersed production orders and their multi-site production steps. The availability of a range of machines in different locations capable of performing the same operation and shipping times between factories have transformed planning systems from the classic Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) to the Distributed Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem (DFJSP). Consequently, the complexity of production planning has increased significantly. We employ Quantum Annealing (QA) to solve the DFJSP in our research. In addition to assigning production orders to production sites, production steps are also assigned to these sites. This requirement is based on a real use case of a wool textile manufacturing company. To investigate the applicability of this method to large problem instances, problems ranging from 50 variables up to 250 variables, the largest problem that could be embedded into a D-Wave quantum annealer Quantum Processing Unit (QPU), are formulated and solved. Special attention is dedicated to determining the Lagrange parameters of the Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) model and the QPU configuration parameters, as these factors can significantly impact solution quality. The obtained solutions are compared to solutions obtained by Simulated Annealing (SA), both in terms of solution quality and calculation time. The results demonstrate that QA has the potential to solve large problem instances specific to the industry</description>

      <title>Neuromorphic Computing - An Overview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06721v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With traditional computing technologies reaching their limit, a new field has emerged seeking to follow the example of the human brain into a new era: neuromorphic computing. This paper provides an introduction to neuromorphic computing, why this and other new computing systems are needed, and what technologies currently exist in the neuromorphic field. It begins with a general introduction into the history of traditional computing and its present problems, and then proceeds to a general overview of neuromorphic systems. It subsequently discusses the main technologies currently in development. For completeness, the paper first discusses neuromorphic-style computing on traditional hardware, and then discusses the two top branches of specialized hardware in this field; neuromorphic chips and photonic systems. Both branches are explained as well as their relative benefits and drawbacks. The paper concludes with a summary and an outlook on the future.</description>
