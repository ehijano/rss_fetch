      <title>Graph Connectionist Temporal Classification for Phoneme Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatic Phoneme Recognition (APR) systems are often trained using pseudo phoneme-level annotations generated from text through Grapheme-to-Phoneme (G2P) systems. These G2P systems frequently output multiple possible pronunciations per word, but the standard Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss cannot account for such ambiguity during training. In this work, we adapt Graph Temporal Classification (GTC) to the APR setting. GTC enables training from a graph of alternative phoneme sequences, allowing the model to consider multiple pronunciations per word as valid supervision. Our experiments on English and Dutch data sets show that incorporating multiple pronunciations per word into the training loss consistently improves phoneme error rates compared to a baseline trained with CTC. These results suggest that integrating pronunciation variation into the loss function is a promising strategy for training APR systems from noisy G2P-based supervision.</description>

      <title>On the Contribution of Lexical Features to Speech Emotion Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although paralinguistic cues are often considered the primary drivers of speech emotion recognition (SER), we investigate the role of lexical content extracted from speech and show that it can achieve competitive and in some cases higher performance compared to acoustic models. On the MELD dataset, our lexical-based approach obtains a weighted F1-score (WF1) of 51.5%, compared to 49.3% for an acoustic-only pipeline with a larger parameter count. Furthermore, we analyze different self-supervised (SSL) speech and text representations, conduct a layer-wise study of transformer-based encoders, and evaluate the effect of audio denoising.</description>

      <title>Time-domain sound field estimation using kernel ridge regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sound field estimation methods based on kernel ridge regression have proven effective, allowing for strict enforcement of physical properties, in addition to the inclusion of prior knowledge such as directionality of the sound field. These methods have been formulated for single-frequency sound fields, restricting the types of data and prior knowledge that can be used. In this paper, the kernel ridge regression approach is generalized to consider discrete-time sound fields. The proposed method provides time-domain sound field estimates that can be computed in closed form, are guaranteed to be physically realizable, and for which time-domain properties of the sound fields can be exploited to improve estimation performance. Exploiting prior information on the time-domain behaviour of room impulse responses, the estimation performance of the proposed method is shown to be improved using a time-domain data weighting, demonstrating the usefulness of the proposed approach. It is further shown using both simulated and real data that the time-domain data weighting can be combined with a directional weighting, exploiting prior knowledge of both spatial and temporal properties of the room impulse responses. The theoretical framework of the proposed method enables solving a broader class of sound field estimation problems using kernel ridge regression where it would be required to consider the time-domain response rather than the frequency-domain response of each frequency separately.</description>

      <title>From perception to production: how acoustic invariance facilitates articulatory learning in a self-supervised vocal imitation model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human infants face a formidable challenge in speech acquisition: mapping extremely variable acoustic inputs into appropriate articulatory movements without explicit instruction. We present a computational model that addresses the acoustic-to-articulatory mapping problem through self-supervised learning. Our model comprises a feature extractor that transforms speech into latent representations, an inverse model that maps these representations to articulatory parameters, and a synthesizer that generates speech outputs. Experiments conducted in both single- and multi-speaker settings reveal that intermediate layers of a pre-trained wav2vec 2.0 model provide optimal representations for articulatory learning, significantly outperforming MFCC features. These representations enable our model to learn articulatory trajectories that correlate with human patterns, discriminate between places of articulation, and produce intelligible speech. Critical to successful articulatory learning are representations that balance phonetic discriminability with speaker invariance -- precisely the characteristics of self-supervised representation learning models. Our findings provide computational evidence consistent with developmental theories proposing that perceptual learning of phonetic categories guides articulatory development, offering insights into how infants might acquire speech production capabilities despite the complex mapping problem they face.</description>

      <title>Beamforming-LLM: What, Where and When Did I Miss?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Beamforming-LLM, a system that enables users to semantically recall conversations they may have missed in multi-speaker environments. The system combines spatial audio capture using a microphone array with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to support natural language queries such as, "What did I miss when I was following the conversation on dogs?" Directional audio streams are separated using beamforming, transcribed with Whisper, and embedded into a vector database using sentence encoders. Upon receiving a user query, semantically relevant segments are retrieved, temporally aligned with non-attended segments, and summarized using a lightweight large language model (GPT-4o-mini). The result is a user-friendly interface that provides contrastive summaries, spatial context, and timestamped audio playback. This work lays the foundation for intelligent auditory memory systems and has broad applications in assistive technology, meeting summarization, and context-aware personal spatial computing.</description>

      <title>Speaker Privacy and Security in the Big Data Era: Protection and Defense against Deepfake</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06361v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the era of big data, remarkable advancements have been achieved in personalized speech generation techniques that utilize speaker attributes, including voice and speaking style, to generate deepfake speech. This has also amplified global security risks from deepfake speech misuse, resulting in considerable societal costs worldwide. To address the security threats posed by deepfake speech, techniques have been developed focusing on both the protection of voice attributes and the defense against deepfake speech. Among them, the voice anonymization technique has been developed to protect voice attributes from extraction for deepfake generation, while deepfake detection and watermarking have been utilized to defend against the misuse of deepfake speech. This paper provides a short and concise overview of the three techniques, describing the methodologies, advancements, and challenges. A comprehensive version, offering additional discussions, will be published in the near future.</description>

      <title>Integrating Spatial and Semantic Embeddings for Stereo Sound Event Localization in Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we address the multimodal task of stereo sound event localization and detection with source distance estimation (3D SELD) in regular video content. 3D SELD is a complex task that combines temporal event classification with spatial localization, requiring reasoning across spatial, temporal, and semantic dimensions. The last is arguably the most challenging to model. Traditional SELD approaches typically rely on multichannel input, limiting their capacity to benefit from large-scale pre-training due to data constraints. To overcome this, we enhance a standard SELD architecture with semantic information by integrating pre-trained, contrastive language-aligned models: CLAP for audio and OWL-ViT for visual inputs. These embeddings are incorporated into a modified Conformer module tailored for multimodal fusion, which we refer to as the Cross-Modal Conformer. We perform an ablation study on the development set of the DCASE2025 Task3 Stereo SELD Dataset to assess the individual contributions of the language-aligned models and benchmark against the DCASE Task 3 baseline systems. Additionally, we detail the curation process of large synthetic audio and audio-visual datasets used for model pre-training. These datasets were further expanded through left-right channel swapping augmentation. Our approach, combining extensive pre-training, model ensembling, and visual post-processing, achieved second rank in the DCASE 2025 Challenge Task 3 (Track B), underscoring the effectiveness of our method. Future work will explore the modality-specific contributions and architectural refinements.</description>

      <title>An Empirical Analysis of Discrete Unit Representations in Speech Language Modeling Pre-training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates discrete unit representations in Speech Language Models (SLMs), focusing on optimizing speech modeling during continual pre-training. In this paper, we systematically examine how model architecture, data representation, and training robustness influence the pre-training stage in which we adapt existing pre-trained language models to the speech modality. Our experiments highlight the role of speech encoders and clustering granularity across different model scales, showing how optimal discretization strategies vary with model capacity. By examining cluster distribution and phonemic alignments, we investigate the effective use of discrete vocabulary, uncovering both linguistic and paralinguistic patterns. Additionally, we explore the impact of clustering data selection on model robustness, highlighting the importance of domain matching between discretization training and target applications.</description>

      <title>Effectively obtaining acoustic, visual and textual data from videos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing use of machine learning models has amplified the demand for high-quality, large-scale multimodal datasets. However, the availability of such datasets, especially those combining acoustic, visual and textual data, remains limited. This paper addresses this gap by proposing a method to extract related audio-image-text observations from videos. We detail the process of selecting suitable videos, extracting relevant data pairs, and generating descriptive texts using image-to-text models. Our approach ensures a robust semantic connection between modalities, enhancing the utility of the created datasets for various applications. We also discuss the challenges encountered and propose solutions to improve data quality. The resulting datasets, publicly available, aim to support and advance research in multimodal data analysis and machine learning.</description>

      <title>Yours or Mine? Overwriting Attacks against Neural Audio Watermarking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As generative audio models are rapidly evolving, AI-generated audios increasingly raise concerns about copyright infringement and misinformation spread. Audio watermarking, as a proactive defense, can embed secret messages into audio for copyright protection and source verification. However, current neural audio watermarking methods focus primarily on the imperceptibility and robustness of watermarking, while ignoring its vulnerability to security attacks. In this paper, we develop a simple yet powerful attack: the overwriting attack that overwrites the legitimate audio watermark with a forged one and makes the original legitimate watermark undetectable. Based on the audio watermarking information that the adversary has, we propose three categories of overwriting attacks, i.e., white-box, gray-box, and black-box attacks. We also thoroughly evaluate the proposed attacks on state-of-the-art neural audio watermarking methods. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed overwriting attacks can effectively compromise existing watermarking schemes across various settings and achieve a nearly 100% attack success rate. The practicality and effectiveness of the proposed overwriting attacks expose security flaws in existing neural audio watermarking systems, underscoring the need to enhance security in future audio watermarking designs.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the Robustness of Contextual ASR to Varying Biasing Information Volumes Through Purified Semantic Correlation Joint Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, cross-attention-based contextual automatic speech recognition (ASR) models have made notable advancements in recognizing personalized biasing phrases. However, the effectiveness of cross-attention is affected by variations in biasing information volume, especially when the length of the biasing list increases significantly. We find that, regardless of the length of the biasing list, only a limited amount of biasing information is most relevant to a specific ASR intermediate representation. Therefore, by identifying and integrating the most relevant biasing information rather than the entire biasing list, we can alleviate the effects of variations in biasing information volume for contextual ASR. To this end, we propose a purified semantic correlation joint modeling (PSC-Joint) approach. In PSC-Joint, we define and calculate three semantic correlations between the ASR intermediate representations and biasing information from coarse to fine: list-level, phrase-level, and token-level. Then, the three correlations are jointly modeled to produce their intersection, so that the most relevant biasing information across various granularities is highlighted and integrated for contextual recognition. In addition, to reduce the computational cost introduced by the joint modeling of three semantic correlations, we also propose a purification mechanism based on a grouped-and-competitive strategy to filter out irrelevant biasing phrases. Compared with baselines, our PSC-Joint approach achieves average relative F1 score improvements of up to 21.34% on AISHELL-1 and 28.46% on KeSpeech, across biasing lists of varying lengths.</description>

      <title>TSPC: A Two-Stage Phoneme-Centric Architecture for code-switching Vietnamese-English Speech Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Code-switching (CS) presents a significant challenge for general Auto-Speech Recognition (ASR) systems. Existing methods often fail to capture the subtle phonological shifts inherent in CS scenarios. The challenge is particularly difficult for language pairs like Vietnamese and English, where both distinct phonological features and the ambiguity arising from similar sound recognition are present. In this paper, we propose a novel architecture for Vietnamese-English CS ASR, a Two-Stage Phoneme-Centric model (TSPC). The TSPC employs a phoneme-centric approach, built upon an extended Vietnamese phoneme set as an intermediate representation to facilitate mixed-lingual modeling. Experimental results demonstrate that TSPC consistently outperforms existing baselines, including PhoWhisper-base, in Vietnamese-English CS ASR, achieving a significantly lower word error rate of 20.8\% with reduced training resources. Furthermore, the phonetic-based two-stage architecture enables phoneme adaptation and language conversion to enhance ASR performance in complex CS Vietnamese-English ASR scenarios.</description>

      <title>Xi+: Uncertainty Supervision for Robust Speaker Embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There are various factors that can influence the performance of speaker recognition systems, such as emotion, language and other speaker-related or context-related variations. Since individual speech frames do not contribute equally to the utterance-level representation, it is essential to estimate the importance or reliability of each frame. The xi-vector model addresses this by assigning different weights to frames based on uncertainty estimation. However, its uncertainty estimation model is implicitly trained through classification loss alone and does not consider the temporal relationships between frames, which may lead to suboptimal supervision. In this paper, we propose an improved architecture, xi+. Compared to xi-vector, xi+ incorporates a temporal attention module to capture frame-level uncertainty in a context-aware manner. In addition, we introduce a novel loss function, Stochastic Variance Loss, which explicitly supervises the learning of uncertainty. Results demonstrate consistent performance improvements of about 10\% on the VoxCeleb1-O set and 11\% on the NIST SRE 2024 evaluation set.</description>

      <title>DreamAudio: Customized Text-to-Audio Generation with Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the development of large-scale diffusion-based and language-modeling-based generative models, impressive progress has been achieved in text-to-audio generation. Despite producing high-quality outputs, existing text-to-audio models mainly aim to generate semantically aligned sound and fall short on precisely controlling fine-grained acoustic characteristics of specific sounds. As a result, users that need specific sound content may find it challenging to generate the desired audio clips. In this paper, we present DreamAudio for customized text-to-audio generation (CTTA). Specifically, we introduce a new framework that is designed to enable the model to identify auditory information from user-provided reference concepts for audio generation. Given a few reference audio samples containing personalized audio events, our system can generate new audio samples that include these specific events. In addition, two types of datasets are developed for training and testing the customized systems. The experiments show that the proposed model, DreamAudio, generates audio samples that are highly consistent with the customized audio features and aligned well with the input text prompts. Furthermore, DreamAudio offers comparable performance in general text-to-audio tasks. We also provide a human-involved dataset containing audio events from real-world CTTA cases as the benchmark for customized generation tasks.</description>

Abstract: Audio Language Models (ALM) have emerged as the dominant paradigm for speech and music generation by representing audio as sequences of discrete tokens. Yet, unlike text tokens, which are invertible, audio tokens are extracted from lossy codecs with a limited bitrate. As a consequence, increasing audio quality requires generating more tokens, which imposes a trade-off between fidelity and computational cost. We address this issue by studying Continuous Audio Language Models (CALM). These models instantiate a large Transformer backbone that produces a contextual embedding at every timestep. This sequential information then conditions an MLP that generates the next continuous frame of an audio VAE through consistency modeling. By avoiding lossy compression, CALM achieves higher quality at lower computational cost than their discrete counterpart. Experiments on speech and music demonstrate improved efficiency and fidelity over state-of-the-art discrete audio language models, facilitating lightweight, high-quality audio generation.

      <title>Benchmarking Music Autotagging with MGPHot Expert Annotations vs. Generic Tag Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Music autotagging aims to automatically assign descriptive tags, such as genre, mood, or instrumentation, to audio recordings. Due to its challenges, diversity of semantic descriptions, and practical value in various applications, it has become a common downstream task for evaluating the performance of general-purpose music representations learned from audio data. We introduce a new benchmarking dataset based on the recently published MGPHot dataset, which includes expert musicological annotations, allowing for additional insights and comparisons with results obtained on common generic tag datasets. While MGPHot annotations have been shown to be useful for computational musicology, the original dataset neither includes audio nor provides evaluation setups for its use as a standardized autotagging benchmark. To address this, we provide a curated set of YouTube URLs with retrievable audio, and propose a train/val/test split for standardized evaluation, and precomputed representations for seven state-of-the-art models. Using these resources, we evaluated these models in MGPHot and standard reference tag datasets, highlighting key differences between expert and generic tag annotations. Altogether, our contributions provide a more advanced benchmarking framework for future research in music understanding.</description>

      <title>LS-EEND: Long-Form Streaming End-to-End Neural Diarization with Online Attractor Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06670v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work proposes a frame-wise online/streaming end-to-end neural diarization (EEND) method, which detects speaker activities in a frame-in-frame-out fashion. The proposed model mainly consists of a causal embedding encoder and an online attractor decoder. Speakers are modeled in the self-attention-based decoder along both the time and speaker dimensions, and frame-wise speaker attractors are automatically generated and updated for new speakers and existing speakers, respectively. Retention mechanism is employed and especially adapted for long-form diarization with a linear temporal complexity. A multi-step progressive training strategy is proposed for gradually learning from easy tasks to hard tasks in terms of the number of speakers and audio length. Finally, the proposed model (referred to as long-form streaming EEND, LS-EEND) is able to perform streaming diarization for a high (up to 8) and flexible number speakers and very long (say one hour) audio recordings. Experiments on various simulated and real-world datasets show that: 1) when not using oracle speech activity information, the proposed model achieves new state-of-the-art online diarization error rate on all datasets, including CALLHOME (12.11%), DIHARD II (27.58%), DIHARD III (19.61%), and AMI (20.76%); 2) Due to the frame-in-frame-out processing fashion and the linear temporal complexity, the proposed model achieves several times lower real-time-factor than comparison online diarization models.</description>

      <title>SoloSpeech: Enhancing Intelligibility and Quality in Target Speech Extraction through a Cascaded Generative Pipeline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19314v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Target Speech Extraction (TSE) aims to isolate a target speaker's voice from a mixture of multiple speakers by leveraging speaker-specific cues, typically provided as auxiliary audio (a.k.a. cue audio). Although recent advancements in TSE have primarily employed discriminative models that offer high perceptual quality, these models often introduce unwanted artifacts, reduce naturalness, and are sensitive to discrepancies between training and testing environments. On the other hand, generative models for TSE lag in perceptual quality and intelligibility. To address these challenges, we present SoloSpeech, a novel cascaded generative pipeline that integrates compression, extraction, reconstruction, and correction processes. SoloSpeech features a speaker-embedding-free target extractor that utilizes conditional information from the cue audio's latent space, aligning it with the mixture audio's latent space to prevent mismatches. Evaluated on the widely-used Libri2Mix dataset, SoloSpeech achieves the new state-of-the-art intelligibility and quality in target speech extraction while demonstrating exceptional generalization on out-of-domain data and real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>Synthetic data enables context-aware bioacoustic sound event detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00296v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a methodology for training foundation models that enhances their in-context learning capabilities within the domain of bioacoustic signal processing. We use synthetically generated training data, introducing a domain-randomization-based pipeline that constructs diverse acoustic scenes with temporally strong labels. We generate over 8.8 thousand hours of strongly-labeled audio and train a query-by-example, transformer-based model to perform few-shot bioacoustic sound event detection. Our second contribution is a public benchmark of 13 diverse few-shot bioacoustics tasks. Our model outperforms previously published methods, and improves relative to other training-free methods by $64\%$. We demonstrate that this is due to increase in model size and data scale, as well as algorithmic improvements. We make our trained model available via an API, to provide ecologists and ethologists with a training-free tool for bioacoustic sound event detection.</description>

      <title>Robust detection of overlapping bioacoustic sound events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02389v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a method for accurately detecting bioacoustic sound events that is robust to overlapping events, a common issue in domains such as ethology, ecology and conservation. While standard methods employ a frame-based, multi-label approach, we introduce an onset-based detection method which we name Voxaboxen. It takes inspiration from object detection methods in computer vision, but simultaneously takes advantage of recent advances in self-supervised audio encoders. For each time window, Voxaboxen predicts whether it contains the start of a vocalization and how long the vocalization is. It also does the same in reverse, predicting whether each window contains the end of a vocalization, and how long ago it started. The two resulting sets of bounding boxes are then fused using a graph-matching algorithm. We also release a new dataset designed to measure performance on detecting overlapping vocalizations. This consists of recordings of zebra finches annotated with temporally-strong labels and showing frequent overlaps. We test Voxaboxen on seven existing data sets and on our new data set. We compare Voxaboxen to natural baselines and existing sound event detection methods and demonstrate SotA results. Further experiments show that improvements are robust to frequent vocalization overlap.</description>

      <title>Whisper Smarter, not Harder: Adversarial Attack on Partial Suppression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09994v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Currently, Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models are deployed in an extensive range of applications. However, recent studies have demonstrated the possibility of adversarial attack on these models which could potentially suppress or disrupt model output. We investigate and verify the robustness of these attacks and explore if it is possible to increase their imperceptibility. We additionally find that by relaxing the optimisation objective from complete suppression to partial suppression, we can further decrease the imperceptibility of the attack. We also explore possible defences against these attacks and show a low-pass filter defence could potentially serve as an effective defence.</description>

      <title>Empathy Omni: Enabling Empathetic Speech Response Generation through Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18655v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the development of speech large language models (speech LLMs), users can now interact directly with assistants via speech. However, most existing models only convert response content into speech without fully capturing the rich emotional cues in user queries, where the same sentence may convey different meanings depending on the expression. Emotional understanding is thus essential for improving human-machine interaction. Most empathetic speech LLMs rely on massive datasets, demanding high computational cost. A key challenge is to build models that generate empathetic responses with limited data and without large-scale training. To this end, we propose Emotion Omni, a model that understands emotional content in user speech and generates empathetic responses. We further developed a data pipeline to construct a 200k emotional dialogue dataset supporting empathetic speech assistants. Experiments show that Emotion Omni achieves comparable instruction-following ability without large-scale pretraining, while surpassing existing models in speech quality (UTMOS:4.41) and empathy (Emotion GPT Score: 3.97). These results confirm its improvements in both speech fidelity and emotional expressiveness. Demos are available at https://w311411.github.io/omni_demo/.</description>

      <title>Learning and composing of classical music using restricted Boltzmann machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04899v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, software has been developed that uses machine learning to mimic the style of a particular composer, such as J. S. Bach. However, since such software often adopts machine learning models with complex structures, it is difficult to analyze how the software understands the characteristics of the composer's music. In this study, we adopted J. S. Bach's music for training of a restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM). Since the structure of RBMs is simple, it allows us to investigate the internal states after learning. We found that the learned RBM is able to compose music.</description>
