      <title>Stochastic Gradient Descent in the Optimal Control of Execution Costs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bertsimas and Lo's seminal work laid the groundwork for addressing the implementation shortfall dilemma in institutional investing, emphasizing the significance of market microstructure and price dynamics in minimizing execution costs. However, the ability to derive a theoretical Optimum market order policy is an unrealistic assumption for many investors. This study aims to bridge this gap by proposing an approach that leverages stochastic gradient descent (SGD) to derive alternative solutions for optimizing execution cost policies in dynamic markets where explicit mathematical solutions may not yet exist. The proposed methodology assumes the existence of a mathematically derived optimal solution that is a function of the underlying market dynamics. By iteratively refining strategies using SGD, economists can adapt their approaches over time based on evolving execution strategies. While these SGD-based solutions may not achieve optimality, they offer valuable insights into optimizing policies under complex market frameworks. These results serve as a bridge for economists and mathematicians, facilitating the study of the Optimum policy volatile markets while offering SGD driven implementable policies that closely approximate optimal outcomes within shorter time frames.</description>

      <title>A multi-factor market-neutral investment strategy for New York Stock Exchange equities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This report presents a systematic market-neutral, multi-factor investment strategy for New York Stock Exchange equities with the objective of delivering steady returns while minimizing correlation with the market. A robust feature set is integrated combining momentum-based indicators, fundamental factors, and analyst recommendations. Using various statistical tests for feature selection, the strategy identifies key drivers of equity performance and ranks stocks to build a balanced portfolio of long and short positions. Portfolio construction methods, including equally weighted, risk parity, and minimum variance beta-neutral approaches, were evaluated through rigorous backtesting. Risk parity demonstrated superior performance with a higher Sharpe ratio, lower beta, and smaller maximum drawdown compared to the Standard and Poor's 500 index. Risk parity's market neutrality, combined with its ability to maintain steady returns and mitigate large drawdowns, makes it a suitable approach for managing significant capital in equity markets.</description>

      <title>An Application of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Process to Pairs Trading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conduct a preliminary analysis of a pairs trading strategy using the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process to model stock price spreads. We compare this approach to a naive pairs trading strategy that uses a rolling window to calculate mean and standard deviation parameters. Our findings suggest that the OU model captures signals and trends effectively but underperforms the naive model on a risk-return basis, likely due to non-stationary pairs and parameter tuning limitations.</description>

      <title>Optimal execution and speculation with trade signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.00621v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a price impact model where changes in prices are purely driven by the order flow in the market. The stochastic price impact of market orders and the arrival rates of limit and market orders are functions of the market liquidity process which reflects the balance of the demand and supply of liquidity. Limit and market orders mutually excite each other so that liquidity is mean reverting. We use the theory of Meyer-$\sigma$-fields to introduce a short-term signal process from which a trader learns about imminent changes in order flow. Her trades impact the market through the same mechanism as other orders. With a novel version of Marcus-type SDEs we efficiently describe the intricate timing of market dynamics at moments when her orders concur with that of others. In this setting, we examine an optimal execution problem and derive the Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman (HJB) equation for the value function of the trader. The HJB equation is solved numerically and we illustrate how the trader uses the signals to enhance the performance of execution problems and to execute speculative strategies.</description>
