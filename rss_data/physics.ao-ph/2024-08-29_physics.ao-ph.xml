      <title>A nudge to the truth: atom conservation as a hard constraint in models of atmospheric composition using an uncertainty-weighted correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computational models of atmospheric composition are not always physically consistent. For example, not all models respect fundamental conservation laws such as conservation of atoms in an interconnected chemical system. In well performing models, these nonphysical deviations are often ignored because they are frequently minor, and thus only need a small nudge to perfectly conserve mass. Here we introduce a method that anchors a prediction from any numerical model to physically consistent hard constraints, nudging concentrations to the nearest solution that respects the conservation laws. This closed-form model-agnostic correction uses a single matrix operation to minimally perturb the predicted concentrations to ensure that atoms are conserved to machine precision. To demonstrate this approach, we train a gradient boosting decision tree ensemble to emulate a small reference model of ozone photochemistry and test the effect of the correction on accurate but non-conservative predictions. The nudging approach minimally perturbs the already well-predicted results for most species, but decreases the accuracy of important oxidants, including radicals. We develop a weighted extension of this nudging approach that considers the uncertainty and magnitude of each species in the correction. This species-level weighting approach is essential to accurately predict important low concentration species such as radicals. We find that applying the uncertainty-weighted correction to the nonphysical predictions slightly improves overall accuracy, by nudging the predictions to a more likely mass-conserving solution.</description>

      <title>Machine learning models for daily rainfall forecasting in Northern Tropical Africa using tropical wave predictors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical weather prediction (NWP) models often underperform compared to simpler climatology-based precipitation forecasts in northern tropical Africa, even after statistical postprocessing. AI-based forecasting models show promise but have avoided precipitation due to its complexity. Synoptic-scale forcings like African easterly waves and other tropical waves (TWs) are important for predictability in tropical Africa, yet their value for predicting daily rainfall remains unexplored. This study uses two machine-learning models--gamma regression and a convolutional neural network (CNN)--trained on TW predictors from satellite-based GPM IMERG data to predict daily rainfall during the July-September monsoon season. Predictor variables are derived from the local amplitude and phase information of seven TW from the target and up-and-downstream neighboring grids at 1-degree spatial resolution. The ML models are combined with Easy Uncertainty Quantification (EasyUQ) to generate calibrated probabilistic forecasts and are compared with three benchmarks: Extended Probabilistic Climatology (EPC15), ECMWF operational ensemble forecast (ENS), and a probabilistic forecast from the ENS control member using EasyUQ (CTRL EasyUQ). The study finds that downstream predictor variables offer the highest predictability, with downstream tropical depression (TD)-type wave-based predictors being most important. Other waves like mixed-Rossby gravity (MRG), Kelvin, and inertio-gravity waves also contribute significantly but show regional preferences. ENS forecasts exhibit poor skill due to miscalibration. CTRL EasyUQ shows improvement over ENS and marginal enhancement over EPC15. Both gamma regression and CNN forecasts significantly outperform benchmarks in tropical Africa. This study highlights the potential of ML models trained on TW-based predictors to improve daily precipitation forecasts in tropical Africa.</description>

      <title>AI-driven weather forecasts enable anticipated attribution of extreme events to human-made climate change</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anthropogenic climate change (ACC) is altering the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. Attributing individual extreme events (EEs) to ACC is becoming crucial to assess the risks of climate change. Traditional attribution methods often suffer from a selection bias, are computationally demanding, and provide answers after the EE occurs. This study presents a ground-breaking hybrid attribution method by combining physics-based ACC estimates from global climate models with deep-learning weather forecasts. This hybrid approach circumvents the framing choices and accelerates the attribution process, paving the way for operational anticipated global forecast-based attribution. We apply this methodology to three distinct high-impact weather EEs. Despite some limitations in predictability, the method uncovers ACC fingerprints in the forecasted fields of EEs. Specifically, forecasts successfully anticipate that ACC exacerbated the 2018 Iberian heatwave, deepened hurricane Florence, and intensified the wind and precipitable water of the explosive cyclone Ciar\'an.</description>

      <title>Subpolar Gyre Variability in CMIP6 Models: Is there a Mechanism for Bistability?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The subpolar gyre is at risk of crossing a tipping point which would result in the collapse of convection in the Labrador Sea. It is important to understand the mechanisms at play and how they are represented in climate models. In this study we use causal inference to verify whether the proposed mechanism for bistability of the subpolar gyre is represented in CMIP6 models. In many models an increase of sea surface salinity leads to a deepening of the mixed layer resulting in a cooling of the water at intermediate depth, in line with theory. The feedback from the subsurface temperature through density to the strength of the gyre circulation is more ambiguous, with fewer models indicating a significant link. Those that do show a significant link do not agree on its sign. One model (CESM2) contains all interactions, with both a negative and delayed positive feedback loop.</description>

      <title>RAIN: Reinforcement Algorithms for Improving Numerical Weather and Climate Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores integrating reinforcement learning (RL) with idealised climate models to address key parameterisation challenges in climate science. Current climate models rely on complex mathematical parameterisations to represent sub-grid scale processes, which can introduce substantial uncertainties. RL offers capabilities to enhance these parameterisation schemes, including direct interaction, handling sparse or delayed feedback, continuous online learning, and long-term optimisation. We evaluate the performance of eight RL algorithms on two idealised environments: one for temperature bias correction, another for radiative-convective equilibrium (RCE) imitating real-world computational constraints. Results show different RL approaches excel in different climate scenarios with exploration algorithms performing better in bias correction, while exploitation algorithms proving more effective for RCE. These findings support the potential of RL-based parameterisation schemes to be integrated into global climate models, improving accuracy and efficiency in capturing complex climate dynamics. Overall, this work represents an important first step towards leveraging RL to enhance climate model accuracy, critical for improving climate understanding and predictions.

      <title>Rapid and accurate mosquito abundance forecasting with Aedes-AI neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a method to convert weather data into probabilistic forecasts of Aedes aegypti abundance. The approach, which relies on the Aedes-AI suite of neural networks, produces weekly point predictions with corresponding uncertainty estimates. Once calibrated on past trap and weather data, the model is designed to use weather forecasts to estimate future trap catches. We demonstrate that when reliable input data are used, the resulting predictions have high skill. This technique may therefore be used to supplement vector surveillance efforts or identify periods of elevated risk for vector-borne disease outbreaks.</description>
