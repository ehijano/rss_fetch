      <title>Explainable artificial intelligence in breast cancer detection and risk prediction: A systematic scoping review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the advances in artificial intelligence (AI), data-driven algorithms are becoming increasingly popular in the medical domain. However, due to the nonlinear and complex behavior of many of these algorithms, decision-making by such algorithms is not trustworthy for clinicians and is considered a black-box process. Hence, the scientific community has introduced explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to remedy the problem. This systematic scoping review investigates the application of XAI in breast cancer detection and risk prediction. We conducted a comprehensive search on Scopus, IEEE Explore, PubMed, and Google Scholar (first 50 citations) using a systematic search strategy. The search spanned from January 2017 to July 2023, focusing on peer-reviewed studies implementing XAI methods in breast cancer datasets. Thirty studies met our inclusion criteria and were included in the analysis. The results revealed that SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) is the top model-agnostic XAI technique in breast cancer research in terms of usage, explaining the model prediction results, diagnosis and classification of biomarkers, and prognosis and survival analysis. Additionally, the SHAP model primarily explained tree-based ensemble machine learning models. The most common reason is that SHAP is model agnostic, which makes it both popular and useful for explaining any model prediction. Additionally, it is relatively easy to implement effectively and completely suits performant models, such as tree-based models. Explainable AI improves the transparency, interpretability, fairness, and trustworthiness of AI-enabled health systems and medical devices and, ultimately, the quality of care and outcomes.</description>

      <title>Decoding Dmrt1: Insights into vertebrate sex determination and gonadal sex differentiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dmrt1 is pivotal in testis formation and function by interacting with genes crucial for Sertoli cell differentiation, such as Sox9. It represses female-determining pathways and ovarian formation by silencing Foxl2. Across 127 vertebrate species, Dmrt1 exhibits sexually dimorphic expression, prior to and during gonadal sex differentiation and in adult testes, implicating its role in master regulation of sex determination and gonadal sex differentiation. Dmrt1 emerges as a master sex-determining gene in one fish, frog, chicken and reptile. Recent studies suggest epigenetic regulation of Dmrt1 in its promoter methylation and transposable element insertion introducing epigenetic modification to cis-regulatory elements, alongside non-coding RNA involvement, in a wide spectrum of sex-determining mechanisms. Additionally, alternative splicing of Dmrt1 was found in all vertebrate groups except amphibians. Dmrt1 has evolved many lineage-specific isoforms (ranging from 2 to 10) but has no sex-specific splicing variants in any taxa, which is in sharp contrast to the constitutional sex-specific splicing of Dsx in insects. Future research should focus on understanding the molecular basis of environmental sex determination from a broader taxon, and the molecular basis of epigenetic regulation. It is also essential to understand why and how multiple alternative splicing variants of Dmrt1 evolve and the specific roles each isoform plays in sex determination and gonadal sex differentiation, as well as the significant differences in the molecular mechanisms and functions of alternative splicing between Dmrt1 in vertebrates and sex-specific splicing of Dsx in insects. Understanding the differences could provide deeper insights into the evolution of sex-determining mechanisms between vertebrates and insects.</description>

      <title>Virtual Gram staining of label-free bacteria using darkfield microscopy and deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gram staining has been one of the most frequently used staining protocols in microbiology for over a century, utilized across various fields, including diagnostics, food safety, and environmental monitoring. Its manual procedures make it vulnerable to staining errors and artifacts due to, e.g., operator inexperience and chemical variations. Here, we introduce virtual Gram staining of label-free bacteria using a trained deep neural network that digitally transforms darkfield images of unstained bacteria into their Gram-stained equivalents matching brightfield image contrast. After a one-time training effort, the virtual Gram staining model processes an axial stack of darkfield microscopy images of label-free bacteria (never seen before) to rapidly generate Gram staining, bypassing several chemical steps involved in the conventional staining process. We demonstrated the success of the virtual Gram staining workflow on label-free bacteria samples containing Escherichia coli and Listeria innocua by quantifying the staining accuracy of the virtual Gram staining model and comparing the chromatic and morphological features of the virtually stained bacteria against their chemically stained counterparts. This virtual bacteria staining framework effectively bypasses the traditional Gram staining protocol and its challenges, including stain standardization, operator errors, and sensitivity to chemical variations.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy with Machine Learning for Advanced Analysis of Anomalous Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The random motion of molecules in living cells has consistently been reported to deviate from standard Brownian motion, a behavior coined as ``anomalous diffusion''. Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy (FCS) is a powerful method to quantify molecular motions in living cells but its application is limited to a subset of random motions and to long acquisition times. Here, we propose a new analysis approach that frees FCS of these limitations by using machine learning to infer the underlying model of motion and estimate the motion parameters. Using simulated FCS recordings, we show that this approach enlarges the range of anomalous motions available in FCS. We further validate our approach via experimental FCS recordings of calibrated fluorescent beads in increasing concentrations of glycerol in water. Taken together, our approach significantly augments the analysis power of FCS to capacities that are similar to the best-in-class state-of-the-art algorithms for single-particle-tracking experiments.</description>

      <title>Improving AlphaFlow for Efficient Protein Ensembles Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Investigating conformational landscapes of proteins is a crucial way to understand their biological functions and properties. AlphaFlow stands out as a sequence-conditioned generative model that introduces flexibility into structure prediction models by fine-tuning AlphaFold under the flow-matching framework. Despite the advantages of efficient sampling afforded by flow-matching, AlphaFlow still requires multiple runs of AlphaFold to finally generate one single conformation. Due to the heavy consumption of AlphaFold, its applicability is limited in sampling larger set of protein ensembles or the longer chains within a constrained timeframe. In this work, we propose a feature-conditioned generative model called AlphaFlow-Lit to realize efficient protein ensembles generation. In contrast to the full fine-tuning on the entire structure, we focus solely on the light-weight structure module to reconstruct the conformation. AlphaFlow-Lit performs on-par with AlphaFlow and surpasses its distilled version without pretraining, all while achieving a significant sampling acceleration of around 47 times. The advancement in efficiency showcases the potential of AlphaFlow-Lit in enabling faster and more scalable generation of protein ensembles.</description>

      <title>Molecular Topological Profile (MOLTOP) -- Simple and Strong Baseline for Molecular Graph Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the effectiveness of topological descriptors for molecular graph classification and design a simple, yet strong baseline. We demonstrate that a simple approach to feature engineering - employing histogram aggregation of edge descriptors and one-hot encoding for atomic numbers and bond types - when combined with a Random Forest classifier, can establish a strong baseline for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). The novel algorithm, Molecular Topological Profile (MOLTOP), integrates Edge Betweenness Centrality, Adjusted Rand Index and SCAN Structural Similarity score. This approach proves to be remarkably competitive when compared to modern GNNs, while also being simple, fast, low-variance and hyperparameter-free. Our approach is rigorously tested on MoleculeNet datasets using fair evaluation protocol provided by Open Graph Benchmark. We additionally show out-of-domain generation capabilities on peptide classification task from Long Range Graph Benchmark. The evaluations across eleven benchmark datasets reveal MOLTOP's strong discriminative capabilities, surpassing the $1$-WL test and even $3$-WL test for some classes of graphs. Our conclusion is that descriptor-based baselines, such as the one we propose, are still crucial for accurately assessing advancements in the GNN domain.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16615v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding transcription factor dynamics is crucial for unraveling the regulatory mechanisms of gene expression that underpin cellular function and development. Measurements of transcription factor subcellular movements are essential for developing predictive models of gene expression. However, obtaining these quantitative measurements poses significant challenges due to the inherent variability of biological data and the need for high precision in tracking the movement and interaction of molecules. Our computational pipeline provides a solution to these challenges, offering a comprehensive approach to the quantitative analysis of transcription factor dynamics. Our pipeline integrates advanced image segmentation to accurately delineate individual nuclei, precise nucleus tracking to monitor changes over time, and detailed intensity extraction to measure fluorescence as a proxy for transcription factor activity. Combining our pipeline with techniques such as fluorescence recovery after photobleaching enables the estimation of vital biophysical parameters, such as transcription factor import and export rates.</description>

      <title>Revolutionizing Genomics with Reinforcement Learning Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.13268v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful tool for solving a wide range of problems, including decision-making and genomics. The exponential growth of raw genomic data over the past two decades has exceeded the capacity of manual analysis, leading to a growing interest in automatic data analysis and processing. RL algorithms are capable of learning from experience with minimal human supervision, making them well-suited for genomic data analysis and interpretation. One of the key benefits of using RL is the reduced cost associated with collecting labeled training data, which is required for supervised learning. While there have been numerous studies examining the applications of Machine Learning (ML) in genomics, this survey focuses exclusively on the use of RL in various genomics research fields, including gene regulatory networks (GRNs), genome assembly, and sequence alignment. We present a comprehensive technical overview of existing studies on the application of RL in genomics, highlighting the strengths and limitations of these approaches. We then discuss potential research directions that are worthy of future exploration, including the development of more sophisticated reward functions as RL heavily depends on the accuracy of the reward function, the integration of RL with other machine learning techniques, and the application of RL to new and emerging areas in genomics research. Finally, we present our findings and conclude by summarizing the current state of the field and the future outlook for RL in genomics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09685v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Template-free SMILES-to-SMILES translation models for reaction prediction and single-step retrosynthesis are of interest for industrial applications in computer-aided synthesis planning systems due to their state-of-the-art accuracy. However, they suffer from slow inference speed. We present a method to accelerate inference in autoregressive SMILES generators through speculative decoding by copying query string subsequences into target strings in the right places. We apply our method to the molecular transformer implemented in Pytorch Lightning and achieve over 3X faster inference in reaction prediction and single-step retrosynthesis, with no loss in accuracy.</description>
