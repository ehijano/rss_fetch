      <title>Measuring trade costs and analyzing the determinants of trade growth between Cambodia and major trading partners: 1993 to 2019</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High trade costs pose substantial barriers to the process of trade liberalization. This study aims to measure trade costs and explore the driving forces behind the growth of bilateral trade between Cambodia and its top 30 trading partners from 1993 to 2019. Using a micro-founded measure of trade costs derived from the gravity model, we find that Cambodia's average trade costs decreased by 35.43 percent between 1993 and 2019. Fluctuations in average trade costs persisted until 2014, despite Cambodia's accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2004. Since then, these costs have declined more rapidly. Cambodia's bilateral trade costs are lower with its major trading partners in Southeast Asia and East Asia than with those in South Asia, Oceania, Europe, and North America. Cambodia's average trade costs with developing and emerging economies are lower than those with developed economies. Between 2014 and 2019, Cambodia experienced a notable decline in average trade costs with trading partners along the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) corridors by 34.78 percent, twice as fast as with non-BRI trading partners. Regarding the decomposition of trade growth, we find that the expansion of Cambodian trade over the period from 1993 to 2019 was driven by three factors: the rise in income (59.65 percent), the decline in trade costs (56.69 percent), and the decline in multilateral resistance (minus 16.34 percent). The findings of this study have significant implications for a better understanding of Cambodia's development process toward global trade integration over the past two decades. Our results suggest that Cambodia can optimize its trade expansion potential by focusing on its relations with trading partners exhibiting high economic growth potential and those showing substantial reductions in trade costs.</description>

      <title>Air Pollution and Under-5 Child Mortality: Evidence from China's Coal Power Plant Phase-out Policy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10728v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper evaluates the impact of a mandatory shutdown policy of small-capacity coal power plants during China's $11^{th}$ 5-Year Plan period (2006--2010) on under-5 mortality. We collect capacity and location information on 2181 coal power plants that operated during 2000--2010 and compile a unique data set that combines coal power plants, county-level under-5 mortality and socioeconomic variables, high spatial resolution data of PM$_{2.5}$ and SO$_2$ and meteorological conditions. We model the impacts of air pollution on under-5 mortality using the IV-Lasso method, with distance-weighted sums of retired capacity and high-altitude wind status as instrumental variable candidates for air pollution. Our estimates imply that the phase-out policy saved around 46,000 lives during the $11^{th}$ 5-Year Plan period. We also find heterogeneity in the policy effects across regions.

      <title>Complement or substitute? How AI increases the demand for human skills</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19754v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper examines whether artificial intelligence (AI) acts as a substitute or complement to human labour, drawing on 12 million online job vacancies from the United States spanning 2018-2023. We adopt a two-pronged approach: first, analysing "internal effects" within roles explicitly requiring AI, and second, investigating "external effects" that arise when industries, occupations, and regions experience increases in AI demand. Our focus centres on whether complementary skills-such as digital literacy, teamwork, resilience, agility, or analytical thinking-become more prevalent and valuable as AI adoption grows. Results show that AI-focused roles are nearly twice as likely to require skills like resilience, agility, or analytical thinking compared to non-AI roles. Furthermore, these skills command a significant wage premium; data scientists, for instance, are offered 5-10% higher salaries if they also possess resilience or ethics capabilities. We observe positive spillover effects: a doubling of AI-specific demand across industries correlates with a 5% increase in demand for complementary skills, even outside AI-related roles. Conversely, tasks vulnerable to AI substitution, such as basic data skills or translation, exhibit modest declines in demand. However, the external effect is clearly net positive: Complementary effects are up to 1.7x larger than substitution effects. These results are consistent across economies, including the United Kingdom and Australia. Our findings highlight the necessity of reskilling workers in areas where human expertise remains increasingly valuable and ensuring workers can effectively complement and leverage emerging AI technologies.</description>

      <title>The Endurance of Identity-Based Voting: Evidence from the United States and Comparative Democracies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16524v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study demonstrates the persistent dominance of identity based voting across democratic systems, using the United States as a primary case and comparative analyses of 19 other democracies as counterfactuals. Drawing solely on election data from the Roper Center (1976 through recent cycles), we employ OLS regression, ANOVA, and correlation tests to show that race remains the strongest predictor of party affiliation in the US (p &lt; 0.001), with White voters favoring Republicans and Black voters consistently supporting Democrats (85% since 1988). Income, education, and gender exemplified by gaps like 10 points in 2020 further shape voting patterns, yet racial identity predominates. Comparative evidence from majoritarian (e.g., India), proportional (e.g., Germany through 2025), and hybrid (e.g., South Korea with a 25 point gender gap) systems reveals no democracy where issue based voting fully supplants identity based voting. Digital mobilization amplifies this trend globally. These findings underscore identity enduring role in electoral behavior, challenging assumptions of policy driven democratic choice.</description>

      <title>The effect of minimum wages on employment in the presence of productivity fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18261v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditionally, the impact of minimum wages on employment has been studied, and it is generally believed to have a negative effect. Yet, some recent studies have shown that the impact of minimum wages on employment can sometimes be positive. In addition, certain recent proposals set a higher minimum wage than the wage earned by some high-productivity workers. However, the impact of minimum wages on employment has been primarily studied on low-skilled workers, whereas there is limited research on high-skilled workers. To address this gap and examine the effects of minimum wages on high-productivity workers' employment, I construct a macroeconomic model incorporating productivity fluctuations, incomplete markets, directed search, and on-the-job search and compare the steady-state distributions between the baseline model and the model with a minimum wage. As a result, binding minimum wages increase the unemployment rate of both low and high-productivity workers.</description>

      <title>The computational power of a human society: a new model of social evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08861v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Social evolutionary theory seeks to explain increases in the scale and complexity of human societies, from origins to present. Over the course of the twentieth century, social evolutionary theory largely fell out of favor as a way of investigating human history, just when advances in complex systems science and computer science saw the emergence of powerful new conceptions of complex systems, and in particular new methods of measuring complexity. We propose that these advances in our understanding of complex systems and computer science should be brought to bear on our investigations into human history. To that end, we present a new framework for modeling how human societies co-evolve with their biotic environments, recognizing that both a society and its environment are computers. This leads us to model the dynamics of each of those two systems using the same, new kind of computational machine, which we define here. For simplicity, we construe a society as a set of interacting occupations and technologies. Similarly, under such a model, a biotic environment is a set of interacting distinct ecological and environmental processes. This provides novel ways to characterize social complexity, which we hope will cast new light on the archaeological and historical records. Our framework also provides a natural way to formalize both the energetic (thermodynamic) costs required by a society as it runs, and the ways it can extract thermodynamic resources from the environment in order to pay for those costs -- and perhaps to grow with any left-over resources.</description>
