      <title>Testing the dark side of neutrino oscillations with the solar neutrino fog at Dark Matter experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent detection of the solar neutrino background at Dark Matter direct detection experiments paves the way to fully explore an important degeneracy in neutrino oscillations in the presence of new interactions, named the LMA-Dark degeneracy. This degeneracy makes it impossible to determine the neutrino mass ordering in oscillation experiments if neutrinos have new vectorial interactions with matter. As the composition of solar neutrinos at the Earth consists of all three neutrino flavors, testing the presence of new neutrino interactions in the muon and tau neutrino sector in scatterings can fully probe the LMA-Dark region for the first time. In this paper we show that current data from XENONnT and PandaX-4T does not yet exclude the LMA-Dark region with equal couplings of a new mediator to muon and tau neutrinos and quarks, and we identify the possible experimental scenarios to do so in the future. We also show that Dark Matter experiments can distinguish new interactions in the muon or tau sector only from new interactions affecting both sectors.</description>

      <title>The role of the pion mass on the QCD phase diagram in the $T-eB$ plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated the role of the pion mass on the QCD phase diagram in the $T-eB$ plane using an effective model treatment. Such treatments are able to capture the main features predicted by first-principles calculations. We also employed the model to estimate the pion mass beyond which the inverse magnetic catalysis (IMC) effect disappears. The value is found to be independent of the strength of the magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Precise Predictions for Event Shapes in Hadronic Higgs Decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14282v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present NNLO QCD predictions for a wide range of event-shape observables in hadronic Higgs decays, taking into account the two dominant decay modes $H\to gg$ and $H\to b\bar{b}$. Specifically, we consider the six classical event shapes thrust, heavy jet mass, $C$-parameter, total and wide jet broadening, and the three-jet resolution $y_{23}$ in the Durham algorithm. We also present results for the soft-drop variant of thrust. Decays of the Higgs boson to two gluons are treated in the heavy-top limit, whereas decays to a bottom-quark pair are mediated by a non-vanishing Yukawa coupling, despite considering kinematically massless quarks. Our results highlight the importance of NNLO QCD corrections in the calculation of event-shape observables and provide means to quantify the intrinsic difference between the two Higgs decay modes.</description>

      <title>Once-in-a-lifetime encounter models for neutrino media II: Quasi-steady states and miscidynamic flavor evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extended the once-in-a-lifetime encounter (OILE) model to stochastic interactions among neutrinos. As in the original OILE model, the new model reproduces the mean-field behavior of a dense neutrino gas for time $t\lesssim (\mu\gamma)^{-1}$, where $\mu$ measures the strength of the mean-field neutrino self-interaction potential and is proportional to the neutrino density, and the dimensionless "impact parameter" $\gamma$ is a measure of the change in the flavor quantum state of a neutrino during interaction with another neutrino when the wave packets of the two neutrinos overlap. As in the mean-field case, the OILE model with random neutrino velocities experiences kinetic flavor decoherence as the flavor quantum states of the neutrinos diverge from each other. Unlike the mean-field case, however, the OILE model has a "collision term" due to the quantum entanglement among neutrinos. For $\gamma\ll1$, this incoherent effect can drive the neutrinos into a quasi-steady state that is similar to the collective precession mode in a homogeneous and isotropic neutrino gas in the mean-field approximation. Subsequently, the collision term drives the neutrino gas adiabatically through different quasi-steady states and eventually to flavor equilibration. This process is an example of miscidynamic flavor evolution, with the mixing equilibria being the quasi-steady precession states.</description>

      <title>NLO Corrections to Dimuonium Production in Photon-Photon Collision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dimuonium ($\mu^+ \mu^-$) is one of the pure QED bound systems of leptons, together with positronium and ditauonium. The former had been observed in experiment in 1951, while the search for dimuonium and ditauonium ($\tau^+ \tau^-$) are still in vain. The ditauonium is thought to be hard to measure due to its short life time, whereas the dimuonium is very likely to be observed in current running experiments. We calculate in this work the para and ortho dimuonium production in photon-photon collision at the next-to-leading order (NLO) in QED. To handle the Coulomb divergence within the bound system, the non-relativistic QED description is adopted for consistency. The results indicate that the NLO corrections are negative for both para and ortho states, at the normal order of perturbative QED corrections. The measurement of the dimuonium in Belle II experiment, especially at the forthcoming facility of STCF, is tenable.</description>

      <title>Axion Star Bosenova in Axion Miniclusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Axionic dark matter can form structures known as miniclusters that host an axion star at their center. The axion star feeds on the host, and the axion star mass may grow beyond its stability limit, leading to a potential bosenova. Since a dilute axion star has a stable mass limit only when self-interaction is considered, we include axion self-interaction effects in this paper, and specify the condition for bosenova in the QCD axion and temperature-independent axion-like particle parameter spaces. We find that self-interaction may dominate the mass growth of the axion star. For a minicluster with a large initial overdensity, bosenova occurs in a large fraction of axion parameter space. For the QCD axion, bosenova occurs within the age of the Universe for miniclusters with an initial overdensity $\delta\gtrsim 100$.</description>

      <title>Impact of new measurements of light quarks at hadron colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently a series of new measurements with both the neutral and charge current Drell--Yan processes have been performed at hadron colliders, showing deviations from the predictions of the current parton distribution functions (PDFs). In this article, the impact of these new measurements is studied by using their results to update the PDFs. Although these new measurements correspond to different boson propagators and colliding energies, they are found to have a similar impact to the light quark parton distributions with the momentum fraction $x$ around 0.1. It manifests that the deviations are consistent with each other and favor a larger valence $d_v/u_v$ ratio than the modern PDF predictions. Further study indicates that such tension arises dominantly from the deep inelastic scattering measurements of NMC and the fixed target experiments of NuSea, both of which play pivotal roles in detecting the relative $u$ and $d$ type quark contributions for modern PDFs. According to the conclusions of the impact study, it would be essential to include these new measurements into the complete PDF global analysis in the future.</description>

      <title>Identifying Monochromatic Signals in LISA and Taiji via Spectral Split: Gravitational Waves versus Ultralight Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of gravitational waves (GWs) has opened a new window to explore the dark Universe. Ultralight dark matter (ULDM), an attractive candidate for dark matter, might induce monochromatic signals in gravitational-wave (GW) laser interferometers. However it is not clear how such signals are disentangled from the GWs emitted by galactic compact binaries. Here we initiate the investigation on the spectral split of monochromatic signals caused by detector's heliocentric motion in space and show the annual modulation can induce distinct structures in the spectral harmonics for GWs and ULDM, which would enable to clearly identify the nature of the signal. We show the physical parameters can be inferred with high precision using the Fisher matrix formalism. Our results provide a practical algorithm for probing ULDM and broaden the scientific objectives of future GW detectors in space, such as LISA and Taiji.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a pedagogical introduction to the physics of hadronic jets and event shapes at electron-positron colliders. We present some of the main jet definitions and event shape observables studied at lepton colliders and discuss how to produce theoretical predictions in perturbative quantum chromodynamics (QCD), both at fixed order and with resummation or parton showers. We further introduce important topics in jet substructure that have seen developments in a lepton collider environment, such as the Lund jet plane, Soft Drop, and quark-gluon jet discrimination. Finally, we briefly elaborate on selected topics, such as flavoured jets, hadronic decays of the Higgs boson, and non-perturbative effects.</description>

      <title>Scrutinizing Fermionic Dark Matter in Scotogenic Model with Low Reheating Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The scotogenic model provides a minimal and elegant framework that simultaneously explains neutrino masses and accommodates a viable dark matter (DM) candidate. In this work, we investigate the phenomenology of fermionic DM in the scotogenic model, with a particular emphasis on the effects of a non-standard cosmological history characterized by a low reheating temperature. We demonstrate that entropy injection from inflaton decay can significantly dilute the DM abundance, thereby relaxing the annihilation cross section required to reproduce the observed relic density and opening new regions of viable parameter space. We further analyze the complementarity between current and future direct detection experiments and charged lepton flavour violation (cLFV) searches in probing this scenario. Our results show that next-generation direct detection experiments such as DARWIN and XLZD, together with upcoming cLFV searches (in particular the future sensitivity of $\mu \rightarrow 3e$ experiments), will be capable of testing substantial regions of the parameter space, including those associated with low reheating temperatures.</description>

      <title>Solar wind bremsstrahlung in our Solar System at 21cm, 3mm, and 12microns Wavelengths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using Monte Carlo techniques, we calculate the bremsstrahlung spectrum that protons and electrons in the solar wind would produce when encountering dark matter (DM) particles within the solar system. We consider two types of interactions for the DM: one where a spin-1/2 neutral DM particle interacts with matter through the exchange of a lighter neutral scalar DM particle and one where a scalar neutral DM particle interacts directly with the matter particle. We consider three wavelengths: 21 cm, 3 mm, and 12 microns. In order to estimate the significance of the signal, we compare our results to experimental results from ARCADE2 and PLANCK, and consider the sensitivities of three telescopes: VLA, ALMA and KECK. We find that in order to produce an observable signal in the first scenario, the neutral fermion must have a mass comparable to the solar wind particle while the exchanged particle must have a mass typically $few\times 10^5$ smaller. The scalar direct interaction however appears beyond reach for any reasonable coupling.</description>

      <title>Nonstrange and strange quark matter at finite temperature within modified NJL model and protoquark stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the modified Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model -- incorporating exchange interactions via the Fierz transformation -- to finite temperatures in both two- and three-flavor scenarios, and investigate the properties of protoquark stars in $\beta$-equilibrium. Our results show that increasing the strength of exchange interactions, characterized by the parameter $\alpha$, changes the chiral phase transition from first-order to crossover. We examine the effects of finite temperature, lepton fraction, and exchange interactions on the equation of state (EOS), finding that the EOS in the crossover regime is significantly stiffer than in the first-order case. In certain regions of parameter space within the crossover scenario, strange quark matter can support the existence of twin star configurations.</description>

      <title>Novel Limits on Dark Photon Mixing from Radiation Safety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I propose a novel laboratory search for dark photons based on radiation-safety monitoring at synchrotron radiation facilities, including NanoTerasu, SPring-8, KEK-PF, and ESRF. Dark photons can be produced parasitically in undulators or via photon-mirror interactions, and subsequently traverse optical systems and shielding. Taking into account quantum effects and the internal structure of undulators, mirrors, and detectors, I show that even a simple Geiger-M\"uller counter, routinely used for radiation-safety monitoring, can detect such dark photons outside the shielding and set competitive limits on the kinetic mixing parameter down to $\chi \lesssim 5\times 10^{-6}$ in the eV mass range, providing some of the strongest bounds among laboratory searches. Because radiation safety is strictly regulated, the resulting limits can be regarded as robust and realistic constraints.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lorentz Local Canonicalization (LLoCa) ensures exact Lorentz-equivariance for arbitrary neural networks with minimal computational overhead. For the LHC, it equivariantly predicts local reference frames for each particle and propagates any-order tensorial information between them. We apply it to graph networks and transformers. We showcase its cutting-edge performance on amplitude regression, end-to-end event generation, and jet tagging. For jet tagging, we introduce a large top tagging dataset, to benchmark LLoCa versions of a range of established benchmark architectures.</description>

      <title>Convection-Driven Multi-Scale Magnetic Fields Determine the Observed Solar-Disk Gamma Rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The solar disk is a continuous source of GeV--TeV gamma rays. The emission is thought to originate from hadronic Galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) interacting with the gas in the photosphere and uppermost convection zone after being reflected by solar magnetic fields. Despite this general understanding, existing theoretical models have yet to match observational data. At the photosphere and the uppermost convection zone, granular convection drives a multi-scale magnetic field, forming a larger-scale filamentary structure while also generating turbulence-scale Alfv\'{e}n wave turbulence. Here, we demonstrate that the larger-scale filamentary field shapes the overall gamma-ray emission spectrum, and the Alfv\'{e}n wave turbulence is critical for further suppressing the gamma-ray emission spectrum below $\sim 100$~GeV. For a standard Alfv\'{e}n wave turbulence level, our model's predicted spectrum slope from 1~GeV to 1~TeV is in excellent agreement with observations from Fermi-LAT and HAWC, an important achievement. The predicted absolute flux is a factor of 2--5 lower than the observed data; we outline future directions to resolve this discrepancy. The key contribution of our work is providing a new theoretical framework for using solar disk gamma-ray observations to probe hadronic GCR transport in the lower solar atmosphere.</description>

Abstract: Coulomb branch amplitudes of maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory display infrared properties different from their conformal counterparts. While the four-leg amplitude is known to very high perturbative orders, amplitudes of higher multiplicity fall into an uncharted territory starting already from two loops. The reason for this is that they are not easily amenable to traditional techniques like canonical differential equations due to the uncontrolled swelling of solutions to integration-by-parts identities. In this paper, we break the barrier for the five-leg amplitude using a technique based on the analysis of Newton polytopes corresponding to Feynman/Schwinger integrands and their tropical geometry. Specifically, we analytically evaluate the near mass-shell limit of the off-shell pentabox in terms of Goncharov polylogarithms.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Neutrino Emission from Spinning, Moving, and Charged Primordial Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The angular and spectral features of neutrinos emitted from primordial black holes (PBHs) carry key imprints of the black hole's fundamental properties. This work investigates the directional emission of neutrinos from Kerr-Newman PBHs undergoing Hawking evaporation, accounting for the combined effects of spin, motion, and electric charge. Rotation induces anisotropic fluxes through axisymmetric geometry and spin-dependent greybody factors, while relativistic motion leads to pronounced Doppler beaming along the direction of travel. Electric charge modifies the thermodynamic evolution and suppresses the emission of like-charged particles, altering the overall spectrum and burst duration. The resulting neutrino flux exhibits rich angular structure, energy dependence, and time profiles that vary with PBH parameters. These directional signatures enhance the prospects for detection at current and future neutrino observatories, and offer new multi-messenger probes of PBH populations in the early universe.</description>

      <title>Resurrecting Vanilla Power Law Inflation with the aid of Continuous Spontaneous Localization in the ACT era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Vanilla Power Law Inflation is plagued with two severe drawbacks, the one being the issue of graceful exit, and the other being its compatibility with the existing data. There's yet another daunting problem generic to any inflationary model, and not particular to the Power Law Inflation, is the issue of classicalization of the primordial quantum perturbation. This issue is often treated as an isolated problem primarily because decoherence is often invoked to tackle such problems and decoherence, in principle, doesn't leaves any observational imprints. However, that's not the case if one invokes the collapse models of quantum mechanics to resolve such a problem, because the collapse models do modify the Schr\"{o}dinger evolution of the quantum system and the modified dynamics is bound to leave imprints. We show that collapsed modified Power Law Inflation can indeed circumvent the issue with observations and can be made compatible with all the current data coming from {\it Planck}, {\it ACT}, DESI and BAO while resolving the classicalization issue associated with the quantum primordial fluctuations. Such an inflationary model also produces a more red-tilted tensor spectrum and no running for both the scalar and tensor spectral indices, which can be a litmus test for this model.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of first-order phase transitions through a mass-acquiring scalar field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phase transitions in the early Universe give rise to effective masses for massless fields in the symmetry-broken phase. We use the lattice simulations to investigate the impact of a spectator scalar field with mass generation on the dynamics of first-order phase transitions and the generation of gravitational waves. In addition to the well-known friction effects, we identify a novel effect that significantly enhances the strength of first-order phase transitions. The amplitude of the mass-acquiring field is highly suppressed in the true vacuum bubbles, resulting in additional release of vacuum energy that concentrate on the bubble walls. We also establish an analytical method to explain our numerical results.</description>

      <title>Proof of a Generalized Ryu-Takayanagi Conjecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive a generalized version of the Ryu-Takayanagi formula for the entanglement entropy in arbitrary diffeomorphism invariant field theories. We use a recent framework which expresses the measurable quantities of a quantum theory as a weighted sum over paths in the theory's phase space. If this framework is applied to a field theory on a spacetime foliated by a hypersurface $\Sigma,$ the choice of a codimension-2 surface $B$ without boundary contained in $\Sigma$ specifies a submanifold in the phase space. For diffeomorphism invariant field theories, a functional integral expression for their density matrices was recently given and then used to derive bounds on phase space volumes in the considered submanifold associated to $B.$ These bounds formalize the gravitational entropy bound. Here, we present an implication of this derivation in that we show the obtained functional integral expression for density matrices to be naturally suited for the replica trick. Correspondingly, we prove a functional integral expression for the associated entanglement entropies and derive a practical prescription for their evaluation to leading order and beyond. An important novelty of our approach is the contact to phase space. This allows us both to obtain a prescription for entanglement entropies in arbitrary diffeomorphism invariant field theories not necessarily possessing a holographic dual as well as to use entanglement entropies to study their phase space structure. In the case of the bulk-boundary correspondence, our prescription consistently reproduces and hence provides a natural and independent proof of the Ryu-Takayanagi formula as well as its various generalizations. These include the covariant holographic entanglement entropy proposal, Dong's proposal for higher-derivative gravity as well as the quantum extremal surface prescription.</description>

      <title>Minimal Dirac seesaw accompanied by Dirac fermionic dark matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:1907.10018v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $SU(3)_c^{}\times SU(2)_L^{} \times U(1)_Y^{}$ standard model is extended by a $U(1)_{B-L}^{}$ gauge symmetry with four right-handed neutrinos. Because of their Yukawa couplings to a Higgs singlet for spontaneously breaking the $U(1)_{B-L}^{}$ symmetry, two right-handed neutrinos can form a Dirac fermion to become a stable dark matter particle. Meanwhile, mediated by additionally heavy Higgs doublet(s), fermion singlet(s) and/or fermion doublet(s), the other two right-handed neutrinos can have a dimension-5 operator with the standard model lepton and Higgs doublets as well as the $U(1)_{B-L}^{}$ Higgs singlet. This context can realize a minimal Dirac neutrino mass matrix only with two nonzero eigenvalues. In association with the sphaleron processes, the interactions for generating the Dirac neutrino masses can also produce the observed baryon asymmetry in the universe.</description>

      <title>Muon anomalous magnetic moment and Right handed sterile neutrino</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07184v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The muon's magnetic moment is a fundamental quantity in particle physics and the deviation of its value from quantum electrodynamics (QED), motivates research beyond the standard models (SM). In this study, we utilize the effective coupling of right-handed sterile neutrinos with SM gauge bosons to calculate the muon anomalous magnetic moment ($\boldsymbol{\mu}$AMM) at one-loop level. The contribution of the sterile neutrino interactions on the $\boldsymbol{\mu}$AMM is calculated by considering the standard and non-standard neutrino interactions. Our results show that the standard sterile neutrino interactions give a negligible contribution to $\Delta a_{\boldsymbol{\mu}}$ while the non-standard neutrino interactions can play a significant role in explaining the muon $(g-2)$ anomaly. In the context of the non-standard neutrino interaction, our calculation shows that a Dirac mass scale $M_D$ around $100\,\text{GeV}$ could explain the muon anomaly if the right handed sterile neutrino's coupling with SM particles is about $\mathcal{G}_R\approx 10^{-3}$. We have also plotted the allowed region of the model parameters that satisfy the experimental data on $\Delta a_{{\boldsymbol{\mu}}}^{SN}$ and discuss the percentage of the ${\boldsymbol{\mu}}$ anomaly compensation in terms of the coupling constant $\mathcal{G}_R$.</description>

      <title>Thermal leptogenesis, dark matter, and gravitational waves from an extended canonical seesaw scenario</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08828v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a canonical type-I seesaw scenario, the Standard Model is extended with three singlet right-handed neutrinos (RHNs) $N_i, i=1,2,3$ with masses $M_i, i=1,2,3$ to simultaneously explain sub-eV masses of light neutrinos and baryon asymmetry of the Universe at high scales. In this paper, we show that a relatively low-scale thermal leptogenesis accompanied by gravitational wave signatures is possible when the type-I seesaw is extended with a singlet fermion ($S$) and a singlet scalar ($\rho$), where $S$ and $\rho$ are odd under a discrete $Z_2$ symmetry. We also add a vectorlike fermion doublet $\Psi$ and impose a $Z^\prime_2$ symmetry under which both $N_1$ and $\Psi$ are odd while all other particles are even. This gives rise to a singlet-doublet Majorana fermion dark matter in our setup. At a high scale, the $Z_2$ symmetry is broken spontaneously by the vacuum expectation value of $\rho$ and leads to (i) mixing between RHNs ($N_2, N_3$) and $S$, and (ii) formation of Domain walls (DWs). In the former case, the final lepton asymmetry is generated by the out-of-equilibrium decay of $S$, which dominantly mixes with $N_2$. We show that the scale of thermal leptogenesis can be lowered to $M_S \sim 2 \times 10^6$ GeV, which is \textit{3} orders of magnitude lower than the thermal leptogenesis in canonical type-I seesaw. In the latter case, the disappearance of the DWs gives observable gravitational wave signatures, which can be probed at LISA, DECIGO, ${\rm \mu ARES}$ etc.</description>

      <title>About Matter Effects on Neutrino Mixing Matrix Phases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18433v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As is widely known, the flavour and mass eigenbasis in neutrino sector can be related by a reduced unitary matrix, described by 3 real parameters and one phase, for Dirac neutrinos, and 2 extra phases if neutrinos are Majorana particles. Neutrino flavour oscillation experiments are insensitive to Majorana phases, which leads to using the PMNS matrix with only one phase to describe flavour transitions. In this paper, we point out one feature of such choice that is commonly ignored: when neutrinos propagate in matter, the reduced unitary matrix PMNS does not properly diagonalize the neutrino system. We present some numerical calculations and analytical estimations to illustrate such statement, and discuss some scenarios where this effect can be probed.</description>

Abstract: Inspired by the latest experimental progress, we systematically study the OZI-allowed two-body strong decay properties of $1P$-, $1D$-, $2S$- and $2P$-wave $\Lambda_c$ baryons within the $j $-$j$ coupling scheme in the framework of the quark pair creation model. The calculations indicate that: (i) Taking the observed states $\Lambda_c(2595)^+$ and $\Lambda_c(2625)^+$ as the $1P$-wave $\lambda$-modes states $\Lambda_c|J^P=1/2^-,1\rangle_{\lambda}$ and $\Lambda_c|J^P=3/2^-,1\rangle_{\lambda}$, respectively, we can reproduce the experimental data well in theory. (ii) Combining with the measured mass and the decay properties of $\Lambda_c(2860)^+$, this excited state can be explained as $1D$-wave $\lambda$-mode state $\Lambda_c|J^P=3/2^+,1\rangle_{\lambda\lambda}$. (iii) The newly observed state $\Lambda_c(2910)^+$ may be assigned as one of the $1P$-wave $\rho$-mode states $\Lambda_c|J^P=3/2^-,2\rangle_{\rho}$ or $\Lambda_c|J^P=5/2^-,2\rangle_{\rho}$. Meanwhile, we notice that the partial decay width ratio between $\Sigma_c\pi$ and $\Sigma_c^*\pi$ for the two candidates is significantly different. Hence, experimental progress in this ratio measurement may shed light on the nature of $\Lambda_c(2910)^+$. (iv) According to the properties of $\Lambda_c(2765)^+$, we find that the $2S$-wave $\lambda$-mode state $\Lambda_{c1}|J^P=1/2^+,0\rangle_{\lambda}$ may be a potential candidate. (v) The $2P$-wave $\lambda$-mode state $\Lambda_{c1}|J^P=3/2^-,1\rangle_{\lambda}$ is mostly likely to be a good assignment of the controversial state $\Lambda_c(2940)^+$. Both the total decay width and partial decay ratio between $pD^0$ and $\Sigma_c\pi$ are in good agreement with the observations. (vi) In addition, for the missing $\Lambda_c$ excitations, we obtain their strong decay properties and hope that's useful for future experimental exploration.</description>

Abstract: The measured standard model parameters indicate that we might live in a false Higgs vacuum, possibly with a very long lifetime. However, small black holes can serve as catalysers and significantly speed up the phase transition. In fact, bubbles of true vacuum might already exist in our universe. We calculate the spectrum of Higgs particles produced by such a bubble, and use event generators to study their decay and subsequent evolution of the decay products to obtain the spectrum of emitted photons and neutrinos as a long-range signature. If the propagation of the bubble walls slows down due to interaction with the surrounding matter and plasma, these signals can reach us before the bubble wall hits us, thus representing the signals of the doomsday.</description>

      <title>Structure of cosmic strings for a gauged B-L symmetry and two Higgs fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20557v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the Standard Model, the difference between the baryon number $B$ and the lepton number $L$ is conserved, which represents a symmetry that is global and exact, and therefore unnatural. We turn it into a naturally exact, local symmetry by coupling the quantum number $B-L$ to an Abelian gauge field. Gauge anomalies are cancelled by adding right-handed neutrinos $\nu_R$, which are not sterile in this case. Therefore the usual Majorana term is forbidden by gauge symmetry, but we arrange for a $\nu_R$-mass by adding a Higgs-type 1-component complex scalar field. Thus we arrive at a modest, well-motivated extension of the Standard Model.
  In this framework, we investigate the field equations in the extended gauge-Higgs sector, involving both Higgs fields and the non-standard U(1) gauge field. They are given by a set of coupled, non-linear differential equations, which we solve numerically, focusing on the structures of cosmic strings. For a variety of parameters, we identify the string profiles and energy densities, assuming appropriate boundary conditions. In particular, these profiles depend on the winding number of each of the Higgs fields. As an amazing peculiarity, we discover -- for high winding numbers -- ``overshooting'' and ``co-axial'' solutions; in the latter case, the profile of the standard Higgs field changes its sign near the core of the cosmic string.</description>

      <title>$D^{(*)}\bar{B}^{(*)}$ dynamics in chiral effective field theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10299v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we systematically study the interactions of the $S$-wave $D^{(*)}\bar{B}^{(*)}$ systems within the framework of chiral effective field theory in heavy hadron formalism. We calculate the $D^{(*)}\bar{B}^{(*)}$ effective potentials up to next-to-leading order, explore the bound state formations, and investigate the $D^{(*)}\bar{B}^{(*)}$ scattering properties such as scattering rate, scattering length, and effective range. Our results show that all $I=1$ $D^{(*)}\bar{B}^{(*)}$ potentials are repulsive, preventing the formation of bound states, while the $I=0$ potentials are generally attractive. Specifically, we get two important observations: first, the shallow bound state is more likely to exist in the $D\bar{B}[I(J^{P})=0(0^{+})]$ system than in the $D\bar{B}^{*}[I(J^{P})=0(1^{+})]$ system; second, $D^{*}\bar{B}^{*}[I(J^{P})=0(0^{+})]$ and $D^{*}\bar{B}^{*}[I(J^{P})=0(1^{+})]$ systems possess relatively large binding energies and positive scattering lengths, which suggests strong bound state formations in these channels. So the attractions in the $D^{*}\bar{B}^{*}[I=0]$ systems are deeper than those in the $D\bar{B}^{(*)}[I=0]$ systems, thus we strongly recommend the future experiment to search for the $D^{*}\bar{B}^{*}[I=0]$ tetraquark systems. We also investigate the coupled-channel effects on the $J=0, 1$ systems and conclude that the inclusion of the coupled channels introduces small but visible influences. In addition, we also investigate the dependencies of the $D\bar{B}^{(*)}$ binding energies on the contact low-energy coupling constants.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves from Resonant Transitions of Tidally Perturbed Gravitational Atoms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18121v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Light bosons can form a gravitational atom (GA) around a spinning black hole through the superradiance process. Considering the black hole to be part of a binary system, the tidal potential of the companion periodically perturbs the GA such that an ``atomic'' transition occurs between two of its energy eigenstates. The resonant transition is modeled by the Landau-Zener system, where the orbital frequency of the companion determines the relevant transition. In this work, we study a novel gravitational wave signal originating directly from the level transition of the GA in a binary system. We derive the analytical formulae of both the strain waveform and frequency spectrum of the signal. We further investigate the GA-binary systems that can have a large signal-to-noise ratio in the milli-Hz to deci-Hz frequency band. Using the future space-based gravitational wave observatory DECIGO, we find the signal-to-noise ratio is $\mathcal{O}(10-200)$ for the fine-structure constant $\alpha\simeq 0.3$, host black hole mass $M= 150M_\odot$ and boson mass $\mu \simeq 10^{-13} \rm eV$ at a distance within 100 kpc.</description>

      <title>Strongly Interacting Dark Matter admixed Neutron Stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19691v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dark matter may accumulate in neutron stars given its gravitational interaction and abundance. We investigate the modification of neutron star properties and confront them with the observations in the context of strongly-interacting dark matter scenario, specifically for a QCD-like theory with G$_2$ gauge group for which a first-principles equation-of-state from lattice calculations is available. We study the impact of various observational constraints and modeling of the QCD equation of state on the combined neutron stars. The results indicate that dark matter masses of a few hundred MeV to a few GeV are consistent with the latest observed neutron star properties.</description>

      <title>Challenges in locating the QCD critical point via constant entropy density contours</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04446v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new method was proposed recently to investigate the location of the putative critical point of strongly interacting matter, governed by quantum chromodynamics. By approximating contours of constant entropy density at finite baryon chemical potential, the conditions for the existence of a critical point are solved. In this work, we analyze this method in the hadron resonance gas and Nambu--Jona-Lasinio models. We demonstrate that the prediction of the critical point in the HRG model is solely due to mesonic and baryonic degrees of freedom, and thus is not necessarily a signal of a critical point. We argue that such an expansion leads to a physically meaningful prediction only when applied near the critical point.</description>

      <title>RGE solver for the complete dim-7 SMEFT interactions and its application to $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06499v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an automatic renormalization group equations (RGEs) solver, D7RGESolver, designed for the precise numerical solution of one-loop RGEs of dimension-7 (dim-7) operators within the standard model effective field theory (SMEFT). This tool is capable of calculating the RGE effects of dim-5 and dim-7 SMEFT operators between any two scales above the electroweak scale. We take the nuclear neutrinoless double beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay process as an example to appreciate the importance of the running effects in phenomenological studies. Our analysis demonstrates that $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay can constrain nearly all dim-7 SMEFT operators involving first-generation leptons that violate lepton number by two units, after accounting for RGE effects. Specifically, we have placed meaningful constraints on 55 dim-7 Wilson coefficients, compared to only 10 from a simple tree-level analysis. Certain operators exhibit much stricter constraints when RGE effects are included, especially for the operators that mix with neutrino mass operators. We provide a complete code documentation for D7RGESolver, along with examples of its usage and interfacing with external automated codes for calculating $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay. The D7RGESolver code is available at: \href{https://github.com/ZhaoXiang210/D7RGESolver}{Github: D7RGESolver}</description>

      <title>More visualisation of decay-time-dependent asymmetries in multibody B-meson decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04850v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Methods have been proposed recently to weight data in order to allow visualisation of CP-violation effects in transitions of neutral B mesons to multibody final states that are not CP-eigenstates. These are useful since integration of the unweighted data over the phase space would otherwise wash out the effects of interest. A similar method, elaborated upon here, with a different weighting function can also be used to visualise CP-conserving $B_{(s)}^0$--$\overline{B}{}_{(s)}^0$ oscillations, rather than the CP-violating asymmetries. Together with the other weighting functions, this new method could be useful, for example, to demonstrate the accuracy of the calibration of the flavour tagging algorithms that are crucial for analyses such as the measurement of the CP-violating phase in $B_s^0 \to J/\!\psi\phi$ decays. Their application to the formalism in common use for such decays is explicitly demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing Transition GPDs for Delta(1232) from Helicity Amplitude A_1/2(Q^2) via Dipole Fits and Impact Parameter Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00018v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents a modular reconstruction of the transition generalized parton distribution (GPD) H_T(x,t) for the Delta(1232) resonance, based on digitized helicity amplitude data and dipole fits to A_1/2(Q^2). From the fitted amplitude, we extract a Sachs-like form factor F(t) and define a separable GPD model H_T(x, t) = h(x)F(t), with h(x) modeled as a normalized Beta-like profile. This factorized ansatz satisfies the GPD sum rule and enables a direct two-dimensional Fourier transform to construct transverse spatial distributions q(x,b). We analyze how longitudinal shaping modulates transverse localization, and quantify spatial features using statistical diagnostics including mean radius, skewness, and kurtosis. The framework is reproducible, data-driven, and applicable to other transition channels, providing a physically interpretable map from amplitude behavior to spatial structure.</description>

      <title>Vertex corrections and wavefunction renormalization for atoms, nuclei, and other heavy composite particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05540v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study one-loop QED corrections to operator matrix elements involving heavy composite particles (e.g., heavy-mesons, nuclei, and atoms). We define a new notion of reducible and irreducible graphs which is useful for systems with many discrete excited states. The equivalence of the LSZ reduction formula and old fashioned perturbation theory is explicitly demonstrated. The self energy and vertex corrections are defined (to all orders), and the one-loop corrections are reduced to operator matrix elements which may be evaluated by hadronic, nuclear, or atomic theorists. The gauge dependence of the various pieces are studied in detail, and cancellation of spurious contributions are demonstrated in a class of covariant gauges; Coulomb gauge is also discussed. The formalism is applied to superallowed beta decay where we identify a number of effects that arise at one loop that are, to the best of our knowledge, not included in current extractions of $|V_{ud}|$. In particular we find an electromagnetic isospin breaking correction at $O(\alpha)$ in addition to the well known $O(Z^2\alpha^2)$ corrections from the intranuclear Coulomb field.</description>

      <title>Search for doubly charged scalars in type-II seesaw mechanism through photon fusion at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11336v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Small neutrino masses can be generated through the well-known seesaw mechanisms, among which the type-II scenario predicts a triplet scalar with doubly charged components. Except for the Drell-Yan production at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the doubly charged scalars $\Delta^{\pm\pm}$ can also be produced through photon fusion along with ultraperipheral collision of protons, the outgoing protons from which can be detected by forward detectors at the LHC, providing a promising way to explore related new physics. We study the pair production through such processes at the 14 TeV LHC, focusing on the final states of $\mu^{+}\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\mu^{-}$ and $e^{+}e^{+}e^{-}e^{-}$ under normal (NH) and inverted hierarchy (IH) of the neutrino mass spectra, respectively. Promising sensitivity can be reached via our proposed search strategy. With luminosity of 36.1 fb$^{-1}$(100 fb$^{-1}$), $m_{\Delta}\sim430(520)$ GeV can be excluded at 95% C.L. under the NH via $\mu^{+}\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\mu^{-}$ states searching, while the mass bound can be extended to 730(880) GeV under the IH via $e^{+}e^{+}e^{-}e^{-}$ states. The exclusion limits on $m_{\Delta}$ can be improved up to 1 TeV and even higher with integrated luminosity accumulated to 3 ab$^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>A string based model with Hagedorn temperature of $T_H\sim 300~$MeV describes the spectrum of mesons and glueballs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11626v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the thermodynamics of a color-confined phase of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) and pure gauge theory within a string-inspired model, corresponding to a physical spatial dimension, d = 3. We show that the physical mass spectrum of massive mesons--in both the strange and non-strange sectors separately--is reasonably well described and extended by the exponential mass spectrum of open strings, $\rho(m)$, characterized by a unique Hagedorn temperature, $T_H = \sqrt{3\sigma/2\pi}$, expressed by the string tension, $\sigma$. This $T_H$ is the value appropriate for d = 3 spatial dimensions, and is of order $T_H \sim 300~\rm MeV$ for typical values of the string tension. It is much larger than the values of $T_H$, which have been phenomenologically extracted so far to describe the meson spectrum. Glueball states in pure gauge theory, modeled by closed strings, exhibit a similarly large Hagedorn temperature, highlighting a universal feature of the exponential spectrum. We further analyze the thermodynamic properties of the equation of state at finite temperature and demonstrate that, in the confined phase, the string models agree with lattice QCD results. This lends further support to the recent interpretation of the QCD phase diagram that incorporates strings as relevant degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Equation of State of Decompressed Quark Matter, and Observational Signatures of Quark-Star Mergers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09013v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quark stars are challenging to confirm or exclude observationally because they can have similar masses and radii as neutron stars. By performing the first calculation of the non-equilibrium equation of state of decompressed quark matter at finite temperature, we determine the properties of the ejecta from binary quark-star or quark star-black hole mergers. We account for all relevant physical processes during the ejecta evolution, including quark nugget evaporation and cooling, and weak interactions. We find that these merger ejecta can differ significantly from those in neutron star mergers, depending on the binding energy of quark matter. For relatively high binding energies, quark star mergers are unlikely to produce r-process elements and kilonova signals. We propose that future observations of binary mergers and kilonovae could impose stringent constraints on the binding energy of quark matter and the existence of quark stars.</description>

      <title>Towards a String Realization of the Dark Dimension via T-folds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19216v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the feasibility of realizing the Dark Dimension Scenario through T-fold compactifications on $T^5 \times S^1$, where the base of the internal space $S^1$ naturally acts as the requisite mesoscopic extra dimension. Utilizing Scherk--Schwarz reduction from 5D to 4D, and applying duality twists from both elliptic and parabolic conjugacy classes of subgroups of the T-duality group associated with $T^5$, we stabilize the volume of $T^5$ and several other moduli. This approach generates a potential characterized by two runaway directions, one aligned with the Scherk--Schwarz radion. Further stabilization efforts yield a decreasing potential trajectory demanded by the Dark Dimension Scenario.</description>

      <title>Evolving Dark Sector and the Dark Dimension Scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03090v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: String theory naturally leads to the expectation that dark energy is not stable, and may be evolving as captured by the Swampland de Sitter conjectures. Moreover, motivated by the distance conjecture, a unification of dark sector has been proposed, where the smallness of dark energy leads to one extra dimension of micron size with dark matter being the Kaluza--Klein graviton excitations in this extra dimension. We consider the natural possibility that the radius of the dark dimension varies as the dark energy decreases, leading to the variation of the dark matter mass. This correlates the decrease of the dark energy with the variation of the dark matter mass as they depend on the variations of a scalar field $\phi$ controlling the radius of the extra dimension. A simple realization of this idea for small range of $\phi$ is adequately captured by choosing a potential which is locally of the form $V=V_0\ {\rm exp}(-c\phi)$ and dark matter mass $m_{\rm DM}=m_0\ {\rm exp}(-c' \phi)$ where the sign of $\phi$ is chosen such that $c'\geq 0$ while we have two choices for the sign of $c$ depending on whether the dark dimension expands or shrinks when the dark energy dominates. We find excellent agreement with recent experimental data from DESI DR2 combined with SN measurements (from DES, Union3 or Pantheon+) and reproduces the same significance as CPL parametrization with the added benefit of providing a natural explanation for the apparent phantom behavior ($w&lt;-1$) reported by DESI and DES based on a physical model. DESI and SN datasets independently favor non-zero values of $c'$ and $c$, respectively, both lying within the expected $\mathcal{O}(1)$ range suggested by the Swampland criteria. Moreover, our best fit value $c'\simeq 0.05 \pm 0.01$ is remarkably consistent with the experimental upper bound of $c'\lesssim 0.2$ demanded by the lack of detection of fifth force in the dark sector.</description>

      <title>Deciphering the dynamics of nuclear collisions with elongated structure of $^{20}$Ne</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14262v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the results obtained from the study of $^{20}$Ne$-$$^{20}$Ne collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$= 6.8 TeV using the Monte Carlo Pythia8/Angantyr model. Angantyr models heavy-ion collisions as a superposition of independent nucleon-nucleon (NN) collisions, without incorporating collective effects. We construct a bi-pyramidal structure of $^{20}$Ne nucleus composed of five $\alpha$-clusters and compare its collision dynamics against those generated using Woods-Saxon nuclear density distribution. The results are further compared for different orientations of the $^{20}$Ne nuclei, including tip-tip, body-body, body-tip, and random orientations of the bi-pyramidal structure. The results show that the geometric arrangement of $\alpha$-clusters in the $^{20}$Ne nucleus significantly influences the particle production patterns in final state particle multiplicity and mean transverse momentum ($\langle p_T \rangle$). These results highlight the sensitivity of final state observables to the nuclear structure and orientation of colliding nuclei, providing insights into the dynamics of small collision systems, even in non-hydrodynamic framework.</description>

      <title>QCD-Gravity double copy in Regge asymptotics: from $2\rightarrow n$ amplitudes to radiation in shockwave collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21252v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: These lectures discuss multi-particle production in QCD and in gravity at ultrarelativistic energies, their double copy relations, and strong parallels in emergent shockwave dynamics. Dispersive techniques are applied to derive the BFKL equation for multi-gluon production in Regge asymptotics. Identical methods apply in gravity and are captured by a gravitational Lipatov equation. The building blocks in both cases are Lipatov vertices and reggeized propagators satisfying double copy relations; in gravity, Weinberg's soft theorem is recovered as a limit of the Lipatov framework. BFKL evolution in QCD generates wee parton states of maximal occupancy characterized by an emergent semi-hard saturation scale. Renormalization group equations in the Color Glass Condensate (CGC) EFT describe wee parton correlations and their rapidity evolution. A shockwave picture of deeply inelastic scattering and hadron-hadron collisions follows, with multi-particle production described by Cutkosky's rules in strong time-dependent fields. Gluon radiation in the CGC EFT has a double copy in gravitational shockwave collisions, with a similar correspondence applicable between gluon and graviton shockwave propagators. Possible extensions of this semi-classical double copy are outlined for computing multi-particle production in gravitational shockwave collisions, self-force and tidal contributions, and classical and quantum noise in the focusing of geodesics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02785v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study tidal Love numbers of static black holes in four-dimensional quadratic theory of gravity, extending the result of GR. We use worldline effective field theory (WEFT) methods to compute metric perturbations from one-point functions, treating the higher-derivative terms perturbatively. We show that insertions of scalar fields on the worldline induce non-zero tidal tails, and the corresponding Love number displays no RG running. The same conclusion holds for the insertions of tensor fields. Furthermore, for scalar dipole perturbations, we derive a Yukawa-deformed Frobenius solution and match the asymptotic behavior to fix the UV charge, finding agreement with EFT predictions of Wilson coefficients. Our work demonstrates that quadratic higher-curvature corrections induce non-zero but scale-independent tidal responses, offering a robust EFT framework to test deviations from GR in gravitational wave observations.</description>

Abstract: We employ a model of nuclear structure that takes into account the quark substructure of the baryons to understand the behavior of static two-point correlation functions of meson fields in dense nuclear matter. We show that these correlation functions display ``moat'' regimes, where the inverse static correlation function is nonmonotonic in momentum space. This can have interesting consequences for the nature of nuclear matter, and it strengthens the possibility of a liquid-crystal phase for high densities.</description>
