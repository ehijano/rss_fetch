      <title>Convergence-divergence models: Generalizations of phylogenetic trees modeling gene flow over time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phylogenetic trees are simple models of evolutionary processes. They describe conditionally independent divergent evolution of taxa from common ancestors. Phylogenetic trees commonly do not have enough flexibility to adequately model all evolutionary processes. For example, introgressive hybridization, where genes can flow from one taxon to another. Phylogenetic networks model evolution not fully described by a phylogenetic tree. However, many phylogenetic network models assume ancestral taxa merge instantaneously to form ``hybrid'' descendant taxa. In contrast, our convergence-divergence models retain a single underlying ``principal'' tree, but permit gene flow over arbitrary time frames. Alternatively, convergence-divergence models can describe other biological processes leading to taxa becoming more similar over a time frame, such as replicated evolution. Here we present novel maximum likelihood-based algorithms to infer most aspects of $N$-taxon convergence-divergence models, many consistently, using a quartet-based approach. The algorithms can be applied to multiple sequence alignments restricted to genes or genomic windows or to gene presence/absence datasets.</description>

      <title>A model for cholera with infectiousness of deceased individuals and vaccination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A cholera transmission model incorporating water-borne and horizontal transmissions as well as infectivity of deceased individuals is formulated and studied. The model also describes an imperfect and waning vaccination. Global stability of the disease-free equilibrium is proved when the basic reproduction number is less than one. It is also proved that there are bistable situations, where when the vaccination reproduction number is less than one, there are two endemic equilibria, although it is shown numerically that the region where this occurs is small. The computational analysis also considers the local asymptotic stability of endemic equilibria and the interplay between vaccination strategy, vaccine efficacy and waning.</description>

      <title>Scaling Laws for Function Diversity and Specialization Across Socioeconomic and Biological Complex Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.06487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.06487v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Function diversity, or the range of tasks that individuals perform, is essential for productive organizations. In the absence of overarching principles, the characteristics of function diversity are seemingly unique to each domain. Here, we introduce an empirical framework and a mathematical model for the diversification of functions in a wide range of systems, such as bacteria, federal agencies, universities, corporations, and cities. Our findings reveal that the number of functions within these entities grows sublinearly with system size, with exponents ranging from 0.35 to 0.57, confirming Heaps' Law. In contrast, cities exhibit logarithmic growth in the occupation types. We generalize the Yule-Simon model to quantify a wide range of these empirical observations by introducing two new key attributes: a diversification parameter that characterizes the tendency for more populated functions to inhibit new function creation, and a specialization parameter that describes how a function's attractiveness depends on its abundance. These parameters allow us to position diverse systems, from microorganisms to metropolitan areas, within a two-dimensional abstract space. This mapping suggests underlying commonalities and differences in the foundational mechanisms that drive the growth of these systems.</description>

      <title>Small-Coupling Dynamic Cavity: a Bayesian mean-field framework for epidemic inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.03829v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the Small-Coupling Dynamic Cavity (SCDC) method, a novel generalized mean-field approximation for epidemic inference and risk assessment within a fully Bayesian framework. SCDC accounts for non-causal effects of observations and uses a graphical model representation of epidemic processes to derive self-consistent equations for edge probability marginals. A small-coupling expansion yields time-dependent cavity messages capturing individual infection probabilities and observational conditioning. With linear computational cost per iteration in the epidemic duration, SCDC is particularly efficient and valid even for recurrent epidemic processes, where standard methods are exponentially complex. Tested on synthetic networks, it matches Belief Propagation in accuracy and outperforms individual-based mean-field methods. Notably, despite being derived as a small-infectiousness expansion, SCDC maintains good accuracy even for relatively large infection probabilities. While convergence issues may arise on graphs with long-range correlations, SCDC reliably estimates risk. Future extensions include non-Markovian models and higher-order terms in the dynamic cavity framework.</description>

      <title>A stochastic explanation for observed local-to-global foraging states in Caenorhabditis elegans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15174v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Abrupt changes in behavior can often be associated with changes in underlying behavioral states. When placed off food, the foraging behavior of C. elegans can be described as a change between an initial local-search behavior characterized by a high rate of reorientations, followed by a global-search behavior characterized by sparse reorientations. This is commonly observed in individual worms, but when numerous worms are characterized, only about half appear to exhibit this behavior. We propose an alternative model that predicts both abrupt and continuous changes to reorientation that does not rely on behavioral states. This model is inspired by molecular dynamics modeling that defines the foraging reorientation rate as a decaying parameter. By stochastically sampling from the probability distribution defined by this rate, both abrupt and gradual changes to reorientation rates can occur, matching experimentally observed results. Crucially, this model does not depend on behavioral states or information accumulation. Even though abrupt behavioral changes do occur, they may not necessarily be indicative of abrupt changes in behavioral states, especially when abrupt changes are not universally observed in the population.</description>
