      <title>The Extreme Activity in Comet Hale-Bopp (C/1995 O1): Investigations of Extensive, Narrowband Photoelectric Photometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional narrowband photoelectric photometry of Comet Hale-Bopp (1995 O1) was obtained on 99 nights from mid-1995 to early-2000, yielding gas and dust production rates over an unprecedented range of time and distance. The appearance of Hale-Bopp presented a prime opportunity for active comet studies and its inherent brightness and orbital geometry allowed the characterization of its long-term activity. Throughout the apparition Hale-Bopp released, by far, more gas and dust than any other comet ever measured. As a very high dust-to-gas ratio object, dust production was successfully measured throughout the apparition, with dust consistently slightly red in color. All five gas species including OH and NH were detected just inside of 5 AU inbound, while C2 and C3 were detected to just past 5 AU outbound and CN was followed until nearly 7.7 AU. Heliocentric distance dependencies ranged between -1.2 to -2.7 in log-log space, with the extremes magnified by the large extrapolations in Haser model parameters at large distances. Hale-Bopp's enormous size and associated extremely high outgassing resulted in a much larger collisional zone, which in turn yielded outflow velocities more than 2x higher than ever previously measured at comparable distances. Even so, volatile composition remained within the "typical" classification, consistent with most Oort Cloud comets, and water production follows the expected curve based on a standard water vaporization model. However, seasonal effects provided evidence for inhomogeneities among the major source regions on the surface of the nucleus. Preliminary modeling of the nucleus and coma successfully matches this seasonal behavior.</description>

      <title>Running with the Bulls: The frequency of star-disc encounters in the Taurus star forming region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stars and planets form in regions of enhanced stellar density, subjecting protoplanetary discs to gravitational perturbations from neighbouring stars. Observations in the Taurus star-forming have uncovered evidence of at least three recent, star-disc encounters that have truncated discs (HV/DO Tau, RW Aurigae, UX Tau), raising questions about the frequency of such events. We aim to assess the probability of observing truncating star-disc encounters in Taurus. We generate a physically motivated dynamical model including binaries and spatial-kinematic substructure to follow the historical dynamical evolution and stellar encounters in the Taurus star forming region. We track the star-disc encounters and outer disc radius evolution over the lifetime of Taurus. A quarter of discs are truncated below 30 au by dynamical encounters, but this truncation mostly occurs in binaries over the course of a few orbital periods, on a time-scale $\lesssim 0.1$ Myr. Nonetheless, some truncating encounters still occur up to the present age of Taurus. Strongly truncating encounters (ejecting $\gtrsim 10$ percent of the disc mass) occur at a rate $\sim 10$ Myr$^{-1}$, sufficient to explain the encounter between HV and DO Tau $\sim 0.1$ Myr ago. If encounters that eject only $\sim 1$ percent of the disc mass are responsible for RW Aurigae and UX Tau, then they are also expected with encounter rate $\Gamma_\mathrm{enc} \sim 100{-}200$ Myr$^{-1}$. However, the observed sample of recent encounters is probably incomplete, since these examples occurred in systems that are not consistent with random drawing from the mass function. One more observed example would statistically imply additional physics, such as replenishment of the outer disc material.</description>

      <title>Viewing the PLATO LOPS2 Field Through the Lenses of TESS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: PLATO will begin observing stars in its Southern Field (LOPS2) after its launch in late 2026. By this time, TESS will have observed the stars in LOPS2 for at least four years. We find that by 2025, on average each star in the PLATO field will have been monitored for 330 days by TESS, with a subset of stars in the TESS continuous viewing zone having over 1000 days of monitoring. There are currently 96 known transiting exoplanets in the LOPS2 field, with 33 of these residing in multiplanet systems. The LOPS2 field also contains around 500 TESS planet candidate systems, over 1000 bright (V&lt;13) eclipsing binary systems, 6 transiting brown dwarf systems, and 2 bright white dwarfs (G&lt;13). We calculate TESS and PLATO sensitivities to detecting transits for the bright FGK stars that make up the PLATO LOPS2 P1 sample. We find that TESS should have discovered almost all transiting giant planets out to approximately 30 d within the LOPS2 field, and out to approximately 100 d for the regions of the LOPS2 field within the TESS CVZ ($\sim$20 per cent of the LOPS2 field). However, we find that for smaller radius planets in the range 1$-$4 R$_\oplus$ PLATO will have significantly better sensitivity, and these are likely to make up the bulk of new PLATO discoveries.</description>

      <title>Exoplanet Demographics: Physical and Orbital Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of over 5700 exoplanets has led to a boom in the field of exoplanet demographics over the past decade. Led by swaths of exoplanet discoveries from NASA's Kepler space mission, astronomers have been conducting statistical studies of the exoplanet population in search of trends in various planetary and host stellar parameters. These investigations are informing our understanding of how planets form and evolve, thus putting our solar system into a galactic context. In this chapter, we review many of the major features uncovered in the distributions of physical and orbital parameters of known exoplanets including the Radius Valley, the Neptunian Desert, the Peas in a Pod pattern, dynamical properties that point toward likely formation/migration mechanisms, as well as trends with host stellar parameters such as the time-evolution of exoplanetary systems and the search for planets within the Habitable Zone. The overarching theme is that exoplanetary systems exhibit an incredible diversity of planet properties and system architectures that do not exist within our own solar system. A promising future awaits the field of exoplanet demographics with increasingly deep investigations planned following the launch of numerous dedicated space telescopes over the coming years and decades.</description>

      <title>White Dwarf Systems: the Composition of Exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We live in an exoplanet revolution, with more than 5,000 exoplanets detected to date. Our ability to characterise individual exoplanets is constantly improving, with exquisite mass and radius measurements for an ever-growing sample of planets, complimented by atmospheric characterisation of lower and lower mass planets. This chapter outlines a complimentary set of observations that uniquely provide bulk elemental compositions for exoplanetary material. Absorption features from metals, including Mg, Fe, Si, O, Ca, Al, Ni and Ti in the white dwarf photosphere characterise the composition of accreted planetary material. These observations highlight the diversity in composition across exoplanetary systems including volatile content and probe key geological processes including the formation of iron cores. Thanks to the many white dwarfs identified by the space satellite {\it Gaia}, a revolution in the spectroscopic characterisation of white dwarfs is underway.</description>

      <title>A patchy CO$_2$ exosphere on Ganymede revealed by the James Webb Space Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jupiter's icy moon Ganymede has a tenuous exosphere produced by sputtering and possibly sublimation of water ice. To date, only atomic hydrogen and oxygen have been directly detected in this exosphere. Here, we present observations of Ganymede's CO$_2$ exosphere obtained with the James Webb Space Telescope. CO$_2$ gas is observed over different terrain types, mainly over those exposed to intense Jovian plasma irradiation, as well as over some bright or dark terrains. Despite warm surface temperatures, the CO$_2$ abundance over equatorial subsolar regions is low. CO$_2$ vapor has the highest abundance over the north polar cap of the leading hemisphere, reaching a surface pressure of 1 pbar. From modeling we show that the local enhancement observed near 12 h local time in this region can be explained by the presence of cold traps enabling CO$_2$ adsorption. However, whether the release mechanism in this high-latitude region is sputtering or sublimation remains unclear. The north polar cap of the leading hemisphere also has unique surface-ice properties, probably linked to the presence of the large atmospheric CO2 excess over this region. These CO2 molecules might have been initially released in the atmosphere after the radiolysis of CO$_2$ precursors, or from the sputtering of CO$_2$ embedded in the H$_2$O ice bedrock. Dark terrains (regiones), more widespread on the north versus south polar regions, possibly harbor CO$_2$ precursors. CO$_2$ molecules would then be redistributed via cold trapping on ice-rich terrains of the polar cap and be diurnally released and redeposited on these terrains. Ganymede's CO$_2$ exosphere highlights the complexity of surface-atmosphere interactions on Jupiter's icy Galilean moons.</description>

      <title>Cleaning WASP-33 b transits from the host star photometric variability: analysis of TESS data from two sectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on TESS observations of a $\delta$ Scuti variable WASP-33 obtained in 2019 and 2022, we thoroughly investigate the power spectrum of this target photometric flux and construct a statistically exhaustive model for its variability. This model contains $30$ robustly justified harmonics detected in the both TESS sectors simultaneously, $13$ less robust harmonics detected in a single TESS sector, a red noise and a quasiperiodic noise terms. This allowed us to greatly improve the accuracy of the exoplanet WASP-33 b transit timings, reducing the TTV residuals r.m.s. drastically, by a factor of $3.5$, from $63$ s to $18$ s. Finally, our analysis does not confirm existence of a detectable orbital phase variation claimed by von Essen et al. (2020) based on WASP-33 TESS photometry of 2019.</description>

      <title>Venus Phosphine: Updates and lessons learned</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of phosphine in Venus' atmosphere provides lessons for the search for life. The detection has survived all challenges and has acquired independent support from archival data from PVP. The presence of phosphine in Venus' oxidising environment is perplexing, and comprehensive studies rule out all known abiotic sources. More data is needed to understand the origin of phosphine, leading to JCMT-Venus, a long term atmospheric monitoring programme. This can find how phosphine varies in relation to other species providing clues to its origin. We present the latest JCMT-Venus results. The discovery and subsequent papers were explicit that they did not constitute evidence for life, only of phosphine. Media and public reaction to the discovery and its implications provide lessons for future life searches, as does the reaction of the scientific community. How this was handled by the team, media, and general public will be reviewed.</description>

      <title>ESPRESSO reveals blueshifted neutral iron emission lines on the dayside of WASP-76 b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra hot Jupiters (gas giants, Teq&gt;2000 K) are intriguing exoplanets due to their extreme atmospheres. Their torrid daysides can be characterised using ground-based high-resolution emission spectroscopy. We search for signatures of neutral and singly ionised iron (Fe I and Fe II) in the dayside of the ultra hot Jupiter WASP-76 b, as these species were detected via transmission spectroscopy in this exoplanet. Furthermore, we aim to confirm the existence of a thermal inversion layer, which has been reported in previous studies, and attempt to constrain its properties. We observed WASP-76 b on four epochs with ESPRESSO at the VLT, at orbital phases shortly before and after the secondary transit, when the dayside is in view. We present the first analysis of high-resolution optical emission spectra for this exoplanet. We compare the data to synthetic templates from petitRADTRANS, using cross-correlation function techniques. We detect a blueshifted (-4.7+-0.3 km/s) Fe I emission signature on the dayside of WASP-76 b at 6.0-sigma. The signal is detected independently both before and after the eclipse, and blueshifted in both cases. The presence of iron emission features confirms the existence of a thermal inversion layer. Fe II was not detected, possibly because this species is located in the upper layers of the atmosphere, which are more optically thin. Thus the Fe II signature on the dayside of WASP-76 b is too weak to be detected with emission spectroscopy. We propose that the blueshifted Fe I signature is created by material rising from the hot spot to the upper layers of the atmosphere, and discuss possible scenarios related to the position of the hotspot. This work unveils some of the dynamic processes ongoing on the dayside of WASP-76 b through the analysis of the Fe I signature from its atmosphere, and complements previous knowledge obtained from transmission studies.</description>

      <title>Planet Mass and Metallicity: The Exoplanets and Solar System Connection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Theoretical studies of giant planet formation suggest that substantial quantities of metals - elements heavier than hydrogen and helium - can be delivered by solid accretion during the envelope-assembly phase. This metal enhancement process is believed to diminish as a function of planet mass, leading to predictions for a mass-metallicity relationship. This picture is supported by the abundance of CH$_4$ in solar system giant planets, which is unaffected by condensation, unlike H$_2$O. However, all of the solar system giants exhibit some evidence for stratification of metals outside of their cores. In this context, two fundamental questions are whether metallicity of giant planets inferred from observations of the outer envelope layers represents their bulk metallicities, and if not, how are metals distributed within these planets. Comparing the mass-metallicity relationship inferred for solar system giants with various tracers of exoplanet metallicity has yielded a range of results. There is evidence of a solar-system-like mass-metallicity trend using bulk density estimates of exoplanets. However, transit-spectroscopy-based tracers of exoplanet metallicity, which probe only the outer layers of the envelope, are less clear about a mass-metallicity trend and radial composition gradients. The large number of known exoplanets enables statistical characterization. We develop a formalism for comparing both the metallicity inferred for the outer envelope and the metallicity inferred using the bulk density and show this combination may offer insights into metal stratification within planetary envelopes. Thus, future exoplanet observations with JWST and Ariel will be able to shed light on the conditions governing radial composition gradients in exoplanets and, perhaps, provide information about the factors controlling stratification and convection in our solar system gas giants.</description>

      <title>Simple lipids form stable higher-order structures in concentrated sulfuric acid</title>

Abstract: Venus has become a target of astrobiological interest because it is physically accessible to direct exploration, unlike exoplanets. So far this interest has been motivated not by the explicit expectation of finding life, but rather a desire to understand the limits of biology. The Venusian surface is sterilizing, but the cloud deck includes regions with temperatures and pressures conventionally considered compatible with life. However, the Venusian clouds are thought to consist of concentrated sulfuric acid. To determine if any fundamental features of life as we understand them here on Earth could in principle exist in these extreme solvent conditions, we have tested several simple lipids for resistance to solvolysis and their ability to form structures in concentrated sulfuric acid. We find that single-chain saturated lipids with sulfate, alcohol, trimethylamine, and phosphonate head groups are resistant to sulfuric acid degradation at room temperature. Furthermore, we find that they form stable higher-order structures typically associated with lipid membranes, micelles, and vesicles. Finally, results from molecular dynamics simulations suggest a molecular explanation for the observed robustness of the lipid structures formed in concentrated sulfuric acid. We conclude with implications for the study of Venus as a target of experimental astrobiology.</description>

      <title>No Pulsar Timing Noise from Brownian Motion of the Sun</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It was recently claimed (arXiv:2405.05410 [gr-qc]) that evidence for a stochastic gravitational wave background observed by pulsar timing arrays can be attributed instead to random perturbations of the Sun's motion by transiting asteroids. I show that that this would lead to a large dipole component accompanying a much smaller quadrupolar perturbation of pulsar timing signals, which would not be confused with a gravitational wave signal. Such an anomalous dipole would have been detected and identified as a spurious background by the PTA collaborations, if it existed.</description>

      <title>A search for Planet Nine with small spacecraft:Three-body, post-Newtonian, non-gravitational, planetary and Kuiper Belt effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.11863v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A hypothetical gravitating body in the outer Solar System, the so-called Planet Nine, was proposed to explain the unexpected clustering of the Kuiper Belt Objects. As it has not been observed via telescopes, it was conjectured to be a primordial black hole (of the size of a quince) that could be gravitationally detected by laser-launching or solar sailing many small spacecraft. Here, we study various aspects affecting such a search for Planet Nine. Our basic observable is the angular displacement in the trajectory of a small spacecraft which will be mainly affected by the gravity of Planet Nine, augmented with several other 3-body, non-gravitational, post-Newtonian, planetary, and Kuiper Belt effects. First, we calculate the effect of the Sun in the framework of the circular restricted three-body problem of the Sun--Planet Nine-spacecraft for the two particular initial conditions. Then, we study the effects of Kuiper Belt and outer planets, namely Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, as well as non-gravitational perturbations such as magnetic and drag forces exerted by the interstellar medium; and the solar radiation pressure. In addition, we investigate the post-Newtonian general relativistic effects such as the frame-dragging, Schwarzschild effect, and geodetic precession on the spacecraft trajectory. We show that the leading order angular displacement is due to the solar radiation pressure for the lower spacecraft velocities, and the drag force for the higher spacecraft velocities. Among the general relativistic effects, the frame-dragging has the smallest effect; and the Schwarzschild effect due to Sun has the largest effect. However, none of the general relativistic effects produces a meaningful contribution to the detection.</description>

      <title>Spectral Energy Distributions of Disc-Embedded Accreting Protoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10057v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many dozens of circumstellar discs show signatures of sculpting by planets. To help find these protoplanets by direct imaging, we compute their broadband spectral energy distributions, which overlap with the JWST (James Webb Space Telescope) and ALMA (Atacama Large Millimeter Array) passbands. We consider how circumplanetary spherical envelopes and circumplanetary discs are heated by accretion and irradiation. Searches with JWST's NIRCam (Near-Infrared Camera) and the blue portion of MIRI (Mid-Infrared Instrument) are most promising since $\sim$300--1000 K protoplanets outshine their $\sim$20--50 K circumstellar environs at wavelengths of $\sim$2--10 $\mu$m. Detection is easier if circumplanetary dust settles into discs (more likely for more massive planets) or is less abundant per unit mass gas (because of grain growth or aerodynamic filtration). At wavelengths longer than 20 $\mu$m, circumplanetary material is difficult to see against the circumstellar disc's surface layers that directly absorb starlight and reprocess it to the far-infrared. Such contaminating circumstellar emission can be serious even within the evacuated gaps observed by ALMA. Only in strongly depleted regions, like the cavity of the transitional disc PDS 70 where two protoplanets have been confirmed, may long-wavelength windows open for protoplanet study. We compile a list of candidate protoplanets and identify those with potentially the highest accretion luminosities, all peaking in the near-infrared.</description>

      <title>TESS Investigation -- Demographics of Young Exoplanets (TI-DYE) II: a second giant planet in the 17-Myr system HIP 67522</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04763v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The youngest ($&lt;$50 Myr) planets are vital to understand planet formation and early evolution. The 17 Myr system HIP 67522 is already known to host a giant ($\simeq$10$R_\oplus$) planet on a tight orbit. In the discovery paper, Rizzuto et al. 2020 reported a tentative single transit detection of an additional planet in the system using TESS. Here, we report the discovery of HIP 67522 c which matches with that single transit event. We confirm the signal with ground-based multi-wavelength photometry from Sinistro and MuSCAT4. At a period of 14.33 days, planet c is close to a 2:1 mean motion resonance with b (6.96 days or 2.06:1). The light curve shows distortions during many of the transits, which are consistent with spot crossing events and/or flares. Fewer stellar activity events are seen in the transits of planet b, suggesting that planet c is crossing a more active latitude. Such distortions, combined with systematics in the TESS light curve extraction, likely explain why planet c was previously missed.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Based Dynamics Identification and Linearization of Orbital Problems using Koopman Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08965v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of the Two-Body and Circular Restricted Three-Body Problems in the field of aerospace engineering and sciences is deeply important because they help describe the motion of both celestial and artificial satellites. With the growing demand for satellites and satellite formation flying, fast and efficient control of these systems is becoming ever more important. Global linearization of these systems allows engineers to employ methods of control in order to achieve these desired results. We propose a data-driven framework for simultaneous system identification and global linearization of both the Two-Body Problem and Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem via deep learning-based Koopman Theory, i.e., a framework that can identify the underlying dynamics and globally linearize it into a linear time-invariant (LTI) system. The linear Koopman operator is discovered through purely data-driven training of a Deep Neural Network with a custom architecture. This paper displays the ability of the Koopman operator to generalize to various other Two-Body systems without the need for retraining. We also demonstrate the capability of the same architecture to be utilized to accurately learn a Koopman operator that approximates the Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem.</description>

      <title>The Gaia Ultracool Dwarf Sample -- IV. GTC/OSIRIS optical spectra of Gaia late-M and L dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03706v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As part of our comprehensive, ongoing characterisation of the low-mass end of the main sequence in the Solar neighbourhood, we used the OSIRIS instrument at the 10.4 m Gran Telescopio Canarias to acquire low- and mid-resolution (R$\approx$300 and R$\approx$2500) optical spectroscopy of 53 late-M and L ultracool dwarfs. Most of these objects are known but poorly investigated and lacking complete kinematics. We measured spectral indices, determined spectral types (six of which are new) and inferred effective temperature and surface gravity from BT-Settl synthetic spectra fits for all objects. We were able to measure radial velocities via line centre fitting and cross correlation for 46 objects, 29 of which lacked previous radial velocity measurements. Using these radial velocities in combination with the latest Gaia DR3 data, we also calculated Galactocentric space velocities. From their kinematics, we identified two candidates outside of the thin disc and four in young stellar kinematic groups. Two further ultracool dwarfs are apparently young field objects: 2MASSW J1246467$+$402715 (L4$\beta$), which has a potential, weak lithium absorption line, and G 196$-$3B (L3$\beta$), which was already known as young due to its well-studied primary companion.</description>
