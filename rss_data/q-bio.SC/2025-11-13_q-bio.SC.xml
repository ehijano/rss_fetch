      <title>Simulating Mono-and Multi-Protein Phosphorylation within Nanoclusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Protein nanoclustering is a characteristic feature of their activated state and is essential for forming numerous subcellular structures. The formation of these nanoclusters is highly dependent on a series of post-translational modifications, such as mono-and multi-phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of residues. We theoretically simulate how a protein can be either mono-or multi-phosphorylated on several residues in functional nanoclusters, depending on effective biophysical parameters (diffusion, dwell time, etc.). Moving beyond a binary view of phosphorylation, this approach highlights the interplay between mono-and multi-phosphorylation, the cooperative effects generally associated with multi-phosphorylation networks, and stresses the role of phosphatases in transforming graded phosphorylation signals into almost switch-like responses. The results are discussed in light of experiments that probe the distribution of phospho-residues.</description>

      <title>Proton Flows, Proton Gradients and Subcellular Architecture in Biological Energy Conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03913v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hydrogen cations, or protons, provide the medium by which energy is stored and converted in biological systems. Such pre-eminence relies on the interplay between interfacial and bulk chemical transformations, according to mechanisms that are shared by organisms in all phyla of life. The present work provides an introduction to the fundamental aspects of biological energy management by focusing on the relationship between vectorial proton flows and the geometry of energy producing organelles in eukaryotes. The leading models of proton-mediated energy conversion, the delocalised proton (or chemiosmotic) model and the localised proton model, are presented in a complementary perspective. While the delocalised model provides a description that relies on equilibrium thermodynamics, the localised model addresses dynamic processes that are better described using out-of-equilibrium thermodynamics. The work reviews the salient aspects of such mechanisms, traces the development of our present understanding, and highlights areas that are open to future developments.</description>
