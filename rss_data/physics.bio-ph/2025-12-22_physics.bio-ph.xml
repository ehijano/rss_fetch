      <title>Full-Wave Optical Modeling of Leaf Internal Light Scattering Dynamics with Potential Applications for Early Detection of Foliar Fungal Disease</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light interacting with plant leaves undergoes reflection, transmission, scattering, and absorption, which together determine leaf optical properties. Changes in leaf architecture disrupt internal light scattering dynamics and consequently affect photosynthetic performance. Previous studies on internal leaf light scattering have primarily relied on ray-tracing approaches (e.g., Raytran) or radiative-transfer models (e.g., PROSPECT). However, these high-frequency approximations cannot capture diffraction and coherent multiple scattering in wavelength-scale leaf tissues, unlike full-wave electromagnetic simulations. Here, we employ GPU-accelerated Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) simulations to model internal light scattering dynamics using segmented cross-section image geometries of representative dicot and monocot leaves with wavelength-dependent complex refractive indices. The simulations accurately reproduce the reflectance and transmittance characteristics of healthy leaves, showing strong agreement with the PROSPECT model, with average Lin's concordance values of 0.8962 for dicot leaves and 0.7849 for monocot leaves. We further simulate early-stage necrotrophic fungal infection by modeling melanized hyphae penetrating the cuticle and upper epidermis. Diseased leaves exhibit a pronounced reduction in visible green reflectance and a marked suppression of the near-infrared reflectance plateau, consistent with experimental observations. Remaining discrepancies in the visible band are expected to be reduced through more advanced geometric and material modeling. This proof-of-concept study presents a full-wave FDTD optical modeling framework for plant-leaf light scattering, enabling physics-based analysis of internal scattering before and after early-stage fungal penetration and supporting the use of light scattering as an indicator for pre-symptomatic plant fungal disease detection.</description>

      <title>Selective trapping of bacteria in porous media by cell length</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bacteria commonly inhabit porous environments such as host tissues, soil, and marine sediments, where complex geometries constrain and redirect their motion. Although bacterial motility has been studied in porous media, the roles of cell length and pore shape in navigating these environments remain poorly understood. Here, we investigate how cell morphology and pore architecture jointly determine bacterial spreading behavior. Using genetically engineered E. coli with tunable cell length, we performed single-cell tracking in microfluidic devices that mimic ordered and disordered porous structures. We find that elongated bacteria traverse ordered pore networks more effectively than short cells, exhibiting straighter paths, greater directional persistence, and enhanced exploration efficiency. In contrast, in disordered porous media, elongated bacteria become trapped in dead-end regions for extended periods, resulting in markedly reduced navigational efficiency. Together, these results reveal how cell shape and environmental geometry interact to govern bacterial transport. Moreover, we suggest a new mechanism for separating antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) bacteria from elongated susceptible cells in designer porous media.</description>

      <title>Eliminating the irregular surface layer of anodically-grown Ni-Ti-O nanopore arrays in a two-stage anodization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nanopores (NPs) grown by anodizing can be partially hidden beneath a relatively compact surface oxide layer, which limits the volumetric surface area of these nanostructures. In this work, nitinol (NiTi) alloy was anodized in an electrolyte containing ethylene glycol, water, and sodium chloride in static and stirred electrolyte stages with the aim of removing the irregular surface array while achieving a thick NP layer. Electron micrographs showed that anodization in the static electrolyte provides a controlled thickness of NP layers covered by an irregular surface layer. In contrast, anodizing in the stirred electrolyte reduced the thickness and the degree of irregularity, which were controlled by the different kinetics of dissolution at the tops, perimeters and bottoms of NPs. To benefit simultaneously from the thickness and regularity of the oxide layers, two-stage anodizing under static and then stirred electrolyte conditions was found to be effective. Following a 30 min anodization in the static electrolyte, anodizing for 30 min under the stirred conditions provided the highest regularity in the oxide array, resulting in NPs of almost 40 nm and 11 {\mu}m in diameter and layer thickness, respectively. Two-stage anodizing under static then stirred electrolyte conditions is proposed in order to promote NP structures for applications demanding higher surface areas.</description>

      <title>Design of a minimal, allosteric, and ATPase-like machine using mechanical linkages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: ATPases cyclically convert chemical energy in the form of ATP gradients into directed motion inside cells. To function, ATPases rely on allosteric communication between at least two binding sites, an internal signaling mechanism that is not well understood. Here, we model an ATPase-like machine by using a system of mechanical linkages to recreate negative allosteric coupling between two binding sites and generate cycles in which the sites alternate occupancy. The ATPase analog has two mechanical degrees of freedom and two discretized binding sites: one for the ATP, Pi and ADP analogs, and one for an allosteric effector analog. The geometry of the ATPase analog allows stepwise binding reactions at each site to capture the two degrees of freedom in a mutually exclusive way. Consequently, the enzyme interconverts between multiple rigid and partially rigid forms, such that neither site can be fully bound when both sites are occupied. Two mechanisms work together to generate an enzymatic cycle: one, in which the tighter-binding ATP analog can bind and displace the effector from the enzyme; and a second, in which flexibility introduced by splitting the ATP analog into two pieces (catalysis) allows the effector to rebind and displace the products (ADP analog). We show that cleavage (forward catalysis) and ligation (reverse catalysis) alter the rigidity of the enzyme complex equivalently to binding and dissociation, respectively, but must do so more slowly for effective cycling to take place. Simple designs for synthetic systems that mimic ATPase monomers can be derived from this work.</description>

      <title>Signatures of coherent energy transfer and exciton delocalization in time-resolved optical cross correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate how optical second-order cross correlations witness the quantum features of a prototype donor-acceptor light-harvesting unit. By considering a pair of detuned two-level emitters electronically coupled and incoherently driven to a non-equilibrium steady-state, we gain insight into how electronic quantum properties such as exciton eigenstate delocalization, coherent energy transfer and steady-state electronic coherence, are manifested in the joint probability of emission or optical second-order cross correlation. Specifically, we show that the frequency associated with oscillations present in time-resolved second-order cross correlation functions quantifies not only the time scale of coherent energy transfer but also the degree of delocalization of the exciton eigenstates. Furthermore, we show that time-resolved cross correlations directly witness steady-state electronic coherence. Our work strengthens the idea that measurements of the intensity quantum cross correlations can provide distinctive signatures of the quantum behavior of biophysical emitters.</description>

      <title>Condensation dynamics of sticky and anchored flexible biopolymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cells regulate gene expression in part by forming DNA-protein condensates in the nucleus. While existing theories describe the equilibrium size and stability of such condensates, their dynamics remain less understood. Here, we use coarse-grained 3D Brownian-dynamics simulations to study how long, end-anchored biopolymers condense over time due to transient crosslinking. By tracking how clusters nucleate, merge, and disappear, we identify two dominant dynamical pathways, ripening and merging, that govern the progression from an uncompacted chain to a single condensate. We show how microscopic kinetic parameters, protein density, and mechanical constraints shape these pathways. Using insights from the simulations, we construct a minimal mechanistic free-energy model that captures the observed scaling behavior. Together, these results clarify the dynamical determinants of DNA and chromatin reorganization on timescales relevant to gene regulation.</description>

      <title>Two-photon light-sheet live imaging at kilohertz frame rate using birefringence-based pulse splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiphoton microscopy is widely used for live imaging. However, its acquisition speed remains limited by fluorophore emission rates and photodamage. To increase the pixel rate of a two-photon microscope beyond a few megahertz (MHz), multi-point parallelized schemes have been proposed. Two-photon (2P) light-sheet microscopy emerges as an effective approach for high-speed multiphoton imaging of live specimens, as it enables parallelized excitation while minimizing the required laser power. However, optimizing the signal-to-photodamage ratio in 2P light-sheet microscopy requires to precisely control the illumination parameters, including both wavelength and pulse frequency. Since conventional femtosecond laser sources generally do not allow independent modulation of these parameters, the development of low-cost, efficient and robust strategies to modulate the temporal excitation profile is essential to fully exploit the advantages of 2P light-sheet microscopy. Here, we introduce a compact pulse splitting scheme that meets these criteria. We used cascaded birefringent crystals to convert each excitation laser pulse into an adjustable sequence of collinear sub-pulses. We demonstrate its effectiveness in optimizing 2P light-sheet imaging of live zebrafish embryos. We analyze the impact of pulse splitting on photobleaching, nonlinear photodamage, and imaging performance. Additionally, we demonstrate high-speed 2P imaging of the beating heart and brain calcium dynamics using red fluorophores in live embryos. We achieve kilohertz imaging frame rate, reaching more than 150 MHz pixel rates with fluorescent signal levels above 10 $photons.pixel^{-1}$ using a laser mean power and a peak intensity in the range of 100 mW and 0.1 $TW.cm^{-2}$ at the sample, respectively. This adjustable pulse-splitting scheme allows full advantage to be taken of light-sheet illumination for fast in vivo 2P imaging.</description>

      <title>The Dual Nature of Body-Axis Formation in Hydra Regeneration: Polarity-Morphology Concurrency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20603v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The formation of a body-axis is central to animal development and involves both polarity and morphology. While polarity is traditionally associated with biochemical patterning, the morphological aspect of axis formation remains elusive. In regenerating Hydra tissues, we find that morphological evolution in all tissue samples depends on inherited positional information from the donor axis, and a foot precursor emerges early in the process. From the onset of regeneration, the Ca2+ excitations that drive actomyosin forces for tissue reshaping follow a gradient aligned with the head-foot polarity direction. We conclude that polarity and morphological axis progression occur concurrently through interlinked processes, and that the foot plays a dominant role in this process, a role usually attributed to the head organizer. A simple toy model accounts for the observed regeneration dynamics and illustrates the mechanochemical integration of polarity and morphogenesis. We expect the insights from Hydra to be relevant to broader developmental systems.</description>

      <title>Genesis of a horizontal electric field within the lipid bilayer core and its role in channel gating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15637v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For over a century, the electric field of biological membranes has been regarded as a one-dimensional quantity, defined solely by the component normal to the bilayer (E_VERT). Here, we challenge this conventional view by developing a device that generates a horizontal electric field within the hydrophobic core of a lipid bilayer (E_HORZ). The device incorporates micrometer-scale electrodes embedded within the bilayer's torus, enabling the steady generation of E_HORZ. Applied E_HORZ selectively and reversibly accelerates the slow inactivation of a voltage-gated potassium channel, while leaving activation essentially unchanged. Physical considerations reveal that E_HORZ naturally arises wherever membrane potential varies spatially, such as at the wavefront of an action potential, implying that it is inherent to many physiological processes. This E_HORZ system provides experimental access to fully three-dimensional membrane electric fields, revealing previously overlooked dimension of membrane bioelectricity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12060v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The use of generative machine learning models, trained on the experimentally resolved structures deposited in the protein data bank, is an attractive approach to sampling conformational ensembles of proteins. However, the ensembles generated by these models lack timescale or causal information. We use the structural ensembles generated from AlphaFold2 at a range of MSA depths to parameterize the potential of mean force of an overdamped, memory-free, coarse-grained Langevin equation. This approach couples the AlphaFold2 ensembles to a causal model, allowing us to estimate the timescales spanned by the ensembles generated at each MSA depth. Performing this analysis on six variants of HIV-1 protease, we confirm an inverse relationship between MSA depth and the timescale of an ensemble's conformational fluctuations. The MSA depth essentially serves as a conformational restraint, and AlphaFold2 is generally able to probe timescales at or below those seen in microsecond-long, unbiased molecular dynamics simulations. We conclude by generalizing this approach to other generative structural ensemble-prediction methods as well as co-folding models, in this case the biologically functional HIV-1 protease dimer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12776v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data simulation is limited by classical methods that rely on linear correlations, failing to capture the intrinsic, nonlinear dependencies. No existing simulator jointly models gene-gene and cell-cell interactions. We introduce qSimCells, a novel quantum computing-based simulator that employs entanglement to model intra- and inter-cellular interactions, generating realistic single-cell transcriptomes with cellular heterogeneity. The core innovation is a quantum kernel that uses a parameterized quantum circuit with CNOT gates to encode complex, nonlinear gene regulatory network (GRN) as well as cell-cell communication topologies with explicit causal directionality. The resulting synthetic data exhibits non-classical dependencies: standard correlation-based analyses (Pearson and Spearman) fail to recover the programmed causal pathways and instead report spurious associations driven by high baseline gene-expression probabilities. Furthermore, applying cell-cell communication detection to the simulated data validates the true mechanistic links, revealing a robust, up to 75-fold relative increase in inferred communication probability only when quantum entanglement is active. These results demonstrate that the quantum kernel is essential for producing high-fidelity ground-truth datasets and highlight the need for advanced inference techniques to capture the complex, non-classical dependencies inherent in gene regulation.</description>

      <title>Modeling Diffusion and Permeation Across the Stratum Corneum Lipid Barrier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14606v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Human skin oils are a major sink for ozone in densely occupied indoor environments. Understanding how the resulting volatile and semivolatile organic oxidation products influence indoor air chemistry requires accurate representations not only of their emission into indoor air but also of their transport across the outermost skin barrier, the stratum corneum. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we investigate the passive permeation of acetone, 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one, and water -- two representative products of skin-oil oxidation and a reference compound -- through a model stratum corneum lipid membrane. We determine position-dependent diffusivities using two complementary analyses based on the same set of simulations and evaluate their accuracy through a propagator analysis. The two approaches provide upper and lower bounds for the true diffusivity, which, when combined with previously reported free-energy profiles, yield permeabilities relevant for modeling macroscopic skin transport. Our results show that permeation is governed primarily by energetic barriers rather than by molecular mobility, and that the predicted transport coefficients vary by about one order of magnitude depending on the chosen diffusivity estimator. These findings provide molecular-level constraints for parameters used in indoor air chemistry models and establish a transferable framework for linking atomistic transport mechanisms to large-scale simulations of human exposure and indoor air quality.</description>
