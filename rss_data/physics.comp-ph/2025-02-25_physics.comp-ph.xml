      <title>Convergence of body-orders in linear atomic cluster expansions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the convergence of a linear atomic cluster expansion (ACE) potential with respect to its basis functions, in terms of the effective two-body interactions of elemental Carbon systems. We build ACE potentials with descriptor sets truncated at body-orders $K=2,3,4$ trained on pure dimers, or on large datasets of different diversities but without any dimers. Potentials trained on a more diverse dataset fare better in validation and result in a nontrivial dimer curve, but still very far from the theoretical two-body interaction calculated by DFT. Moreover, dimer curves between descriptor sets clipped at different $K$ do not seem to converge to a universal function for a given dataset. We conclude that machine learning potentials employing atomic cluster expansions optimize losses at low $K$ but fail to generalize and converge properties described by two-body interactions.</description>

      <title>DiffChip: Thermally Aware Chip Placement with Automatic Differentiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiplets are modular integrated circuits that can be combined to form a larger system, offering flexibility and performance enhancements. However, their dense packing often leads to significant thermal management challenges, requiring careful floorplanning to ensure efficient heat distribution. To address thermal considerations, layout optimization algorithms concurrently minimize the total wirelength and the maximum temperature. However, these efforts employ gradient-free approaches, such as simulated annealing, which suffer from poor scaling and slow convergence. In this paper, we propose DiffChip, a chiplet placement algorithm based on automatic differentiation (AD). The proposed framework relies on a differentiable thermal solver that computes the sensitivity of the temperature map with respect to the positions of the chiplets. Regularization strategies for peak temperature, heat sources, and material properties enable end-to-end differentiability, allowing for gradient-based optimization. We apply DiffChip to optimize a layout where the total wirelength is minimized while keeping the maximum temperature below a desired threshold. By leveraging AD and physics-aware optimization, our approach accelerates the design process of microelectronic systems, exceeding traditional trial-and-error and gradient-free methods.</description>

      <title>A new framework for X-ray absorption spectroscopy data analysis based on machine learning: XASDAML</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) is a powerful technique to probe the electronic and structural properties of materials. With the rapid growth in both the volume and complexity of XAS datasets driven by advancements in synchrotron radiation facilities, there is an increasing demand for advanced computational tools capable of efficiently analyzing large-scale data. To address these needs, we introduce XASDAML,a flexible, machine learning based framework that integrates the entire data-processing workflow-including dataset construction for spectra and structural descriptors, data filtering, ML modeling, prediction, and model evaluation-into a unified platform. Additionally, it supports comprehensive statistical analysis, leveraging methods such as principal component analysis and clustering to reveal potential patterns and relationships within large datasets. Each module operates independently, allowing users to modify or upgrade modules in response to evolving research needs or technological advances. Moreover, the platform provides a user-friendly interface via Jupyter Notebook, making it accessible to researchers at varying levels of expertise. The versatility and effectiveness of XASDAML are exemplified by its application to a copper dataset, where it efficiently manages large and complex data, supports both supervised and unsupervised machine learning models, provides comprehensive statistics for structural descriptors, generates spectral plots, and accurately predicts coordination numbers and bond lengths. Furthermore, the platform streamlining the integration of XAS with machine learning and lowering the barriers to entry for new users.</description>

      <title>CardSharp: A python library for generating MCNP6 input decks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A python library for the creation of MCNP6 input decks is described. The library supports geometry generation with automatic assignment of surface/facet numbers, cell numbers, transform numbers and material numbers along with MCNP Universes and FILL feature. Rectangular and Hexagonal Lattices are also supported. A large material library is included. Support for a good selection of common sources and tallies is also provided. Cards or features which are currently not supported in the library can also be inserted as raw strings into the output stream. Combining Python features like descriptively named variables, functions and for loops with library functions provides an intuitive and parametric way to create, modify and maintain complicated geometries and simulation models. The generated card deck also has human readable comments which makes it easy to read and relate back to the python source. Some support for running MCNP, reading tallies and plotting is also provided.</description>

      <title>Application of the Pathline Method to the Aircraft Reactor Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, a new numerical method for the transport of Delayed Neutron Precursors (DNPs) is applied to the Aircraft Reactor Experiment (ARE). The pathline method is based on the Method of Characteristics (MOC) and leverages the pathlines of the liquid nuclear fuel to derive an integral form of the DNPs balance equation. The method has previously been tested on the CNRS benchmark and in a simplified 2D geometry where turbulent diffusivity was significant compared to advection. Here, the pathline method is applied to a real-world Molten Salt Reactor (MSR), the ARE. DNPs transport is implemented in the framework of the coupling between neutron transport solver APOLLO3\textregistered{} and computational fluid dynamics code TrioCFD, both developed at the French Atomic and Energy Commission (CEA). The DNPs concentration obtained with the pathline method were compared with those previously computed by TrioCFD, highlighting the importance of recirculation of fission products. The L-7 experiment was also replicated to demonstrate the method's capability.</description>

      <title>High-Order Modulation Large MIMO Detector Based on Physics-Inspired Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Applying quantum annealing or current quantum-/physics-inspired algorithms for MIMO detection always abandon the direct gray-coded bit-to-symbol mapping in order to obtain Ising form, leading to inconsistency errors. This often results in slow convergence rates and error floor, particularly with high-order modulations. We propose HOPbit, a novel MIMO detector designed to address this issue by transforming the MIMO detection problem into a higher-order unconstrained binary optimization (HUBO) problem while maintaining gray-coded bit-to-symbol mapping. The method then employs the simulated probabilistic bits (p-bits) algorithm to directly solve HUBO without degradation. This innovative strategy enables HOPbit to achieve rapid convergence and attain near-optimal maximum-likelihood performance in most scenarios, even those involving high-order modulations. The experiments show that HOPbit surpasses ParaMax by several orders of magnitude in terms of bit error rate (BER) in the context of 12-user massive and large MIMO systems even with computing resources. In addition, HOPbit achieves lower BER rates compared to other traditional detectors.</description>

      <title>Transferability of vibrational normalizing-flow coordinates: A pathway towards intrinsic coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computing molecular vibrational energies and wavefunctions using variational approaches is a computationally demanding task, with the primary bottleneck being the diagonalization of the Hamiltonian matrix. The achievable accuracy depends on the dimensionality and complexity of the vibrational problem, the number and quality of the utilized basis functions and on the choice of vibrational coordinates. Composing basis sets with normalizing flows is a newly emerged idea to improve their expressivity and subsequently reduce the computational effort of variational methods. This approach generates coordinates tailored to a given vibrational problem for a selected truncated basis. We illustrate that the optimized coordinates results in more accurate predictions and faster convergence when transferred across different basis-set truncations, without the need for re-optimization. In addition, we show that the optimized coordinates are transferable across isotopologues and across molecules with similar structural motifs.</description>

      <title>High-Throughput Computational Screening and Interpretable Machine Learning of Metal-organic Frameworks for Iodine Capture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The removal of leaked radioactive iodine isotopes in humid environments holds significant importance in nuclear waste management and nuclear accident mitigation. In this study, high-throughput computational screening and machine learning were combined to reveal the iodine capture performance of 1816 metal-organic framework (MOF) materials under humid air conditions. Firstly, the relationship between the structural characteristics of MOFs and their adsorption properties was explored, with the aim of identifying the optimal structural parameters for iodine capture. Subsequently, two machine learning regression algorithms - Random Forest and CatBoost, were employed to predict the iodine adsorption capabilities of MOFs. In addition to 6 structural features, 25 molecular features and 8 chemical features were incorporated to enhance the prediction accuracy of the machine learning algorithms. Feature importance was assessed to determine the relative influence of various features on iodine adsorption performance, in which the Henry's coefficient and heat of adsorption to iodine were found the two most crucial chemical factors. Furthermore, four types of molecular fingerprints were introduced for providing comprehensive and detailed structural information of MOF materials. The top 20 most significant MACCS molecular fingerprints were picked out, revealing that the presence of six-membered ring structures and nitrogen atoms in the MOFs were the key structural factors that enhanced iodine adsorption, followed by the existence of oxygen atoms. This work combined high-throughput computation, machine learning, and molecular fingerprints to comprehensively elucidate the multifaceted factors influencing the iodine adsorption performance of MOFs, offering profound insightful guidelines for screening and structural design of advanced MOF materials.</description>

      <title>Exact Nonlinear Decomposition of Ideal-MHD Waves Using Eigenenergies III: Gravity, Generalized Inhomogeneous Quasi-linear PDEs, Mode Conversion, and Numerical Implementation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precise tracking and measurement of the energy carried by the individual magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) modes has important implications and utility in astrophysical and laboratory plasmas. Previously, this was only achievable in limited linear MHD cases in the $\beta \ll 1$ or $\beta \gg 1$ regimes. In a series of papers, of which this is the third, we introduced the Eigenenergy Decomposition Method (EEDM) and derived exact analytical expressions for the modal energy components--called eigenenergies--of nonlinear 3D disturbances governed by the homogeneous ideal-MHD equations. Here, we extend the method to inhomogeneous ideal-MHD by introducing a source term accounting for gravity, and provide detailed guidelines for applying the decomposition scheme to any general inhomogeneous quasi-linear PDEs that possess a globally conserved quantity, beyond the realm of MHD. Furthermore, we show that the eigenenergies can be used to locate and measure nonlinear mode conversions, which is an additional feature of the method. Finally, we provide well-categorized context for the application of the method to simulations and discuss the possible numerical inaccuracies that may inevitably arise due to discretization. This paper provides a more mature description of the method and its interpretation, and is recommended as the starting point for readers unfamiliar with the method.</description>

      <title>A diffuse boundary method for phase boundaries in viscous compressible flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many physical systems of interest involve the close interaction of a flow in a domain with complex, time-varying boundaries. Treatment of boundaries of this nature is cumbersome due to the difficulty in explicitly tracking boundaries that may exhibit topological transitions and high curvature. Such conditions can also lead to numerical instability. Diffuse boundary methods such as the phase field method are an attractive way to describe systems with complex boundaries, but coupling such methods to hydrodynamic flow solvers is nontrivial. This work presents a systematic approach for coupling flow to arbitrary implicitly-defined diffuse domains. It is demonstrated that all boundary conditions of interest can be expressed as suitable fluxes, noting that angular momentum flux is necessary in order to account for cases such as the no-slip condition. Moreover, it is shown that the diffuse boundary formulation converges exactly to the sharp interface solution, resulting in a well-defined error bound. The method is applied in a viscous compressible flow solver with block-structured adaptive mesh refinement, and the convergence properties are shown. Finally, the efficacy of the method is demonstrated by coupling to other classical flow problems (vortex shedding), problems in solidification (coupling to dendritic growth), and flow through eroding media (coupling to the Allen Cahn equation).</description>

      <title>Making Puzzle Pieces Fit or Reshaping MiMiC for Multiscale Simulations with CP2K and More</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: MiMiC is a framework for modeling large-scale chemical processes that require treatment at multiple resolutions. It does not aim to implement single-handedly all methods required to treat individual subsystems, but instead, it relegates this task to specialized computational chemistry software while it serves as an intermediary between these external programs, and computes the interactions between the subsystems. MiMiC minimizes issues typically associated with molecular dynamics performed with multiple programs, by adopting a multiple-program multiple-data paradigm combined with a loose-coupling model. In this article, we present the addition of a new client program, CP2K, to the MiMiC ecosystem, which required a major refactoring of the entire framework and in the end allowed us to unlock its full flexibility. By thorough timing analysis, we verify that the introduced changes do not affect the performance of MiMiC or CP2K, and neither are they a source of significant computational overheads that would be detrimental to simulation efficiency. Moreover, we demonstrate the benefits of the framework's modular design, by performing a QM/MM MD simulation combining CP2K with previously interfaced OpenMM, with no additional implementation effort required.</description>

      <title>Turbulence-Induced Fluctuating Interfaces in Heterogeneously-Active Suspensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of heterogeneous (spatially varying) activity in a hydrodynamical model for dense bacterial suspensions, confining ourselves to experimentally realizable, simple, quenched, activity patterns. We show that the evolution of the bacterial velocity field under such activity patterning leads to the emergence of hydrodynamic interfaces separating spatially localized turbulence from jammed frictional surroundings. We characterise the intermittent and multiscale fluctuations of this interface and also investigate how heterogeneity influences mixing via the residence times of Lagrangian tracers. This work reveals how naturally occurring heterogeneities could decisively steer active flows into more complex configurations than those typically studied, opening up parallels to droplet dynamics, front propagation and turbulent mixing layers.</description>

      <title>Discovery of High-Temperature Superconducting Ternary Hydrides via Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of novel high-temperature superconductor materials holds transformative potential for a wide array of technological applications. However, the combinatorially vast chemical and configurational search space poses a significant bottleneck for both experimental and theoretical investigations. In this study, we employ the design of high-temperature ternary superhydride superconductors as a representative case to demonstrate how this challenge can be well addressed through a deep-learning-driven theoretical framework. This framework integrates high-throughput crystal structure exploration, physics-informed screening, and accurate prediction of superconducting critical temperatures. Our approach enabled the exploration of approximately 36 million ternary hydride structures across a chemical space of 29 elements, leading to the identification of 144 potential high-Tc superconductors with predicted Tc &gt; 200 K and superior thermodynamic stability at 200 GPa. Among these, 129 compounds spanning 27 novel structural prototypes are reported for the first time, representing a significant expansion of the known structural landscape for hydride superconductors. This work not only greatly expands the known repertoire of high-Tc hydride superconductors but also establishes a scalable and efficient methodology for navigating the complex landscape of multinary hydrides.</description>

      <title>Quantum lattice Boltzmann method for simulating nonlinear fluid dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing holds great promise to accelerate scientific computations in fluid dynamics and other classical physical systems. While various quantum algorithms have been proposed for linear flows, developing quantum algorithms for nonlinear problems remains a significant challenge. We introduce a novel node-level ensemble description of lattice gas for simulating nonlinear fluid dynamics on a quantum computer. This approach combines the advantages of the lattice Boltzmann method, which offers low-dimensional representation, and lattice gas cellular automata, which provide linear collision treatment. Building on this framework, we propose a quantum lattice Boltzmann method that relies on linear operations with medium dimensionality. We validated the algorithm through comprehensive simulations of benchmark cases, including vortex-pair merging and decaying turbulence on $2048^2$ computational grid points. The results demonstrate remarkable agreement with direct numerical simulation, effectively capturing the essential nonlinear mechanisms of fluid dynamics. This work offers valuable insights into developing quantum algorithms for other nonlinear problems, and potentially advances the application of quantum computing across various transport phenomena in engineering.</description>

      <title>MetaSym: A Symplectic Meta-learning Framework for Physical Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scalable and generalizable physics-aware deep learning has long been considered a significant challenge with various applications across diverse domains ranging from robotics to molecular dynamics. Central to almost all physical systems are symplectic forms, the geometric backbone that underpins fundamental invariants like energy and momentum. In this work, we introduce a novel deep learning architecture, MetaSym. In particular, MetaSym combines a strong symplectic inductive bias obtained from a symplectic encoder and an autoregressive decoder with meta-attention. This principled design ensures that core physical invariants remain intact while allowing flexible, data-efficient adaptation to system heterogeneities. We benchmark MetaSym on highly varied datasets such as a high-dimensional spring mesh system (Otness et al., 2021), an open quantum system with dissipation and measurement backaction, and robotics-inspired quadrotor dynamics. Our results demonstrate superior performance in modeling dynamics under few-shot adaptation, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines with far larger models.</description>

      <title>PulseBat: A field-accessible dataset for second-life battery diagnostics from realistic histories using multidimensional rapid pulse test</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As electric vehicles (EVs) approach the end of their operational life, their batteries retain significant economic value and present promising opportunities for second-life use and material recycling. This is particularly compelling for Global South and other underdeveloped regions, where reliable energy storage is vital to addressing critical challenges posed by weak and even nonexistent power grid and energy infrastructures. However, despite this potential, widespread adoption has been hindered by critical uncertainties surrounding the technical performance, safety, and recertification of second-life batteries. In cases where they have been redeployed, mismatches between estimated and actual performance often render batteries technically unsuitable or hazardous, turning them into liabilities for communities they were intended to benefit. This considerable misalignment exacerbates energy access disparities and undermines the broader vision of energy justice, highlighting an urgent need for robust and scalable solutions to unlock the potential. In the PulseBat Dataset, the authors tested 464 retired lithium-ion batteries, covering 3 cathode material types, 6 historical usages, 3 physical formats, and 6 capacity designs. The pulse test experiments were performed repeatedly for each second-life battery with 10 pulse width, 10 pulse magnitude, multiple state-of-charge, and state-of-health conditions, e.g., from 0.37 to 1.03. The PulseBat Dataset recorded these test conditions and the voltage response as well as the temperature signals that were subject to the injected pulse current, which could be used as a valuable data resource for critical diagnostics tasks such as state-of-charge estimation, state-of-health estimation, cathode material type identification, open-circuit voltage reconstruction, thermal management, and beyond.</description>

      <title>Robust treatment of finite nuclear size reduces CKM unitarity deficit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the extraction of the $|V_{ud}|$ CKM matrix element from the superallowed transition decay rate of $^{26m}$Al$\rightarrow$$^{26}$Mg, focusing on finite nuclear size effects. We show that the dependence of the decay rate of $^{26m}$Al on its charge radius is 4 times greater than previously believed, so it must be determined with high precision. However, for a short-lived isotope of an odd $Z$ element such as $^{26m}$Al, radius extraction relies on challenging many-body atomic calculations. We performed the needed calculations, finding an excellent agreement with previous ones, which used a highly different methodology. This sets a new standard for the reliability of isotope shift factor calculations in many-electron systems. The $\mathcal{F}t$ value obtained from our analysis is lower by $2.2\,\sigma$ than the corresponding value in the previous critical survey, resulting in an increase in $|V_{ud}|^2$ by $0.9\,\sigma$. Adopting $|V_{ud}|$ from this decay alone reduces the CKM unitarity deficit by one standard deviation, irrespective of the choice of $|V_{us}|</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The continuous effort in making artificial neural networks more alike to human brain calls for the hardware elements to implement biological synapse-like functionalities. The recent experimental demonstration of ferroelectric-like FETs promises low-power operation as compared to the conventional ferroelectric switching devices. This work presents an in-house numerical tool, which self-consistently solves the electrostatics and time-dependent electronic and ionic transport. The tool is exploited to analyze the effect that various physical parameters such as mobility and ion concentration could have on the design of the ferroelectric-like FETs. Their suitability in emulating different functions of the biological synapses is also demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Modelling conductive thermal transport in three-dimensional fibrous media with fiber-to-fiber contacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding heat transfers in fibrous materials, particularly conduction, is a major challenge due to their heterogeneous and multiscale nature, and the unknown contribution of fiber-to-fiber contacts. In most previous modelling studies, the existence of thermal contact resistance is not considered, and the computational complexity often limits the size of simulated samples, which leads to imprecise of inaccurate predictions. The same problem arises when considering electrical conduction through fibrous materials. In this work, we describe a computationally efficient simulation approach based on multi-nodal representation to analyze the steady-state heat conduction through the solid structure in numerically generated 3D nanofiber networks, including contact resistance. We show that the solid conductivity in these networks is governed by a master curve that depends on a single parameter: a characteristic ratio representing the interplay between fiber intrinsic conductivity and contact resistance as well as the influence of other geometric parameters, which numerically validates previous theoretical studies. However, we observe a deviation to this established theory for poorly-connected networks. We derive an expression for a correction factor, considering the influence of correlations between fiber temperatures, and we find then good agreement with our simulation data. Our results demonstrate that the solid conductivity can be fully predicted based on geometric quantities, regardless of the extent of network connectivity, thus generalizing previous studies on this topic. This work, contributing to improve our understanding of conductive heat transport in fibrous media, may prove useful in the development of accurate predictive models and optimization strategies for fibrous insulation materials.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium quantum Monte Carlo algorithm for stabilizer Renyi entropy in spin systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19577v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum magic, or nonstabilizerness, provides a crucial characterization of quantum systems, regarding the classical simulability with stabilizer states. In this work, we propose a novel and efficient algorithm for computing stabilizer R\'enyi entropy, one of the measures for quantum magic, in spin systems with sign-problem free Hamiltonians. This algorithm is based on the quantum Monte Carlo simulation of the path integral of the work between two partition function ensembles and it applies to all spatial dimensions and temperatures. We demonstrate this algorithm on the one and two dimensional transverse field Ising model at both finite and zero temperatures and show the quantitative agreements with tensor-network based algorithms. Furthermore, we analyze the computational cost and provide both analytical and numerical evidences for it to be polynomial in system size.</description>

      <title>Meta-Generalized-Gradient Approximation made Magnetic</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15201v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Jacob's ladder of density functional theory (DFT) proposes the compelling view that by extending the form of successful approximations -- being guided by exact conditions and selected (least empirical) norms -- upper rungs will do better than the lower, thus allowing to balance accuracy and computational effort. Meta-generalized-gradient-approximations (MGGAs) belong to the last rung of the semi-local approximations before hybridization with non-local wave function theories. Among the MGGAs, the Strongly Constrained and Appropriately Normed Approximation (SCAN) greatly improves upon GGAs from the lower rung. But the over magnetized solutions of SCAN make GGAs more reliable for magnetism. Here, we provide a solution that satisfies the most pressing {\em desiderata} for density functional approximations for ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic and non-collinear states. The approach is available in an implementation in the \textsc{Crystal} electronic structure package.</description>

      <title>Efficiency of band edge optical transitions of 2D monolayer materials: A high-throughput computational study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18287v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We performed high-throughput density functional theory calculations of optical matrix elements between band edges across a diverse set of non-magnetic two-dimensional monolayers with direct band gaps. Materials were ranked as potential optical emitters, leading to the identification of transition-metal nitrogen halides (ZrNCl, TiNBr, TiNCl) and bismuth chalcohalides (BiTeCl) with optical coupling comparable to or exceeding MoS$_2$. Despite strong in-plane dipole transitions, most two-dimensional materials underperform bulk semiconductors due to the absence of out-of-plane components. To elucidate interband transitions, we introduced the orbital overlap tensor and established a correlation between anomalous Born effective charges and optical coupling, linking charge redistribution to transition strength. We also identified chalcogen-mediated $d$-$d$ transition as a key mechanism enabling optical responses in transition-metal dichalcogenides. We derived an analytical radiative recombination model incorporating multi-valley effects and found that excitonic corrections are essential for accurate lifetime predictions. Some direct-gap materials exhibit dark excitons as their lowest-energy states, classifying them as quasi-direct band gap semiconductors, which is critical for tuning excitonic recombination dynamics.</description>

      <title>Explain Like I'm Five: Using LLMs to Improve PDE Surrogate Models with Text</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01137v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) is ubiquitous in science and engineering. Computational complexity and difficulty in writing numerical solvers has motivated the development of data-driven machine learning techniques to generate solutions quickly. The recent rise in popularity of Large Language Models (LLMs) has enabled easy integration of text in multimodal machine learning models, allowing easy integration of additional system information such as boundary conditions and governing equations through text. In this work, we explore using pretrained LLMs to integrate various amounts of known system information into PDE learning. Using FactFormer as our testing backbone, we add a multimodal block to fuse numerical and textual information. We compare sentence-level embeddings, word-level embeddings, and a standard tokenizer across 2D Heat, Burgers, Navier-Stokes, and Shallow-Water data sets. These challenging benchmarks show that pretrained LLMs are able to utilize text descriptions of system information and enable accurate prediction using only initial conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05498v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Environmentally-benign, non-toxic electrolytes with combinatorial design spaces are excellent candidates for green solvents, green leaching agents, and carbon capture sources. Here, we examine one particular green solvent, ethaline, a 2:1 molar ratio of ethylene glycol and choline chloride. Despite its touted green credentials, we find partial decomposition of ethaline into toxic chloromethane and dimethylaminoethanol at room temperature, limiting its sustainable advantage. We experimentally characterize these decomposition products and computationally develop a general, quantum chemically-accurate workflow to understand decomposition. We find that fluctuations of the hydrogen bonds bind chloride near reaction sites, initiating the reaction between choline cations and chloride anions. In summary, in the design of green solvents, we do not recommend the use of choline chloride due to its susceptibility to undergo decomposition in strongly hydrogen-bound mixtures.</description>

      <title>Solving Helmholtz problems with finite elements on a quantum annealer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13740v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solving Helmholtz problems using finite elements leads to the resolution of a linear system which is challenging to solve for classical computers. In this paper, we investigate how quantum annealers could address this challenge. We first express the linear system arising from the Helmholtz problem as a generalized eigenvalue problem (gEVP). The obtained gEVP is mapped into quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problems (QUBOs) which we solve using an adaptive quantum annealing eigensolver (AQAE) and its classical equivalent. We identify two key parameters in the success of AQAE for solving Helmholtz problems: the system condition number and the integrated control errors (ICE) in the quantum hardware. Our results show that a large system condition number implies a finer discretization grid for AQAE to converge, leading to larger QUBOs and that AQAE is either tolerant or not with respect to ICE depending on the gEVP.</description>

      <title>Deep Autoencoder with SVD-Like Convergence and Flat Minima</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18148v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Representation learning for high-dimensional, complex physical systems aims to identify a low-dimensional intrinsic latent space, which is crucial for reduced-order modeling and modal analysis. To overcome the well-known Kolmogorov barrier, deep autoencoders (AEs) have been introduced in recent years, but they often suffer from poor convergence behavior as the rank of the latent space increases. To address this issue, we propose the learnable weighted hybrid autoencoder, a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of singular value decomposition (SVD) with deep autoencoders through a learnable weighted framework. We find that the introduction of learnable weighting parameters is essential -- without them, the resulting model would either collapse into a standard POD or fail to exhibit the desired convergence behavior. Interestingly, we empirically find that our trained model has a sharpness thousands of times smaller compared to other models. Our experiments on classical chaotic PDE systems, including the 1D Kuramoto-Sivashinsky and forced isotropic turbulence datasets, demonstrate that our approach significantly improves generalization performance compared to several competing methods. Additionally, when combining with time series modeling techniques (e.g., Koopman operator, LSTM), the proposed technique offers significant improvements for surrogate modeling of high-dimensional multi-scale PDE systems.</description>

      <title>CrystalFlow: A Flow-Based Generative Model for Crystalline Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11693v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning-based generative models have emerged as powerful tools for modeling complex data distributions and generating high-fidelity samples, offering a transformative approach to efficiently explore the configuration space of crystalline materials. In this work, we present CrystalFlow, a flow-based generative model specifically developed for the generation of crystalline materials. CrystalFlow constructs Continuous Normalizing Flows to model lattice parameters, atomic coordinates, and/or atom types, which are trained using Conditional Flow Matching techniques. Through an appropriate choice of data representation and the integration of a graph-based equivariant neural network, the model effectively captures the fundamental symmetries of crystalline materials, which ensures data-efficient learning and enables high-quality sampling. Our experiments demonstrate that CrystalFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance across standard generation benchmarks, and exhibits versatile conditional generation capabilities including producing structures optimized for specific external pressures or desired material properties. These features highlight the model's potential to address realistic crystal structure prediction challenges, offering a robust and efficient framework for advancing data-driven research in condensed matter physics and material science.</description>

      <title>Multi-scale physics of cryogenic liquid helium-4: Inverse coarse-graining properties of smoothed particle hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14244v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Our recent numerical studies on cryogenic liquid helium-4 strongly indicate the features of multiscale physics that can be identified using the Landau's two-fluid model. This study presents the possibility that two-fluid models based on classical and quantum hydrodynamics have a relationship between the scale transformation using filtering in large eddy simulations (LES) and the inverse scale transformation using smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). We show that the spin angular momentum conservation term, which we previously introduced into the two-fluid model as a quantum mechanical correction, formally corresponds to the subgrid-scale (SGS) model, which can be derived from the scale transformation of the two-fluid model from quantum to classical hydrodynamics. Our theoretical analysis shows that solving the two-fluid model based on classical hydrodynamics using SPH can reproduce the microscopic fluctuations even at the macroscopic scale because the truncation errors owing to the smoothing kernel approximation can substitute the microscopic fluctuations. In particular, the fluctuations can be amplified according to the size of the kernel radius at the macroscopic scale. Our further theoretical analysis shows that the Condiff viscosity model can serve as an SGS model and incorporate the quantum vortex interactions into the two-fluid model. Our results and discussion provide new insights into the microscopic composition of the cryogenic liquid helium-4 within a multiscale framework. First, a normal fluid can be a mixture of inviscid and viscous fluid particles. Second, a flow identified as a normal fluid on the microscopic scale because of the presence of molecular viscosity is still classified as an inviscid fluid on the hydrodynamic scale because its viscosity is insufficient to produce eddy viscosity.</description>

Abstract: A symmetric boundary integral formulation for the transient scattering of acoustic waves off homogeneous elastic obstacles is analyzed. Both the acoustic scattered field and the elastodynamic excited field are represented through a direct integral representation, resulting in a coupled system of interior/exterior integral equations that is symmetrized through the introduction of an auxiliary mortar variable. The analysis of each system and of its Galerkin discretization is done through the passage to the Laplace domain, which allows for the use of convolution quadrature for time discretization. Since the operators of the acustic and elastic Calder\'on calculus appear independently of each other, the formulation is well suited for non-intrusive numerical impementations (i.e. existing codes for acoustic and elastic problems can be used without any modification). Numerical examples are provided for two-dimensional examples.</description>
