      <title>Convex bodies with algebraic section volume functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The section volume function $A_K(\xi,t), \ \xi \in \mathbb R^n, \ t \in \mathbb R,$ of a body $K \subset \mathbb R^n$ evaluates the $(n-1)$-dimensional volume of the cross-section $K$ by the hyperplane $\{ x \cdot \xi=t \}.$ We are concerned with the question: can the shape of a body $K$ be detected from an algebraic type of its section function? We prove that among strictly convex bodies $K$ with $C^{\infty}$ boundaries, ellipsoids are completely described by the algebraic equation $qA_K^m+p=0,$ where $m \in \mathbb N$ and $q=q(\xi), \ p=p(\xi,t)$ are polynomials. The result is motivated by Arnold's problem on algebraically integrable domains (which, in turn, has its roots in Newton's Lemma about ovals) and generalizes known results on polynomially integrable domains.</description>

      <title>Riesz energies and the magnitude of manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We relate the magnitude function to Brylinski's beta function of a closed manifold. For compact homogeneous spaces, we show that the residues of the beta function contain the same geometric information as the asymptotic expansion of the magnitude function. For general closed manifolds, we use the recent pseudodifferential analysis of the magnitude operator to show how the two relate to each other via an interpolating polynomial family. Beyond manifolds, the relation with the Brylinski beta function allows to deduce unexpected properties of the magnitude function for the $p$-adic integers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Lonely Runner Conjecture originated in Diophantine approximation will turn 60 in 2028. Even if the conjecture is still widely open, the flow of partial results, innovative tools and connections to different problems and applications has been steady on its long life. This survey attempts to give a panoramic view of the status of the problem, trying to highlight the contributions of the many papers that it has originated.</description>

      <title>The Gauss Image Problem with Weak Aleksandrov Condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.16778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.16778v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a relaxation of the Aleksandrov condition for the Gauss Image Problem. This weaker condition turns out to be a necessary condition for two measures to be related by a convex body. We provide several properties of the new condition. A solution to the Gauss Image Problem is obtained for the case when one of the measures is assumed to be discrete and the another measure is assumed to be absolutely continuous, under the new relaxed assumption.</description>

      <title>The Discrete Gauss Image Problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.16974v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Discrete Gauss Image Problem, a generalization of Aleksandrov's classical question on the existence of convex bodies with prescribed integral curvature. We introduce a combinatorial problem called the Assignment Problem and show its equivalence to the Discrete Gauss Image Problem. We establish sufficient (and nearly necessary) geometric conditions on measures that solve both problems. Additionally, we provide new discrete interpretations of some classical concepts related to Aleksandrov's integral curtvature, such as, for example, connecting Aleksandrov relation to Hall's Marriage Theorem.</description>

      <title>Coarse and bi-Lipschitz embeddability of subspaces of the Gromov-Hausdorff space into Hilbert spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.04730v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we discuss the embeddability of subspaces of the Gromov-Hausdorff space, which consists of isometry classes of compact metric spaces endowed with the Gromov-Hausdorff distance, into Hilbert spaces. These embeddings are particularly valuable for applications to topological data analysis. We prove that its subspace consisting of metric spaces with at most n points has asymptotic dimension $n(n-1)/2$. Thus, there exists a coarse embedding of that space into a Hilbert space. On the contrary, if the number of points is not bounded, then the subspace cannot be coarsely embedded into any uniformly convex Banach space and so, in particular, into any Hilbert space. Furthermore, we prove that, even if we restrict to finite metric spaces whose diameter is bounded by some constant, the subspace still cannot be bi-Lipschitz embedded into any finite-dimensional Hilbert space. We obtain both non-embeddability results by finding obstructions to coarse and bi-Lipschitz embeddings in families of isometry classes of finite subsets of the real line endowed with the Euclidean-Hausdorff distance.</description>

      <title>Probability Metrics for Tropical Spaces of Different Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.02846v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The problem of comparing probability distributions is at the heart of many tasks in statistics and machine learning. Established comparison methods treat the standard setting that the distributions are supported in the same space. Recently, a new geometric solution has been proposed to address the more challenging problem of comparing measures in Euclidean spaces of differing dimensions. Here, we study the same problem of comparing probability distributions of different dimensions in the tropical setting, which is becoming increasingly relevant in applications involving complex data structures such as phylogenetic trees. Specifically, we construct a Wasserstein distance between measures on different tropical projective tori -- the focal metric spaces in both theory and applications of tropical geometry -- via tropical mappings between probability measures. We prove equivalence of the directionality of the maps, whether mapping from a low dimensional space to a high dimensional space or vice versa. As an important practical implication, our work provides a framework for comparing probability distributions on the spaces of phylogenetic trees with different leaf sets. We demonstrate the computational feasibility of our approach using existing optimisation techniques on both simulated and real data.</description>

      <title>On the Non-Flatness Nature of Noncommutative Minkowski Spacetime and the Singular Behavior of Probes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.02479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.02479v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is more than a century-old concept that the Minkowski spacetime is flat. From the pure geometric point of view, we explicitly address the issue of whether a noncommutative Minkowski spacetime is flat or not. In the framework of the twisted-diffeomorphism approach to noncommutative gravity with canonical type noncommutative (NC) coordinate structure, one important result that we get is that the NC Minkowski spacetime parametrized either with spherical polar coordinates or with parabolic coordinates has nontrivial NC corrections to Riemann curvature tensor, Ricci tensor and curvature scalars. Another crucial result is that the curvature scalars have singular behavior at certain points, and these singularities are not coordinate singularities. The nature of these singularities clearly points towards the idea of high-energetic probes turning into black holes. The absence of any such noncommutative corrections, and thus any such singularities, in the cases of Cartesian coordinates and cylindrical coordinates leads to the conclusion that high-energetic probes do not turn into black holes when the canonical NC structure is considered for these coordinates.</description>

      <title>A chiral aperiodic monotile</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.17743v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recently discovered "hat" aperiodic monotile mixes unreflected and reflected tiles in every tiling it admits, leaving open the question of whether a single shape can tile aperiodically using translations and rotations alone. We show that a close relative of the hat -- the equilateral member of the continuum to which it belongs -- is a weakly chiral aperiodic monotile: it admits only non-periodic tilings if we forbid reflections by fiat. Furthermore, by modifying this polygon's edges we obtain a family of shapes called Spectres that are strictly chiral aperiodic monotiles: they admit only chiral non-periodic tilings based on a hierarchical substitution system.</description>

      <title>Korevaar-Schoen $p$-energy forms and associated $p$-energy measures on fractals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13435v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct good $p$-energy forms on metric measure spaces as pointwise subsequential limits of Besov-type $p$-energy functionals under certain geometric/analytic conditions. Such forms are often called Korevaar-Schoen $p$-energy forms in the literature. As an advantage of our approach, the associated $p$-energy measures are obtained and investigated. We also prove that our construction is applicable to the settings of Kigami [Mem. Eur. Math. Soc. 5 (2023)] and Cao-Gu-Qiu [Adv. Math. 405 (2022), no. 108517], yields Korevaar-Schoen $p$-energy forms comparable to the $p$-energy forms constructed in these papers, and can be further modified in the case of self-similar sets to obtain self-similar $p$-energy forms keeping most of the good properties of Korevaar-Schoen ones.</description>

      <title>Tropical Gradient Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19551v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a gradient descent method for solving optimisation problems arising in settings of tropical geometry - a variant of algebraic geometry that has become increasingly studied in applications such as computational biology, economics, and computer science. Our approach takes advantage of the polyhedral and combinatorial structures arising in tropical geometry to propose a versatile approach for approximating local minima in tropical statistical optimisation problems - a rapidly growing body of work in recent years. Theoretical results establish global solvability for 1-sample problems and a convergence rate of $O(1/\sqrt{k})$. Numerical experiments demonstrate the method's superior performance over classical descent for tropical optimisation problems which exhibit tropical convexity but not classical convexity. Notably, tropical descent seamlessly integrates into advanced optimisation methods, such as Adam, offering improved overall performance.</description>
