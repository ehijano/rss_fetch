      <title>Totally Bounded Elements in W*-probability Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of a totally ($K$-) bounded element of a W*-probability space $(M, \varphi)$ and, borrowing ideas of Kadison, give an intrinsic characterization of the $^*$-subalgebra $M_{tb}$ of totally bounded elements. Namely, we show that $M_{tb}$ is the unique strongly dense $^*$-subalgebra $M_0$ of totally bounded elements of $M$ for which the collection of totally $1$-bounded elements of $M_0$ is complete with respect to the $\|\cdot\|_\varphi^\#$-norm and for which $M_0$ is closed under all operators $h_a(\log(\Delta))$ for $a \in \mathbb{N}$, where $\Delta$ is the modular operator and $h_a(t):=1/\cosh(t-a)$ (see Theorem 4.3). As an application, we combine this characterization with Rieffel and Van Daele's bounded approach to modular theory to arrive at a new language and axiomatization of W*-probability spaces as metric structures. Previous work of Dabrowski had axiomatized W*-probability spaces using a smeared version of multiplication, but the subalgebra $M_{tb}$ allows us to give an axiomatization in terms of the original algebra operations. Finally, we prove the (non-)axiomatizability of several classes of W*-probability spaces.</description>

      <title>Saturated Fell bundles and their classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive classification theory for saturated Fell bundles over locally compact groups, utilizing data associated with their base group and unit fiber. This framework offers a unified approach to understanding the structure and properties of such bundles, providing key insights into their classification.</description>

      <title>Trace of Multi-variable Matrix Functions and its Application to Function of Graph Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Matrix extension of a scalar function of a single variable is well-studied in literature. Of particular interest is the trace of such functions. It is known that for diagonalizable matrices, $M$, the function $g(M) = \text{Tr}(f(M)) = \sum_{j=1}^n f(\mu_j)$ (where $\{\mu_j\}_{j=1,2,\cdots,n}$ are the eigenvalues of $M$) inherits the monotonocity and convexity properties of $f$ ($f$ need not be operator convex for $g$ to be convex -- convexity is sufficient). In this paper we first develop the idea of matrix extension of function of multiple variables, study the monotonicity and convexity properties of the trace, and thus show that a function of form $g(M) = \sum_{j_1=1}^n \sum_{j_2=1}^n \cdots \sum_{j_m=1}^n f(\mu_{j_1}, \mu_{j_2},\cdots, \mu_{j_m})$ also inherits the monotonocity and convexity properties of the multi-variable function, $f$. We apply the results to functions of the spectrum of the weighted Laplacian matrix of an undirected, simple graph.</description>

      <title>New Approaches to Complexity via Quantum Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.12887v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Problems based on the structure of graphs -- for example finding cliques, independent sets, or colourings -- are of fundamental importance in classical complexity. Defining well-formulated decision problems for quantum graphs, which are an operator system generalisation of graphs, presents several technical challenges. Consequently, the connections between quantum graphs and complexity have been underexplored.
  In this work, we introduce and study the clique problem for quantum graphs. Our approach utilizes a well-known connection between quantum graphs and quantum channels. The inputs for our problems are presented as circuits inducing quantum channel, which implicitly determine a corresponding quantum graph. We show that, quantified over all channels, this problem is complete for QMA(2); in fact, it remains QMA(2)-complete when restricted to channels that are probabilistic mixtures of entanglement-breaking and partial trace channels. Quantified over a subset of entanglement-breaking channels, this problem becomes QMA-complete, and restricting further to deterministic or classical noisy channels gives rise to complete problems for NP and MA, respectively. In this way, we exhibit a classical complexity problem whose natural quantisation is QMA(2), rather than QMA, and provide the first problem that allows for a direct comparison of the classes QMA(2), QMA, MA, and NP by quantifying over increasingly larger families of instances.
  We use methods that are inspired by self-testing to provide a direct proof of QMA(2)-completeness, rather than reducing to a previously-studied complete problem. We also give a new proof of the celebrated reduction of QMA(k) to QMA(2). In parallel, we study a version of the closely-related independent set problem for quantum graphs, and provide preliminary evidence that it may be in general weaker in complexity, contrasting to the classical case.</description>

      <title>Wasserstein distances and divergences of order $p$ by quantum channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08066v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a non-quadratic generalization of the quantum mechanical optimal transport problem introduced in [De Palma and Trevisan, Ann. Henri Poincar\'e, {\bf 22} (2021), 3199-3234] where quantum channels realize the transport. Relying on this general machinery, we introduce $p$-Wasserstein distances and divergences and study their fundamental geometric properties. Finally, we prove triangle inequality for quadratic Wasserstein divergences under the sole assumption that an arbitrary one of the states involved is pure, which is a generalization of our previous result in this direction.</description>
