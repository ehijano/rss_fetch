      <title>Exploring Group Convolutional Networks for Sign Problem Mitigation via Contour Deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sign problem that arises in Hybrid Monte Carlo calculations can be mitigated by deforming the integration manifold. While simple transformations are highly efficient for simulation, their efficacy systematically decreases with decreasing temperature and increasing interaction. Machine learning models have demonstrated the ability to push further, but require additional computational effort and upfront training. While neural networks possess the capacity to learn physical symmetries through proper training, there are anticipated advantages associated with encoding them into the network's structure. These include enhanced accuracy, accelerated training, and improved stability. The objective of the present study is twofold. First, we investigate the benefits of group convolutional models in comparison to fully connected networks, with a specific focus on the effects on the sign problem and on computational aspects. Second, we examine their capabilities for transfer learning, demonstrating the ability to further reduce training cost. We perform our investigations on the Hubbard model on select low-dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>Isolating the hard core of phaseless inference: the Phase selection formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-valued Phase retrieval is a non-convex continuous inference problem, where a high-dimensional signal is to be reconstructed from a dataset of signless linear measurements. Focusing on the noiseless case, we aim to disentangle the two distinct sub-tasks entailed in the Phase retrieval problem: the hard combinatorial problem of retrieving the missing signs of the measurements, and the nested convex problem of regressing the input-output observations to recover the hidden signal. To this end, we introduce and analytically characterize a two-level formulation of the problem, called ``Phase selection''. Within the Replica Theory framework, we perform a large deviation analysis to characterize the minimum mean squared error achievable with different guesses for the hidden signs. Moreover, we study the free-energy landscape of the problem when both levels are optimized simultaneously, as a function of the dataset size. At low temperatures, in proximity to the Bayes-optimal threshold -- previously derived in the context of Phase retrieval -- we detect the coexistence of two free-energy branches, one connected to the random initialization condition and a second to the signal. We derive the phase diagram for a first-order transition after which the two branches merge. Interestingly, introducing an $L_2$ regularization in the regression sub-task can anticipate the transition to lower dataset sizes, at the cost of a bias in the signal reconstructions which can be removed by annealing the regularization intensity. Finally, we study the inference performance of three meta-heuristics in the context of Phase selection: Simulated Annealing, Approximate Message Passing, and Langevin Dynamics on the continuous relaxation of the sign variables. With simultaneous annealing of the temperature and the $L_2$ regularization, they are shown to approach the Bayes-optimal sample efficiency.</description>

      <title>The anomalously slow dynamics of inhomogeneous quantum annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inhomogeneous quantum annealing (IQA), in which transverse fields are turned off one by one rather than simultaneously, has been proposed as an effective way to avoid the first-order phase transitions that impede conventional quantum annealing (QA). Here we explicitly study the dynamics of IQA, rather than merely the thermodynamics, and find that it is appreciably slower than the phase diagram would suggest. Interestingly, this slowdown manifests both when IQA succeeds in circumventing phase transitions and when it fails. Even in the absence of transitions, such as for the mean-field models that have been analyzed previously, IQA is slower than expected by a factor of the number of spins $N$. More significantly, we show that in non-mean-field models, first-order transitions are likely to be quite common, and the gap at such transitions is not merely exponential in $N$ but exactly zero. Thus IQA cannot reach the ground state on any timescale. Both of these results can be understood through the simple observation that a spin's magnetization becomes conserved once its field is turned off during the IQA protocol.</description>

      <title>Multi-Output Convolutional Neural Network for Improved Parameter Extraction in Time-Resolved Electrostatic Force Microscopy Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time-resolved scanning probe microscopy methods, like time-resolved electrostatic force microscopy (trEFM), enable imaging of dynamic processes ranging from ion motion in batteries to electronic dynamics in microstructured thin film semiconductors for solar cells. Reconstructing the underlying physical dynamics from these techniques can be challenging due to the interplay of cantilever physics with the actual transient kinetics of interest in the resulting signal. Previously, quantitative trEFM used empirical calibration of the cantilever or feed-forward neural networks trained on simulated data to extract the physical dynamics of interest. Both these approaches are limited by interpreting the underlying signal as a single exponential function, which serves as an approximation but does not adequately reflect many realistic systems. Here, we present a multi-branched, multi-output convolutional neural network (CNN) that uses the trEFM signal in addition to the physical cantilever parameters as input. The trained CNN accurately extracts parameters describing both single-exponential and bi-exponential underlying functions, and more accurately reconstructs real experimental data in the presence of noise. This work demonstrates an application of physics-informed machine learning to complex signal processing tasks, enabling more efficient and accurate analysis of trEFM.</description>

      <title>Model-based reconstruction of real-world fractal complex networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a versatile model for generating fractal complex networks that closely mirror the properties of real-world systems. By combining features of reverse renormalization and evolving network models, the proposed approach introduces several tunable parameters, offering exceptional flexibility in capturing the diverse topologies and scaling behaviors found in both natural and man-made networks. The model effectively replicates their key characteristics such as fractal dimensions, power-law degree distributions, and densities. Unlike traditional deterministic models, it incorporates stochasticity into the network growth process, overcoming limitations like discontinuities in degree distributions and rigid size constraints. The model's applicability is demonstrated through its ability to reproduce the structural features of real-world fractal networks, including the Internet, the World Wide Web, and co-authorship networks.</description>

      <title>Disorder-induced instability of a Weyl nodal loop semimetal towards a diffusive topological metal with protected multifractal surface states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05298v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Weyl nodal loop semimetals are gapless topological phases that, unlike their insulator counterparts, may be unstable to small perturbations that respect their topology-protecting symmetries. Here, we analyze a clean system perturbed by chiral off-diagonal disorder using numerically exact methods. We establish that the ballistic semimetallic phase is unstable towards the formation of an unconventional topological diffusive metal hosting topological multifractal surface states. Although, as in the clean case, surface states are exponentially localized along the direction perpendicular to the nodal loop, disorder induces a multifractal structure in the remaining directions. Surprisingly, the number of these states also increases with a small amount of disorder. Eventually, as disorder is further increased, the number of surface states starts decreasing.</description>

      <title>Boundary-driven many-body phase transitions in a non-Hermitian disordered fermionic chain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06160v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian systems exhibit extreme sensitivity to the boundary conditions. The change in the eigenspectrum with tunning boundary parameter is intimately connected to the non-Hermitian skin effect. The single-particle systems are affected by the boundary perturbations; however the interplay of a random disorder potential and non-reciprocal hopping under boundary perturbations of an interacting many-body system is not yet clear. In this work, we examine the boundary sensitivity of a non-Hermitian interacting fermionic system in the presence of a random disorder potential. A non-zero boundary parameter results in real-complex spectral transitions with non-reciprocal (or unidirectional) hopping at weak disorder. While the many-body localization at strong disorder washes away real-complex transitions leading to dynamical stability and real eigenvalue spectrum. We show that the boundary-driven real-complex spectral transitions of the non-Hermitian chain are accompanied by the corresponding changes in the level statistics and nearest level-spacing distributions. The intriguing features of non-reciprocity and boundary sensitivity are further revealed using the averaged inverse participation ratios. Finally, we find distinct behaviour in the quench dynamics of local particle density, population imbalance, and entanglement entropy of charge-density-wave ordered state that corroborate the real-complex and localization transitions. Our results provide a route to understanding disordered many-body systems under a generalized boundary.</description>

      <title>Bond Disordered Antiferromagnetic Quantum Spin Chains with Long Range Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07298v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce and implement a reformulation of the strong disorder renormalization group (SDRG) method in real space, which is well suited to study bond disordered power law long range coupled, antiferromagnetic quantum spin chains. We derive the distribution function of couplings $J$ with corrections to the previously derived strong disorder fixed point distribution, which depend on power exponent $\alpha$ and coupling anisotropy $\gamma.$ As a consequence, the low temperature magnetic susceptibility is found to diverge with an anomalous power law. The distribution of singlet lengths is found to decay more slowly than obtained previously, with consequences for physical properties. The entanglement entropy of a subsystem of length $n$ is thereby found to increase with a power law, rather than logarithmically, corresponding to a subvolume law. While we find no volume law entanglement entropy for the ground state for any $\alpha$, we derive a finite probability that excited states are rainbow states below a critical value $\alpha_c\approx 1.5$, which leads to volume law entanglement for $\alpha &lt; 0.4$, where the rainbow state formation is certain.</description>

      <title>Linear-time classical approximate optimization of cubic-lattice classical spin glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17267v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computing low-energy configurations (i.e., approximate optimization) of classical spin glasses is of relevance to both condensed matter and combinatorial optimization. Recent theoretical work opens the possibility to make its time complexity with quantum annealing generically polynomial, and D-Wave experiments can now achieve approximate optimization of cubic-lattice classical Ising spin glasses with $\sim$$10^4$ spins. It is therefore timely to ask which short-range classical spin glasses are good candidates for demonstrating quantum advantage in the time complexity of heuristic approximate optimization. One intuition is to consider models with very rugged energy landscapes in configuration space. However, here we provide evidence that short-range classical spin glasses may be approximately optimized in linear time and space with a very simple deterministic tensor-network heuristic regardless of ruggedness. On the cubic lattice with up to 50$\times$50$\times$50 spins, we obtain energy errors of $\lesssim$3% for the $\pm J$ model used in recent D-Wave experiments, and $\lesssim$5% for much more rugged planted-solution instances. For cubic-lattice-Ising reductions of unweighted Max-Cut on random 3-regular graphs with up to 300 vertices, we find energy errors of $&lt;$1% and approximation ratios of about 72-88%. A theoretical implication of our algorithm is that only quantum algorithms with sublinear time complexity may have time-complexity quantum advantage for heuristic approximate optimization of classical spin glasses that have decaying correlations. These results inform the search for quantum advantage and suggest an efficient classical method for generating warm starts for other spin-glass optimization algorithms. Our algorithm is amenable to massive parallelization and may also allow for low-power, accelerated implementations with photonic matrix-multiplication hardware.</description>

      <title>Observable asymptotics of regularized Cox regression models with standard Gaussian designs: a statistical mechanics approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13690v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic behaviour of the Regularized Maximum Partial Likelihood Estimator (RMPLE) in the proportional limit, considering an arbitrary convex regularizer and assuming that the covariates $\mathbf{X}_i\in\mathbb{R}^{p}$ follow a multivariate Gaussian law with covariance $\mathbf{I}_p/p$ for each $i=1, \dots, n$. In order to efficiently compute the estimator under investigation, we propose a modified Approximate Message Passing (AMP) algorithm, that we name COX-AMP, and compare its performance with the Coordinate-wise Descent (CD) algorithm, which is taken as reference. By means of the Replica method, we derive a set of six Replica Symmetric (RS) equations that we show to correctly describe the average behaviour of the estimators when the sample size and the number of covariates is large and commensurate. These equations cannot be solved in practice, as the data generating process (that we are trying to estimate) is not known. However, the update equations of COX-AMP suggest the construction of a local field that can in turn be used to accurately estimate all the RS order parameters of the theory \emph{solely from the data}, \emph{without} actually solving the RS equations. We emphasize that this approach can be applied when the estimator is computed via any method and is not restricted to COX-AMP. Once the RS order parameters are estimated, we have access to the amount of signal and noise in the RMPLE, but also its generalization error, directly from the data. Although we focus on the Partial Likelihood objective, we envisage broader application of the methodology proposed here, for instance to GLMs with nuisance parameters, which include some non-proportional hazards models, e.g. Accelerated Failure Time models.</description>

      <title>Bayesian RG Flow in Neural Network Field Theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17538v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Neural Network Field Theory correspondence (NNFT) is a mapping from neural network (NN) architectures into the space of statistical field theories (SFTs). The Bayesian renormalization group (BRG) is an information-theoretic coarse graining scheme that generalizes the principles of the exact renormalization group (ERG) to arbitrarily parameterized probability distributions, including those of NNs. In BRG, coarse graining is performed in parameter space with respect to an information-theoretic distinguishability scale set by the Fisher information metric. In this paper, we unify NNFT and BRG to form a powerful new framework for exploring the space of NNs and SFTs, which we coin BRG-NNFT. With BRG-NNFT, NN training dynamics can be interpreted as inducing a flow in the space of SFTs from the information-theoretic `IR' $\rightarrow$ `UV'. Conversely, applying an information-shell coarse graining to the trained network's parameters induces a flow in the space of SFTs from the information-theoretic `UV' $\rightarrow$ `IR'. When the information-theoretic cutoff scale coincides with a standard momentum scale, BRG is equivalent to ERG. We demonstrate the BRG-NNFT correspondence on two analytically tractable examples. First, we construct BRG flows for trained, infinite-width NNs, of arbitrary depth, with generic activation functions. As a special case, we then restrict to architectures with a single infinitely-wide layer, scalar outputs, and generalized cos-net activations. In this case, we show that BRG coarse-graining corresponds exactly to the momentum-shell ERG flow of a free scalar SFT. Our analytic results are corroborated by a numerical experiment in which an ensemble of asymptotically wide NNs are trained and subsequently renormalized using an information-shell BRG scheme.</description>

      <title>Probing quantum chaos through singular-value correlations in sparse non-Hermitian SYK model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11969v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Utilizing singular value decomposition, our investigation focuses on the spectrum of the singular values within a sparse non-Hermitian Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model. Unlike the complex eigenvalues typical of non-Hermitian systems, singular values are inherently real and positive. Our findings reveal a congruence between the statistics of singular values and those of the analogous Hermitian Gaussian ensembles. An increase in sparsity results in the non-Hermitian SYK model deviating from its chaotic behavior, a phenomenon precisely captured by the singular value ratios. Our analysis of the singular form factor ({\upsigma}FF), analogous to the spectral form factor (SFF) indicates the disappearance of the linear ramp with increased sparsity. Additionally, we define singular complexity, inspired by the spectral complexity in Hermitian systems, whose saturation provides a critical threshold of sparseness. Such disintegration is likely associated with the breakdown of the existing holographic dual for non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <title>Viscous liquid dynamics modeled as random walks within overlapping hyperspheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19952v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The hypersphere model is a simple one-parameter model of the potential energy landscape of viscous liquids, which is defined as a percolating system of same-radius hyperspheres randomly distributed in $\mathbb{R}^{3N}$ in which $N$ is the number of particles. We study random walks within overlapping hyperspheres in 12 to 45 dimensions, i.e., above the percolation threshold, utilizing an algorithm for on-the-fly placement of the hyperspheres in conjunction with the kinetic Monte Carlo method. We find behavior typical of viscous liquids; thus decreasing the hypersphere density (corresponding to decreasing the temperature) leads to a slowing down of the dynamics by many orders of magnitude. The shape of the mean-square displacement as a function of time is found to be similar to that of the Kob-Andersen binary Lennard-Jones mixture and the Random Barrier Model, which predicts well the frequency-dependent fluidity of nine glass-forming liquids of different chemistry [Bierwirth et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. $\mathbf{119}, 248001\,(2017)$].</description>
