      <title>Grading Assistance for a Handwritten Thermodynamics Exam using Artificial Intelligence: An Exploratory Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a high-stakes thermodynamics exam as sample (252~students, four multipart problems), we investigate the viability of four workflows for AI-assisted grading of handwritten student solutions. We find that the greatest challenge lies in converting handwritten answers into a machine-readable format. The granularity of grading criteria also influences grading performance: employing a fine-grained rubric for entire problems often leads to bookkeeping errors and grading failures, while grading problems in parts is more reliable but tends to miss nuances. We also found that grading hand-drawn graphics, such as process diagrams, is less reliable than mathematical derivations due to the difficulty in differentiating essential details from extraneous information. Although the system is precise in identifying exams that meet passing criteria, exams with failing grades still require human grading. We conclude with recommendations to overcome some of the encountered challenges.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the controversy over the time-dependent Aharonov-Bohm effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The time-dependent Aharonov-Bohm (AB) effect considers the situation in which the magnetic flux inside the solenoid changes time-dependently. Different from the standard AB-effect, the problem is unexpectedly subtle and not easy to solve without any doubt, which is the reason why it is still in a state of unsettlement even theoretically. The difficulty originates from the fact that its theoretical analysis requires line-integral along a path in the 4-dimensional Minkowski space. The central controversy concerns the success or failure of the claim by Singleton and collaborators, which states that the time-dependent part of the AB-phase shift due to the magnetic vector potential is precisely cancelled by the effect of induced electric field generated by the time-variation of the magnetic flux. In this paper, we try to demonstrate that their cancellation argument would not be justified by going back to the basic quantum mechanical analysis of the charged particle motion under the presence of external electromagnetic potential. At the end, we conclude that the failure of the cancellation argument is due to unjustified application of the 4-dimensional Stokes theorem to the problem of time-dependent AB-effect.</description>
