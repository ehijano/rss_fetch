      <title>Laws of the iterated logarithm for iterated perturbed random walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We call the random sequence {T_k, k=1,2...} a (globally) perturbed random walk. Consider a general branching process generated by {T_k, k=1,2...} and let Y_j(t) denote the number of the jth generation individuals with birth times less or equal t. Assuming that Var \xi_1 is finite and allowing the distribution of \eta_1 to be arbitrary, we prove a law of the iterated logarithm (LIL) for Y_j(t). In particular, a LIL for the counting process of {T_k, k=1,2...} is obtained. The latter result was previously established in the article Iksanov, Jedidi and Bouzeffour (2017) under the additional assumption that E\eta^a is finite for some positive a. In this paper, we show that the aforementioned additional assumption is not needed.</description>

Abstract: We prove the existence of solution to the following $\mathbb{C}^3$-valued singular SPDE on the 2D torus $\mathbb{T}^2$: \begin{align} \label{CR} \partial_{\bar z} r = r \times \overline{r} + i \, \gamma \, {\mathscr W}, \tag{CR} \end{align} where $\partial_{\bar z}: = \frac12(\partial_x + i \partial_y)$ is the Cauchy-Riemann operator on $\mathbb{T}^2$, ${\mathscr W} = ({\scriptstyle {\mathscr W}_1}, {\scriptstyle {\mathscr W}_2}, {\scriptstyle {\mathscr W}_3})$ is a real 3D white noise on $\mathbb{T}^2$ whose component ${\scriptstyle {\mathscr W}_3}$ has zero mean over $\mathbb{T}^2$, $\gamma: = (\gamma_1,\gamma_2,\gamma_3)$ is an $\mathbb{R}^3$-vector and $\gamma \, {\mathscr W}: = (\gamma_1 {\scriptstyle {\mathscr W}_1}, \gamma_2 {\scriptstyle {\mathscr W}_2}, \gamma_3 {\scriptstyle {\mathscr W}_3})$.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Analysis of the Total Quasi-Steady State Approximation for the Michaelis--Menten Enzyme Kinetic Reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a stochastic model of the Michaelis-Menten (MM) enzyme kinetic reactions in terms of Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) driven by Poisson Random Measures (PRMs). It has been argued that among various Quasi-Steady State Approximations (QSSAs) for the deterministic model of such chemical reactions, the total QSSA (tQSSA) is the most accurate approximation, and it is valid for a wider range of parameter values than the standard QSSA (sQSSA). While the sQSSA for this model has been rigorously derived from a probabilistic perspective at least as early as 2006 in Ball et al. (2006), a rigorous study of the tQSSA for the stochastic model appears missing. We fill in this gap by deriving it as a Functional Law of Large Numbers (FLLN), and also studying the fluctuations around this approximation as a Functional Central Limit Theorem (FCLT).</description>

      <title>Martingale measure associated with the critical $2d$ stochastic heat flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In [CSZ23], the authors proved the convergence of the finite dimensional time distribution of the rescaled random fields derived from the discrete stochastic heat equation of $2d$-directed polymers in random environment in the critical window. The scaling limit is called critical $2d$ stochastic heat flow (SHF).
  In this paper, we will show that the critical $2d$ SHF is a continuous semimartingale. Moreover, we will consider the martingale problem associated with the critical $2d$ SHF in a similar fashion to the super Brownian motion which is one of the well-known measure valued process. Also, we define the martingale measure associated with the critical $2d$ SHF in the sense of [Wal86, Chapter 2].
  The quadratic variation of the martingale measure gives information of the regularity of the critical $2d$ SHF.</description>

      <title>A note on the asymptotics of the free energy of $1+1$ dimensional directed polymers in random environment at high temperature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The author gave the sharp asymptotic behavior of the free energy of $1+1$ dimensional directed polymers in random environment(DPRE) as the inverse temperature $\beta\to 0$ under the assumption that random environment satisfies a certain concentration inequality in [Nak19], \[\lim_{\beta\to0}\frac{1}{\beta^4}F(\beta)=-\frac{1}{6}. \] In this paper, we obtain the same asymptotics without using the concentration inequality.</description>

      <title>Multi-dimensional anticipated backward stochastic differential equations with quadratic growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the general solvability of anticipated backward stochastic differential equations with quadratic growth by relaxing the assumptions made by Hu, Li, and Wen [Journal of Differential Equations, 270 (2021), 1298--1311] from the one-dimensional case with bounded terminal values to the multi-dimensional situation with bounded/unbounded terminal values. Three new results regarding the existence and uniqueness of local and global solutions are established. More precisely, for the local solution with bounded terminal values, the generator $f(t, Y_t, Z_t, Y_{t+\delta_t},Z_{t+\zeta_t})$ is of general growth with respect to $Y_t$ and $Y_{t+\delta_{t}}$. For the global solution with bounded terminal values, the generator $f(t, Y_t, Z_t, Y_{t+\delta_t},Z_{t+\zeta_t})$ is of skew sub-quadratic but also ``strictly and diagonally" quadratic growth in $Z_t$. For the global solution with unbounded terminal values, the generator $f(t, Y_t, Z_t, Y_{t+\delta_t})$ is of diagonal quadratic growth in $Z_t$ in the first case; and in the second case, the generator $f(t, Z_t)+\mathbb{E}_t[g(t, Y_t,Z_t, Y_{t+\delta_t},Z_{t+\zeta_t}) ] $ is of diagonal quadratic growth in $Z_t$ and linear growth in $Z_{t+\zeta_t}$.</description>

      <title>A Polynomial Rate of Convergence for the Dirichlet Problem on Orthodiagonal Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend recent work of Gurel-Gurevich--Jerison--Nachmias (2020) and Bou-Rabee--Gwynne (2024) by showing that as the mesh of our lattice tends to $0$, we have a polynomial rate of convergence for the Dirichlet problem on orthodiagonal maps with H\"older boundary data to its continuous counterpart.
  The key idea is that the convolution of a discrete harmonic function on an orthodiagonal map with a smooth mollifier has small Laplacian and so is ``almost harmonic." This also allows us to show that discrete harmonic functions on orthodiagonal maps are Lipschitz in the bulk on a mesoscopic scale.</description>

      <title>On the weak invariance principle for random fields with commuting filtrations under L1-projective criteria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a field $f \circ T_1^{i_1} \circ \cdots \circ T_d^{i_d}$ where $T_1, \dots , T_d$ arecommuting transformations, one of them at least being ergodic. Considering the case of commuting filtrations, we are interested by giving sufficient ${\mathbb L}^1$-projective conditions ensuring that the normalized partial sums indexed by quadrants converge in distribution to a normal random variable. We also give sufficient conditions ensuring the weak invariance principle for the partial sums process. For the central limit theorem (CLT), the proof combines a truncated orthomartingale approximation with the CLT for orthomartingales due to Voln{\'y}. For the functional form, a new maximal inequality is needed and is obtained via truncation techniques, blocking arguments and orthomartingale approximations. The case of completely commuting transformations in the sense of Gordin can be handled in a similar way. Application to bounded Lipschitz functions of linear fields whose innovations have moments of a logarithmic order will be provided, as well as an application to completely commuting endomorphisms of the m-torus. In the latter case, the conditions can be expressed in terms of the ${\mathbb L}^1$-modulus of continuity of $f$.</description>

      <title>Landscape $k$-complexity of isotropic centered Gaussian fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In large dimension, we study the asymptotic behavior of the mean number of critical points with index $k$ below a level $u$ for an isotropic centered Gaussian random field defined on a family of subsets of $\mathbb{R}^d$ depending  on $d$. We prove the existence of three regimes depending on the speed of growth of the volume the parameter set. In the first regime the mean number of critical points decreases exponentially with the dimension. For the second regime, there exists a critical level $u_c$ such that the mean number of critical points with index $k$ below a level $u$ with $u&gt;u_c$ increases exponentially with the dimension $d$ independently of the index $k$ and decreases exponentially with $d$ when $u&lt;u_c$. In the third regime, there exists a layered structure depending on the level $u$ considered and on the index $k$ of the critical points. This behavior is similar to the one encountered  on the sphere by  Auffinger et al. [5]. In the particular case of the Bargmann-Fock field, only two regimes coexist.</description>

      <title>Approximate Message Passing for general non-Symmetric random matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Approximate Message Passing (AMP) algorithms are a family of iterative algorithms based on large random matrices with the special property of tracking the statistical properties of their iterates. They are used in various fields such as Statistical Physics, Machine learning, Communication systems, Theoretical ecology, etc.
  In this article we consider AMP algorithms based on non-Symmetric random matrices with a general variance profile, possibly sparse, a general covariance profile, and non-Gaussian entries. We hence substantially extend the results on Elliptic random matrices that we developed in [Gueddari et al., 2024]. From a technical point of view, we enhance the combinatorial techniques developed in [Bayati et al., 2015] and in [Hachem, 2024].
  Our main motivation is the understanding of equilibria of large food-webs described by Lotka-Volterra systems of ODE, in the continuation of the works of [Hachem, 2024], [Akjouj et al., 2024] and [Gueddari et al., 2024], but the versatility of the model studied might be of interest beyond these particular applications.</description>

      <title>Concentration inequalities for the sum in sampling without replacement: an approach via majorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $P=(x_1,\ldots,x_n)$ be a population consisting of $n\ge 2$ real numbers whose sum is zero, and let $k &lt;n$ be a positive integer. We sample $k$ elements from $P$ without replacement and denote by $X_P$ the sum of the elements in our sample. In this article, using ideas from the theory of majorization, we deduce non-asymptotic lower and upper bounds on the probability that $X_P$ exceeds its expected value.</description>

      <title>On asymptotic behavior of almost surely extreme values of independent random variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The article studies the almost surely asymptotics of extreme values $\bar{\xi}_n = \max_{1\leq i \leq n} \xi_i$, where $ \xi , \xi_1 , \xi_2 , \ldots$ are discrete identically distributed random variables. One of the main results on this topic is related to the law of the iterated logarithm for the lim sup (LIL) and a law of the triple logarithm for the lim inf (LTL). But, taking into account the specifics of the discrete case, necessary and sufficient conditions are established for $\mathbf{P}(\bar{\xi}_n = a_n +l \quad\mbox{infinitely often} ) =1$, where $a_n$ is some given increasing sequence of integers and $l$ is a fixed integer. Note that in the case of discrete random variables whose distribution tails are close to the tails of the Poisson distribution or fall off even faster, Theorems 1-3 of this article are significantly more informative than LIL and LTL. For the geometric distribution (or discrete random variables whose tails fall off even more slowly), the results are given in Theorem 3 and Theorem B, which are an important complement to LIL and LTL.</description>

      <title>On some properties of probability kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although regular conditional distributions (r.c.d.) are well-defined and widely used measure-theoretic objects, they can violate our intuition from the classical definition of a conditional probability given an event. For that purpose, the notion of a proper r.c.d. has been introduced. Here, we study how properness, viewed as a property of probability kernels in general, is related to stationarity, compatibility, reversibility and totality, revealing the effects these properties have on the structure of probability kernels. As a further development, we consider the inverse problem of characterizing certain classes of r.c.d.s in terms of the above properties. In particular, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions under which, for a given probability kernel, there exists a unique (in some sense) sub-$\sigma$-algebra such that the probability kernel is a proper r.c.d. given that sub-$\sigma$-algebra.</description>

      <title>Moderate deviations of many--server queues, idempotent processes and quasipotentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Large Deviation Principle (LDP) is established for the stationary distribution of the number of customers in a many--server queue in heavy traffic for a moderate deviation scaling akin to the Halfin--Whitt regime. The interarrival and service times are assumed generally distributed. The deviation function is given by a quasipotential. It is related to the longterm idempotent distribution of the large deviation limit of the number-in-the-system process. New results on the
  trajectorial LDP for that process are also obtained. Proofs rely on the characterisation of large deviation relatively compact sequences as exponentially tight ones and use methods of weak convergence and idempotent processes. Another contribution of the paper concerns bounds on the higher--order moments of counting renewal processes.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article is the second chapter of a two-part series dedicated to the mathematical study of the higher-spin symmetry enjoyed by the $\mathfrak{sl}_3$ boundary Toda Conformal Field Theory. Namely, based on a probabilistic definition of this model and building on the framework introduced in the first article of this series, we compute some singular vectors of the theory which at the level of correlation functions give rise to higher equations of motion. Under additional assumptions these become BPZ-type differential equations satisfied by the correlation functions, a key feature in the perspective of a rigorous derivation of the structure constants of the theory. Such equations of motion and differential equations were previously unknown in the physics literature.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Transport Maps in Diffusion Models and Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a theoretical and computational framework for constructing stochastic transport maps between probability distributions using diffusion processes. We begin by proving that the time-marginal distribution of the sum of two independent diffusion processes satisfies a Fokker-Planck equation. Building on this result and applying Ambrosio-Figalli-Trevisan's superposition principle, we establish the existence and uniqueness of solutions to the associated stochastic differential equation (SDE). Leveraging these theoretical foundations, we develop a method to construct (stochastic) transport maps between arbitrary probability distributions using dynamical ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and SDEs. Furthermore, we introduce a unified framework that generalizes and extends a broad class of diffusion-based generative models and sampling techniques. Finally, we analyze the convergence properties of particle approximations for the SDEs underlying our framework, providing theoretical guarantees for their practical implementation. This work bridges theoretical insights with practical applications, offering new tools for generative modeling and sampling in high-dimensional spaces.</description>

      <title>A stochastic gradient descent algorithm with random search directions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic coordinate descent algorithms are efficient methods in which each iterate is obtained by fixing most coordinates at their values from the current iteration, and approximately minimizing the objective with respect to the remaining coordinates. However, this approach is usually restricted to canonical basis vectors of $\mathbb{R}^d$. In this paper, we develop a new class of stochastic gradient descent algorithms with random search directions which uses the directional derivative of the gradient estimate following more general random vectors. We establish the almost sure convergence of these algorithms with decreasing step. We further investigate their central limit theorem and pay particular attention to analyze the impact of the search distributions on the asymptotic covariance matrix. We also provide the non-asymptotic $\mathbb{L}^p$ rates of convergence.</description>

      <title>Infinite Time Horizon Optimal Control of McKean-Vlasov SDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a theory of optimal control for McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equations with infinite time horizon and discounted gain functional. We first establish the well-posedness of the state equation and of the associated control problem under suitable hypotheses for the coefficients. We then especially focus on the time invariance property of the value function V, stating that it is in fact independent of the initial time of the dynamics. This property can easily be derived if the class of controls can be restricted, forgetting the past of the Brownian noise, without modifying the value. This result is not trivial in a general McKean-Vlasov case; in fact, we provide a counterexample where changing the class of controls worsens the value. We thus require appropriate continuity assumptions in order to prove the time invariance property. Furthermore, we show that the value function only depends on the initial random condition through its probability distribution. The function V can thus be rewritten as a map v on the Wasserstein space of order 2. After establishing a Dynamic Programming Principle for v, we derive an elliptic Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, solved by v in the viscosity sense. Finally, using a finite horizon approximation of our optimal control problem, we prove that the aforementioned equation admits a unique viscosity solution under stronger assumptions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the Assouad-like $\Phi$ dimensions of sets and measures that are constructed by a random weighted iterated function system of similarities. These dimensions are distinguished by the depth of the scales considered and thus provide more refined infomation about the local geometry/behaviour of a set or measure. The Assouad dimensions are important well-known examples. We determine the almost sure value of the upper and lower Assouad dimension of the random set. We also determine the range of attainable upper and lower (small) $\Phi$ dimensions of the measures, in both the situation where the probability weights can depend on the scaling factors and when they cannot. In the later case we find that there is a ``gap'' between the dimension of the set and the dimensions of the associated family of random measures.</description>

      <title>A decision-theoretic approach to dealing with uncertainty in quantum mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a decision-theoretic framework for dealing with uncertainty in quantum mechanics. This uncertainty is two-fold: on the one hand there may be uncertainty about the state the quantum system is in, and on the other hand, as is essential to quantum mechanical uncertainty, even if the quantum state is known, measurements may still produce an uncertain outcome. In our framework, measurements therefore play the role of acts with an uncertain outcome and our simple decision-theoretic postulates ensure that Born's rule is encapsulated in the utility functions associated with such acts. This approach allows us to uncouple (precise) probability theory from quantum mechanics, in the sense that it leaves room for a more general, so-called imprecise probabilities approach. We discuss the mathematical implications of our findings, which allow us to give a decision-theoretic foundation to recent seminal work by Benavoli, Facchini and Zaffalon, and we compare our approach to earlier and different approaches by Deutsch and Wallace.</description>

Abstract: We study the graph alignment problem over two independent Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs on $n$ vertices, with edge density $p$ falling into two regimes separated by the critical window around $p_c=\sqrt{\log n/n}$. Our result reveals an algorithmic phase transition for this random optimization problem: polynomial-time approximation schemes exist in the sparse regime, while statistical-computational gap emerges in the dense regime. Additionally, we establish a sharp transition on the performance of online algorithms for this problem when $p$ lies in the dense regime, resulting in a $\sqrt{8/9}$ multiplicative constant factor gap between achievable and optimal solutions.</description>

      <title>Ordering and Convergence of Large Degrees in Random Hyperbolic Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06383v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe the asymptotic behaviour of large degrees in random hyperbolic graphs, for all values of the curvature parameter $ \alpha$. We prove that, with high probability, the node degrees satisfy the following ordering property: the ranking of the nodes by decreasing degree coincides with the ranking of the nodes by increasing distance to the centre, at least up to any constant rank. In the scale-free regime $ \alpha&gt;1/2$, the rank at which these two rankings cease to coincide is $n^{1/(1+8 \alpha)+o(1)}$. We also provide a quantitative description of the large degrees by proving the convergence in distribution of the normalised degree process towards a Poisson point process. In particular, this establishes the convergence in distribution of the normalised maximum degree of the graph. A transition occurs at $ \alpha = 1/2$, which corresponds to the connectivity threshold of the model. For $ \alpha &lt; 1/2$, the maximum degree is of order $n - O(n^{ \alpha + 1/2})$, whereas for $ \alpha \geq 1/2$, the maximum degree is of order $n^{1/(2 \alpha)}$. In the cases $ \alpha &lt; 1/2$ and $ \alpha &gt; 1/2$, the limit distribution of the maximum degree belongs to the class of extreme value distributions (Weibull for $ \alpha &lt; 1/2$ and Fr\'echet for $ \alpha &gt; 1/2$). This refines previous estimates on the maximum degree for $ \alpha &gt; 1/2$ and extends the study of large degrees to the dense regime $ \alpha \leq 1/2$.</description>

Abstract: This paper introduces the class of multidimensional self-exciting processes with dependencies (MSPD), which is a unifying writing for a large class of processes: counting, loss, intensity, and also shifted processes. The framework takes into account dynamic dependencies between the frequency and the severity components of the risk, and therefore induces theoretical challenges in the computations of risk valuations. We present a general method for calculating different quantities related to these MSPDs, which combines the Poisson imbedding, the pseudo-chaotic expansion and Malliavin calculus. The methodology is illustrated for the computation of explicit general correlation formula.</description>

      <title>Entropy Gain and Information Loss by Measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:1908.10364v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When the von Neumann entropy (VNE) of a system increases due to measurements, certain information is lost, some of which may be recoverable. We define information retrievability (IR) and information loss (IL) as functions of the density matrix through VNE to illustrate the relationship between gain and loss. We demonstrate that when a pure, unbiased m-qubit state collapses into a maximally mixed state, it experiences the maximal loss of information and the highest gain in entropy, equivalent to the m-bit classical Shannon entropy. We analyze the VNE, IR, and IL of single qubits, entangled photon pairs in Bell tests, three-qubit systems in quantum teleportation, multiple-qubit systems of GHZ and W states, and two-qubit Werner mixed states, emphasizing their IL dependence on parameters such as polarization bias and qubit count. Data exchange between two observers in Bell tests can recover some of the lost quantum information and eliminate the associated quantum entropy, even years later. The need to recover knowledge explains why no spooky action occurs at a distance. We show that measuring the Bell, GHZ, and marginally entangled Werner states yields the same minimum entropy gain (ln2) and equal minimal information loss (50 percent).</description>

      <title>Depth Patterns and their Applications in Animal Tracking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13532v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a definition of ordinal patterns for multivariate data sets based on the concept of Tukey's halfspace depth. Given the definition of these \emph{depth patterns}, we are interested in the probabilities of observing specific patterns in time series. For this, we consider the relative frequency of depth patterns as natural estimators for their occurrence probabilities. Depending on the choice of reference distribution and the relation between reference and data distribution, we distinguish different settings that are considered separately. Within these settings we study statistical properties of depth pattern probabilities, establishing consistency and asymptotic normality under the assumption of weakly dependent time series. Since our concept only depends on ordinal depth information, the resulting values are robust under small perturbations and measurement errors. We emphasize the applicability of our method by analyzing the depth patterns which are found in seal pubs' movement. We use our approach in order to choose an appropriate model out of a range of two-dimensional random walks, which are commonly used in mathematical biology.</description>

      <title>Bounds on the Distribution of a Sum of Two Random Variables: Revisiting a problem of Kolmogorov with application to Individual Treatment Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08806v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the following problem, proposed by Kolmogorov: given prescribed marginal distributions $F$ and $G$ for random variables $X,Y$ respectively, characterize the set of compatible distribution functions for the sum $Z=X+Y$. Bounds on the distribution function for $Z$ were first given by Markarov (1982) and R\"uschendorf (1982) independently. Frank et al. (1987) provided a solution to the same problem using copula theory. However, though these authors obtain the same bounds, they make different assertions concerning their sharpness. In addition, their solutions leave some open problems in the case when the given marginal distribution functions are discontinuous. These issues have led to some confusion and erroneous statements in subsequent literature, which we correct.
  Kolmogorov's problem is closely related to inferring possible distributions for individual treatment effects $Y_1 - Y_0$ given the marginal distributions of $Y_1$ and $Y_0$; the latter being identified from a randomized experiment. We use our new insights to sharpen and correct the results due to Fan and Park (2010) concerning individual treatment effects, and to fill some other logical gaps.</description>

Abstract: In this expository note, we show that the blow-up arguments of L. Simon adapt well to the corresponding Schauder theory of germs used in the study of singular SPDEs. We illustrate this through some representative examples. As in the classical PDE framework, the argument relies only on the scaling properties of the germ semi-norms and the Liouville principle for the operator.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Non-Parametric Model Learning and Adaptive Control of MDPs with Borel spaces: Identifiability and Near Optimal Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11058v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider an average cost stochastic control problem with standard Borel spaces and an unknown transition kernel. We do not assume a parametric structure on the unknown kernel. We present topologies on kernels which lead to their identifiability and ensures near optimality through robustness to identifiability errors. Following this, we present two data-driven identifiability results; the first one being Bayesian (with finite time convergence guarantees) and the second one empirical (with asymptotic convergence guarantees). The identifiability results are, then, used to design near-optimal adaptive control policies which alternate between periods of exploration, where the agent attempts to learn the true kernel, and periods of exploitation where the knowledge accrued throughout the exploration phase is used to minimize costs. We will establish that such policies are near optimal. Moreover, we will show that near optimality can also be achieved through policies that simultaneously explore and exploit the environment. Thus, our primary contributions are to present very general conditions ensuring identifiability, as well as adaptive learning and control which leads to optimality. Key tools facilitating our analysis are a general measurability theorem, robustness to model learning, and continuity of expected average cost in stationary policies under Young topology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14769v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note I demonstrate that the collection of Dynkin systems on finite sets assembles into a Connes-Consani $\mathbb{F}_1$-module, with the collection of partitions of finite sets as a sub-module. The underlying simplicial set of this $\mathbb{F}_1$-module is shown to be isomorphic to the delooping of the Krasner hyperfield $\mathbb{K}$, where $1+1=\{0,1\}$. The face and degeneracy maps of the underlying simplicial set of the $\mathbb{F}_1$-module of partitions correspond to merging partition blocks and introducing singleton blocks, respectively. I also show that the $\mathbb{F}_1$-module of partitions cannot correspond to a set with a binary operation (even partially defined or multivalued) under the ``Eilenberg-MacLane'' embedding. These results imply that the $n$-fold sum of the Dynkin $\mathbb{F}_1$-module with itself is isomorphic to the $\mathbb{F}_1$-module of the discrete projective geometry on $n$ points.</description>

Abstract: We study a random walk on the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{sl}_2(\mathbf{F}_p)$ where new elements are produced by randomly applying adjoint operators of two generators. Focusing on the generic case where the generators are selected at random, we analyze the limiting distribution of the random walk and the speed at which it converges to this distribution. These questions reduce to the study of a random walk on a cyclic group. We show that, with high probability, the walk exhibits a pre-cutoff phenomenon after roughly $p$ steps. Notably, the limiting distribution need not be uniform and it depends on the prime divisors of $p-1$. Furthermore, we prove that by incorporating a simple random twist into the walk, we can embed a well-known affine random walk on $\mathbf{F}_p$ into the modified random Lie bracket, allowing us to show that the entire Lie algebra is covered in roughly $\log p$ steps in the generic case.</description>
