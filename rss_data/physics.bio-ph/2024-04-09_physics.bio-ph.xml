      <title>The Effects of Splayed Lipid Molecules on Lubrication by Lipid Bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The outstanding lubrication of articular cartilage in the major synovial joints such as hips and knees, essential for the joint well-being, has been attributed to boundary layers of lipids at the outer cartilage surfaces, which have very low friction mediated by the hydration lubrication mechanism at their highly hydrated exposed headgroups. However, the role of spontaneously present lipid splays, lipids with an acyl tail in each of the opposing bilayers, in modulating the frictional force between lipid bilayers has not, to date, been considered. In this study, we perform all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to quantitatively assess the significance of splayed molecules within the framework of lubricating lipid bilayers. We demonstrate that, although transient, splayed molecules significantly increase the inter-membrane friction until their retraction back into the lamellar phase, with this effect more steadily occurring at lower sliding velocities that are comparable to the physiological velocities of sliding articular cartilage.</description>

      <title>EPR-Net: Constructing non-equilibrium potential landscape via a variational force projection formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.01946v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present EPR-Net, a novel and effective deep learning approach that tackles a crucial challenge in biophysics: constructing potential landscapes for high-dimensional non-equilibrium steady-state (NESS) systems. EPR-Net leverages a nice mathematical fact that the desired negative potential gradient is simply the orthogonal projection of the driving force of the underlying dynamics in a weighted inner-product space. Remarkably, our loss function has an intimate connection with the steady entropy production rate (EPR), enabling simultaneous landscape construction and EPR estimation. We introduce an enhanced learning strategy for systems with small noise, and extend our framework to include dimensionality reduction and state-dependent diffusion coefficient case in a unified fashion. Comparative evaluations on benchmark problems demonstrate the superior accuracy, effectiveness, and robustness of EPR-Net compared to existing methods. We apply our approach to challenging biophysical problems, such as an 8D limit cycle and a 52D multi-stability problem, which provide accurate solutions and interesting insights on constructed landscapes. With its versatility and power, EPR-Net offers a promising solution for diverse landscape construction problems in biophysics.</description>

      <title>Switching particle systems for foraging ants showing phase transitions in path selections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01946v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Switching interacting particle systems studied in probability theory are the stochastic processes of hopping particles on a lattice made up of slow and fast particles, where the switching between these types of particles occurs randomly at a given transition rate. This paper explores how such stochastic processes involving multiple particles can model group behaviors of ants. Recent experimental research by the last author's group has investigated how ants switch between two types of primarily relied cues to select foraging paths based on the current situation. Here, we propose a discrete-time interacting random walk model on a square lattice, incorporating two types of hopping rules. Numerical simulation results demonstrate global changes in selected homing paths, transitioning from trailing paths of the `pheromone road' to nearly optimal paths depending on the switching parameters. By introducing two types of order parameters characterizing the dependence of homing duration distributions on switching parameters, we discuss these global changes as phase transitions in ant path selections. We also study critical phenomena associated with continuous phase transitions.</description>
