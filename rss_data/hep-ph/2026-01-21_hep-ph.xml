      <title>Gravitational Baryogenesis from Entropy Production and Parity Violation: A Unified Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a unified framework for gravitational baryogenesis combining two mechanisms: (i) an entropy-clock source that generates a sign-definite baryon chemical potential mu_B proportional to d ln S/dt during irreversible entropy production, and (ii) CP violation from a gravitational theta term theta R Rtilde analogous to the QCD vacuum angle. The entropy-clock evades adiabatic cancellation that suppresses purely oscillatory chemical potentials under smooth freeze-out; we quantify this with a universal low-pass transfer function F(x)=1/sqrt(1+x^2), where x=omega*tau_off. A minimal UV completion via a dilaton coupled to the conformal anomaly yields the entropy-clock coupling with decay constant f_sigma ~ 10^17-10^18 GeV. The theta term provides CP violation through interference between topologically distinct gravitational configurations; we estimate an instanton suppression factor kappa_inst ~ 10^-2-10^-1. The combined mechanism predicts Y_B ~ c*kappa*Pi_eff*epsilon_eff, linking the baryon asymmetry to the reheating temperature, the theta angle, and the entropy-production history. For Loop Quantum Cosmology bounces we derive an analytic expression for the circular polarization of the stochastic gravitational-wave background, with |Pi| ~ pi*|theta| for horizon-crossing modes, potentially testable by future space-based detectors.</description>

      <title>Probing super-heavy dark matter with ultra-high-energy gamma rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We refine the constraints on the lifetime of decaying super-heavy dark matter particles (SHDM), with masses ranging from $10^7$ to $10^{15}$ GeV, by analyzing ultra-high-energy (UHE) gamma-ray data. Our approach involves an accurate comparison of the primary gamma-ray emissions resulting from prompt SHDM decays in the galactic halo with the most recent upper limits on isotropic UHE gamma-ray fluxes provided by various extensive air shower experiments. We demonstrate that a precise consideration of the field of view and the geometric acceptance of different UHE gamma-ray observatories has significant implications for the inferred limits of dark matter lifetime. In addition, we examine the influence of uncertainties linked to the current models of the galactic dark matter distribution, employing diverse halo density profiles while varying both their radial extent and the local dark matter density. Our findings indicate that the newly established UHE gamma-ray constraints are marginally less stringent than earlier evaluations, thereby revisiting the SHDM parameter space and allowing for observable neutrino fluxes.</description>

      <title>Minkowski Space Dynamics and Light-Front Projection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the connection between the four-dimensional Minkowski-space Bethe-Salpeter equation and its light-front projection, emphasizing the implications for bound-state dynamics. Our approach incorporates dressed particles, such as quarks, via the integral representation of the corresponding propagator. We analyze the light-front dynamics of the valence component of the physical state using a hierarchical set of Green's functions, which reveals its coupling to higher Fock components when dressed particles are considered. We also present the light-front Faddeev-Bethe-Salpeter equations for three-body systems with dressed constituents. Furthermore, we discuss formal developments that are central to connecting the three-dimensional light-front dynamics onto the null-plane and the four-dimensional Minkowski-space framework, based on the Nakanishi integral representation. Selected applications to hadron structure are also reviewed.</description>

      <title>Testing a Linear Relation: Short-Range Correlations and the EMC Effect for Gluons and Quarks in Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we focus on the possible linear relation between short-range correlations (SRCs) and the EMC effect for partons in nuclei. First, we test a linear relationship pertaining to gluons in bound nuclei; it is manifested as a correlation between the slope of the reduced cross section ratio in deep inelastic scattering (DIS) and the cross section of sub-threshold $J/\psi$ photoproduction. For comparison, the results from four different global analyses groups of nuclear parton distribution functions (nPDFs) are utilized. These results show a good linear correlation between the gluons in bound nuclei and the slope of the reduced cross section ratio, consistent with the possible presence of nuclear effects in the gluon distributions. Second, we investigate the linear relationship of quarks in the proton-induced Drell-Yan process. The corresponding results for quarks show strong sensitivity to the parameterization forms adopted by the different groups. These findings enhance our understanding of the substructure in bound nuclei and provide valuable reference for future global fitting of nPDFs.</description>

      <title>Examining possible doubly topped baryon configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive theoretical assessment of the masses of possible baryonic configurations characterized by the presence of two heavy top quarks, including $\Xi_{ttu}$, $\Xi_{ttd}$, $\Omega_{tts}$, $\Omega_{ttc}$, and $\Omega_{ttb}$ systems. This analysis is rigorously executed within the specialized framework of two-point $\mathrm{QCD}$ sum rules, focusing on their predicted ground state masses. Our interest in these systems arises from recent CMS and ATLAS reports indicating a pseudoscalar excess close to $t\bar{t}$ threshold. Our evaluation incorporates both perturbative terms and nonperturbative effects, including condensate contributions up to dimension eight. Based on our results, the extracted central masses for all channels are slightly above the sum of the constituent quark masses, which is consistent with the inherent uncertainties of the method. These quantitative predictions provide a useful first-principle theoretical reference, which may help future experimental searches for such heavy configurations at the LHC and inform sensitivity studies at next-generation facilities such as the FCC.</description>

      <title>Prospects for discovering strongly decaying doubly heavy $T_{bc}$ tetraquark states at LHCb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the discovery potential of the $T_{bc}$ states with $J^P = 0^+$ in proton-proton ($pp$) collisions at LHCb at a center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s} = 13~\mathrm{TeV}$. The study focuses on the decay channel $T_{bc} \to B^- D^+$. A phenomenological approach is employed to construct the background model based on the associated production of $B$ and $D$ mesons, incorporating previously published LHCb results. Background processes are simulated using $\texttt{MadGraph5\_aMC@NLO}$ and $\texttt{Pythia8.3}$. We explore the parameter space of the $T_{bc}$ mass, width, production cross section, and the effective double-parton-scattering cross section ($\sigma_{\mathrm{eff}}$) relevant for the $B D$ meson background. The integrated luminosity required for a $5\sigma$ discovery at LHCb is evaluated under various assumptions. We find that a $5\sigma$ observation is achievable for a production cross section of $103~\mathrm{nb}$, which is expected to be within reach during Run~4. In addition, we estimate the minimum observable $\sigma(T_{bc}) \times \mathrm{BR}(T_{bc} \to B^- D^+)$ for a $5\sigma$ discovery under different luminosity scenarios, providing guidance for future experimental searches at LHCb.</description>

      <title>Neutral scalar pair productions through $W$-boson fusion at multi--TeV muon colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Full one-loop electroweak radiative corrections to $\mu^- \mu^+ \to W^\pm W^\mp \to hh$ in the Standard Model are computed for the first time in this work. We then evaluate neutral scalar pair production through vector boson fusion at multi--TeV muon colliders within Two-Higgs-Doublet Model (THDM). In the phenomenological analysis, the enhancement factor, defined as the ratio of the cross sections for SM-like Higgs pair production in the THDM with respect to the corresponding ones in the SM, is examined over the viable regions of the parameter space in the Type-X and Type-Y THDMs. Our findings show that this ratio can reach a factor of $3$ in several regions within the valid parameter space of the Type-X THDM, whereas it ranges from $0.91$ to $0.96$ over the entire parameter space of the Type-Y THDM. Finally, we scan the cross sections for double CP-odd Higgs production over the updated parameter space of the Type-X and Type-Y THDMs. In the Type-Y case at $\sqrt{s} = 10$~TeV with an integrated luminosity of $\mathcal{L} = 10000~\text{fb}^{-1}$, CP-odd Higgs pair production in the $t\bar{t}b\bar{b}$ final state, with subsequent top-quark decays into leptons and bottom quarks taken into account, can be tested with a statistical significance exceeding the $2\sigma$ level at several viable parameter points.</description>

      <title>Open charm production and $\Lambda_{c}^{+}/D^{0}$ ratio in pp and Au+Au collisions at the RHIC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study open charm hadrons production in pp and Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}} = 200$~GeV using an improved a multi-phase transport (AMPT) model. Specifically, we show the transverse-momentum spectra and nuclear modification factors $R_{\mathrm{AA}}$ of $D^{0}$ mesons and $\Lambda_{c}^{+}$ baryons, as well as the $\Lambda_{c}^{+}/D^{0}$ ratio in pp and Au+Au collisions. The results obtained from the AMPT model simulations are compared with the STAR experimental data and found to be consistent. We further investigate the $\Lambda_{c}^{+}/D^{0}$ ratio by evaluating contributions from coalescence, fragmentation, and the combined coalescence+fragmentation mechanisms, and we find that fragmentation alone underestimates the pronounced enhancement in Au+Au relative to pp at low and intermediate $p_{\mathrm{T}}$, whereas the coalescence+fragmentation mechanism reproduces the observed trend significantly better. These results indicate that coalescence plays a key role in charm baryon productions and helps constrain the relative importance of different hadronization mechanisms in the ultra-relativistic nuclear collisions.</description>

      <title>Forbidden dark matter assisted by first-order phase transition and associated gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a simple yet testable framework for light fermion dark matter (DM) with mass in the MeV--GeV range, charged under a dark $U(1)_D$ gauge symmetry. The $U(1)_D$ is spontaneously broken by a scalar field $\Phi$, giving mass to the dark gauge boson $X_D$. The dominant DM annihilation proceeds via a forbidden channel, where the DM pair annihilates into slightly heavier dark gauge bosons and scalars after the dark-sector phase transition. Once the dark-sector phase transition occurs, the induced mass gap activates the forbidden annihilation channel, which in turn determines the DM relic abundance and naturally suppresses late-time annihilation. As a result, the scenario avoids stringent cosmic microwave background and indirect detection constraints that typically exclude thermal light DM. Moreover, the same symmetry-breaking phase transition is strongly first-order, producing a stochastic gravitational wave background that could be probed by upcoming space-based interferometers and pulsar timing arrays. We demonstrate that achieving the observed DM abundance tightly correlates the DM mass with the nucleation temperature of the phase transition. Thus, this setup links the DM relic abundance, dark-sector dynamics, and gravitational wave signals, offering complementary paths for discovery in both terrestrial and cosmological observations.</description>

      <title>Molecular pentaquarks composed of a ground octet baryon and a $P-$wave anti-charmed meson</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the interactions between an excited anti-charm meson doublet $(\bar{D}_1, \bar{D}_2^*)$ and ground-state octet baryons $(N, \Lambda, \Sigma, \Xi)$ with the aim of identifying possible molecular pentaquark states. A systematic analysis is performed within the one-boson-exchange model, which incorporates both $S$-wave and $P$-wave interactions, $S$-$D$ wave mixing, and coupled-channel effects. By solving the Schr\"{o}dinger equations, we can predict a rich spectrum of loosely bound anti-charm molecular pentaquarks with strangeness $|S| = 0, 1, 2$. Our results provide specific quantum number assignments and mass range predictions to guide future experimental searches at facilities such as LHCb and Belle II. The discovery of such states would significantly enrich the hadron spectrum and serve as a critical test of theoretical models for hadronic interactions.</description>

      <title>PDF at small $x$ in the non-perturbative region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parton distribution function (PDF) at small $x$ in a fast-moving proton is investigated within an upgraded parton model that includes parton splitting and fusion. In the region of moderately small $x$, we obtain a power-law behavior of the parton density $x f(x)$ with an exponent proportional to the logarithm of the probability of parton splitting. Taking into account parton fusion leads to a nonlinear equation for the PDF. In the region of very small $x$, the phenomenon of saturation of the parton density is detected and a model estimate of its value in this regime is obtained. The results are compared with those obtained previously based on the analysis of equations in logarithmic approximations of perturbative QCD.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity Analysis of Singlet Vector-Like B Quarks via Photon-Induced Processes at FCC--$\mu p$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a dedicated and systematic sensitivity analysis of a singlet-type vector-like $B$ quark at an FCC--$\mu p$ collider with a center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s}=24.5~\mathrm{TeV}$ via photon-induced production mechanisms. The analyses are based on the $B \to Zb$ decay and the lepton decay of the $Z$ boson on a clean and selective final state. In this regard, we observed that the applied kinematic cuts suppress the Standard Model backgrounds by several orders of magnitude while maintain high signal efficiency. Also, the obtained results show that for $\mathcal{L}=1000~\mathrm{fb^{-1}}$, even small coupling constant values in the mass range $M_B = 2$--$3$~TeV are accessible. In this context, an exclusion limit of $g^\ast \simeq 0.12$--$0.17$ at 95\% confidence level and a sensitivity in the range of $g^\ast \simeq 0.22$--$0.30$ for the $5\sigma$ discovery region are obtained. Moreover, the calculations indicate that scenarios with smaller ${\rm BR}(B\to Zb)$ values via increasing integrated luminosity values can be experimentally tested. As a result, the outputs of the study show that the FCC--$\mu p$ environment offers a unique and powerful discovery potential for vector-like quark searches that go beyond the current LHC limits and complement the decreasing sensitivity of the ep and $e^+e^-$ colliders in the high-mass regime. In this context, the findings suggest that the $\mu p$ colliders can be considered not only as a complementary option for the search of heavy new particles in the future accelerator programme, but also as a strategic discovery tool.</description>

      <title>QCD-Like Theories with Different Color Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum chromodynamics (QCD) with a general number of colors, $\Nc$, provides a powerful theoretical laboratory to explore the dynamics of non-Abelian gauge theories. Although $\Nc =3$ does not look a large number, the $1/\Nc$ expansion provides us with a very useful classification and book-keeping scheme for hadronic processes and sharpens conceptions otherwise obscured in real-world QCD with $\Nc = 3$. Important applications are dense QCD matter where the first principle methods for QCD are not available and many conceptual issues remain to be clarified. In this chapter we first review hadrons at large $\Nc$ from the viewpoint of quark-gluon dynamics, and then extend the discussions to hot/dense matter, focusing on confinement-deconfinement aspects. We emphasize how the large-$\Nc$ limit provides a unified organizing principle for hadronic and quark degrees of freedom in regimes where first-principle methods are limited. Two-color and isospin QCD, for which lattice simulations at finite density can be performed for a special reason, is reviewed.</description>

      <title>Investigation of deuteron-like singly bottomed dibaryon resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a systematical investigation of the existence of the deuteron-like singly bottomed dibaryon resonance states with strangeness $S=-1,~-3,~-5$ in the chiral quark model. Two resonance states with strangeness $S=-1$ are obtained in the baryon-baryon scattering process. The first candidate is $\Sigma\Sigma_b$ in the $\Lambda\Lambda_b$ and $N\Xi_b^*$ scattering process, with the resonance energy 6974.22 MeV - 6975.37 MeV and the decay width 14.450 MeV, respectively; the other one is $\Sigma \Sigma_b^*$ in the $N\Xi_b$ and $N\Xi'_b$ scattering process, with the resonance energy 6990.69 MeV - 7008.37 MeV and the decay width 43.790 MeV, respectively. The Root Mean Square (RMS) radius calculation shows that the former tends to be in a compact structure, while the latter tends to be in a molecular structure. Both of these resonance states are worthy of experimental exploration. Furthermore, it should be emphasized that the effect of channel-coupling is of great importance in exploring exotic hadron states, and investigating the scattering process may serve as an effective approach to identifying genuine resonances.</description>

      <title>Search for the low-lying excited baryon $\Sigma^*(1/2^-)$ through process $\Lambda^+_c \to \Lambda K^0 \pi^+$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by recent BESIII measurements of the singly Cabibbo-suppressed processes $\Lambda^+_c \to \Lambda K^+ \pi^0$ and $\Lambda^+_c \to \Lambda K_S^0 \pi^+$, we investigate the process $\Lambda^+_c \to \Lambda K^0 \pi^+$ by taking into account the contribution from the low-lying excited baryon $\Sigma^*(1/2^-)$, dynamically generated via the $S$-wave pseudoscalar meson-octet baryon interaction, as well as from the intermediate resonances $K^*(892)$ and $N(1535)$. Our model successfully reproduces the BESIII $\pi^+K^0$ invariant mass distribution, and predicts a distinct cusp structure around 1.43~GeV in the $\pi^+\Lambda$ invariant mass distribution, which is associated with the predicted $\Sigma^*(1/2^-)$. Future high-precise measurements of this process at BESIII, Belle~II, and the proposed Super Tau-Charm Facility experiments will be crucial for testing the existence of $\Sigma^*(1/2^-)$ and advancing our understanding of the light baryon spectrum.</description>

      <title>Can a pseudoscalar with a mass of 365 GeV in the 2HDM explain the CMS $t\bar{t}$ excess?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the CMS-reported t tbar excess within conventional Two-Higgs-Doublet Models of Types I, II, X, and Y, using the best-fit pseudoscalar parameters MA = 365 GeV, GammaA over MA = 2 percent, and tan beta = 1.28. Applying theoretical and experimental constraints, including stability, unitarity, perturbativity, flavor constraints, and collider bounds, we find that perturbativity limits the charged and heavy neutral Higgs masses to below about 723 GeV. Flavor constraints exclude Types II and Y, while the remaining parameter space in Types I and X is ruled out by recent t tbar Z measurements from ATLAS and CMS. We conclude that conventional Two-Higgs-Doublet Models cannot explain the observed t tbar excess, although toponium effects in the background modeling may modify this conclusion.

      <title>Pseudoscalar meson $P\to \tau (\to \pi \nu_\tau, \rho \nu_\tau, \ell \bar{\nu}_\ell \nu_\tau) \bar{\nu}_\tau$ decays in the Standard Model and beyond</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we have conducted a comprehensive and systematic theoretical investigation of the full cascade decays of charged pseudoscalar mesons, specifically $D_s$, $D$, $B$, and $B_c$, into $\tau \nu_\tau$, followed by the subsequent decay of the $\tau$ via its dominant experimentally reconstructible channels: $\tau \to \pi \nu_\tau$, $\tau \to \rho \nu_\tau$, $\tau \to e \bar\nu_e \nu_\tau$, and $\tau \to \mu \bar\nu_\mu \nu_\tau$. Our study is framed within the model-independent low-energy effective field theory approach, which incorporates the most general set of four-fermion operators, including those coupling to right-handed neutrinos. We provide precise Standard Model predictions for differential decay rate as a function of the final-state charged particle energy, develop an innovative and robust methodology for extracting the magnitudes of the new physics couplings using energy moments, and identify and characterize fixed points in the normalized energy distributions. The fixed points are invariant under new physics contributions described by the considered effective Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Quark sector effects and glueball mass sensitivity estimates in Lorentz-violating supersymmetric QCD-like theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $N=1$ supersymmetric Yang--Mills--Carroll--Field--Jackiw (SYM--CFJ) model is extended to include the quark sector of supersymmetric quantum chromodynamics (SQCD) in the presence of Lorentz--symmetry violation (LSV). The Lorentz--violating data are carried by a spurion chiral superfield whose components define a purely spacelike background vector $v_\mu$ and fermionic bilinears, inducing a topological mass scale in the gauge sector. Working within a spurion effective field theory (EFT) and a small--LSV expansion, we classify the allowed parametric dependence of glueball observables on the induced mass scales. Using lattice Yang--Mills (YM) glueball masses only as a reference hadronic scale, we provide parametric sensitivity estimates and naturalness ranges for the topological mass $|v|$ relative to $\Lambda_{\rm YM}$.</description>

      <title>Vacuum Decay Rate in D-dimensional Electroweak theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic framework for calculating the vacuum decay rate in D-dimensional electroweak theories, providing a unified treatment of quantum fluctuations for scalar, fermion, and gauge boson fields via a combined WKB expansion and dimensional regularization. This method ensures rapid convergence even at large angular momenta. Application to a $D=4$ standard model effective field theory gives $\log_{10}(\gamma \times \text{Gyr} \times \text{Gpc}^3)=183$. In the finite-temperature, dimensionally reduced standard model effective field theory with $D=3$, the values are $\log_{10}(\Gamma_T \times \text{Gyr} \times \text{Gpc}^3)=42.4$ at tree level and $116.1$ at two-loop order. The approach offers a general and efficient tool for analyzing vacuum stability and decay across dimensions.</description>

      <title>Heavy Quarks in the initial stages of Proton-Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collisions among heavy ions, like Pb or Au, are a great tool to study the theory of strong interactions, that is Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). In particular, these experiments are able to give insights on all the complex phases of matter that the theory of QCD allows. In this PhD Thesis we have investigated the initial stages of proton-ion collisions: in particular, we will focus on the first $\sim 0.4$ fm/c ($\sim 10^{-24}$ s) after the collision, which are dominated by very intense gluon fields, in a state called glasma. We investigated the effect of such fields on the dynamics of heavy quarks (charm and beauty) which are created and evolve in this medium. The effect of the initial gluon fields on heavy quarks is quite substantial, in particular we observe that the glasma provokes a $50\%$ dissociation rate on quark-antiquark pairs. Moreover, glasma fields have a large momentum anisotropy, and transmit a large part of such anisotropy to the heavy quarks which evolve in this medium. Finally, we have generalized our study to a non-boost invariant medium, and shown that fluctuations in rapidity do not lead to significant isotropization within glasma timescales.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Singlet Fermion Dark Matter with a Scalar Portal: Connecting Higgs Phenomenology and Strong Electroweak Phase Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a minimal extension of the Standard Model with a real singlet scalar and a singlet Dirac fermion acting as dark matter. Unlike a conventional singlet scalar setup, we assume that the singlet scalar does not acquire a vacuum expectation value at zero temperature. This decouples the scalar mixing angle from the Higgs-portal quartic coupling responsible for the strong first-order electroweak phase transition, allowing it to coexist with current collider and direct-detection constraints. The Higgs-singlet mixing is generated independently through a trilinear portal interaction. We check theoretical consistency conditions, various LHC limits on heavy scalar resonances, dark matter relic abundance, and direct detection bounds to delineate the viable parameter space. We perform a state-of-the-art analysis of the electroweak phase transition, which is shown to be achieved for a few benchmark points. We further compute the resulting stochastic gravitational wave spectra and find that several scenarios yield signals potentially observable at future space-based interferometers. Our results establish a unified and testable framework that connects collider phenomenology, first-order electroweak phase transition, and the resulting production of gravitational waves, along with the dark matter phenomenology, all within a simple renormalizable extension of the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Constraining the Higgs potential using multi-Higgs production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Higgs self-couplings remain only weakly constrained by current Large Hadron Collider (LHC) measurements, leaving ample room for physics beyond the Standard Model that could modify the structure of the Higgs potential. Multi-Higgs production processes provide a particularly sensitive probe of deviations in both the Higgs trilinear and quartic self-couplings. In this note, we summarize the current status of next-to-leading-order electroweak (EW) corrections to double-Higgs production computed within the Standard Model Effective Field Theory and Higgs Effective Field Theory frameworks, emphasizing how these calculations introduce sensitivity to the Higgs self-couplings beyond what is accessible at leading order. We discuss the key conceptual and technical differences between the two effective field theory approaches, including their treatment of higher-dimensional operators, renormalization procedures, and the structure of EW two-loop amplitudes. Despite these differences, both approaches yield broadly consistent constraints, illustrating the complementarity of double- and triple-Higgs measurements. With the high-luminosity LHC and future high-energy colliders on the horizon, these developments and further advances provide an essential foundation for extracting increasingly precise information on the dynamics of EW symmetry breaking.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scaling laws describing the dependence of neural network performance on the amount of training data, the spent compute, and the network size have emerged across a huge variety of machine learning task and datasets. In this work, we systematically investigate these scaling laws in the context of amplitude surrogates for particle physics. We show that the scaling coefficients are connected to the number of external particles of the process. Our results demonstrate that scaling laws are a useful tool to achieve desired precision targets.</description>

      <title>Bottom-up approach to describe groomed jet data in heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theoretical interpretation of jet observables in heavy-ion collisions is a complex task due to the intricate interplay of perturbative and non-perturbative effects. One way to reduce this complexity is to groom away soft, wide-angle radiation so that perturbative dynamics dominates. Even in this simplified scenario, there are competing explanations for the physical origin of the measured medium-induced modifications. In this paper, we present a minimal approach to compute groomed substructure observables. The core idea is to treat medium effects as an effective energy shift of the hard, vacuum-like substructure. This energy shift includes a gradual onset of colour decoherence effects and thus depends on the jet substructure itself. We first study a NLO-exact dijet configuration in vacuum and apply radiative energy-loss to the two subjets. We find that this minimal setup already captures the narrowing trend of groomed observables but it's not able to quantitatively describe the existing data. Next, we match the NLO matrix-element to a leading-logarithm accurate parton shower and perform a clustering algorithm to recover a two-prong system to which we again apply the energy-loss distribution. Despite its simplicity, the model results in a very good theory-to-data agreement (within $10\%$) for a broad range of observables including both ALICE and ATLAS kinematics. We also examine the discriminating power of groomed jet data in terms of colour decoherence effects and find that substructure-dependent energy loss yields an overall better agreement.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the framework of the extra-dimensional Randall-Sundrum set-up, we investigate the freeze-in production of Standard Model (SM) gauge-singlet scalar, fermionic, and massive vector dark matter (DM). Assuming that both the DM and SM fields reside on the IR brane and interact solely through the graviton and radion, we demonstrate that the observed DM relic abundance measured by Planck can be achieved across a wide range of reheating temperatures, all while naturally addressing the hierarchy problem, satisfying constraints from collider, early Universe cosmology including $\Delta{N}_{\rm eff}$. We further show that the same set-up can accommodate TeV-scale leptogenesis capable of generating the observed baryon asymmetry of the Universe. Remarkably, we find that current graviton searches at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) already impose strong constraints on the reheating temperature in this scenario.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the standard framework in which electroweak sphaleron processes relate lepton and baryon number, we derive an upper limit on the amplitude of a chiral gravitational wave background produced prior to the electroweak epoch. This bound is independent of the production time of chiral GWs for superhorizon modes, while it becomes sensitive to the production time for subhorizon modes. For sufficiently high reheating temperatures, the bound becomes significantly more stringent than the conventional big bang nucleosynthesis constraints at frequencies above the MHz scale, thereby providing a powerful and \emph{model-independent} probe of parity-violating physics in the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative flavor asymmetry in the nucleon and deuteron: The light-front Hamiltonian effective field theory approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate non-perturbative multi-pion contributions to nucleon flavor asymmetry within the framework of Light-Front Hamiltonian Effective Field Theory (LFHEFT). Utilizing a Fock sector expansion, we systematically incorporate pionic degrees of freedom, with the nucleon-pion interactions governed by a scalar variant of chiral effective field theory. Our results demonstrate that the non-perturbatively calculated longitudinal momentum distributions exhibit significant deviations from leading-order perturbative predictions, emphasizing the importance of higher-order Fock components in describing the proton's sea quark structure. Furthermore, we demonstrate the feasibility of extending this framework to investigate nuclear effects in light nuclei, such as the deuteron. This unified approach provides a consistent basis for analyzing the interplay between intrinsic nucleon structure and nuclear modifications, potentially offering new insights into the flavor asymmetry observed in fixed-target and collider experiments.</description>

      <title>Discrimination of $H\rightarrow Z\gamma\rightarrow \ell^{+}\ell^{-}\gamma$ from $Z/\gamma^*$ Processes Using Kinematically Correlated Observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At LHC energies, the Drell--Yan ($Z/\gamma^{*}$) processes have a substantially large cross section. Their di-lepton ($\ell^+\ell^-$) final state contributes significantly to many resonant signal regions, making them one of the dominant backgrounds in numerous physics analyses. The study focuses on improving the discrimination and suppression of the $Z/\gamma^{*} \rightarrow \ell^{+}\ell^{-}$ background from the $H \rightarrow Z\gamma \rightarrow \ell^{+}\ell^{-}\gamma$ signal at $\sqrt{s}=13~\text{TeV}$ by leveraging Monte Carlo simulated data. The analysis introduces physics-motivated correlated observables derived from the two-dimensional $(P_{\mathrm{Higgs}}, \theta_{Z\gamma})$ plane. These observables encode differences in angular and momentum information to enhance signal--background separation while maintaining high signal efficiency. We present a multivariate analysis (MVA) employing a Boosted Decision Tree (XGBoost) classifier. By incorporating additional physics-motivated correlated observables, the classifier achieves measurable improvements in performance. A significant increase in the area under the ROC curve (AUC) is observed in both the electron and muon channels, demonstrating the effectiveness of the expanded feature set. Further, optimised background rejection using $(P_{\mathrm{Higgs}}, \theta_{Z\gamma})$ plane increases the signal-to-background ratio to 2.1\% and 3.4\% for the electron and muon channel respectively near the Higgs mass. This work demonstrates that combining kinematic correlations with interpretable multivariate techniques leads to improved sensitivity and robust background rejection. The approach is flexible and can be readily applied to a wide range of analyses, including rare Higgs decays, resonant searches, and studies beyond the Standard Model.</description>

In addition to $N(1535)$, our model incorporates contributions from other intermediate resonances including $N(1650)$, $K^*(892)$, $K_0^*(1430)$, $N(1440)$, and $\Sigma(1750)$. The calculated invariant mass distributions and Dalitz plot are in good agreement with the recent Belle measurements. Our analysis highlights the crucial role of $N(1535)$ state in this decay channel and supports its interpretation as a dynamically generated state arising from coupled-channel meson-baryon interactions.</description>

      <title>Quantum Encoding Framework for Leptophilic Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic quantum encoding framework for leptophilic extensions of the Standard Model, tailored to quantum simulation applications on near term and future quantum devices. Focusing on anomaly free $U(1)'_{\ell}$ gauge theories, we show that the leptonic charge structure admits a natural and scalable representation on qubit registers, where gauge symmetries and anomaly cancellation conditions are enforced directly at the level of quantum states. Within this framework, gauge invariant operators are mapped to unitary quantum circuits, ensuring the preservation of gauge symmetry under quantum evolution. As a proof of principle, we construct explicit circuits that encode scattering processes mediated by a leptophilic gauge boson $Z'_{\ell}$. Our results establish a reusable bridge between beyond the Standard Model gauge theories and quantum information science, providing a concrete pathway for simulating leptophilic gauge sectors within emerging quantum computing architectures.</description>

      <title>Structure of Bound States with Coulomb plus Short-range Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the structure of bound states appearing in systems governed by the Coulomb and short-range interactions. We analyze the binding energies and wave functions of the bound states generated by the Coulomb plus short-range potential. We demonstrate that Coulomb-induced shifts of the binding energy are closely correlated with the spatial distribution of the wave function. Furthermore, we show that the asymptotic behavior of wave functions of weakly bound states is qualitatively altered by Coulomb repulsion, leading to a modification of the near-threshold mass scaling that is otherwise universal for short-range interactions.</description>

      <title>The dynamically generated $h_1$ state by the $K^*\bar{K}^*$ interaction and its $K_1(1270)\bar{K}$ and $b_1(1235)\pi$ decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamically generated $h_1$ state with spin-parity $J^P = 1^+$ and a mass around 1790~MeV, arising from the $K^* \bar{K}^*$ interaction within the chiral unitary approach. The partial decay widths into the $K_1(1270)\bar{K}$ and $b_1(1235)\pi$ channels are calculated via a triangular loop mechanism. In this mechanism, the $h_1$ state couples to $K^* \bar{K}^*$, and final-state interactions between $K^*$ and $\bar{K}^*$ proceed through pseudoscalar-meson exchange, leading to the final states $\bar{K}$ (or $\pi$) and $K_1(1270)$ [or $b_1(1235)$]. We also present the invariant mass distributions of a vector meson and a pseudoscalar meson originating from the decays of $K_1(1270)$ or $b_1(1235)$, along with the corresponding decay widths. Our results show that these decay widths are all of the order of a few MeV. We hope that future experiments can test the predictions presented here, thereby helping to identify this $h_1$ state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the 1-loop $\gamma Z$ box-graph correction to electron-quark scattering at low energy and low momentum transfer. Both electron and quark masses are kept non-zero. From our result, we extract coupling constants for the low-energy effective Lagrangian with parity-violating 4-fermion interaction terms. We study the zero-mass limits and show that a non-zero electron mass is sufficient to obtain finite, well-defined couplings which are insensitive to a hadronic mass cutoff. We finally discuss the impact of our results on the determination of the weak charge of the proton from polarized electron-proton scattering.</description>

      <title>The Dead Cone Effect in Heavy-Quark Jets: A Unified Study from Charm and Bottom to Top</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a unified overview of recent progress in the study of QCD radiation in heavy-quark jets, focusing on the dead-cone effect. Using precision data from LEP at $\sqrt{s}=91.2$~GeV, we demonstrate strong momentum-space suppression in charm and bottom quark jets, supported by Monte Carlo simulations with \textsc{Pythia}8, and provide a quantitative interpretation within the Modified Leading Logarithmic Approximation (MLLA) of perturbative QCD. We then extend the analysis to top-quark jets at $\sqrt{s}=1$~TeV, where finite lifetime effects and decay radiation introduce new conceptual challenges. A new method is presented to isolate the top-quark dead cone by separating production and decay radiation, and it is validated at both parton and hadron level using \textsc{Pythia}8. Together, these results establish a coherent framework for testing QCD radiation dynamics across all three heavy quarks.</description>

      <title>The gradient-flow coupling of three-and four-dimensional QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We evaluate the QED coupling in the gradient-flow scheme in three and four space-time dimensions. Our general result applies to any theory with a U(1) gauge field coupled to arbitary other fields via arbitrary interactions. As an example, we consider QED with $n_\text{f}$ flavors in three and four space-time dimensions and evaluate the corresponding $\beta$ functions. In four dimensions, we find that the perturbative expansion of the $\beta$ function behaves much better than the corresponding expression in QCD. In three dimensions, we recover both the ultraviolet as well as the infrared fixed points of the QED coupling in the large-$n_\text{f}$ limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first dedicated analysis of cosmic-ray dark matter (CRDM) in paleo detectors. Owing to their large kinetic energies, CRDM particles generate nuclear-recoil tracks that extend to substantially larger lengths than those produced by dominant backgrounds from neutrinos and intrinsic radioactivity. Combined with the ultra-large effective geological exposure of $\mathcal{O}(10^{5})~\mathrm{t\,yr}$, paleo detectors provide a uniquely sensitive probe of sub-GeV DM. Considering both constant and vector-mediator interactions, we find that paleo detectors improve the sensitivity to the DM--proton scattering cross section by one to two orders of magnitude compared with the latest XENONnT limits.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the frame dependence of distribution functions within the framework of generalized chiral kinetic theory. Based on the derived transformation rules governing the choice of frame, we analytically obtain the global equilibrium solution in the presence of vorticity and electromagnetic fields. Our results show that, under the assumption of a varying electromagnetic field, these equilibrium solutions can be uniquely determined.</description>

      <title>A systematic study of lepton flavor violating dark matter interactions via indirect detection in effective field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lepton flavor violating (LFV) interactions involving dark matter (DM) particles remain a largely unexplored area. In this study, we systematically investigate LFV DM interactions within the framework of effective field theories by analyzing astrophysical photons and positrons produced from DM annihilation. Employing the astrophysical photon and positron data collected by Fermi-LAT, INTEGRAL, XMM-Newton, and AMS-02, we place meaningful constraints on all leading-order effective operators involving a DM pair and a flavor violating charged lepton pair. Our analysis covers the three well-known DM candidates: a scalar, a fermion, and a vector particle. For the photon flux, we consider contributions from final-state radiation, radiative decay, and inverse Compton scattering, and examine their respective sensitivity regions across different DM masses and photon energies. We find that for DM masses below $\mathcal{O}(20\,\rm GeV)$, INTEGRAL provides the most stringent constraints on annihilation cross sections and effective operators in all three LFV channels, whereas AMS-02 offers the strongest constraints above $\mathcal{O}(20\,\rm GeV)$.</description>

      <title>AllShowers: One model for all calorimeter showers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate and efficient detector simulation is essential for modern collider experiments. To reduce the high computational cost, various fast machine learning surrogate models have been proposed. Traditional surrogate models for calorimeter shower modeling train separate networks for each particle species, limiting scalability and reuse. We introduce AllShowers, a unified generative model that simulates calorimeter showers across multiple particle types using a single generative model. AllShowers is a continuous normalizing flow model with a Transformer architecture, enabling it to generate complex spatial and energy correlations in variable-length point cloud representations of showers. Trained on a diverse dataset of simulated showers in the highly granular ILD detector, the model demonstrates the ability to generate realistic showers for electrons, photons, and charged and neutral hadrons across a wide range of incident energies and angles without retraining. In addition to unifying shower generation for multiple particle types, AllShowers surpasses the fidelity of previous single-particle-type models for hadronic showers. Key innovations include the use of a layer embedding, allowing the model to learn all relevant calorimeter layer properties; a custom attention masking scheme to reduce computational demands and introduce a helpful inductive bias; and a shower- and layer-wise optimal transport mapping to improve training convergence and sample quality. AllShowers marks a significant step towards a universal model for calorimeter shower simulations in collider experiments.</description>

      <title>Review of hadronic vacuum polarization calculations via $e^+e^-$ measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.11966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discrepancy on the muon anomalous magnetic moment values obtained via a direct measurement and via a data-driven theory determination that uses the experimentally measured hadronic cross section, is among the long standing and most significant deviations from the Standard Model predictions. The recently presented final result of the direct measurement performed at the experiment at Fermilab, with an impressive accuracy of 127 parts-per-billion, further stresses the need for a theory estimate of comparable accuracy. The $e^+e^-$ hadronic cross section is the experimental input to the dispersive integral for the calculation of the hadronic contribution to the $g-2$, which is largely dominated by the $e^+e^-\to \pi^+\pi^-$ channel. Precise measurements of the $e^+e^-\to \pi^+\pi^-$ cross section with a sub-percent accuracy, in the energy region of the $\rho$-resonance peak, have been performed by several experiments, but the results differ way more than the published accuracies limiting the comparison with the Fermilab direct measurement. New results are expected to become available in the near future from KLOE, CMD-3, SND and BESIII experiments, while a new measurement from the BABAR collaboration is presented today and its impact on the present situation is discussed. This measurement makes use of the entire BABAR data set and adopts a different analysis strategy, with results (still preliminary) largely independent of the results published in the 2009 BABAR publication.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive study of cosmogenic neutron production in large liquid scintillator detectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.11980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutrons produced by cosmic ray muons constitute a significant background for underground experiments investigating neutron oscillations, neutrinoless double beta decay, dark matter, and other rare event signals. This work benchmarks measured neutron yields and neutron multiplicities--with a focus on data from the Daya Bay Reactor Neutrino Experiment--against comprehensive simulations using three GEANT4 hadronic physics lists. These simulations are further refined via a TALYS-based adjustment of hadronic cross sections. For the BERT-based models, the adjustment reduces the discrepancy in the total neutron yield from about 20% to approximately 6%, while for the BIC-based models it improves the agreement from roughly 13% to the sub-percent level (~0.3%), indicating a markedly better consistency of the BIC-based models with the experimental data. Nevertheless, a clear tension persists: simulations systematically underproduce single-neutron events while overproducing multi-neutron events. The study establishes a reproducible benchmark for cosmogenic neutron modeling and proposes a targeted refinement strategy--including channel-specific reweighting and intranuclear cascade parameter tuning--to guide future model development.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.11988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scalar-tensor theories predict fundamental scalar fields of considerable interest in astrophysics and cosmology. We investigate the superradiant instability of scalar clouds around Kerr black holes, showing that stimulated decay generates detectable electromagnetic signals. The growth of the superradiant scalar cloud differs from that of other bosonic fields and depends sensitively on the matter distribution surrounding the black hole, which originates from the scalar-matter coupling realized by the chameleon mechanism in modified gravity theories. In non-uniform matter distributions, stimulated emission from scalar clouds offers an observational signature that distinguishes fundamental scalars from other light bosonic fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The theory of nuclear excitations involving nucleon resonances is revisited and significantly extended to asymmetric nuclear matter and higher P- and S-wave $N^*$ resonances. Excited states of are described as superpositions of particle-hole configurations including $NN^{'-1}$ and $N^*N^{-1}$ configurations. Configuration mixing is taken into account on the one-loop level by solving the generalized $N^*RPA$ Dyson equation. The underlying coupled channels formalism is derived and response functions is discussed. Applications of the approach are illustrated for charge-exchange modes of asymmetric nuclear matter and finite nuclei. The spectral gross structures of corresponding excitations in finite nuclei are investigated in local density approximation. Applications of the approach to resonance studies by high-energy heavy ion reactions are recapitulated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bilinear Euclidean quark and gluon correlators with Wilson links have been used widely for applications of large-momentum effective field theories to computing non-perturbative collinear and soft parton physics. Due to color confinement, these correlators decay exponentially at large spatial distances, a behavior crucial for computing momentum-space Fourier transformations with controlled errors from lattice QCD data. Using heavy-quark effective theory reduction, dispersive analysis, Lorentz symmetry, and heavy-flavor spectra, we determine the leading and next-to-leading asymptotic behaviors and relate the expansion parameters to binding energies of heavy-flavor hadrons. We demonstrate the results through two-loop calculations in $\phi^3$ theory and from the perspective of locality and analyticity. We also study the impact of the asymptotic analysis on realistic lattice QCD data and demonstrate reliable error estimates.</description>

Abstract: Dissipative processes are pivotal for understanding the hydrodynamic evolution of hot and dense QCD matter created in relativistic nuclear collisions. The interplay of multiple conserved charges -- net baryon, strangeness, and electric charge -- is of particular interest. We simulate the longitudinal hydrodynamic evolution with the three diffusion currents in a hydrodynamic model with a lattice-QCD-based equation of state, NEOS-4D, and estimate rapidity distributions including diffusive corrections to the phase-space distribution in the presence of multiple charges, which ensure charge conservation at particlization. We determine the response of particle yields at midrapidity to changes in the diagonal and off-diagonal conductivities. Inversely, we find that most components of the conductivity matrix can be constrained experimentally using identified particle multiplicities at different collision energies.</description>

      <title>Probing Circumstellar Material and Shock Acceleration in Core-Collapse Supernovae with High-Energy Neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study high-energy (HE) neutrino production from interactions between supernova (SN) ejecta and the surrounding circumstellar material (CSM), focusing on regular Type~II and Type~IIn SNe. Using observationally inferred CSM density distributions, we calculate the resulting neutrino fluxes and examine their dependence on key parameters, including the CSM density normalization $D_*$, outer radius $R_{\rm csm}$, proton acceleration efficiency $\epsilon_p$, and magnetic energy fraction $\epsilon_B$. Detection prospects are assessed with a binned likelihood analysis for IceCube, indicating that nearby SNe with moderately dense, confined CSM can produce detectable signals, with a typical detection horizon of $\sim 0.1$ - 1 Mpc. For a Galactic SN at $\sim 10$ kpc, high-statistics neutrino data with detailed temporal and spectral information can constrain $D_*$, $R_{\rm csm}$, and $\epsilon_p$ to within a factor of $\sim 10$ or to a precision of $\sim 20\%$, depending on the assumed values of $D_*$ and $R_{\rm csm}$. These neutrino signals thus provide a complementary probe of the CSM profile and shock acceleration, alongside traditional electromagnetic observations.</description>

Abstract: This paper is a sequel in which we further analyze the recently derived quantum gravity equations which apply in accelerating cosmological spacetimes and whose solutions should be equivalent to all order re-summations of the perturbative leading logarithms that appear. In particular we study their implications concerning the primordial tensor power spectrum and the gravitational force due to a test source.</description>

      <title>Lattice-QCD validation of hadron mass and trace-anomaly decomposition sum rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first lattice-QCD validation of multiple sum rules associated with quark-gluon decomposition of hadron mass by computing all components from first principles. We achieve this through nonperturbative renormalization of the QCD energy-momentum tensor, including its trace, in a gradient-flow scheme, followed by continuum extrapolations, two-loop matching to the $\overline{\mathrm{MS}}$ scheme, and zero-flow-time extrapolations. These ingredients enable a direct and simultaneous verification, in a common renormalization scheme and scale, of multiple energy-density-based and trace-based mass decomposition sum rules proposed in the literature. We demonstrate the framework for the $\eta_c$ and $J/\psi$ charmonia using three fine lattice spacings with a physical strange-quark and near-physical up- and down-quark masses. We present the first lattice-QCD results for the gravitational form factor $\bar{C}$. We find sizable gluonic contributions to charmonia masses at the hadronic scale, $\sim 15\%$ in the Lorc\'e and Metz-Pasquini-Rodini decompositions. The trace-anomaly contribution in the Ji sum rule is $\sim 6\%$, while the gluonic component of the trace anomaly in the Hatta-Rajan-Tanaka sum rule is $\sim 35\%$. The method is general and can be straightforwardly adopted for lattice-QCD calculations of mass and spin decompositions as well as gravitational form factors of other hadrons and nuclei.</description>

      <title>Plunge-Merger-Ringdown Tests of General Relativity with GW250114</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The binary black hole signal GW250114, the clearest gravitational wave detected to date, offers a unique opportunity to test general relativity in the relativistic strong-gravity regime. How well does GW250114 agree with Einstein's predictions in the plunge-merger-ringdown stage? To address this point, we constrain deviations from general relativity across the plunge-merger-ringdown stage of spin-precessing binaries with a parametrized waveform model within the effective-one-body formalism. We find that deviations from the peak gravitational-wave amplitude and instantaneous frequency of the $(\ell, |m|)=(2,2)$ mode are constrained to about $10\%$ and $4\%$, respectively, at $90\%$ credible level. These constraints are, respectively, two and four times more stringent than those obtained by analyzing GW150914. We also constrain, for the first time, the instantaneous frequency of the $(\ell, |m|)=(4,4)$ mode at merger to about $6\%$, and the time at which the gravitational-wave amplitude peaks to about $5~\mathrm{ms}$. These results are the most precise tests of general relativity in the nonlinear regime to date, and can be employed to constrain extensions of Einsten's theory.</description>

      <title>Universal Dense-Matter Trace Anomaly Inferred from Collective Flow in Heavy-Ion Collisions and Global Properties of Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The trace anomaly of dense matter, $\Delta \equiv 1/3 - P/\varepsilon$, defined in terms of the ratio of pressure $P$ to energy density $\varepsilon$, quantifies deviations from conformal symmetry and plays a central role in both the hydrodynamic response and gravitational equilibrium. While $\Delta(\varepsilon)$ has recently been inferred from neutron star observations, we report the first Bayesian extraction of the trace anomaly from collective flow observables in intermediate-energy heavy-ion collisions. By employing transport-model simulations that explicitly decouple the cold-matter mean-field potential from thermal effects, we directly constrain the cold dense-matter equation of state (EOS). Remarkably, the trace anomaly inferred from laboratory flow data agrees quantitatively, within $68\%$ credible intervals, with independent astrophysical posterior bands. This nontrivial agreement demonstrates that heavy-ion collisions and neutron star observations probe the same universal macroscopic properties of dense matter, establishing the trace anomaly as a composition-insensitive descriptor of dense matter across widely different physical environments.</description>

      <title>Quantum Qualifiers for Neural Network Model Selection in Hadronic Physics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As quantum machine-learning architectures mature, a central challenge is no longer their construction, but identifying the regimes in which they offer practical advantages over classical approaches. In this work, we introduce a framework for addressing this question in data-driven hadronic physics problems by developing diagnostic tools - centered on a quantitative quantum qualifier - that guide model selection between classical and quantum deep neural networks based on intrinsic properties of the data. Using controlled classification and regression studies, we show how relative model performance follows systematic trends in complexity, noise, and dimensionality, and how these trends can be distilled into a predictive criterion. We then demonstrate the utility of this approach through an application to Compton form factor extraction from deeply virtual Compton scattering, where the quantum qualifier identifies kinematic regimes favorable to quantum models. Together, these results establish a principled framework for deploying quantum machine-learning tools in precision hadronic physics.</description>

      <title>Joint constraints on cosmic birefringence and early dark energy from ACT, Planck, DESI, and PantheonPlus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the increasing number of high-precision astronomical observations, physical quantities that were previously inaccessible to accurate calculations, such as cosmic birefringence, have once again become a focal point of interest. Such phenomena induce a nonvanishing cross-correlation between the $E$- and $B$-mode polarizations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), thereby providing a direct observational signature of parity violation. The Chern-Simons coupling between the scalar field in early dark energy (EDE) models and CMB photons is regarded as a plausible mechanism for generating cosmic birefringence. Recent data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) deliver $EB$ measurements at higher multipole moments than those previously achieved by {Planck}, while DESI and PantheonPlus datasets provide new and stringent constraints on the late-time expansion history. Using a joint analysis of {Planck}, DESI DR1, Pantheon+, and ACT data, we perform a full-parameter constraint on the cosmic birefringence effects induced by the EDE-CMB photon coupling. Our results favor a higher Hubble constant, $H_0 = 76.9^{+2.9}_{-2.5}\,\rm km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}$, and a relatively large EDE fraction, $f_{\mathrm{EDE}} = 0.232^{+0.074}_{-0.047}$. By comparing the cosmological evolution of this model across different data combinations, we find that the ACT-$EB$ data combined with {Planck} + DESI + PantheonPlus provide good constraints to both early- and late-Universe observations.</description>

      <title>Rotational enhancement and stability of protoquark stars during thermal evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first systematic study of rigidly rotating protoquark stars based on isentropic equations of state (EOS) within the density-dependent quark mass (DDQM) framework. Using a quasi-static equilibrium approach, we follow the Kelvin--Helmholtz evolution from hot, lepton-rich matter to a cold, catalyzed quark star. Rotation substantially enhances the maximum stable mass (by up to $\sim 40\%$), equatorial radius, and key rotational observables, with the ratio of rotational kinetic to gravitational potential energy, $T_{\rm kin}/|W|$, reaching $0.18$--$0.19$ near the Keplerian limit, indicating a heightened susceptibility to gravitational-wave--emitting instabilities. Thermal evolution introduces a clear ordering: all stellar properties peak during the lepton-rich stages and decrease monotonically as the star cools. Compared to hadronic stars, rotating protoquark stars exhibit larger radii, higher moments of inertia, and stronger quadrupolar deformation, producing a distinct signature in the mass--radius--spin plane that can accommodate objects such as HESS~J1731--347 and PSR~J0740+6620. These results demonstrate that future multimessenger observations must account for both thermal history and rotation to robustly identify quark matter in compact stars.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear optical response as a probe of emergent Lorentz symmetry violation in noncentrosymmetric materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an electrically controlled protocol to detect weak Lorentz-violating (LV) backgrounds through the second-order shift photocurrent in noncentrosymmetric crystals. Using a spinful Rice--Mele model, we show that a stationary LV background induces a momentum-odd correction to the Bloch Hamiltonian, which generates an odd-in-field contribution to the shift current. This leads to a directional asymmetry, whereby the photocurrent distinguishes opposite orientations of an applied static field. The effect originates from an LV-induced deformation of the interband phase and can be isolated experimentally by comparing field-reversed configurations, with vanishing response at transverse orientations, providing an internal consistency check. Our results demonstrate that nonlinear optical responses offer a practical and symmetry-selective route for probing LV effects in solid-state systems.</description>

      <title>Decoupling of large-scale, adiabatic inflationary perturbations from enhanced small-scale modes at one-loop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We reconsider back-reaction from large amplitude, short-scale perturbations onto a long wavelength adiabatic mode. In a loop expansion of the long-mode power spectrum, this back-reaction appears first at 1-loop. Due to the separation between the long and short scales, the separate universe method provides a simple and efficient framework for this computation. In this paper, building on our earlier work, we employ a $\delta N$ formula for the long mode, which captures the effect of short scales. We show that back-reaction at 1-loop is due to either (i) non-linearity of the $\delta N$ formula, or (ii) 1-loop corrections to the initial conditions. We argue that contributions of type (ii) cannot themselves be described within the separate universe framework, but their properties can be constrained using soft theorems and a ''multi-point propagator'' expansion. When applied to a band of enhanced short-scale perturbations that crossed the horizon during inflation, our result shows that the loop correction decouples from their detailed properties. Furthermore, the back-reaction we obtain is scale-invariant. Its magnitude is model-dependent, but is degenerate with effects from modes that were still sub-horizon at the end of inflation. In this scenario (but not necessarily in all scenarios), we conclude that the effect is not observable.</description>

      <title>Seesaw Models under the Lens of Angular Distributions at $\mu^+\mu^-,\, \mu^+ \mu^+, \, \mu^+ \gamma$ and $\mu^+ e^-$ Colliders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2011.04191v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Seesaw extensions of the Standard Model not only provide a natural explanation for tiny neutrino masses, they also predict additional heavy states such as Majorana neutrinos, charged leptons, and scalar triplets. Distinguishing between these scenarios at future colliders will be essential if such particles are discovered. In this work, we investigate how leptonic colliders offer complementary avenues for this task, focusing on the role of reconstructed angular distributions, which encode information about the underlying matrix elements. One only needs to reconstruct the new particle (or SM charged lepton) in the final state and examine its angular distribution relative to the beam axis, without bothering about the other particles in the final state, and this is sufficient to reveal the underlying seesaw scenario. We perform a detailed PYTHIA8-based simulation for different Seesaw realizations: inverse Type-I, Type-II, and inverse Type-III at $\mu^+\mu^-$, $\mu^+\mu^+$, $\mu^+\gamma$, and $\mu^+e^-$ colliders. Characteristic angular patterns emerge that enable discrimination among the models, with muon colliders providing particularly promising reach. We also comment on the prospects of asymmetric $\mu e$ colliders in probing off-diagonal Yukawa structures.</description>

      <title>Status of G2HDM with right handed neutrino coupling in the light of $b\to c \tau\nu$ anomalies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.17766v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent experimental measurements of several observables in semileptonic B meson decays have pointed towards the possibility of new physics. The LHCb collaboration has reported a significant deviation, exceeding $3.2\sigma$, in the combined measurement of the ratio of branching ratios $R(D)-R(D^\star)$ from the predictions of the standard model. Furthermore, other observables, such as $R_{J/\psi}$, $P_{\tau}^{D^\star}$, $F_L^{D^\star}$, and $R_{\Lambda_c}$ in the $b\to c\ell\nu$ transition, have also exhibited noticeable deviations from the standard model predictions. Motivated by these anomalies in the $b\to c\tau\nu$ transitions, we perform a log-likelihood fit incorporating new physics coming from right-handed neutrino couplings and explored the implications of a charged Higgs boson within a generic two Higgs doublet model (G2HDM). Our comprehensive analysis, focused on the $\tau\nu$ and $b\tau\nu$ final states, was performed using the High Luminosity run of the Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC). We demonstrate that HL-LHC has the sensitivity to exclude the remaining allowed region in G2HDM model in explaining these anomalies with charged Higgs boson coupled to right-handed neutrino.</description>

The idea is to use linear substitutions to transform these relations to an explicitly recursive form. A possible type of such substitutions is proposed for the case of vacuum integrals. Its applicability is shown for several families of massless (with one massive line) vacuum integrals up to the 7-loop level.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the jet angular broadening with photon-tagged jets in high-energy nuclear collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10924v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The medium modification of jet substructure in hot and dense nuclear matter has garnered significant interest from the heavy-ion physics community in recent years. Measurements of inclusive jets show an angular narrowing in nucleus-nucleus collisions, while recent CMS results for photon-tagged jets ($\gamma$+jets) suggest evidence of broadening. In this study, we conduct a theoretical analysis of the angular structure of inclusive jets and $\gamma$+jets using a transport approach that accounts for jet energy loss and the medium response in the quark-gluon plasma. We examine the girth modification of $\gamma$+jets in $0-30\%$ PbPb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 5.02$ TeV, achieving satisfactory agreement with recent CMS measurements. We explore the relationship between selection bias and jet kinematics by varying the threshold for $x_{j\gamma} = p_T^{\rm jet}/p_T^{\gamma}$. Notably, we quantitatively demonstrate that $\gamma$+jets significantly reduce selection bias and can effectively select jets that have been sufficiently quenched in PbPb collisions, which is crucial for capture the jet angular broadening. Additionally, we estimate the contributions of medium-induced gluon radiation and the medium response to the broadening of the jet angular substructure. Lastly, we analyze the modification patterns of jet $R_g$ and $\Delta R_{\rm axis}$ in PbPb collisions, which indicate slight broadening for $\gamma$+jets and noticeable narrowing for inclusive jets compared to pp collisions.</description>

      <title>Approaching Stable Quark Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19678v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The determination of whether the ground state of baryon matter in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is the ordinary nucleus or a quark matter state remains a long-standing question in physics. A critical parameter in this investigation is the bag parameter $B$, which quantifies the QCD vacuum energy and can be computed using nonperturbative methods such as Lattice QCD (LQCD). By combining the equation of state derived from perturbative QCD (pQCD) with the bag parameter to fit the LQCD-simulated data for isospin-dense matter, we address the stability of quark matter within the LQCD+pQCD framework. Our findings suggest that the current data imposes an upper bound on $B^{1/4} \lesssim 160$ MeV, approaching a conclusive statement on quark matter stability. Given the lower bound on $B$ from the quark condensate contribution to the vacuum energy, the stable 2-flavor quark matter remains possible, whereas the stable 2+1-flavor quark matter is excluded, assuming complete deconfinement and chiral-symmetry restoration and the reliability of pQCD at baryon chemical potentials around the proton mass. Additionally, we derive more general thermodynamic bounds on the quark matter energy-per-baryon and $B$, which, while weaker, provide complementary insights.</description>

      <title>Two-Loop Anomalous Dimensions in the LEFT: Dimension-Six Four-Fermion Operators in NDR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08384v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive the complete set of two-loop anomalous dimensions describing the mixing of four-fermion operators in the Low Energy Effective Field Theory (LEFT). The calculation is performed in Naive Dimensional Regularization with anticommuting $\gamma_5$ (the NDR scheme), and the results are given in the "JMS basis" of dimension-six operators. The derivation relies on known results for UV poles in two-loop diagrams in QCD, which are then used to derive the two-loop Anomalous Dimension Matrix (ADM) for the full set of four-fermion operators including $O(\alpha_s^2)$, $O(\alpha_s\alpha)$ and $O(\alpha^2)$ corrections. The method employed is an extension of a common approach to deal with traces containing $\gamma_5$ in NDR. Our results have been implemented in the public code DsixTools. We also discuss and provide the results in the LEFT with 5, 4 and 3 active quark flavors.</description>

      <title>The Signals of Doomsday I: False Higgs vacuum decay signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15848v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The measured standard model parameters indicate that we might live in a false Higgs vacuum, though with a very long lifetime. However, small black holes can serve as catalysers and significantly speed up the phase transition. In fact, bubbles of true vacuum might already exist in our universe. If the propagation of the bubble walls slows down due to interaction with the surrounding matter and plasma, these signals can reach us before the bubble wall hits us. Using the vacuum mismatch method, we calculate the spectrum of the Higgs particles produced by such a bubble until the terminal velocity is reached. In addition, we show that frictional dissipation at the terminal wall velocity generates a large population of thermally produced Higgs particles, which continues even after the mismatch channel shuts off. Since the Higgs is neutral, a good part of the final decay products (after hadronization, annihilation and decay of unstable particles) will be photons and neutrinos, which will then act as a long-range signature. For the conservative set of parameters used here, the thermal channel produces a macroscopically large burst of high energy neutrinos and photons from Higgs decays, which could be detectable from sufficiently nearby bubbles with current or upcoming multi messenger facilities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20352v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the rotational Brownian motion of heavy quark in QCD medium and provide analytical results for polarization of open heavy-flavor hadrons. We calculate expressions for vector and tensor polarization, corresponding to baryon spin polarization and vector meson spin alignment, respectively. Assuming that heavy quarks are initially fully spin polarized along the direction of magnetic field, we compare our results with recent experimental data from ALICE collaboration for $D^{*+}$ meson and provide predictions for spin polarization of open charm baryons. We propose that the transverse momentum dependence of heavy quark polarization may serve as a distinctive signature of the intense initial magnetic field generated in off-central relativistic heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08897v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Velocity-independent (s-wave) annihilation of thermal Dark Matter is ruled out by CMB data for masses below 10GeV, effectively ruling out the possibility of indirectly detecting it in this mass range. We demonstrate in a model-independent framework that Breit-Wigner effects from very narrow resonances can circumvent CMB constraints, thereby reviving the potential to detect s-wave DM annihilation in the present Universe. The density of resonant s-wave Dark Matter continues to evolve long after chemical decoupling, leading to a scenario we refer to as belated freeze-out, where kinetic decoupling plays a significant role in determing the relic density.</description>

Abstract: Dark matter may accumulate in neutron stars given its gravitational interaction and abundance. We investigate the modification of neutron star properties and confront them with the observations in the context of strongly-interacting dark matter scenario, specifically for a QCD-like theory with G$_2$ gauge group for which a first-principles equation-of-state from lattice calculations is available. We study the impact of various observational constraints and modeling of the QCD equation of state on the combined neutron stars. The results indicate that dark matter masses of a few hundred MeV to a few GeV are consistent with the latest observed neutron star properties.</description>

      <title>Searching for the LFV $\gamma\gamma e\mu$ interaction at future $e^- e^+$ colliders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12431v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the Lepton Flavor Violating (LFV) process $e^{+}e^{-}\to e^{+}e^{-}e\mu$ ($e=e^-,\,e^+,\,\mu=\mu^-,\,\mu^+ $) at future circular colliders, probing the effective $\gamma\gamma e\mu$ interaction through photon fusion. Within an Effective Field Theory (EFT) framework compatible with theoretical and experimental constraints, we identify regions in the parameter space of the effective couplings where the signal could be observed at the Circular Electron-Positron Collider (CEPC) at $\sqrt{s}=240\ \text{GeV}$ and the Future Circular Collider (FCC-ee) at $\sqrt{s}=240$ and $350\ \text{GeV}$. Our analysis leverages distinctive kinematic distributions -- particularly the transverse momentum of the scattered electron $p_{T}^{(e^{-}\ \text{scattered})}$ and the central muon $p_{T}^{\mu}$ -- to achieve efficient signal-background separation. By employing a neural network classifier, we enhance the sensitivity beyond traditional cut-based methods, demonstrating the discovery potential of these facilities for LFV searches in the clean environment of $e^{+}e^{-}$ collisions.</description>

      <title>Lorentz Violation: Loop-Induced Effects in QED and Observational Constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15608v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lorentz invariance is a cornerstone of modern physics, yet its possible violation remains both theoretically intriguing and experimentally significant. In this work, using quantum electrodynamics as an example, we explore how Lorentz invariance violation, introduced into a specific sector of the theory, spreads through loop corrections, modifying the propagation and dispersion relations of other particles. Self-energy and vacuum polarization graphs reveal how LIV effects transfer across sectors, influencing particle kinematics. Due to these loop effects, constraints from cosmic-ray observations and other Earth-based experiments impose limits on induced LIV parameters that would otherwise be less constrained. We show that while interaction-based LIV effects require unrealistically large parameters for detection, modifications to dispersion relations can be probed down to $\delta \sim 10^{-8} \text{ to } 10^{-9}$ at the LHC. This suggests that accelerator-based resonance studies provide a promising avenue for stringent LIV constraints, potentially rivaling astrophysical observations.</description>

      <title>$\mathcal{P}$, $\mathcal{T}$-violating axion-mediated interactions in RaOH molecule</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08667v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: If axion simultaneously has the scalar couplings to the nucleons and pseudo-scalar couplings to the electrons, it may mediate a $\mathcal{P}$, $\mathcal{T}$-violating interaction between the electronic shell and nuclei in the molecules. The polyatomic molecule RaOH, which is considered as a promising platform for the $\mathcal{P}$, $\mathcal{T}$ violation searches, is studied for its sensitivity to such interactions. Due to the long-range nature (on molecular scales) of the axion-mediated interaction, it is important whether the enhancement parameter would be sensitive to the vibration of the molecule. Our results imply that the impact of the vibrations on the axion-mediated electron-nucleon interaction in the molecule is similar to the impact on the short-range electron-nucleon scalar-pseudoscalar interaction studied earlier.</description>

      <title>Reducing Hadronic Uncertainty in Low-Energy Neutral-Current Processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03255v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the hadronic uncertainty from light-quark loops coupled to (anti)neutrino in low-energy neutral-current (anti)neutrino scattering, estimated at the $3$-$4$ permille level. This uncertainty arises from limited knowledge of the charge-isospin correlation function of quark currents. We study the charge-charge and charge-isospin correlators within $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ and $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ chiral perturbation theory (ChPT). In $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ ChPT, the two correlators are identical to all orders in the chiral and electromagnetic expansions. We further perform a leading-order $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ ChPT calculation and discuss the relevant counterterms. Our findings reduce the hadronic uncertainty in neutral-current processes such as (anti)neutrino-electron and coherent elastic (anti)neutrino-nucleus scattering by a factor $\sim 35$.</description>

Abstract: We consider the extension of the Standard electroweak Model through an $SU(2)$ quadruplet of scalars with hypercharge either $3/2$ or $1/2$ (with an additional reflection symmetry in the latter case). We establish, through $\textit{exact analytical equations}$, the boundaries of the phase spaces of the gauge-invariant terms that appear in the (renormalizable) scalar potentials. We devise procedures for the determination of necessary and sufficient bounded-from-below conditions on those potentials; we emphasize that one mostly needs to scan the scalar potential over a few $\textit{lines}$, instead of $\textit{surfaces}$, in order to establish the boundedness-from-below; this fact allows one $\textit{to reduce by three orders of magnitude the computational time}$ devoted to that establishment.</description>

      <title>Quantum Bootstrap Approach to a Non-Relativistic Potential for Quarkonium systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02916v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantum bootstrap method is applied to determine the bound-state spectrum of Quarkonium systems using a non-relativistic potential approximation. The method translates the Schr\"odinger equation into a set of algebraic recursion relations for radial moments $\langle r^m \rangle$, which are constrained by the positive semidefiniteness of their corresponding Hankel matrices. The numerical implementation is first validated by calculating the $1S$ and $1P$ mass centroids for both charmonium ($c\bar{c}$) and bottomonium ($b\bar{b}$) systems, finding deviations of less than 0.5\% from experimental data from the Particle Data Group (PDG). This analysis is then extended to the hypothetical toponium ($t\bar{t}$) system, predicting a $1S$ ground state mass of $M \approx 344.3 \text{ GeV}$. This theoretical mass is in agreement with the energy of the recently observed resonance-like enhancement in the $t\bar{t}$ cross-section by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations. This result provides theoretical support for the interpretation of this experimental phenomenon as the formation of a quasi-bound toponium state and highlights the predictive power of the non-relativistic potential approach for systems of two massive quarks.</description>

      <title>Indirect searches for realistic sub-GeV Dark Matter models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03819v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Indirect searches for Dark Matter (DM) particles with mass in the MeV -- GeV scale have received significant attention lately. Pair-annihilations of such DM particles in the Galaxy can give rise to (at the same time) MeV to GeV $\gamma$-rays via prompt emission, sub-GeV $e^\pm$ in cosmic-rays, as well as a broad photon spectrum ranging from $X$-rays to soft $\gamma$-rays, produced by the DM induced $e^\pm$ via inverse Compton scattering, bremsstrahlung and in-flight annihilation processes (collectively called `secondary emissions'). We focus on two representative realistic sub-GeV DM models, namely, the vector-portal kinetic-mixing model and the higgs-portal model, and perform a detailed study of the indirect detection constraints from existing $X$-rays, $\gamma$-rays and cosmic-ray observations, based on all of the above-mentioned signals. We also estimate the future prospects from the upcoming MeV photon telescope COSI, including all possible types of prompt and secondary emission signals. We compare our results with the constraints and (or) projections from cosmological and terrestrial observations. We find that, for both the sub-GeV DM models, the current observations constrain the annihilation cross-section at the level of $\langle \sigma v \rangle \lesssim 10^{-27} {\rm cm}^3/{\rm s}$, or lower for some specific mass ranges or under optimistic assumptions. Moreover, new unconstrained DM parameter space can be probed at the upcoming instruments like COSI, thanks to the inclusion of secondary photons which in many cases provide the dominant signal.</description>

Abstract: Van der Waals potentials describing interactions between color-singlet mesons and/or baryons vanish at leading order in potential nonrelativistic quantum chromodynamics (pNRQCD). This result and constraints from Gauss's law are used to prove that weakly-coupled pNRQCD van der Waals potentials in generic non-Abelian gauge theories with only heavy quarks are too weak to form bound states whose color state is a product of color-singlets. Quantum Monte Carlo calculations of four, five, and six quarks with equal masses provide numerical evidence that exotic color configurations are higher energy than products of color-singlet hadrons, suggesting that equal-mass fully-heavy tetraquark, pentaquark, and hexaquark bound states do not exist at next-to-leading order in pNRQCD and at all orders in QCD-like theories in which all quark masses are asymptotically large. Mechanisms for generating hadron-hadron bound states are identified, which necessarily involve large quark-mass hierarchies, relativistic effects arising from the presence of sufficiently light quarks, or nonperturbative effects outside the scope of weakly-coupled pNRQCD.</description>

      <title>Transport Properties of QGP within a Bayesian Holographic QCD Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16167v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using a holographic QCD model augmented by Bayesian inference, we calculate key transport coefficients of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP)$\text{-}$including the drag force, jet quenching parameter, heavy quark diffusion coefficient, and shear and bulk viscosities$\text{-}$at finite temperature and chemical potential. Posterior parameter distributions at the 68\% and 95\% confidence levels (CL), as well as the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimates, are employed to quantify uncertainties. Our findings indicate that the diffusion coefficient within the Bayesian credible regions aligns with lattice QCD results for $T \sim 1.2T_c$ to $2T_c$, and is consistent with ALICE experimental measurements near $T_c$. The jet quenching parameter obtained from the Bayesian analysis agrees with RHIC and LHC data, while viscosity coefficients show compatibility with existing literature. These results demonstrate the efficacy of a Bayesian holographic approach in elucidating the nonperturbative transport properties of QCD matter.</description>

Abstract: The COMPASS Collaboration recently reported the observation of a new resonance, $a_4(2610)$, which has sparked our interest in studying the $a_4$ family with {$I^GJ^{PC}=1^{-}4^{++}$}. In this work, we investigate the mass spectra and Okubo-Zweig-Iizuka-allowed two-body strong decays of the $a_4$ family using the modified Godfrey-Isgur quark model and the quark-pair creation model. We also explore the possibility of identifying $a_4(2610)$ as a $4F$ or $2H$ state, {and our numerical results suggest that it could be a promising candidate for the $a_4(2H)$ state. In addition, we predict the masses and the widths of the $a_4(1H)$ and $a_4(3F)$ states.}</description>

      <title>The three-loop single-mass heavy-flavor corrections to the structure functions $F_2(x,Q^2)$ and $g_1(x,Q^2)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16124v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present quantitative results on the single-mass heavy-flavor contributions in the
  region of large virtualities $Q^2$ up to three-loop order to the unpolarized structure
  function $F_2(x,Q^2)$ and the polarized structure function $g_1(x,Q^2)$ for the first
  time. These results are relevant for precision QCD analyses of the World deep-inelastic
  data and the data taken at future colliders, such as the Electron--Ion Collider, since
  the scaling violations due to massless and massive Wilson coefficients are significantly
  different. In order to measure the strong coupling constant $\alpha_s(M_Z^2)$ and the
  twist-2 parton distribution functions consistently at highest precision, the
  next-to-next-to-leading order corrections have to be taken into account. Furthermore,
  the complete three-loop corrections will allow to reduce the present theory error of the
  charm mass $m_c$ as measured form deep-inelastic data. We provide a fast and precise
  public numerical code for the unpolarized and polarized massive Wilson coefficients in
  the asymptotic region.</description>

      <title>High Reheating Temperature without Axion Domain Walls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24812v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a cosmological scenario in which the Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry remains broken in the entire history of the Universe, thereby avoiding the formation of axion strings and domain walls. Contrary to the conventional expectation, it is demonstrated that appropriately chosen scalar interactions are able to keep the PQ symmetry broken at arbitrarily high temperatures. We carefully examine the finite-temperature effective potential in a model with two PQ breaking scalar fields. The existence of flat directions plays a vital role in suppressing axion isocurvature perturbations during inflation by stabilizing a PQ field at a large field value. The viable parameter space consistent with theoretical and observational constraints is identified. Our scenario provides a minimal path for PQ symmetry breaking that addresses both the axion domain wall and isocurvature problems while permitting arbitrarily high reheating temperatures accommodating high-scale baryogenesis scenarios such as thermal leptogenesis.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive study of $\Lambda_c^- \to \Lambda (\to p \pi) \mu^- \bar \nu_{\mu}$ incorporating SMEFT implications and right-handed neutrino</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05050v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of the decay $\Lambda_c^- \to \Lambda(\to p\pi)\,\mu^- \bar\nu_\mu$ within a model-independent effective field theory framework. Previous studies have been restricted to the three-body decay $\Lambda_c^+ \to \Lambda \mu^+ \nu_\mu$ and considered only left-handed neutrinos within the Low-Energy Effective Theory (LEFT). In this work, we extend the analysis to the complete four-body angular distribution for the first time, incorporating the indirect constraints implied by the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) on the LEFT Wilson coefficients. We also include the effects of right-handed neutrino (RHN) operators, enabling a unified treatment of both left- and right-handed neutrino interactions in the $c \to s \mu \nu_\mu$ transition. Using the global bounds derived from LEFT observables and their SMEFT correlations, we study the impact of allowed new-physics scenarios on a variety of observables, including differential decay rates, forward-backward asymmetries, polarization asymmetries of the final-state hadron and lepton, and the angular coefficients (${\cal M}_0$ to ${\cal M}_9$) in the 4-body angular distribution. Our analysis reveals significant deviations from the Standard Model in the observables $\mathcal{P}^\Lambda_L$ and ${\cal M}_1$ for $C^V_{RL}$ and $C^V_{RR}$, and striking $T$-odd effects in ${\cal M}_7$ for complex $C^V_{RL}$. These features provide sensitive probes of vector-type new physics, such as leptoquark or right-handed current models. The predicted patterns can be tested in forthcoming measurements at BESIII, LHCb, and Belle II, where polarization-sensitive observables in $\Lambda_c$ decays are becoming experimentally accessible.</description>

      <title>Convergence of Heavy-Flavor PDFs at Small x and Its Impact on Future ep Colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15427v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first quantitative demonstration of the statistical convergence of heavy-flavor parton distribution functions at small x across modern NNLO global fits. Using the latest NNPDF4.0, CT18, and MSHT20 sets, we find a maximal relative deviation of 16.8 percent at x = 1e-6 and Q = 100 GeV, corresponding to nearly a factor-of-two improvement over the approximately 30 percent spread in pre-2013 determinations. This convergence, stabilized by consistent alpha_s and scale treatments, marks a transition of the heavy-flavor sector into a statistically controlled regime of small-x QCD. We further show that this precision directly reduces PDF-driven uncertainties in heavy-quark electroproduction at future ep colliders (LHeC and FCC-eh) by about a factor of two and enhances the theoretical stability of leptophilic new-physics searches such as a neutral Z_l gauge boson. These findings establish a link between the precision frontier of QCD and the discovery potential of next-generation lepton-hadron facilities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24658v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this contribution, new developments for the Standard Model Higgs-boson decays will be summarized. This addresses extensions of the grids used by {\tt Hdecay} to implement finite NLO mass effects for $H\to gg$ as well as explicit numbers for the branching fraction for the strange-Yukawa induced part of $H\to s\bar s$ together with the related uncertainties. In addition, first results of the strong and weak Dalitz decays of the Higgs-boson decays $H\to s\bar s + g/\gamma$ are presented. The Dalitz decays define the separation between the Yukawa-induced part and the continuum, that is not induced by the strange-Yukawa coupling, and thus pave the way towards a solid determination of the strange-Yukawa coupling at future $e^+e^-$ colliders, but will also be relevant for solid bounds on the strange-Yukawa coupling at the LHC.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09279v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The laser of an intense electromagnetic field promotes the studies of strong-field particle physics in high-intensity frontier. Particle accelerator facilities in the world produce high-quality muon and proton beams. In this work, we propose the nonlinear Compton scattering to light dark particles through the collision between intense laser pulse and muon or proton beam. We take light dark photon and axion-like particle as illustrative dark particles. The cross sections of relevant nonlinear Compton scattering to dark photon or axion-like particle are calculated. We also analyze the background processes with missing neutrinos. The prospective sensitivity shows that the laser-induced process provides a complementary and competitive search of new invisible particles lighter than about 1 MeV.</description>

      <title>Probing unitarity violation of lepton flavor mixing matrix with reactor antineutrinos at JUNO and TAO</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15525v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the precise measurements of neutrino oscillation parameters at Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO), we investigate the possibility of probing the unitarity violation of lepton flavor mixing matrix solely with reactor antineutrinos. First, we stress that it is necessary to reconsider the production and detection of neutrinos in a self-consistent way, apart from neutrino propagation, when analyzing experimental sensitivities to unitarity violation. Then, concentrating on JUNO and its satellite experiment Taishan Antineutrino Observatory (TAO), we demonstrate how the event rates of inverse beta decays (i.e., $\overline{\nu}^{}_e + p \to e^+ + n$) for observing $\overline{\nu}^{}_e \to \overline{\nu}^{}_e$ oscillations, and those of elastic antineutrino-electron scattering (i.e., $\overline{\nu}^{}_\alpha + e^- \to \overline{\nu}^{}_\alpha + e^-$ with $\alpha = e, \mu, \tau$) for $\overline{\nu}^{}_e \to \overline{\nu}^{}_\mu$ and $\overline{\nu}^{}_e \to \overline{\nu}^{}_\tau$ oscillations, depend on the parameters characterizing unitarity violation. Our investigation will be useful for JUNO and TAO to place independent constraints with more data in the near future.</description>

      <title>Diquark size effects in the quark-diquark approximation for baryons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06016v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Baryons can be described within several theoretical frameworks. Among them, the constituent approach is widely used. In this context, we aim to evaluate the accuracy of a particular model of baryons: the quark-diquark approximation. It consists in separating the three-body system into two subsequent two-body ones: a pair of two quarks, the diquark, and a second system consisting of the diquark and the third quark. This approximation is widely used, but its accuracy is rarely evaluated. The goal of this work is to perform this evaluation by comparing the quark-diquark model with a three-body model, both using the same semi-relativistic interaction. The baryon masses and some characteristic distances are computed and analysed within both approaches. Additionally, an original procedure to establish the quark-diquark potential will be presented with the aim to increase the precision of this approximation. It is shown that a diquark must not necessarily be compact to obtain good baryon masses.</description>

      <title>Neutrino texture-zeros after JUNO's first results: Implications for long-baseline neutrino experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13587v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent results from the JUNO reactor neutrino experiment have significantly improved our knowledge of the solar mixing angle $\theta_{12}$ and the solar mass splitting $\Delta m^2_{21}$. We study the impact of these improved estimates on the validity of texture-zeros in the light neutrino mass matrix by assuming neutrinos to be of Majorana nature. Considering a diagonal charged lepton basis, we revisit the previously allowed one-zero and two-zero textures and check their validity by using updated neutrino data from JUNO. While JUNO data rule out one previously allowed two-zero texture, they also make predictions for other neutrino parameters more precise. We finally study the prospects of probing the currently allowed texture-zeros and their predicted correlations among neutrino parameters at the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE). The inclusion of JUNO and reactor experiments strengthens DUNE's ability to constrain the allowed parameter space of both one-zero and two-zero textures. We also observe that DUNE benefits substantially from the complementarity with the T2HK experiment.</description>

      <title>A possible solution to the gallium anomaly moving beyond the leptonic wave function factorization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.20560v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For over thirty years, a $\sim20\%$ deficit, now exceeding $5\sigma$, has persisted between measured and predicted neutrino capture rates on $^{71}$Ga, as observed in radioactive source experiments (namely GALLEX, SAGE, and more recently BEST) using $^{51}$Cr and $^{37}$Ar. This long-standing discrepancy, referred to as the gallium anomaly, has posed a significant challenge to our understanding of both experimental methods and theoretical predictions. In this work, we revisit the theoretical calculation of the neutrino capture cross-section by moving beyond the standard treatment of the leptonic wave functions, revealing limitations in the commonly used factorization approach based on the detailed balance principle. Incorporating phenomenologically constrained Gamow-Teller transition densities, able to correctly reproduce the precisely measured half-life of $^{71}{\textrm{Ge}}$, we find that the revised cross-section can be significantly reduced, potentially resolving the gallium anomaly without invoking new physics.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Understanding of PDF Fits and their Uncertainties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24116v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Parton Distribution Functions (PDFs) play a central role in describing experimental data at colliders and provide insight into the structure of nucleons. As the LHC enters an era of high-precision measurements, a robust PDF determination with a reliable uncertainty quantification has become mandatory in order to match the experimental precision. The NNPDF collaboration has pioneered the use of Machine Learning (ML) techniques for PDF determinations, using Neural Networks (NNs) to parametrise the unknown PDFs in a flexible and unbiased way. The NNs are then trained on experimental data by means of stochastic gradient descent algorithms. The statistical robustness of the results is validated by extensive closure tests using synthetic data. In this work, we develop a theoretical framework based on the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) to analyse the training dynamics of neural networks. This approach allows us to derive, under precise assumptions, an analytical description of the neural network evolution during training, enabling a quantitative understanding of the training process. Having an analytical handle on the training dynamics allows us to clarify the role of the NN architecture and the impact of the experimental data in a transparent way. Similarly, we are able to describe the evolution of the covariance of the NN output during training, providing a quantitative description of how uncertainties are propagated from the data to the fitted function. While our results are not a substitute for PDF fitting, they do provide a powerful diagnostic tool to assess the robustness of current fitting methodologies. Beyond its relevance for particle physics phenomenology, our analysis of PDF determinations provides a testbed to apply theoretical ideas about the learning process developed in the ML community.</description>

      <title>The non-linear dynamics of axion inflation: a detailed lattice study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16368v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study in detail the fully inhomogeneous non-linear dynamics of axion inflation, identifying three regimes: weak-, mild-, and strong-backreaction, depending on the duration of inflation. We use lattice techniques that explicitly preserve gauge invariance and shift symmetry, and which we validate against other computational methods of the linear dynamics and of the homogeneous backreaction regime. Notably, we demonstrate that the latter fails to accurately describe the truly local dynamics of strong backreaction. We investigate the convergence of simulations of local backreaction, determining the requirements to achieve an accurate description of the dynamics, and providing useful parametrizations of the delay of the end of inflation. Additionally, we identify key features emerging from a proper local treatment of strong backreaction: the dominance of magnetic energy against the electric counterpart, the excitation of the longitudinal mode, and the generation of a scale-dependent chiral (im)balance. Our results underscore the necessity to accurately capture the local nature of the non-linear dynamics of the system, in order to correctly assess phenomenological predictions, such as e.g. the production of gravitational waves and primordial black holes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09381v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutron Stars (NSs), among the densest objects in the Universe, are exceptional laboratories for investigating Dark Matter (DM) properties. Recent theoretical and observational developments have heightened interest in exploring the impact of DM on NS structure, giving rise to the concept of Dark Matter Admixed Neutron Stars (DANSs). This review examines how NSs can accumulate DM over time, potentially altering their fundamental properties. We explore leading models describing DM behavior within NSs, focusing on the effects of both bosonic and fermionic candidates on key features such as mass, radius, and tidal deformability. Additionally, we review how DM can modify the cooling and heating processes, trigger the formation of a black hole, and impact Gravitational Waves (GWs) emissions from binary systems. By synthesizing recent research, this work highlights how DANSs might produce observable signatures, offering new opportunities to probe DM properties through astrophysical phenomena.</description>

      <title>Compton Form Factor Extraction using Quantum Deep Neural Networks</title>

Abstract: We extract Compton form factors (CFFs) from deeply virtual Compton scattering measurements at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (JLab) using quantum-inspired deep neural networks (QDNNs). The analysis implements the twist-2 Belitsky-Kirchner-M\"uller formalism and employs a fitting strategy that emulates standard local fits. Using pseudodata, we benchmark QDNNs against classical deep neural networks (CDNNs) and find that QDNNs often deliver higher predictive accuracy and tighter uncertainties at comparable model complexity. Guided by these results, we introduce a quantitative selection metric that indicates when QDNNs or CDNNs are optimal for a given experimental fit. After obtaining local extractions from the JLab data, we perform a standard neural-network global CFF fit and compare with previous global analyses. The results support QDNNs as an efficient and complementary tool to CDNNs for CFF determination and for future multidimensional studies of parton distributions and hadronic structure.</description>

      <title>On internal mechanical properties of Electroweak Magnetic Monopoles and their effects on stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04872v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By considering properties of the energy-momentum tensor of the electroweak magnetic monopole and its Born-Infeld extension, we attempt to make comments on the stability of these configurations. Specifically, we perform a study of the behaviour of the so-called internal force and pressure of these extended field-theoretic solitonic objects, which are derived from the energy-momentum tensor. Our method is slightly different from the so-called Laue's criterion for stability of nuclear matter, a local form of which had been proposed and applied in the earlier literature to the `t Hooft-Polyakov (HP) magnetic monopole, and found to be violated.By applying our method first to HP monopole, we also observe that, despite its topological stability, the total (finite) internal force (which has only radial components) is directed inwards, towards the centre of the monopole, which would imply instability. Thus this mechanical criterion for stability is arguably violated in the case of the HP monopole, as is the local version of Laue's criterion. The criterion is satisfied for the short-range part of the energy momentum tensor, in which the long-range part, due to the massless photon of the U(1) subgroup, is subtracted. Par contrast, the total internal force of the Cho-Maison (CM) electroweak monopole has both radial and angular components, which diverge at the origin, leading to rotational instabilities. Finally, by studying finite-energy extensions of the CM, either with non-minimal Higgs couplings with the hypercharge sector or hypercharge Born-Infeld type models, we find that the total force, integrated over space, is finite, but it has also angular components in the Born-Infeld case. The latter feature is interpreted as indicating that the Born-Infeld-CM monopole might be subject to rotations upon the action of perturbations, but it does not necessarily imply instabilities of the configuration.</description>

      <title>Hawking Radiation Signatures from Primordial Black Holes Transiting the Inner Solar System: Prospects for Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14041v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) arise from the collapse of density perturbations in the early universe and serve as a dark matter (DM) candidate and a probe of fundamental physics. There remains an unconstrained ``asteroid-mass'' window where PBHs of masses $10^{17} {\rm g} \lesssim M \lesssim 10^{23} {\rm g}$ could comprise up to $100\%$ of the dark matter. Current $e^{\pm}$ Hawking radiation constraints on the DM fraction of PBHs are set by comparing observed spatial- and time-integrated cosmic ray flux measurements with predicted Hawking emission fluxes from the galactic DM halo. These constraints depend on cosmic ray production and propagation models, the galactic DM density distribution, and the PBH mass function. We propose to mitigate these model dependencies by developing a new local, time-dependent Hawking radiation signature to detect low-mass PBHs transiting through the inner Solar System. We calculate transit rates for PBHs that form with initial masses $M \lesssim 5\times10^{17}\text{g}$. We then simulate time-dependent positron signals from individual PBH flybys as measured by the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS) experiment in low-Earth orbit. We find that AMS is sensitive to PBHs with masses $M\lesssim 2\times10^{14} \, {\rm g}$ due to its lower energy threshold of $500 \, {\rm MeV}$. We demonstrate that a dataset of daily positron fluxes over the energy range $5-500 \, {\rm MeV}$, with similar levels of precision to the existing AMS data, would enable detection of PBHs drawn from present-day distributions that peak within the asteroid-mass window. Our simulations yield ${\cal O} (1)$ detectable PBH transits per year across wide regions of parameter space, which may be used to constrain PBH mass functions. This technique could be extended to detect $\gamma$-ray and X-ray Hawking emission to probe further into the asteroid-mass window.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15413v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the standard inflationary paradigm the inhomogeneities observed in the CMB arise from quantum fluctuations of an initially homogeneous and isotropic vacuum state. This picture suffers from two well-known weaknesses. First, it assumes that quantum field theory remains valid at trans-Planckian scales, without modifications from quantum gravity. Second, it necessitates a quantum-to-classical transition in which fluctuations of a homogeneous quantum state become the classical inhomogeneities seen in the CMB. Recently, an alternative paradigm has been proposed in which such inhomogeneities are present from the very beginning, emerging from the assumed discreteness of spacetime at the Planck scale predicted by certain approaches to quantum gravity. Within this framework, scale-invariant scalar perturbations are generated naturally, without relying on trans-Planckian assumptions or invoking a quantum-to-classical transition. Specifically, inhomogeneities in the quantum state at the Planck scale propagate into semiclassical inhomogeneities on CMB scales. Here, we extend the aforementioned proposal to the most realistic case of a quasi-de Sitter expansion; in particular, we compute the scalar perturbation spectrum as a function of the slow-roll parameters, systematically encoded through the Hubble flow functions.</description>

Abstract: Microquasars, compact binary systems with an accreting stellar-mass black hole or neutron star, are promising candidates for high-energy particle acceleration. Recently, the LHAASO collaboration reported on the detection of $&gt;100$ TeV $\gamma$-ray emission from five microquasars, suggesting that these sources are efficient particle accelerators. In microquasars, high-energy $\gamma$-rays can be produced in large-scale jets or winds. In this work, we explore the X-ray, $\gamma$-ray and neutrino emission from SS 433, V4641 Sgr and GRS 1905+105. We consider leptonic and hadronic scenarios to explain the spectra observed by LHAASO and other high-energy $\gamma$-ray detectors. We estimate the neutrino flux associated with the hadronic component and investigate the detectability of neutrinos from these sources in current and future neutrino telescopes. We find that among the three sources, V4641 Sgr has the best prospects of observation with a combined next-generation neutrino telescopes.</description>

      <title>The diffuse supernova neutrino background: an update with modern population synthesis and core-collapse simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22699v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new, state-of-the-art computation of the Diffuse Supernova Neutrino Background (DSNB), where we use neutrino spectra from multi-dimensional, multi-second core collapse supernova simulations - including both neutron-star and black-hole forming collapses - and binary evolution effects from modern population synthesis codes. Large sets of numerical results are processed and connected in a consistent manner, using two key quantities: the mass of the star's Carbon-Oxygen (CO) core at an advanced pre-collapse stage - which depends on binary evolution effects - and the compactness parameter, which is the main descriptor of the post-collapse neutrino emission. The method enables us to model the neutrino emission of a very diverse, binary-affected population of stars, which cannot unambiguously be mapped in detail by existing core collapse simulations. We find that including black hole-forming collapses enhances the DSNB by up to 50% at energies greater than 30-40 MeV. Binary evolution effects can change the total rate of collapses and generate a sub-population of high core mass stars that are stronger neutrino emitters. However, the net effect on the DSNB is moderate - up to a 15% increase in flux - due to the rarity of these super-massive cores and to the relatively modest dependence of the neutrino emission on the CO core mass. The methodology presented here is suitable for extensions and generalizations, and therefore it lays the foundation for modern treatments of the DSNB.</description>

      <title>On frequentist confidence intervals in a non-Gaussian regime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10633v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study frequentist confidence intervals based on graphical profile likelihoods (Wilks' theorem, likelihood integration), and the Feldman-Cousins (FC) prescription, a generalisation of the Neyman belt construction, in a setting with non-Gaussian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) posteriors. Our simplified setting allows us to recycle the MCMC chain as an input in all methods, including mock simulations underlying the FC approach. We find all methods agree to within $10 \%$ in the close to Gaussian regime, but extending methods beyond their regime of validity leads to greater discrepancies. Importantly, we recover a $\sim 2 \sigma$ shift in cosmological parameters between low and high redshift cosmic chronometer data with the FC method, but only when one fits all parameters back to the mocks. We observe that fixing parameters, a common approach in the literature, risks underestimating confidence intervals.</description>

      <title>BAO miscalibration cannot rescue late-time solutions to the Hubble tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01974v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements play a key role in ruling out post-recombination solutions to the Hubble tension. However, because the data compression leading to these measurements assumes a fiducial $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, their reliability in testing late-time modifications to $\Lambda$CDM has at times been called into question. We play devil's advocate and posit that fiducial cosmology assumptions do indeed affect BAO measurements in such a way that low-redshift acoustic angular scales (proportional to the Hubble constant $H_0$) are biased low, and test whether such a rescaling can rescue post-recombination solutions. The answer is no. Firstly, strong constraints on the shape of the $z \lesssim 2$ expansion history from unanchored Type Ia Supernovae (SNeIa) prevent large deviations from $\Lambda$CDM. In addition, unless $\Omega_m$ is significantly lower than $0.3$, the rescaled BAO measurements would be in strong tension with geometrical information from the Cosmic Microwave Background. We demonstrate this explicitly on several dark energy (DE) models ($w$CDM, CPL DE, phenomenologically emergent DE, holographic DE, $\Lambda_s$CDM, and the negative cosmological constant model), finding that none can address the Hubble tension once unanchored SNeIa are included. We argue that the $\Lambda_s$CDM sign-switching cosmological constant model possesses interesting features which make it the least unpromising one among those tested. Our results demonstrate that possible fiducial cosmology-induced BAO biases cannot be invoked as loopholes to the Hubble tension "no-go theorem", and highlight the extremely important but so far underappreciated role of unanchored SNeIa in ruling out post-recombination solutions.</description>

      <title>Weak Gravity Conjecture in the sky: gravitational waves from preheating in Einstein-Maxwell-Scalar EFT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10890v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The effective field theory (EFT) concept provides a necessary tool for obtaining general predictions of low-energy theory valid below its unitarity-breaking scale (cutoff scale). Early Universe inflation and subsequent reheating could be a unique setup for testing potentially observable effects coming from the derivative expansion of the corresponding EFT around the flat space vacuum. In this work, we consider an EFT describing perturbative reheating dominated by the decay of inflaton to photons caused by the dimension-5 operator $\phi F_{\mu\nu} F^{\mu\nu}$. We compute the graviton production during reheating and high frequency gravitational wave signal due to the bremsstrahlung effect in the presence of $R_{\mu\nu\lambda\rho}F^{\mu\nu} F^{\lambda\rho}$ operator. It may lead to the dominant contribution at high momenta if the EFT cutoff is lower than the Planck mass. Assuming the general consequences of the unitarity and causality constraints, which imply that all EFT operators should be present, and be suppressed by the scales following from the dimension analysis, we obtain the observational constraints (CMB bound for the dark radiation) on the mass of the inflaton and UV cutoff of gravity. We find that for the typical parameters of large field inflation models, the gravitational cutoff scale cannot be lower than $10^{15}$ GeV.</description>

      <title>Emergence of thermal recoil jets in high-energy heavy-ion collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12715v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the established paradigm of jet quenching in relativistic heavy-ion collisions, jets from initial hard parton scatterings are suppressed due to their interaction with the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) as they traverse the hot medium, serving as crucial tomographic probes of QGP properties. The QGP is also capable of absorbing and reprocessing energy deposited by the hard jets into emergent jet-like objects, providing a novel production mechanism of thermal recoil jets. These emergent thermal recoil jets exhibit distinct transverse momentum ($p_\mathrm{T}$) and jet-size ($R$) dependencies different from the hard jets, and naturally explain the puzzling observation of the enhanced yields of hadron or photon triggered jets at large azimuthal angle and solely at small $p_\mathrm{T}$ and large $R$. These thermal recoil jets are predicted to have unique substructures, such as their jet shape that increases with the radius and the thermal-like distribution of their constituents, which can be verified in future experimental analyses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15627v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a discussion on lattice techniques for the simulation of non-canonical field theory circumstances, complementing our previous monograph (arXiv:2006.15122) on canonical cases. We begin by reviewing basic aspects of lattice field theory, including symplectic and non-symplectic evolution algorithms. We then introduce lattice implementations of non-canonical interactions, considering scalars with a non-minimal coupling to gravity, $\phi^2R$, non-minimal scalar kinetic theories, $\mathcal{G}_{ab}(\lbrace\phi_c\rbrace)\partial_\mu\phi^a\partial^\mu\phi^b$, and axion-like particle (ALP) interactions with Abelian gauge fields, $\phi F_{\mu\nu}\tilde F^{\mu\nu}$. Next, we discuss methods to set up special field configurations, including the creation of cosmic defect networks towards scaling (e.g. cosmic strings and domain walls), field configurations based on arbitrary power spectra or spatial profiles, and probabilistic methods as required e.g. for thermal configurations. We further extend the notion of non-canonical theories, discussing the discretization of scalar field dynamics in $d + 1$ dimensions, with $d \neq 3$. Unrelated to non-canonical aspects, we also discuss implementation(s) of gravitational wave (GW) dynamics on the lattice. This document represents the theoretical basis for the non-canonical field theory aspects (interactions, initial conditions, dimensionality) and GW dynamics implemented in ${\mathcal C}$osmo${\mathcal L}$attice v2.0, to be released in 2026.</description>

      <title>Resurgence in the two-field scalar and spinor Quantum Electrodynamics Euler-Heisenberg Lagrangian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22775v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first systematic resurgent analysis of the Euler-Heisenberg Lagrangian in spinor and scalar quantum electrodynamics for the most general constant background field configuration. In contrast to the extensively studied single-field cases, the two-field case exhibits unique asymptotic structures, leading to a substantially richer pattern of singularities in the Borel plane. Explicit large-order asymptotic formulas for the weak-field coefficients in both spinor and scalar quantum electrodynamics are derived. These reveal a nontrivial interplay between alternating and non-alternating factorial growth, governed by distinct structures associated with electric and magnetic contributions, and smoothly interpolating between the known single-field limits. Using Borel dispersion techniques, we demonstrate that the complete instanton structure underlying Schwinger pair production in two-field backgrounds is encoded in the divergent perturbative coefficients. We then construct resurgent approximants using Pad\'{e}-Borel and Pad\'{e}-Conformal-Borel resummation schemes adapted to the two-field case. For the spinor case, conformal improvement results in a significant enhancement in reconstructing both the real and imaginary parts of the effective Lagrangian across a wide range of field ratios, accurately capturing the subtle sign-changing features in the strong-field regime while in the scalar case, it yields minor improvement. Detailed comparisons with exact special-function representations demonstrate the reliability of reconstructions from a modest number of weak-field coefficients. This work establishes a natural completion of the resurgence programme for constant electromagnetic backgrounds, providing a robust analytic framework for exploring nonperturbative physics and strong-field phenomena in spinor and scalar quantum electrodynamics, from finite perturbative data.</description>

Abstract: We develop a bottom-up formulation of spin-kinetic theory for hot and/or dense plasmas. We introduce scalar and axial-vector phase-space functions as dynamical variables that parametrize both spin-averaged and spin-dependent distribution functions. Using spin-dependent Poisson brackets, we derive the corresponding kinetic equations and construct the associated Schwinger-Keldysh action. We further demonstrate how physical observables can be expressed in terms of these dynamical variables through constitutive relations. In the linear response regime, we establish a precise matching between the kinetic-theory and field-theory descriptions of vector and axial Wigner functions under electromagnetic and gravitational perturbations. Our framework provides a complementary approach to describing the dynamics of spin effects in a medium.</description>

      <title>From the Wavefunction of the Universe to In-In-Correlators: A Perturbative Map to All Orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00992</link>

Abstract: Both the Wavefunction of the Universe and the Schwinger-Keldysh in-in formalism are central tools for analyzing primordial cosmological observables, such as equal-time correlation functions. While their conceptual equivalence is well established, a systematic and explicit map between their diagrammatic expansions has remained elusive. In this article, I construct such a map by analyzing the relation between the two frameworks at the diagrammatic level. I show that diagrams contributing to correlation functions in the Wavefunction of the Universe approach can be uniquely reorganized into Schwinger-Keldysh diagrams. This correspondence holds to all orders in perturbation theory, including arbitrary numbers of interaction vertices and loops.</description>

      <title>Constraining the Primordial Black Hole Abundance with Space-Based Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05069v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Overdense regions can collapse into primordial black holes (PBHs) in the early universe, which are a compelling candidate for dark matter. Current constraints leave the asteroid-mass window the only possible one for PBH to account for all the dark matter, which can only be probed indirectly by the scalar-induced gravitational waves (GWs) sourced by the curvature perturbation which forms PBH. In this work, we explore the capabilities of future space-based gravitational wave detectors, including LISA, Taiji, and TianQin, to constrain such induced GWs as well as the PBH abundance. We systematically account for the width of the primordial curvature power spectrum, and find that the asteroid-mass window can be fully probed by all three space-based interferometers. If PBHs constitute the majority of dark matter, the induced GW leaves a strong signal in the mHz band with a signal-to-noise ratio of $10^3$--$10^4$.</description>

      <title>QCD phase-transition under the light of Thermofractal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08735v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The deconfining transition in $SU(3)$ gauge theory, traditionally interpreted through the Gross-Witten-Wadia (GWW) model as a sharp third-order phase transition in the large-$N_c$ limit, appears as a smooth crossover in lattice QCD. This work demonstrates that the transition is topologically smoothed into a crossover by incorporating the fractal momentum space structure inherent to thermofractals. By matching the non-extensive $\beta$-function to one-loop QCD results, a fundamental scaling of the thermofractal index $q$ is derived as a function of the number of flavours $N_f$. It is proven that applying a $q$-deformed derivative operator $\mathcal{D}_q$ to the $q$-logarithm of the eigenvalue distance results in a non-extensive measure that effectively smears the topological stiffness of the gauge vacuum. A unified master equation for the Polyakov loop $\langle L \rangle$ is presented, governed by the thermofractal index $q$ and a single variance parameter $\sigma^2(T)$ that scales as $T^{1/(q-1)}$. The observed phase dynamics are shown to be asymptotic limits of this unified density: a ``soft'' algebraic growth $\langle L \rangle \propto T^{11}$ in the 1D string-like confined regime for $N_f=0$, and a rapid $1 - \langle L \rangle \propto T^{-21}$ suppression in the 3D deconfined volume for $N_f=3$. This approach provides a microscopic foundation for partial deconfinement theory and reproduces lattice QCD data with a reduced $\chi^2 \approx 1.12$, offering a rigorous reconciliation between matrix model topology and the continuous QCD crossover.</description>
