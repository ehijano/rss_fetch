      <title>On the Structure of Black Bounces Sourced by Anisotropic Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The field equations of static, spherically symmetric geometries generated by anisotropic fluids is investigated with the aim of better understanding the relation between the matter and the emergence of minimal area throats, like in wormhole and black bounce scenarios. Imposing some simplifying restrictions on the matter, which amounts to considering nonlinear electromagnetic sources, we find analytical expressions that allow one to design the type of sought geometries. We illustrate our analysis with several examples, including an asymmetric, bounded black bounce spacetime which reproduces the standard Reissner-Nordstrom geometry on the outside all the way down to the throat.</description>

      <title>Clear skies ahead: characterizing atmospheric gravity gradient noise for vertical atom interferometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Terrestrial long-baseline atom interferometer experiments are emerging as powerful tools for probing new fundamental physics, including searches for dark matter and gravitational waves. In the frequency range relevant to these signals, gravity gradient noise (GGN) poses a significant challenge. While previous studies for vertical instruments have focused on GGN induced by seismic waves, atmospheric fluctuations in pressure and temperature also lead to variations in local gravity. In this work, we advance the understanding of atmospheric GGN in vertical atom interferometers, formulating a robust characterization of its impact. We evaluate the effectiveness of underground placement of atom interferometers as a passive noise mitigation strategy. Additionally, we empirically derive global high- and low-noise models for atmospheric pressure GGN and estimate an analogous range for atmospheric temperature GGN. To highlight the variability of temperature-induced noise, we compare data from two prospective experimental sites. Our findings establish atmospheric GGN as comparable to seismic noise in its impact and underscore the importance of including these effects in site selection and active noise monitoring for future experiments.</description>

      <title>Scalar perturbation and density contrast evolution in $f(Q,C)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The symmetric teleparallel theory offers an alternative gravitational formulation which can elucidate events in the early and late universe without requiring the physical existence of dark matter or dark energy. In this formalism, $f(Q, C)$ gravity has been recently introduced by incorporating the boundary term $C$ with the non-metricity scalar $Q$. In this paper, we develop the theory of cosmological scalar perturbation for $f(Q, C)$ gravity, and retrieve that of $f(\mathring{R})$ and $f(Q)$ gravity from our result. The analysis assumes a model-independent approach within these theories that adheres to the conventional continuity equation at the background level. We derive the density contrast equation by employing some standard cosmological approximations, where the $f(Q, C)$ theory is encoded in the effective Newtonian constant $G_{eff}$. Finally, we derive the evolution equation of density growth $f_g$.</description>

      <title>Interacting Barrow Holographic Dark Energy in Non-flat Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Barrow holographic dark energy model is an extension of holographic dark energy that incorporates modifications to entropy due to quantum gravitational effects. In this work we study the cosmological properties of interacting Barrow holographic dark energy model in the case of non-zero curvature universe. We construct the differential equations governing the evolution of the Barrow holographic dark energy density parameter and the dark matter density parameter in coupled form for both closed and open spatial geometry. Considering three different forms of coupling, we obtain the corresponding analytical expressions for the equation of state parameter for the dark energy component. We confront the scenario using recent observational datasets like cosmic chronometer and Pantheon data. It has been found that the strength of interaction as well as the curvature contribution come out to be nonzero which indicates that a non-flat interacting scenario is preferred by observational data.</description>

      <title>Circular orbits and thin accretion disk around a quantum corrected black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we fist consider the shadow radius of a quantum corrected black hole proposed recently, and provide a bound on the correction parameter based on the observational data of Sgr A*. Then, the effects of the correction parameter on the energy, angular momenta and angular velocities of particles on circular orbits in the accretion disk are discussed. It is found that the correction parameter has significant effects on the angular momenta of particles on the circular orbits even in the far region from the black hole. It would be possible to identify the value of the correction parameter by the observations of the angular momenta of particles in the disk. It is also found that the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit increase with the increase of the correction parameter, while the radiative efficiency of the black hole decreases with the increase of the correction parameter. Finally, we consider how the correction parameter affect the emitted and observed radiation fluxes from a thin accretion disk around the black hole. Polynomial fitting functions are identified for the relations between the maxima of three typical radiation fluxes and the correction parameter.</description>

      <title>Semiclassical world is one of infinite many cloneworlds in common spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider $N$ clones of the quantized world, interacting with each other via quantum gravity, coupled by the downscaled Newton constant $G/N$. In the limit $N\rightarrow\infty$, we obtain the semiclassical Einstein equation for every single cloneworld. In the non-relativistic limit, De Filippo had already obtained the semiclassical Schr\"odinger-Newton equation. Extension for the general relativistic case is the main goal of the present work. We compare our simple correlated cloneworlds with Stamp's correlated worldlines and show why they differ despite the conceptual similarity.</description>

      <title>Are regular black holes from pure gravity classified within the same thermodynamical topology?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Regular black holes, which avoid the essential center singularities, can be constructed through various methods, including nonlinear electrodynamics and quantum corrections. Recently, it was shown that via an infinite tower of higher-curvature corrections, one can obtain different regular black hole solutions in any spacetime dimension $D\geq 5$. Utilizing the concept of thermodynamical topology, we examine these black holes as topological thermodynamic defects, classifying them into distinct topological categories based on their generalized free energy. We find that the Hawking temperature of the black hole has at least one zero point at the small horizon radius limit. Under this fact, the regular black holes generated through the purely gravitational theories exhibit universal thermodynamical behaviors, strongly suggesting they belong to the same topological class. We presents a comprehensive analysis of these properties, providing a clearer understanding of the fundamental nature of regular black holes and their classification within the framework of thermodynamical topology.</description>

      <title>Probing Gravity -- Fundamental Aspects of Metric Theories and their Implications for Tests of General Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Guided by the Einstein equivalence principle that identifies the phenomenon of gravitation as a manifestation of the dynamics of spacetime in contrast to a localizable force, we review and explore its consequences on formulating a theory of gravity. The resulting space of metric theories of gravity may address open conceptual and observational puzzles through a wealth of effects beyond general relativity, whose traces can be searched for within today's and tomorrow's gravitational testing grounds. Above all, we offer a generic metric theory generalization of Isaacson's approach to the leading-order field equations of physical perturbations with a well-defined notion of energy-momentum carried by the gravitational waves. Within this framework, we identify the backreaction of the Isaacson energy-momentum flux onto the background spacetime with the displacement memory effect that induces a permanent distortion of space after the passage of a gravitational wave. This effect is a well-known prediction of GR whose dominant contribution captures its inherent non-linear nature, manifest in the ability of gravity to gravitate. However, the novel interpretation of memory as naturally arising within the Isaacson approach to gravitational waves comes with two main advantages. Firstly, it allows for a unified understanding of both the null and the ordinary memory effect, which are respectively sourced by unbound energy fluxes that do and do not reach asymptotic null infinity. Secondly, and most importantly, this approach allows for a consistent derivation of the memory formula for a large class of metric theories with considerable lessons to be learned for upcoming future measurements of the memory effect.</description>

      <title>Lecture Notes in Loop Quantum Gravity. LN2: Cauchy problems and pre-quantum states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the structure of covariant equations, relating analytical properties of solutions to algebraic properties of the corresponding differential operator, specifically of its principal symbol. The principal symbol and its globality is discussed for a general quasi-linear PDE system, regardless the algebraic structure the configuration space can have. We also discuss how the typical relativistic model can be under-determined and over-determined at the same time as well as how one can define out of it a well-posed Cauchy problem. This issue leads us to pre-quantum configurations and Cauchy bubbles as the way to set up evolution problems in a compact region of spacetime, taking into account that relativistic models are defined on bare manifolds. The typical application we shall sketch is standard GR.</description>

      <title>Chaotic motion of the charged test particle in Kerr-MOG black hole with explicit symplectic algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Kerr-MOG black hole has attracted widespread research interest and has been widely used in fields such as galaxy rotation curves, gravitational lensing in galaxy clusters, and the formation of large-scale structures in the universe. In this paper, we mainly focus on dynamics of the charged particle around Kerr-MOG black hole. At first, the field equations for the charged particle under the Scalar-Tensor-Vector Gravity (STVG) theory are presented. Then, according to the characteristics of the Hamiltonian system, the Hamiltonian can be decomposed into five integrable parts, and three kinds of explicit symplectic algorithms are constructed. Numerical experiments show that the $PR{K_6}4$ algorithm is the optimal one. At last, the Poincar\'e section and the fast Lyapunov indicator (FLI) are used to explore dynamic evolution of the particle. From the numerical results, it is easy to find that the energy $E$, the angular momentum $L$, the magnetic field parameter $\beta$, the black hole spin parameter $a$, and the gravitational field strength parameter $\alpha$ have an impact on the motion of the particle. In particular, the chaotic region increases as $E$, $\beta$, or $\alpha$ increases, but decreases with the increases of $a$ or $L$. Moreover, when any two of the five parameters are applied simultaneously, it is easy to observe that $a$ and $L$ play a dominant role.</description>

      <title>Frolov Black Hole Surrounded by Quintessence -- I: Thermodynamics, Geodesics and Shadows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Frolov black hole (BH) is a charged extension of the Hayward BH, having regularity at the central point $r = 0$ and an asymptotically Schwarzschild form for large values of $r$. Such a BH is parameterized by a length scale parameter, $\alpha_0$. In this paper, we analyze the thermodynamic properties, null and timelike geodesics, and shadows of a Frolov BH immersed in a quintessence field. Our results indicate that the smaller BH is locally thermodynamically stable yet globally unstable at all horizon radii. Neither the quintessence parameter nor the other model parameters like the charge $q$ and length scale parameter $\alpha_0$ change this global instability. We extend the study of the null and timelike geodesics to the vicinity of the BH by analyzing how the geodesic motion depends on the model parameters. A strong quintessence field exerts a repulsive effect in the case of null geodesics, while in contrast the precession of timelike orbits is least affected by the parameter associated with the quintessence field. Finally, we analyze the shadow of the BH system and find that the shadow radii are sensitively dependent on model parameters. In contrast the influence of the quintessence parameter itself on the size of the shadow is found to be rather weak.</description>

      <title>Mechanisms Behind the Aschenbach Effect in Non-Rotating Black Hole Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: General relativity predicts that a rotating black hole drags the spacetime due to its spin. This effect can influence the motion of nearby objects, causing them to either fall into the black hole or orbit around it. In classical Newtonian mechanics, as the radius of the orbit increases, the angular velocity of an object in a stable circular orbit decreases. However, Aschenbach discovered that for a hypothetical non-rotating observer, contrary to usual behavior, the angular velocity increases with radius in certain regions. Although the possibility of observing rare and less probable rotational behaviors in a rotating structure is not unlikely or impossible. However, observing such behaviors in a static structure is not only intriguing but also thought-provoking, as it raises questions about the factors that might play a role in such phenomena. In seeking answers to this question, various static models, particularly in the context of nonlinear fields, were examined, with some results presented as examples in the article. Among the models studied, the model of Magnetic Black Holes in 4D Einstein Gauss Bonnet Massive Gravity Coupled to Nonlinear Electrodynamics (M-EGB-Massive) appears to be a candidate for this phenomenon. In the analysis section, we will discuss the commonalities of this model with previous models that have exhibited this phenomenon and examine the cause of this phenomenon. Finally, we will state whether this phenomenon is observable in other black holes and, if not, why</description>

      <title>A geometric template bank for the detection of spinning low-mass compact binaries with moderate orbital eccentricity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compact binaries on eccentric orbits are another class of gravitational-wave (GW) sources that can provide a wealth of information on binary formation pathways and astrophysical environments. However, historically, eccentricity is often neglected in modelled GW searches for compact binaries. We show that currently used modelled searches that employ quasi-circular template banks are highly ineffectual in detecting binary neutron star (BNS) and neutron star--black hole (NSBH) systems with orbital eccentricities in the range of $[10^{-5},0.15]$ at a GW frequency of $15$Hz. For populations of moderately eccentric BNS and NSBH binaries with (anti-)aligned component spins, we demonstrate that quasi-circular template banks fail to detect up to $\sim 40\%$ of such systems. To alleviate these inefficiencies, we develop the first \emph{geometric} template bank for the search of BNSs and NSBH binaries that includes masses, (anti-)aligned spins and moderate eccentricity. Utilising the post-Newtonian inspiral waveform {\tt TaylorF2Ecc} and a global coordinate transformation, we construct a globally flat metric to efficiently place eccentric templates. Our geometric template bank is highly effectual, and significantly improves the recovery of eccentric signals with less than $6\%$ of signals missed due to the finite template spacing in the bank.</description>

      <title>Cosmology with the matter component decaying faster than radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The impact of a fast decaying component of mass-energy, that decreases faster than radiation with the increase of the scale factor, on the evolution of the universe is studied using a hydrodynamic approach. Proceeding from the Hamiltonian formalism, the hydrodynamic-like equations for the velocity and acceleration of the expansion of the universe as a function of conformal time are obtained. The influence of a fast decaying component on the dynamics of the expansion of the universe is determined by the sign of its contribution to the total energy density of the system. The effects of this component are illustrated by figures.</description>

      <title>Revise the Dark Matter-Phantom Scalar Field Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cosmological history and evolution are examined for gravitational models with interaction in the dark sector of the universe. In particular, we consider the dark energy to be described by a phantom scalar field and the dark matter $\rho _{m}$ as a pressureless ideal gas. We introduce the interacting function $Q=\beta \left( t\right) \rho_{m}$, where the function $% \beta \left( t\right) $ is considered to be proportional to $\dot{\phi},~% \dot{\phi}^{2}H^{-1},~H$, or a constant parameter with dimensions of $\left[ H_{0}\right] $. For the four interacting models, we study in details the phase space by calculating the stationary points. The latter are applied to reconstruct the cosmological evolution. Compactified variables are essential to understand the complete picture of the phase space and to conclude about the cosmological viability of these interacting models. The detailed analysis is performed for the exponential potential $V\left( \phi \right) =V_{0}e^{\lambda \phi }$. The effects of other scalar field potential functions on the cosmological dynamics are examined.</description>

      <title>Monodromy eigenvalues of the radial Teukolsky equation and their connection to the renormalized angular momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Teukolsky equation describes perturbations of Kerr spacetime and is central to the study of rotating black holes and gravitational waves. In the frequency domain, the Teukolsky equation separates into radial and angular ordinary differential equations. Mano, Suzuki, and Takasugi (MST) found semi-analytic solutions to the homogeneous radial Teukolsky equation in terms of series of analytic special functions. The MST expansions hinge on an auxiliary parameter known as the renormalized angular momentum $\nu$, which one must calculate to ensure the convergence of these series solutions. In this work, we present a method for calculating $\nu$ via monodromy eigenvalues, which capture the behavior of ordinary differential equations and their solutions in the complex domain near their singular points. We directly relate the monodromy data of the radial Teukolsky equation to the parameter $\nu$ and provide a numerical scheme for calculating $\nu$ based on monodromy. With this method we evaluate $\nu$ in different regions of parameter space and analyze the numerical stability of this approach. We also highlight how, through $\nu$, monodromy data are linked to scattering amplitudes for generic (linear) perturbations of Kerr spacetime.</description>

      <title>Gravitational capture cross-section in Zipoy-Voorhees spacetimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider geodesics of massive and massless test particles in the gravitational field of a static and axisymmetric compact object described by the quadrupolar metric ($q$-metric), which is the simplest generalization of the Schwarzschild metric, containing an independent quadrupole parameter $q$. We analyze the effective potential profile and calculate the orbital parameters and capture cross-sections of test particles in this spacetime. Moreover, we derive the explicit expression for the escape angle of photons as a function of the quadrupole parameter. All the results reduce in the corresponding limit of vanishing quadrupole to the well-known case of the Schwarzschild spacetime. We argue that our results could be used to investigate realistic compact objects such as white dwarfs and neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Tidal effects in gravitational waves from neutron stars in scalar-tensor theories of gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute tidal signatures in the gravitational waves (GWs) from neutron star binary inspirals in scalar-tensor gravity, where the dominant adiabatic even-parity tidal interactions involve three types of Love numbers that depend on the matter equation of state and parameters of the gravitational theory. We calculate the modes of the GW amplitudes and the phase evolution in the time and frequency domain, working up to first order in the post-Newtonian and small finite-size approximations. We also perform several case studies to quantify the dipolar and quadrupolar tidal effects and their parameter dependencies specialized to Gaussian couplings. We show that various tidal contributions enter with different signs and scalings with frequency, which generally leads to smaller net tidal GW imprints than for the same binary system in General Relativity.</description>

      <title>A note on the gravitational dark matter production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark matter, one of the fundamental components of the universe, has remained mysterious in modern cosmology and particle physics, and hence, this field is of utmost importance at present moment. One of the foundational questions is the origin of dark matter which directly links with its creation. In the present article we study the gravitational production of dark matter in two distinct contexts: firstly, when reheating occurs through the gravitational particle production, and secondly, when it is driven by the inflaton's decay. We establish a connection between the reheating temperature and the mass of dark matter, and from the reheating bounds, we determine the range of viable dark matter mass values.</description>

      <title>Geometric distances between closed universes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The large-scale structure of the universe is well-approximated by the Friedmann equations, parameterised by several energy densities which can be observationally inferred. A natural question to ask is: how different would the universe be if these densities took on other values? While there are many ways this can be approached depending on interpretation and mathematical rigour, we attempt an answer by building a "history space" of different cosmologies. A metric is introduced after overcoming technical hurdles related to Lorentzian signature and infinite volume, at least for topologically-closed cases. Geodesics connecting two points on the superspace are computed to express how distant -- in a purely geometric sense -- two universes are. Age can be treated as a free parameter in such an approach, leading to a more general mathematical construct relative to geometrodynamical configuration-space. Connections to bubble inflation and phase transitions are explored.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we briefly review the adiabatic renormalization program for spin 1/2 fields in expanding universes. We introduce the method and provide explicit expressions for the renormalized vacuum expectation value of the stress-energy tensor. Then, we discuss its application to some cosmological scenario of physical interest. We end up sketching out the proof that adiabatic and DeWitt-Schwinger point-splitting schemes provide the same renormalized expectation values of the stress-energy tensor for Dirac fields.</description>

      <title>On the Motion of Compact Objects in Relativistic Viscous Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a world-line effective field theory of compact objects moving relativistically through a viscous fluid. The theory is valid when velocity gradients are small compared to the inverse size of the object. Working within the EFT eliminates the need to solve a boundary value problem by turning all interactions between the fluid and the object into a source term in the action. We use the EFT to derive the relativistic equations of motion for a compact object immersed in a viscous fluid in a curved background.</description>

      <title>Faint Radio Signals from Very High-Frequency Gravitational Waves in the Strong Astrophysical Magnetic Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) may convert into photons in a magnetic field (MF) through the Gertsenshtein-Zeldovich (GZ) effect. The properties of the MF significantly influence this conversion probability. Although interstellar and interplanetary magnetic fields are vast, their low intensities result in limited conversion probabilities. Here, we confirm that strong MFs in neutron stars significantly increase this conversion probability. We use single-dish telescopes FAST, TMRT, QTT, and GBT, as well as the radio interferometers SKA1-MID and SKA2-MID, to estimate the detection potential of very high-frequency (VHF) GWs. We infer two types of signals in the $10^{6}-10^{11}\mathrm{~Hz}$ radio waveband: transient and persistent signals. We propose three criteria for distinguishing signals from other astrophysical signals while identifying different GW sources. We derive the expected intrinsic spectral line shapes for gravitons by considering their mass and spin in quantum field theory (QFT). These are smooth, continuous lines that don't have any absorption or emission features. FAST has the highest sensitivity in single-dish telescopes for detecting VHF GWs, it provides a bound on the characteristic strain at $h_c&lt;10^{-23}$ near $h_c=10^{-24}$ within $\left[1\mathrm{~GHz}, 3\mathrm{~GHz}\right]$ with 6 hours of observation time. This exceeds the threshold for detecting VHF GWs produced by primordial black holes (PBHs) with over $5\sigma$ confidence and approaches the Big Bang nucleosynthesis bound. Moreover, SKA2-MID has greater detection potential. Detection of such GWs would enhance our understanding of cosmological models, refine the PBH parameter spaces, and serve as a test for QFT.</description>

      <title>A Search for Low-Mass Neutron Stars in the Third Observing Run of Advanced LIGO and Virgo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most observed neutron stars have masses around 1.4 $M_\odot$, consistent with current formation mechanisms. To date, no sub-solar mass neutron star has been observed. Observing a low-mass neutron star would be a significant milestone, providing crucial constraints on the nuclear equation of state, unveiling a new population of neutron stars, and advancing the study of their formation processes and underlying mechanisms. We present the first targeted search for tidally deformed sub-solar mass binary neutron stars (BNS), with primary masses ranging from 0.1 to 2 $M_\odot$ and secondary masses from 0.1 to 1 $M_\odot$, using data from the third observing run of the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo gravitational-wave detectors. We account for the tidal deformabilities of up to $O(10^4)$ of these systems, as low-mass neutron stars are more easily distorted by their companions' gravitational forces. Previous searches that neglect tidal deformability lose sensitivity to low-mass sources, potentially missing more than $\sim30\%$ of detectable signals from a system with a chirp mass of 0.6 $M_\odot$ binaries. No statistically significant detections were made. In the absence of a detection, we place a $90\%$ confidence upper limit on the local merger rate for sub-solar mass BNS systems, constraining it to be $&lt; 6.4\times10^4$ Gpc$^{-3}$Yr$^{-1}$ for a chirp mass of 0.2 $M_\odot$ and $&lt; 2.2\times 10^3$ Gpc$^{-3}$Yr$^{-1}$ for 0.7 $M_\odot$. With future upgrades to detector sensitivity, development of next-generation detectors, and ongoing improvements in search pipelines, constraints on the minimum mass of neutron stars will improve, providing the potential to constrain the nuclear equation of state, reveal new insights into neutron star formation channels, and potentially identify new classes of stars.</description>

      <title>Black hole pulsars and monster shocks as outcomes of black hole-neutron star mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The merger of a black hole (BH) and a neutron star (NS) in most cases is expected to leave no material around the remnant BH; therefore, such events are often considered as sources of gravitational waves without electromagnetic counterparts. However, a bright counterpart can emerge if the NS is strongly magnetized, as its external magnetosphere can experience radiative shocks and magnetic reconnection during/after the merger. We use magnetohydrodynamic simulations in the dynamical spacetime of a merging BH-NS binary to investigate its magnetospheric dynamics. We find that the magnetosphere develops compressive waves that steepen into shocks. After swallowing the NS, the BH acquires a magnetosphere that quickly evolves into a split monopole configuration and then undergoes an exponential decay (balding), enabled by magnetic reconnection and also assisted by the ring-down of the remnant BH. This spinning BH drags the split monopole into rotation, forming a transient pulsar-like state. It emits a striped wind if the swallowed magnetic dipole moment is inclined to the spin axis. We predict two types of transients from this scenario: (1) a fast radio burst emitted by the shocks as they expand to large radii and (2) an X/gamma-ray burst emitted by the $e^\pm$ outflow heated by magnetic dissipation.</description>

      <title>Implications of latest NICER data for the neutron star equation of state</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As an update to our previously performed Bayesian inference analyses of the neutron star matter equation-of-state and related quantities, the additional impact of the recently published NICER data of PSR J0437-4751 is examined. Including the mass and radius distributions of this pulsar in our data base results in modest shifts from previously inferred median posterior values of radii $R$ and central densities $n_c$ for representative $1.4\,M_\odot$ and $2.1\,M_\odot$ neutron stars: radii are reduced by about $0.2-0.3$ km to values of $R_{1.4} = 12.1\pm 0.5$ km and $R_{2.1} = 11.9^{+0.5}_{-0.6}$ km (at the 68\% level); central densities increase slightly to values of $n_c(1.4\,M_\odot)/n_0 = 2.8\pm 0.3$ and $n_c(2.1\,M_\odot)/n_0 = 3.8_{-0.7}^{+0.6}$ (in units of equilibrium nuclear matter density, $n_0 = 0.16$ fm$^{-3}$), i.e., they still fall below five times nuclear saturation density at the 68\% level. As a further significant result, the evidence established by analyzing Bayes factors for a negative trace anomaly measure, $\Delta = 1/3-P/\varepsilon &lt; 0$, inside heavy neutron stars is raised to strong.</description>

      <title>Axion-photon-mixing dark matter conversion mediated by torsion mass constrained by the Barbero-Immirzi parameter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the Standard Model\,(SM) of particle physics, photon-torsion mixing is extended to include the Einstein-Cartan portal to dark-photon-axion-torsion mixing beyond the Standard Model\,(BSM), mediated by torsion. The Barbero-Immirzi(BI) parameter, of the order of $10^{-31}$, is more stringent than those obtained by Aliberti and Lambiase using matter-antimatter asymmetry. This paper presents the coupling of the SM with dark matter\,(DM) axions, both mediated by torsion. We discuss tordions, the quanta of torsion, and the damping of propagating torsion. It is shown that with both kinds of vectorial torsion masses, equations from Einstein-Cartan-Holst gravity can be derived, which reduce to axionic photon equations where torsion appears only through its mass spectrum. Photon-axion conversions and axion mixing are found to depend on the BI parameter. This study demonstrates that when the spin-0 torsion mass is finite and Proca electrodynamics is not ghost-free, dark axion masses align with spin-0 torsion masses via axion-driven torsion and photon-torsion mixing. Our results provide innovative insights into Proca gravity models and the role of torsion in photon-axion conversion and dark matter dynamics, thereby offering a solid foundation for future research and new theoretical frameworks in quantum gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the expectation that relativistic symmetries might acquire quantum features in Quantum Gravity, we take the first steps towards a theory of ''Doubly'' Quantum Mechanics, a modification of Quantum Mechanics in which the geometrical configurations of physical systems, measurement apparata, and reference frame transformations are themselves quantized and described by ''geometry'' states in a Hilbert space. We develop the formalism for spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ measurements by promoting the group of spatial rotations $SU(2)$ to the quantum group $SU_q(2)$ and generalizing the axioms of Quantum Theory in a covariant way. As a consequence of our axioms, the notion of probability becomes a self-adjoint operator acting on the Hilbert space of geometry states, hence acquiring novel non-classical features. After introducing a suitable class of semi-classical geometry states, which describe near-to-classical geometrical configurations of physical systems, we find that probability measurements are affected, in these configurations, by intrinsic uncertainties stemming from the quantum properties of $SU_q(2)$. This feature translates into an unavoidable fuzziness for observers attempting to align their reference frames by exchanging qubits, even when the number of exchanged qubits approaches infinity, contrary to the standard $SU(2)$ case.</description>

Abstract: We construct wavefunctions for unitary irreducible representations (UIRs) of the Bondi-Metzner-Sachs (BMS) group, i.e. BMS particles, and show that they describe quantum superpositions of (Poincar\'e) particles propagating on inequivalent gravity vacua. This follows from reconsidering McCarthy's classification of BMS group UIRs through a unique, Lorentz-invariant but non-linear, decomposition of supermomenta into hard and soft pieces.</description>

      <title>Aspects of supersymmetry breaking driven inflation in orbifold models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider gravitationally induced corrections to inflaton potentials driven by supersymmetry breaking in a five-dimensional supergravity, compactified on a $ S_1/Z_2 $ orbifold. The supersymmetry breaking takes place on the hidden brane and is transmitted to the visible brane through finite one loop graphs giving rise to an inflaton potential which includes gravitationally induced terms. These corrections are significant for inflationary cosmology and have the potential to modify the predictions of widely studied supergravity models if the latter are embedded in this framework. To explore these effects we examine two classes of models those inspired by no-scale supergravity models and $\alpha$-attractors. Both models are compatible with current cosmological observations but face chalenges in reconciling enhanced values for the scalar power spectrum $ P_\zeta$ with cosmological data, particularly regarding the tensor to scalar ratio $r$. In fact $ P_\zeta \gtrsim 10^{-2}$ results to $ r &gt; \mathcal{O} (0.1) $, outside the limits put by current data.</description>

      <title>More on thermal holographic RG flows in a 3D gauged supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We continue our studies of holographic renormalization group (RG) flows for a 3d truncated supergravity model, the scalar potential of which can have either one or three extrema depending on the radius of the target manifold. We construct numerically and analytically thermal holographic RG flows, which are described by asymptotically AdS$_3$ black holes (non-rotating BTZ) characterized by the value of the scalar field on the horizon. We find two classes of RG flows with monotonic and non-monotonic behavior of the scalar field. The first one exists for both types of the potential, while the second one appears only for the potential with three extrema. For the slowly changing scalar field we find a special class of RG flows, which are described by the scalar field in the BTZ black hole geometry. For such flows we present an analytic solution for the scalar field from the horizon to the boundary. We discuss thermodynamical properties of the constructed holographic RG flows.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the bispectrum of primordial density perturbations in CMB to second order in the slow-roll parameters of single field inflation. We found a large logarithmic contribution which is at least of the same order as the leading order result and can lead to an enhancement by an order of magnitude in a large class of models, including hilltop inflation.</description>

      <title>Can decaying vacuum solve the H_0 Tension?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present work we analyze two different models of interaction between dark energy and dark matter, also known as vacuum decay models or $\Lambda(t)$CDM models. In both models, when the $H_0$ parameter is constrained by the Planck distance priors, its value is compatible with a higher value of $H_0$, in agreement with SH0ES data, while simultaneously reducing the values of $\Omega_m$ and $\Omega_b$. In both models, we find $H_0=73.1\pm0.86$ at 68\% c.l. by combining Planck+SH0ES data. We also find the decay parameter to be $\varepsilon=0.0197^{+0.0032}_{-0.0027}$ for one model and $\varepsilon=0.0203\pm0.0034$ for the other one. From these analyses, a noninteracting model is excluded at least at $6\sigma$ c.l.! This shows that these types of models are promising in solving or at least alleviating the $H_0$ tension problem. Our analysis also shows a preference for the decay of vacuum into dark matter, in agreement to thermodynamic analyses.</description>

      <title>How Well Do We Know the Scalar-Induced Gravitational Waves?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves sourced by amplified scalar perturbations are a common prediction across a wide range of cosmological models. These scalar curvature fluctuations are inherently nonlinear and typically non-Gaussian. We argue that the effects of non-Gaussianity may not always be adequately captured by an expansion around a Gaussian field, expressed through nonlinear parameters such as $f_{\rm{NL}}$. As a consequence, the resulting amplitude of the stochastic gravitational wave background may differ significantly from predictions based on the standard quadratic source model routinely used in the literature.</description>

      <title>Probing the equation of state of neutron stars with captured primordial black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.06645v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) from primordial black holes (PBHs) inspiraling within neutron stars (NSs) -- should they exist -- are detectable by ground-based detectors and offer a unique insight into the internal structure of NSs. To provide accurate templates for GW searches, we solve Einstein's equations within NSs and calculate the orbital motion of the captured PBH by considering dynamical friction, accretion, and gravitational radiation. Equipped with precise GW waveforms for PBHs inspiraling inside NSs, we find that the Einstein Telescope can differentiate between various equations of state for NSs. As PBHs inspiral deeper into NSs, the GW frequency rises near the surface, then decreases to a constant value deeper within NSs. The distinctive characteristics of GW frequency serve as the smoking gun for GW signals emitted by PBHs inspiraling inside NSs and can be used to probe the nuclear matter in the crust and core of NSs.</description>

      <title>Aschenbach effect and circular orbits in static and spherically symmetric black hole backgrounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.11883v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Aschenbach effect, the increasing behavior of the angular velocity of a timelike circular orbit with its radius coordinate, is found to extensively exist in rapidly spinning black holes to a zero-angular-momentum observer. It also has potential observation in the high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations of X-ray flux. However, observing such effect remains to be a challenge in static and spherically symmetric black hole backgrounds. In this paper, we mainly focus on such issue. Starting with the geodesics, we analytically study the underlying properties of the timelike circular orbits, and show the conditions under which the Aschenbach effect survives. It is shown that the presence of the static point orbits and stable photon spheres would be the indicator of the Aschenbach effect. We then apply it to three characteristic black holes exhibiting different features. The results state that this effect is absent for both the Schwarzschild and Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black holes. While, for the dyonic black hole in quasi-topological electromagnetics, there indeed exists the Aschenbach effect. This provides a first example that such effect exists in a non-spinning black hole background. Moreover, it also uncovers an intriguing property for understanding the black holes in nonlinear electrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic nature of black holes in coexistence region</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.11886v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Studying the system state of coexistence regions will peek into to reveal microscopic interactions between different phases of a thermodynamic system. However, there is no effective method to study thermodynamic nature of the coexistence black hole regions for the failure of the equation of state. Aiming at these coexistence states, in this work, we develop a general approach by introducing two new ratio parameters. The first one is the ratio of the horizon radii of the saturated coexistence small and large black holes, and the second one measures that of the small black hole molecule number to the total molecule number. We demonstrate that the first parameter can serve as an order parameter to characterize the first-order phase transition. The study also shows that the black hole state in the coexistence region is uniquely determined by these two introduced parameters bounded between 0 and 1. These results are quite significant in the analytical study of phase transition and the microscopic nature of black hole in the coexistence regions.</description>

      <title>Unifying Ordinary and Null Memory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05936v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on a recently proposed reinterpretation of gravitational wave memory that builds up on the definition of gravitational waves pioneered by Isaacson, we provide a unifying framework to derive both ordinary and null memory from a single well-defined equation at leading order in the asymptotic expansion. This allows us to formulate a memory equation that is valid for any unbound asymptotic energy-flux that preserves local Lorentz invariance. Using Horndeski gravity as a concrete example metric theory with an additional potentially massive scalar degree of freedom in the gravitational sector, the general memory formula is put into practice by presenting the first account of the memory correction sourced by the emission of massive field waves. Throughout the work, physical degrees of freedom are identified by constructing manifestly gauge invariant perturbation variables within an SVT decomposition on top of the asymptotic Minkowski background, which will in particular prove useful in future studies of gravitational wave memory within vector tensor theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03909v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive the full spacetime metric of a generalized uncertainty-inspired quantum black hole. We examine a previous model of the interior in this approach and show that extending its metric to the full spacetime leads to serious issues in the asymptotic region. To remedy this, we introduce an ``improved scheme'' mimicking a similar prescription used in loop quantum gravity, where the quantum parameters are made momentum-dependent. Under this scheme, we rework the interior of the black hole and extend it to the full spacetime. We find that the resulting metric is asymptotically flat and its associated Kretschmann scalar is regular everywhere. We also show that the null expansion and Raychaudhuri equation are regular everywhere in this spacetime, implying that the classical singularity is resolved.</description>

      <title>Modified Compton Effect and CMB Anisotropy</title>

Abstract: Recent satellite observations have revealed significant anisotropy in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation, a phenomenon that had previously been detected but received limited attention due to its subtlety. With the advent of more precise measurements from satellites, the extent of this anisotropy has become increasingly apparent. This paper examines the CMB radiation by reviewing past research on the causes of CMB anisotropy and presents a new model to explain the observed temperature anisotropy and the anisotropy in the correlation function between temperature and E-mode polarization in the CMB radiation. The proposed model is based on a modified-generalized Compton scattering approach incorporating Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG). We begin by describing the generalized Compton scattering and then discuss the CMB radiation in the context of processes occurring at the last scattering surface. Our findings are derived from the latest observational data from the Planck satellite (2018). In our model, besides the parameters available in the Planck data for the standard model ($\Lambda$CDM), we introduce two novel parameters: $\delta_{L}$, the density of cosmic electrons, and $M^2$, a parameter related to the modified-generalized Compton scattering effects. The results indicate that, based on the 2018 Planck data, small values were obtained for $\delta_{L}$ and $M^{2}$, $\delta_{L}=1.63\pm0.08(10^{-13})$ and $M^2=2.28\pm0.34(10^{-4})$, showing no significant deviation from the standard model. Moreover, increasing the values of $\delta_{L}$ and $M^{2}$ leads to an increase in the range of fluctuations in the CMB temperature anisotropy power spectrum and the correlation function between temperature and E-mode polarization for multipoles $l&lt;500$ until the first peak.</description>

      <title>The Existence and Distribution of Photon Spheres Near Spherically Symmetric Black Holes -- A Geometric Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14035v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photon sphere has attracted significant attention since the discovery of black hole shadow images by Event Horizon Telescope. Recently, a number of studies have highlighted that the number of photon spheres and their distributions near black holes are strongly constrained by black hole properties. Specifically, for black holes with event horizons and proper asymptotic behaviors, the number of stable and unstable photon spheres satisfies the relation $n_{\text{stable}} - n_{\text{unstable}} = -1$. In this study, we provide a novel proof on this relation using a completely new geometric approach, in which the stable and unstable photon spheres are determined by Gaussian curvature and geodesic curvature in the optical geometry of black hole spacetimes. Firstly, we demonstrated the existence of photon spheres near black holes with proper asymptotic behaviors (asymptotically flat black holes, asymptotically de-Sitter and anti-de-Sitter black holes). Subsequently, we proved that the stable and unstable photon spheres near black holes must be one-to-one alternatively separated from each other, such that each unstable photon sphere is sandwiched between two stable photon spheres (and each stable photon sphere is sandwiched between two unstable photon spheres). Our analysis in this study is limited to the spherically symmetric black hole spacetime (with the spacetime metric $ds^{2}=g_{tt}dt^{2}+g_{rr}dr^{2}+g_{\theta\theta}d\theta^{2}+g_{\phi\phi}d\phi^{2}$).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08349v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superradiant instability can form clouds around rotating black holes (BHs) composed of ultralight bosonic fields, such as axions. A BH with such a cloud in a binary system exhibits rich phenomena, and gravitational waves (GWs) from the BH merger provide a means to probe axions. For the first time, we study the evolution of axion clouds in a binary system during the inspiral phase, including axion self-interaction effects. When the self-interaction is significant, unlike in the negligible case, two types of clouds coexist through mode coupling. We examine the evolution of the system considering the effects of dissipation caused by both self-interaction and tidal interaction. For tidal interaction, in addition to the processes of emission to infinity and absorption by the BH, indirect emission via transitions (both resonant and off-resonant) is also considered as a second-order perturbation. Our results demonstrate that the signatures of axion self-interaction are imprinted in the modification of the GW phase. Furthermore, we find the possibility of a dynamical instability called bosenova during the binary inspiral phase.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01801v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been argued that realistic models of (singularity-free) black holes (BHs) embedded within an expanding Universe are coupled to the large-scale cosmological dynamics, with striking consequences, including pure cosmological growth of BH masses. In this pilot study, we examine the consequences of this growth for the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) produced by inspiraling supermassive cosmologically coupled BHs. We show that the predicted SGWB amplitude is enhanced relative to the standard uncoupled case, while maintaining the $\Omega_{\text{gw}} \propto f^{2/3}$ frequency scaling of the spectral energy density. For the case where BH masses grow with scale factor as $M_{\text{bh}} \propto a^3$, thus contributing as a dark energy component to the cosmological dynamics, $\Omega_{\text{gw}}$ can be enhanced by more than an order of magnitude. This has important consequences for the SGWB signal detected by pulsar timing arrays, whose measured amplitude is slightly larger than most theoretical predictions for the spectrum from inspiraling binary BHs, a discrepancy which can be alleviated by the cosmological mass growth mechanism.</description>

      <title>Polarization modes of gravitational waves in scalar-tensor-Rastall theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18503v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rastall theory, originally introduced in 1972, suggests a violation of the usual conservation law. We consider two generalizations of Rastall theory: Brans-Dicke-Rastall theory and the newly established scalar-tensor-Rastall theory, the latter being a further generalization of the former. The field equations in these two generalized theories are studied across different parameter spaces, and the polarization modes of gravitational waves, as a key focus, are subsequently investigated. The results show that the polarization modes of gravitational waves in Brans-Dicke-Rastall theory are the same as those in Brans-Dicke theory; specifically, both theories exhibit the plus, cross, and breathing modes. However, in scalar-tensor-Rastall theory, the polarization modes of gravitational waves depend on the parameter space of the theory. Particularly, over a broad range of the parameter space, regardless of some special values of the parameters, it allows only two tensor modes, just as in general relativity, without introducing any additional degrees of freedom. This indicates that Rastall theory offers a novel approach to constructing modified gravity theories that propagate only two tensor degrees of freedom. In the remaining regions of the parameter space, there is also one scalar mode in addition to the two tensor modes. The scalar mode can be either a mixture of the breathing and longitudinal modes or just a pure breathing mode, depending on the parameter space. These results will play a crucial role in constraining the theoretical parameters through future gravitational wave detection projects, such as LISA, Taiji, and TianQin.</description>

Abstract: This paper explores the thermodynamic properties and stability of two newly introduced gas models, namely the Modified Chaplygin-Jacobi gas and the Modified Chaplygin-Abel gas. To achieve this, we examine the behavior of relevant physical parameters to gain in depth information about the evolution of the universe. The specific heat formalism is employed to verify the applicability of the third law of thermodynamics. Furthermore, the equation of state for the thermal system is obtained by applying thermodynamic variables. The stability of the gas models is investigated within the framework of classical thermodynamics, focusing on adiabatic processes, specific heat capacities, and isothermal conditions. It is inferred that the proposed fluid configurations exhibit thermodynamic stability and undergo adiabatic expansion for suitable parameter choices. We then perform observational analysis using CC+BAO and Pantheon+SH0ES datasets to impose constraints on our model parameters using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) process.</description>

      <title>Stationary BTZ space-time in Ricci-Inverse and $f(\mathcal{R})$ gravity theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11922v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore a stationary BTZ space-time within the framework of modified gravity theory, specifically focusing on Ricci-inverse gravity. It is important to clarify that ``Ricci-inverse" refers to the inverse of the Ricci tensor, not the Ricci scalar. We consider a general class of this gravity theory, where the function $f$ is defined by $f(\mathcal{R}, \mathcal{A}, A^{\mu\nu}\,A_{\mu\nu})$, with $\mathcal{R}$ and $\mathcal{A}$ representing the Ricci and anti-curvature scalars, respectively and $A^{\mu\nu}$ is the anti-curvature tensor. We demonstrate that stationary BTZ space-time is a valid solution in this gravity theory, wherein the cosmological constant undergoes modifications due to the coupling constants. Moreover, we study another modified gravity theory known as $f(\mathcal{R})$-gravity and analyze the stationary BTZ space-time. Subsequently, we fully integrate the geodesic equations for BTZ space-time constructed within the Ricci-Inverse gravity, expressing the solutions in terms of elementary functions and compared with the GR result. We classify different types of geodesics, including null and time-like geodesics, under three conditions: (i) nonzero mass and angular momentum, $M \neq 0, J\neq 0$, (ii) massless BTZ space-time, $M=0$ and $J=0$, and (iii) $M=-1, J=0$, that is $AdS_3$-type, and analyze the results in modified gravity theories and compare with the general relativity case.</description>

      <title>Is graviton shot noise detectable?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06694v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Direct detection of gravitons in gravitational experiments, including gravitational wave observatories, has been all but ruled out given the weak coupling between the gravitational field and matter. Here we propose an alternative: looking not for the presence but for the absence of graviton shot noise in gravitational wave data. Gravitational wave experiments detect very weak signals that correspond to a surprisingly small number of gravitons even at the relatively low frequencies that characterize signals from gravitational wave events. A detailed calculation, which also yields results that are consistent with the existing literature, demonstrates that graviton shot noise may be present at detectable levels in gravitational wave observations. The absence of elevated noise levels due to graviton shot noise, in turn, would indicate that gravity is not a quantum field theory with a conventional perturbative expansion at low energies.</description>

      <title>The Critical Role of LIGO-India in the Era of Next-Generation Observatories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10349v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the role of LIGO-India in facilitating multi-messenger astronomy in the era of next generation observatories. A network with two L-shaped Cosmic Explorer (CE) detectors and one triangular Einstein Telescope (ET) would detect nearly the entire annual binary neutron star merger population up to a redshift of 0.5, localizing over 10,000 events within $10\ \mathrm{deg}^2$, including $\sim 150$ events within $0.1\ \mathrm{deg}^2$. Luminosity distance would be measured to within 10% for over 9,000 events and within 1% for $\sim 100$ events. Notably, replacing the 20 km CE detector with LIGO-India operating in A$^\sharp$ sensitivity (I$^\sharp$) retains comparable performance, achieving a similar number of detections and localization of over 9,000 events within $10\ \mathrm{deg}^2$ and $\sim 90$ events within $0.1\ \mathrm{deg}^2$. This configuration detects over $\sim 6,000$ events with luminosity distance uncertainties under 10%, including $\sim 50$ events with under 1%. Both networks are capable of detecting $\mathcal{O}(100)$ events up to 10 minutes before merger, with localization areas $\leq 10\ \mathrm{deg}^2$. While I$^\sharp$'s $5\times $ longer baseline with CE, compared to a second CE in the United States, achieves excellent localization and early warning capabilities, its shorter arms and narrower sensitivity band would limit its effectiveness for other science goals, e.g. detecting population III binary black hole mergers at $z \gtrsim 10$, neutron star mergers at $z \sim 2$, or constraining cosmological parameters.</description>

      <title>Inner horizon instability via the trace anomaly effective action</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14964v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In quantum field theory applied to black hole spacetimes, substantial evidence suggests that the Unruh and Hartle-Hawking vacuum states become singular at Cauchy horizons. This raises essential questions regarding the impact of quantum field backreaction on the stability of Cauchy horizons in static scenarios and inner horizons in evolving spacetimes. To approach this problem, we employ analytic approximations to the renormalized stress-energy tensor (RSET) of quantum fields in four dimensions. Specifically, we utilize the anomaly-induced effective action, which generates four-dimensional approximate RSETs through a pair of auxiliary scalar fields that satisfy higher-order equations of motion. The boundary conditions imposed on these auxiliary fields yield RSETs with leading-order terms that mimic the behaviour of different vacuum states. This study presents the first application of the anomaly-induced effective action method to Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole interiors, evaluating its accuracy, applicability, and connections with prior RSET approximations. Among the range of possible states accessible through this method, we found none that remain regular at both the event and Cauchy horizons, aligning with theoretical expectations. The method shows strong agreement with exact four-dimensional RSET results for the Hartle-Hawking state but does not fully capture the unique characteristics of the Unruh state in Reissner-Nordstr\"om spacetimes. We conclude by suggesting possible extensions to address these limitations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16344v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Certain holographic dark energy (HDE) models allow for the possibility of a ``long freeze,'' in which the scale factor evolves to a constant in the long-time limit. Here we extend previous calculations by adding a nonrelativistic matter component. The addition of a matter component tends to destroy the long freeze behavior, driving the universe to recollapse. Long freeze evolution is still possible, but only for a limited set of HDE models.</description>

Abstract: We review the suggestion that it is possible to eliminate the Big Bang curvature singularity of the Friedman cosmological solution by considering a particular type of degenerate spacetime metric. Specifically, we take the 4-dimensional spacetime metric to have a 3-dimensional defect with a vanishing determinant of the metric. This new solution suggests the existence of another "side" of the Big Bang (perhaps a more appropriate description than "pre-big-bang" phase used in our original paper). The corresponding new solution for defect wormholes is also briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter production during Warm Inflation via Freeze-In</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17371v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel perspective on the role of inflation in the production of Dark Matter (DM). Specifically, we explore the DM production during Warm Inflation via ultraviolet Freeze-In (WIFI). We demonstrate that in a Warm Inflation (WI) setting the persistent thermal bath, sustained by the dissipative interactions with the inflaton field, can source a sizable DM abundance via the non-renormalizable interactions that connect the DM with the bath. Compared to the (conventional) radiation-dominated (RD) UV freeze-in scenario for the same reheat temperature (after inflation), the resulting DM yield in WIFI is always enhanced showing a strongly positive dependence on the mass dimension of the non-renormalizable operator. Of particular interest, for a sufficiently large mass dimension of the operator, the entirety of the DM abundance of the Universe can be created during the inflationary phase. For the specific models we study, we find that the enhancement in DM yield, relative to RD UV freeze-in, is at least an order of magnitude for an operator of mass dimension 5, and as large as 18 order of magnitudes for an operator of mass dimension 10. Our findings also suggest a broader applicability for producing other cosmological relics, which may have a substantial impact on the evolution of the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Representations of a quantum-deformed Lorentz algebra, Clebsch-Gordan map, and Fenchel-Nielsen representation of complex Chern-Simons theory at level-${N}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08176v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A family of infinite-dimensional irreducible $*$-representations on $\mathcal{H}\simeq L^2(\mathbb{R})\otimes\mathbb{C}^N$ is defined for a quantum-deformed Lorentz algebra $\mathscr{U}_{\bf q}(sl_2)\otimes \mathscr{U}_{\widetilde{\bf {q}}}(sl_2)$, where $\mathbf{q}=\exp[\frac{\pi i}{N}(1+b^2)]$ and $\tilde{\mathbf{q}}=\exp[\frac{\pi i}{N}(1+b^{-2})]$ with $N\in\mathbb{Z}_+$ and $|b|=1$. The representations are constructed with the irreducible representation of quantum torus algebra at level-$N$, which is developed from the quantization of $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})$ Chern-Simons theory. We study the Clebsch-Gordan decomposition of the tensor product representation, and we show that it reduces to the same problem as diagonalizing the complex Fenchel-Nielson length operators in quantizing $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})$ Chern-Simons theory on 4-holed sphere. Finally, we explicitly compute the spectral decomposition of the complex Fenchel-Nielson length operators and the corresponding direct-integral representation of the Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$, which we call the Fenchel-Nielson representation.</description>

      <title>Renormalisation of postquantum-classical gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17844v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the obstacles to reconciling quantum theory with general relativity, is constructing a theory which is both consistent with observation, and and gives finite answers at high energy, so that the theory holds at arbitrarily short distances. Quantum field theory achieves this through the process of renormalisation, but famously, perturbative quantum gravity fails to be renormalisable, even without coupling to matter. Recently, an alternative to quantum gravity has been proposed, in which the geometry of spacetime is taken to be classical rather than quantum, while still being coupled to quantum matter fields [1, 2]. This can be done consistently, provided the dynamics is fundamentally stochastic. Here, we find that the pure gravity theory is formally renormalisable. We do so via the path integral formulation by relating the classical-quantum action to that of quadratic gravity which is renormalisable. Because the action induces stochastic dynamics of space-time, rather than deterministic evolution of a quantum field, the classical-quantum theory is free of tachyons and negative norm ghosts. The key remaining question is whether the renormalisation prescription retains completely positive (CP) dynamics. This consideration appears to single out the scale invariant and asymptotically free theory. We give further evidence that the theory is CP, by showing that the two-point function of the scalar mode is positive. To support the use of precision accelerometers in testing the quantum nature of spacetime, we also compute the power spectral density of the acceleration. The results presented here have a number of implications for inflation, CMB data, and experiments to test the quantum nature of spacetime. They may also provide a way to compute probabilities in the regime of quantum gravity where spacetime can be treated as effectively classical.</description>

      <title>Axi-Majoron : One-shot solution to most of the big puzzles of particle cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08675v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The details of the minimal cosmological standard model (MCSM) proposed in [arXiv:2403.05390.] are discussed. The model is based on the scale-symmetry and the global Peccei-Quinn(PQ) symmetry with a key assumption that the latter is broken only in the gravity sector in a scale-invariant manner. We show that the model provides a quite simple unified framework for the unknown history of the Universe from inflation to the epoch of big-bang nucleosynthesis, simultaneously addressing key puzzles of high energy theory and cosmology: (i) the origin of scales, (ii) primordial inflation, (iii) matter-antimatter asymmetry, (iv) tiny neutrino masses, (v) dark matter, and (vi) the strong \textit{CP}-problem. Scale symmetry can be exact, and the Planck scale is dynamically generated. The presence of Gauss-Bonnet term may safely retain dangerous nonperturbative symmetry-breaking effects negligible, allowing a large-field trans-Planckian inflation along the PQ-field. Isocurvature perturbations of axi-Majorons are suppressed. A sizable amount of PQ-number asymmetry is generated at the end of inflation, and conserved afterwards. Domain wall problem is absent due to the nonrestoration of the symmetry and the nonzero PQ-number asymmetry. Baryogenesis can be realized by either the transfer of the PQ-number asymmetry through the seesaw sector, or by resonant leptogenesis. Dark matter is purely cold axi-Majorons from the mis-alignment contribution with the symmetry-breaking scale of $\mathcal{O}(10^{12}) {\rm GeV}$. Hot axi-Majorons from the decay of the inflaton become a natural source for a sizable amount of dark radiation. Inflationary gravitational waves have information about the mass parameters of the lightest left-handed and right-handed neutrinos, thanks to the presence of an early matter-domination era driven by the long-lived lightest right-handed neutrino species.</description>

Abstract: Many evidences appear in the past decades and show that the negativity of Casimir energy is responsible for exotic mechanical and gravitational effects. We study in this work the Lorentz boost of a Casimir cavity, on which little attention is paid to its momentum in historical works. We find that the vacuum energy and momentum carried by the cavity transform differently from those of point particles due to the cavity's extension feature. However, the mass-shell condition of the two are identical as long as the cavity is finite along the moving direction only.</description>

Abstract: Tachyons have fascinated generations of physicists due to their peculiar behavior, but they did not solve any real physical problem. This may have changed with the recent works of Dragan et al., who have shown that superluminal observers may be related to the foundations of quantum mechanics (QM) because they require introducing non-determinism and wave-like behavior at the fundamental level. Unfortunately, we show that the tachyon quantum field theory proposed as a part of this program is not quantum since the tachyon field commutes at all points and the canonical commutations relations of a quantum scalar field are not satisfied. We also discuss other authors' theories, e.g., we show that the Dhar-Sudarshan's formula for the Feynman propagator violates unitarity, and we apply the LSZ formalism to tachyons for the first time, where we find that one cannot prove the LSZ asymptotic condition just by replacing plane waves with wavepackets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22206v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we analyze the vacuum bosonic current associated with a massive charged scalar field propagating in a $(D+1)$-dimensional anti-de Sitter (AdS) bulk in the presence of an idealized carrying-magnetic-flux cosmic string and also a brane. We assume that the string is perpendicular to the brane which is parallel to the AdS boundary.
  The brane divides the space in two regions with different properties of vacuum states. We investigate the only non-vanishing azimuthal components of the induced currents in both regions. To develop this analysis we calculate first, for both regions, the positive frequency Wightman functions. These present contributions associated with the presence of a cosmic string only plus the other induced by the brane. In this talk we consider only the contributions induced by the brane.</description>

Abstract: We explore the potential of gravitational waves (GWs) to probe the pre-BBN era of the early universe, focusing on the effects of energy injection. Specifically, we examine a hidden sector alongside the Standard Model that undergoes a strong first-order phase transition (FOPT), producing a GW signal. Once the phase transition has completed, energy injection initiates reheating in the hidden sector, which positions the hidden sector field so that additional phase transitions can occur. This can result in a total of three distinct phase transitions with a unique three-peak GW spectrum. Among these transitions, the first and third are of the standard type, while the intermediate second transition is inverted, moving from a broken to an unbroken phase. Using polynomial potentials as a framework, we derive analytical relations among the phase transition parameters and the resulting GW spectrum. Our results indicate that the second and third transitions generate GWs with higher amplitudes than the first, with a peak frequency ratio differing by up to an order of magnitude. This three-peak GW spectrum is detectable by upcoming facilities such as LISA, BBO, and UDECIGO. Notably, the phenomenon is robust across various potentials and model parameters, suggesting that hidden sector GWs provide a powerful tool for exploring new physics scenarios in the pre-BBN era.</description>

      <title>Hidden Adler zeros and soft theorems for inflationary perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17591v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive soft theorems for on-shell scattering amplitudes from non-linearly realised global space-time symmetries, arising from the flat space and decoupling limits of the effective field theories (EFTs) of inflation, while taking particular care of on-shell limits, soft limits, time-ordered correlations, momentum derivatives, energy-momentum conserving delta functions and $i\varepsilon$ prescriptions. Intriguingly, contrary to common belief, we find with a preferred soft hierarchy among the soft momentum $q$, on-shell residue $p_a^0 \pm E_a$, and $\varepsilon$, the soft theorems do not have dependence on off-shell interactions, even in the presence of cubic vertices. We also argue that the soft hierarchy is a natural choice, ensuring the soft limit and on-shell limit commute. Our soft theorems depend solely on on-shell data and hold to all orders in perturbation theory. We present various examples including polynomial shift symmetries, non-linear realisation of Lorentz boosts and dilatations on how the soft theorems work. We find that the collection of exchange diagrams, where the soft momentum is associated with a cubic vertex, exhibits an enhanced soft scaling. The enhanced soft scaling explains why the sum of such diagrams do not enter the soft theorems non-trivially. We further apply the soft theorems to bootstrap the scattering amplitudes of the superfluid and scaling superfluid EFTs, finding agreement with the Hamiltonian analysis.</description>

      <title>Magnetic reconnection under centrifugal and gravitational electromotive forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19491v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine the physical implications of the centrifugal and gravitational electromotive forces on magnetic reconnection in a Kerr black hole background. We find that both forces increase the reconnection rate, though the underlying mechanisms differ substantially. The gravitational force leads to a separation of charge density, breaking the quasi-neutrality of the plasma. In contrast, the centrifugal electromotive force affects the electric current by reducing the effective length of the current sheet. This reduction arises from the non-Euclidean spatial geometry observed by a locally comoving observer with respect to the rotating sheet. This phenomenon amplifies both the transport of charged carriers and the thermal-inertia effect within the current sheet, irrespective of the presence of a black hole.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the Pre-Big Bang scenario from a cosmological interpretation of the NANOGrav data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01734v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss a recently proposed fit of the 15-year data set obtained from the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav) in terms of a relic stochastic background of primordial gravitons, produced in the context of the string cosmology pre-big bang scenario. We show that such interpretation cannot be reconciled with a phenomenologically viable minimal version of such scenario, while it can be allowed if one considers an equally viable but generalised, non-minimal version of pre-big bang evolution. Maintaining the $S$-duality symmetry throughout the high-curvature string phase is possible although somewhat disfavoured. The implications of this non-minimal scenario for the power spectrum of curvature perturbations are also briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Restricted Phase Space Thermodynamics of 4D Dyonic AdS Black Holes: Insights from Kaniadakis Statistics and Emergence of Superfluid $\lambda$-Phase Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04375v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the thermodynamics of $4D$ dyonic AdS black hole in the Kaniadakis statistics framework using the Restricted Phase Space (RPST) formalism. This framework provides a non-extensive extension of classical statistical mechanics, drawing inspiration from relativistic symmetries and presenting a fresh perspective on black hole thermodynamics. Our study analyzes how including Kaniadakis entropy modifies the phase transition of the dyonic black holes. We consider the central charge $C$ and its conjugate chemical potential $\mu$ as the thermodynamic variable along with others except the pressure and volume. Due to the addition of the magnetic charge $\tilde{Q}_m$, the study of the phase transition becomes much richer by obtaining a non-equilibrium phase transition from an unstable small black hole to a stable large black hole along with the Van der Waals phase transition in the $T-S$ processes. In the $F-T$ plot, we get an extra Hawking-Page phase transition. Including the deformation parameter $\kappa$ introduces an unstable (ultra-large BH) branch seen in almost all the plots. Turning off the magnetic charge flips the direction of the phase transition seen during its presence. We observe a novel phenomenon that is the superfluid $\lambda$ phase transition in the mixed $(\tilde{\Phi}_e,\tilde{Q}_m)$ which is due to the additional $\tilde{Q}_m$ inclusion. Also, in the plots varying $\kappa$ match with the plot varying $C$ which underlines some sort of correspondence in its meaning which is not possible to observe in Gibbs-Boltzmann statistics. As the entropy models change the homogeneity is not lost where mass is of the first order and the rest is zeroth order. Finally, the $\mu-C$ processes in quite similar across black hole systems and entropy formulation marking some kind of universality of this process.</description>

      <title>New analysis of SNeIa Pantheon Catalog: Variable speed of light as an alternative to dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05262v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In A&amp;A 412, 35 (2003) Blanchard, Douspis, Rowan-Robinson, and Sarkar (BDRS) slightly modified the primordial fluctuation spectrum and produced an excellent fit to WMAP's CMB power spectrum for an Einstein-de Sitter (EdS) universe, bypassing dark energy. Curiously, they obtained a Hubble value of $H_0\approx46$, in sharp conflict with the canonical range $H_0\sim67-73$. However, we will demonstrate that the reduced value of $H_0\approx46$ achieved by BDRS is fully compatible with the use of variable speed of light in analyzing the late-time cosmic acceleration observed in Type Ia supernovae (SNeIa). In arXiv:2412.04257 [gr-qc] we uncovered a hidden aspect in a generic class of scale-invariant actions: the dynamics of the dilaton can induce a variation in the speed of light as $c\propto\chi^{1/2}$, causing $c$ to vary alongside $\chi$ across spacetime. For an EdS universe with varying $c$, besides the effects of cosmic expansion, light waves emitted from distant SNeIa are further subject to a refraction effect, which alters the Lemaitre redshift relation to $1+z=a^{-3/2}$. Based on this new formula, we achieve a fit to the SNeIa Pantheon Catalog exceeding the quality of the $\Lambda$CDM model. Crucially, our approach does not require dark energy and produces $H_0=47.2$ in strong alignment with the BDRS finding of $H_0\approx46$. Hence, BDRS's analysis of the (early-time) CMB power spectrum and our variable-$c$ analysis of the (late-time) Hubble diagram of SNeIa fully agree on two counts: (i) the dark energy hypothesis is avoided, and (ii) $H_0$ is reduced to $\sim47$, which also yields an age $t_0=2/(3H_0)=13.8$ Gy for an EdS universe, without requiring dark energy. Most importantly, we will demonstrate that the late-time acceleration can be attributed to the declining speed of light in an expanding EdS universe, rather than to a dark energy component.</description>
