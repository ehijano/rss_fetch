      <title>Bounding the number of holes required for folding rectangular polyominoes into cubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18197v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of whether rectangular polyominoes with holes are cube-foldable, that is, whether they can be folded into a cube, if creases are only allowed along grid lines. It is known that holes of sufficient size guarantee that this is the case.
  Smaller holes which by themselves do not make a rectangular polyomino cube-foldable can sometimes be combined to create cube-foldable polyominoes. We investigate minimal sets of holes which guarantee cube-foldability. We show that if all holes are of the same type, the these minimal sets have size at most 4, and if we allow different types of holes, then there is no upper bound on the size.</description>

      <title>On the Computation of Schrijver's Kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The geometry of a graph $G$ embedded on a closed oriented surface $S$ can be probed by counting the intersections of $G$ with closed curves on $S$. Of special interest is the map $c \mapsto \mu_G(c)$ counting the minimum number of intersections between $G$ and any curve freely homotopic to a given curve $c$. Schrijver [On the uniqueness of kernels, 1992] calls $G$ a kernel if for any proper graph minor $H$ of $G$ we have $\mu_H &lt; \mu_G$. Hence, $G$ admits a minor $H$ which is a kernel and such that $\mu_G = \mu_H$. We show how to compute such a minor kernel of $G$ in $O(n^3 \log n)$ time where $n$ is the number of edges of $G$, and $g\ge 2$ is the genus of $S$. Our algorithm leverages a tight bound on the size of minimal bigons in a system of closed curves. It also relies on several subroutines of independent interest including the computation of the area enclosed by a curve and a test of simplicity for the lift of a curve in the universal covering of $S$.
  As a consequence of our minor kernel algorithm and a recent result of Dubois [Making multicurves cross minimally on surfaces, 2024], after a preprocessing that takes $O(n^3 \log n)$ time and $O(n)$ space, we are able to compute $\mu_G(c)$ in $O(g (n + \ell) \log(n + \ell))$ time given any closed walk $c$ with $\ell$ edges. The state-of-the-art algorithm by Colin de Verdi\`ere and Erickson [Tightening non-simple paths and cycles on surfaces, 2010] would avoid constructing a kernel but would lead to a computation of $\mu_G(c)$ in $O(g n \ell \log(n \ell))$ time (with a preprocessing that takes $O(gn\log n)$ time and $O(gn)$ space). Another consequence of the computation of minor kernels is the ability to decide in polynomial time whether two graph minors $H$ and $H'$ of $G$ satisfy $\mu_H = \mu_{H'}$.</description>

      <title>Optimized Fish Locomotion using Design-by-Morphing and Bayesian Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a computational framework for optimizing undulatory swimming profiles using a combination of design-by-morphing and Bayesian optimization strategies. The body deformation is expressed as a linear combination of five baseline bio-inspired profiles, including two unconventional shapes to enhance diversity in the design space. The optimization objective is to maximize propulsive efficiency over a wide range of frequency-wavelength combinations. The Arbitrary Lagrangian--Eulerian formulation is employed to simulate the unsteady flow around two-dimensional undulating swimmers. The optimized profile achieves a significantly improved efficiency of 82.4\%, while the second- and third-best profiles achieve efficiencies of 51.8\% and 42.8\%, respectively, outperforming the benchmark anguilliform and carangiform profiles by leveraging advantageous surface stress distributions and effective energy recovery mechanisms. A detailed force decomposition reveals that the optimal swimmer minimizes resistive drag and maximizes constructive work contributions, particularly in the anterior and posterior body regions. Spatial and temporal work decomposition indicates a strategic redistribution of input and recovered energy, enhancing performance while reducing energetic cost. The wake topology associated with the optimized swimmer exhibits organized and coherent vortex structures, reflecting superior fluid-structure interaction characteristics compared to conventional profiles. These findings demonstrate that morphing-based parametric design, when guided by surrogate-assisted optimization, offers a powerful framework for discovering energetically efficient swimming gaits, with significant implications for the design of autonomous underwater propulsion systems and the broader field of bio-inspired locomotion.</description>

      <title>On the Diameter of Arrangements of Topological Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{D}=\{D_0,\ldots,D_{n-1}\}$ be a set of $n$ topological disks in the plane and let $\mathcal{A} := \mathcal{A}(\mathcal{D})$ be the arrangement induced by~$\mathcal{D}$. For two disks $D_i,D_j\in\mathcal{D}$, let $\Delta_{ij}$ be the number of connected components of~$D_i\cap D_j$, and let $\Delta := \max_{i,j} \Delta_{ij}$.
  We show that the diameter of $\mathcal{G}^*$, the dual graph of~$\mathcal{A}$, can be bounded as a function of $n$ and $\Delta$. Thus, any two points in the plane can be connected by a Jordan curve that crosses the disk boundaries a number of times bounded by a function of~$n$ and~$\Delta$. In particular, for the case of two disks we prove that the diameter of $\mathcal{G}^*$ is at most $\max\{2,2\Delta\}$ and this bound is tight. % For the general case of $n&gt;2$ disks, we show that the diameter of $\mathcal{G}^*$ is at most $2 n(\Delta+1)^{n(n-1)/2} \min\{n,\Delta+1\}$. We achieve this by proving that the number of maximal faces in $\mathcal{A}$ -- the faces whose ply is more than the ply of their neighboring faces -- is at most $n(\Delta+1)^{n(n-1)/2}$, which is interesting in its own right.</description>

      <title>Fast Agnostic Learners in the Plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the computational efficiency of agnostic learning for several fundamental geometric concept classes in the plane. While the sample complexity of agnostic learning is well understood, its time complexity has received much less attention. We study the class of triangles and, more generally, the class of convex polygons with $k$ vertices for small $k$, as well as the class of convex sets in a square. We present a proper agnostic learner for the class of triangles that has optimal sample complexity and runs in time $\tilde O({\epsilon^{-6}})$, improving on the algorithm of Dobkin and Gunopulos (COLT `95) that runs in time $\tilde O({\epsilon^{-10}})$. For 4-gons and 5-gons, we improve the running time from $O({\epsilon^{-12}})$, achieved by Fischer and Kwek (eCOLT `96), to $\tilde O({\epsilon^{-8}})$ and $\tilde O({\epsilon^{-10}})$, respectively.
  We also design a proper agnostic learner for convex sets under the uniform distribution over a square with running time $\tilde O({\epsilon^{-5}})$, improving on the previous $\tilde O(\epsilon^{-8})$ bound at the cost of slightly higher sample complexity. Notably, agnostic learning of convex sets in $[0,1]^2$ under general distributions is impossible because this concept class has infinite VC-dimension. Our agnostic learners use data structures and algorithms from computational geometry and their analysis relies on tools from geometry and probabilistic combinatorics. Because our learners are proper, they yield tolerant property testers with matching running times. Our results raise a fundamental question of whether a gap between the sample and time complexity is inherent for agnostic learning of these and other natural concept classes.</description>

      <title>Noncrossing Longest Paths and Cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05580v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Edge crossings in geometric graphs are sometimes undesirable as they could lead to unwanted situations such as collisions in motion planning and inconsistency in VLSI layout. Short geometric structures such as shortest perfect matchings, shortest spanning trees, shortest spanning paths, and shortest spanning cycles on a given point set are inherently noncrossing. However, the longest such structures need not be noncrossing. In fact, it is intuitive to expect many edge crossings in various geometric graphs that are longest.
  Recently, \'Alvarez-Rebollar, Cravioto-Lagos, Mar\'in, Sol\'e-Pi, and Urrutia (Graphs and Combinatorics, 2024) constructed a set of points for which the longest perfect matching is noncrossing. They raised several challenging questions in this direction. In particular, they asked whether the longest spanning path, on any finite set of points in the plane, must have a pair of crossing edges. They also conjectured that the longest spanning cycle must have a pair of crossing edges.
  In this paper, we give a negative answer to the question and also refute the conjecture. We present a framework for constructing arbitrarily large point sets for which the longest perfect matchings, the longest spanning paths, and the longest spanning cycles are noncrossing.</description>

      <title>Computing the Matching Distance of 2-Parameter Persistence Modules from Critical Values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.12868v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The exact computation of the matching distance for multi-parameter persistence modules is an active area of research in computational topology. Achieving an easily obtainable exact computation of this distance would permit multi-parameter persistent homology to be a viable option for data analysis. For this purpose, two approaches are currently available, limited to persistence with parameters from $\mathbb{R}^2$: authors of arXiv:1812.09085, arXiv:2111.10303 work in the discrete setting and apply the point-line duality; authors of arXiv:2210.16718, arXiv:2312.04201 work in the smooth setting while remaining in the primal plane. In this paper, we streamline the computation of the matching distance in the combinatorial setting while staying in the primal plane. In doing so, besides connecting results from the literature, we give explicit formulas for the switch points needed by all the available methods and we show that it is possible to avoid considering vertical and horizontal lines. For the latter, lines with slope 1 play an essential role.</description>
