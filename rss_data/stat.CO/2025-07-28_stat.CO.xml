      <title>Hysteretic Multivariate Bayesian Structural GARCH Model with Soft Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces the SH-MBS-GARCH model, a hysteretic multivariate Bayesian structural GARCH framework that integrates hard and soft information to capture the joint dynamics of multiple financial time series, incorporating hysteretic effects and addressing conditional heteroscedasticity through GARCH components. Various model specifications could utilize soft information to define the regime indicator in distinct ways. We propose a flexible, straightforward method for embedding soft information into the regime component, applicable across all SH-MBS-GARCH model variants. We further propose a generally applicable Bayesian estimation approach that combines adaptive MCMC, spike-and-slab regression, and a simulation smoother, ensuring accurate parameter estimation, validated through extensive simulations. Empirical analysis of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, NASDAQ Composite, and PHLX Semiconductor indices from January 2016 to December 2020 demonstrates that the SH-MBS-GARCH model outperforms competing models in fitting and prediction accuracy, effectively capturing regime-switching dynamics.</description>

      <title>Branch-and-bound method for calculating Viterbi path in triplet Markov models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a bivariate, possibly non-homogeneous, finite-state Markov chain $(X,U)=\{(X_t,U_t)\}_{t=1}^n$. We are interested in the marginal process $X$, which typically is not a Markov chain. The goal is to find a realization (path) $x=(x_1,\ldots,x_n)$ with maximal probability $P(X=x)$. If $X$ is Markov chain, then such path can be efficiently found using the celebrated Viterbi algorithm. However, when $X$ is not Markovian, identifying the most probable path -- hereafter referred to as the Viterbi path -- becomes computationally expensive. In this paper, we explore the branch-and-bound method for finding Viterbi paths. The method is based on the lower and upper bounds on maximum probability $\max_x P(X=x)$, and the objective of the paper is to exploit the joint Markov property of $(X,Y)$ to calculate possibly good bounds in possibly cheap way.
  This research is motivated by decoding or segmentation problem in triplet Markov models. A triplet Markov model is trivariate homogeneous Markov process $(X,U,Y)$. In decoding, a realization of one marginal process $Y$ is observed (representing the data), while $X$ and $U$ are latent processes. The process $U$ serves as a nuisance variable, whereas $X$ is the process of primary interest. Decoding refers to estimating the hidden sequence $X$ based solely on the observation $Y$. Conditional on $Y$, the latent processes $(X, U)$ form a non-homogeneous Markov chain. In this context, the Viterbi path corresponds to the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of $X$, making it a natural choice for signal reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Inverse Problems on Metric Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the formulation, well-posedness, and numerical solution of Bayesian inverse problems on metric graphs, in which the edges represent one-dimensional wires connecting vertices. We focus on the inverse problem of recovering the diffusion coefficient of a (fractional) elliptic equation on a metric graph from noisy measurements of the solution. Well-posedness hinges on both stability of the forward model and an appropriate choice of prior. We establish the stability of elliptic and fractional elliptic forward models using recent regularity theory for differential equations on metric graphs. For the prior, we leverage modern Gaussian Whittle--Mat\'ern process models on metric graphs with sufficiently smooth sample paths. Numerical results demonstrate accurate reconstruction and effective uncertainty quantification.</description>

      <title>Start from the End: A Framework for Computational Policy Exploration to Inform Effective and Geospatially Consistent Interventions applied to COVID-19 in St. Louis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10870v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mathematical models are a powerful tool to study infectious disease dynamics and intervention strategies against them in social systems. However, due to their detailed implementation and steep computational requirements, practitioners and stakeholders are typically only able to explore a small subset of all possible intervention scenarios, a severe limitation when preparing for disease outbreaks. In this work, we propose a parameter exploration framework utilizing emulator models to make uncertainty-aware predictions of high-dimensional parameter spaces and identify large numbers of feasible response strategies. We apply our framework to a case study of a large-scale agent-based disease model of the COVID-19 ``Omicron wave'' in St. Louis, Missouri that took place from December 2021 to February 2022. We identify large numbers of response strategies that would have been estimated to have reduced disease spread by a substantial amount. We also identify policy interventions that would have been able to reduce the geospatial variation in disease spread, which has additional implications for designing thoughtful response strategies.</description>
