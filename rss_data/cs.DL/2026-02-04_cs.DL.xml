      <title>AutoFigure: Generating and Refining Publication-Ready Scientific Illustrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-quality scientific illustrations are crucial for effectively communicating complex scientific and technical concepts, yet their manual creation remains a well-recognized bottleneck in both academia and industry. We present FigureBench, the first large-scale benchmark for generating scientific illustrations from long-form scientific texts. It contains 3,300 high-quality scientific text-figure pairs, covering diverse text-to-illustration tasks from scientific papers, surveys, blogs, and textbooks. Moreover, we propose AutoFigure, the first agentic framework that automatically generates high-quality scientific illustrations based on long-form scientific text. Specifically, before rendering the final result, AutoFigure engages in extensive thinking, recombination, and validation to produce a layout that is both structurally sound and aesthetically refined, outputting a scientific illustration that achieves both structural completeness and aesthetic appeal. Leveraging the high-quality data from FigureBench, we conduct extensive experiments to test the performance of AutoFigure against various baseline methods. The results demonstrate that AutoFigure consistently surpasses all baseline methods, producing publication-ready scientific illustrations. The code, dataset and huggingface space are released in https://github.com/ResearAI/AutoFigure.</description>

      <title>GLiSE: A Prompt-Driven and ML-Powered Tool for Automated Grey Literature Extraction in Software Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23066v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Grey literature is essential to software engineering research as it captures practices and decisions that rarely appear in academic venues. However, collecting and assessing it at scale remains difficult because of their heterogeneous sources, formats, and APIs that impede reproducible, large-scale synthesis. To address this issue, we present GLiSE, a prompt-driven tool that turns a research topic prompt into platform-specific queries, gathers results from common software-engineering web sources (GitHub, Stack Overflow) and Google Search, and uses embedding-based semantic classifiers to filter and rank results according to their relevance. GLiSE is designed for reproducibility with all settings being configuration-based, and every generated query being accessible. In this paper, (i) we present the GLiSE tool, (ii) provide a curated dataset of software engineering grey-literature search results classified by semantic relevance to their originating search intent, and (iii) conduct an empirical study on the usability of our tool.</description>
