      <title>Quantum criticality and tunable Griffiths phase in superconducting twisted trilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When dimensionality is reduced, enhanced quantum fluctuations can destroy long-range phase coherence, driving a superconductor insulator transition, SIT, where disorder and electronic correlations give rise to novel many-body states. Here, we report the first observation of a magnetic field tuned SIT in mirrorsymmetric twisted trilayer graphene, TTG. Remarkably, signatures of quantum criticality persist over an exceptionally broad range of magnetic fields and are well described by the formation of a quantum Griffiths phase, a regime in which rare spatially extended regions develop local order within a globally disordered phase. This leads to a quantum phase transition governed by an infinite-randomness fixed point and characterized by ultraslow relaxation dynamics. Near the quantum critical region, transport measurements reveal strongly nonlinear electrical behavior, including a current-driven reentrant transition from insulating to superconducting transport, providing direct evidence of local superconducting order. By tilting the magnetic field, we are able to collapse the broad Griffiths regime into a single quantum critical point, QCP, demonstrating a striking level of control over disorder induced quantum dynamics. Our results further show that TTG strongly violates the Pauli limit and establishes twisted trilayer graphene as a tunable platform for exploring quantum phase fluctuations, Cooper pair localization, and unconventional superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Spin and valley-dependent tunneling in MoS$_2$ through magnetic barrier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study electron transport in monolayer molybdenum disulfide MoS$_2$ subjected to a magnetic barrier. Our analysis employs a full-band continuum model to capture the relevant physical phenomena. We focus on how electron energy, magnetic field strength, and the geometric characteristics of the barrier affect the transmission and conductance. We observe sharp resonant tunneling features emerging from quantum interference effects induced by magnetic confinement. A key outcome of our study is the discovery of distinct resonance patterns in the conduction and valence bands. These patterns are closely related to the intrinsic spin-orbit coupling in MoS$_2$ and the breaking of time-reversal symmetry by the magnetic field. This results in significant spin and valley selectivity in electron transport. We demonstrate that adjusting external parameters precisely controls spin-polarized and valley-polarized currents. We show that a magnetic barrier can control electron spin and valley in MoS$_2$, making it a promising platform for energy-efficient spintronic and valleytronic devices.</description>

      <title>Imaging Nonlinear Spin Waves in Magnetoacoustic Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetoacoustic systems offer promising platforms for next-generation sensors and computing applications, but understanding their nonlinear dynamics remains challenging. Here, we use nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond to spatially map nonlinear magnon scattering processes in FeGaB/LiNbO3 magnetoacoustic devices with sub-micron resolution. We observe highly heterogeneous magnetic noise generation under acoustic driving at 1425 MHz, with responses varying dramatically across micron length scales. Time-domain measurements reveal threshold-like nonlinear behavior where NV center spin relaxation rates increase over two orders of magnitude as drive power is increased. These findings reveal microscopic noise sources that limit magnetoacoustic sensor performance while simultaneously demonstrating how acoustic mode engineering could enable selective control of nonlinear magnon processes.</description>

      <title>Marginal Metals and Kosterlitz-Thouless Type Phase Transition in Disordered Altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnetism, a recently discovered magnetic phase characterized by spin-split bands without net magnetization, has emerged as promising platform for novel physics and potential applications. However, its stability against disorder-ubiquitous in real materials-remains poorly understood. Here, we study the electron localization properties of two-dimensional altermagnets subject to disorder. Remarkably, we discover a disorder-driven phase transition from a marginal metallic phase to an insulator, which falls into the Kosterlitz-Thouless class. We demonstrate this by convincing numerical evidence and propose a vortex-antivortex-like spin pair picture for its interpretation. Moreover, we show that the characteristic spin anisotropy of altermagnets persists but gradually fades away across the transition. These changes directly affect the spin-splitting features that are detectable in angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and tunneling magnetoresistance. Our findings provide a new perspective on recent experimental observations of altermagnetism in candidate materials.</description>

      <title>Dimensional crossover of superfluid $^{3}$He in a magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by recent experiments on superfluid $^3$He in nanoscale-confined geometries, we theoretically investigate the associated phase diagram in a slab geometry and perpendicular magnetic field as the size of confinement is varied. Our analysis is based on minimizing the Ginzburg--Landau free energy for the $3\times 3$ matrix superfluid order parameter for three different boundary conditions. We observe a smooth crossover from the phase diagram of the 3D system to the quasi-2D limit for slab heights of several hundred nanometres and magnetic fields of several kilogauss. We illuminate that, despite the apparent complexity of the underlying equations, many precise numerical and even analytical statements can be made about the phase structure for general values of the coefficients of the free energy functional, which can in turn be used to constrain or measure these parameters. To guide future experimental studies, we compute the phase diagram in dependence of pressure, temperature, slab height, and magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Moir\'e dependent Chern insulators in twisted crystalline flatbands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In moir\'e crystals, the competition between different isospin configurations can be tuned by twist angles and stacking orders, forming various symmetry-broken states. Here we report twisted double rhombohedral-trilayer-gaphene as a new twisted crystalline flatbands system showing rich moir\'e dependent topological phenomena. For small twist angles, programmable Chern insulators with Chern number C = 3 at integer moir\'e filling v = 1 have been observed. We have further revealed multiple first-order transitions and an exotic hidden order which can quench the Chern insulator. Interestingly, for a larger twist angle, multiple Chern insulators with C = 1 at fractional fillings including v = 1/4, 1/3 and 1/2 have been observed, whereas the Chern insulator at v = 1 is absent. Our study demonstrated the twisted flatbands from rhombohedral-multilayer-graphene as a new platform to study topological correlated physics, offering a promising pathway toward developing new devices for quantum storage and computation.</description>

      <title>Tunable Interlayer Excitons in Bilayer Graphene Nanoribbons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vertically stacked van der Waals structures are promising platforms that enable layer engineering, opening new avenues for the quantum control of elementary excitations, including optically generated bound electron-hole pairs. Here we employ excited-state density functional calculations to demonstrate strong interlayer excitonic coupling in one-dimensional van der Waals nanostructures derived from armchair graphene nanoribbons. The excitonic response exhibits prominent peaks in the near-infrared range, mainly attributed to intralayer excitons, while interlayer excitations with absorption peak strengths of up to 13\% of the maximum absorption are also observed. Both type-I and type-II band alignments are found, which promote the formation of intralayer and interlayer excitons. Notably, interlayer excitons in these systems exhibit long-lived radiative lifetimes at room temperature, ranging from 1 nanosecond to 9.4 microseconds. Our calculations suggest the potential to tune the excitonic response and lifetimes of bilayer graphene nanoribbons via careful engineering of the stacking order.</description>

      <title>Polarons in two-dimensional polar materials: All-coupling variational theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed and self-contained theoretical study of polarons in two-dimensional (2D) polar materials, which extends the classical macroscopic theory of Fr\"ohlich polarons to the 2D case. The theory is fully determined by experimentally accessible parameters, the static and optical 2D polarizabilities of a monolayer, the frequency of transverse optical phonons, and the effective mass of charge carriers. We define a single dimensionless parameter, which characterizes the coupling of electrons with longitudinal optical phonons, analyze both weak- and strong-coupling regimes, and adopt the Feynman variational path-integral approach for a high-quality interpolation between these limits. Our results provide insight into the ground-state energy and effective mass of polarons in the new generation of 2D polar monolayers.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic nonabelian braiding of imperfect Majoranas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Demonstration of a nontrivial result of quasiparticle exchange (or braiding) is usually considered the definitive proof of a topological phase with nonabelian excitations, such as Majorana bound states (MBSs). However, in finite systems with disorder and smooth potential variations, the MBSs are imperfect in the sense that they are not fully isolated in space and can, to a varying degree, resemble conventional fermions. Here, we study the braiding properties of isolated MBSs, regular fermions, and anything in between. We find a way to compensate for the undesired splitting of the ground-state degeneracy which occurs during the protocol for imperfect MBS. This leads to a braiding outcome that depends on the degree of MBS isolation but remains robust and nonabelian except in the perfect fermion limit. Our protocol could be implemented in different platforms with nonabelian excitations, including quantum-dot-based minimal Kitaev chains.</description>

      <title>Internal dynamics and dielectric screening of confined multiexciton states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experimental and computational studies suggest that biexcitons (BX) confined in large CsPbBr$_3$ nanocrystals experience reduced dielectric screening as compared to excitons (X) and trions (X$^*$). Here we provide a physical rationale to explain such a behavior. A characteristic frequency is introduced, which describes the internal dynamics of an exciton within the excitonic complex. By means of effective mass--variational Quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we show that, in large nanocrystals, the frequency is similar for X and X$^*$, but smaller for BX. Because the frequencies exceed that of the bulk longitudinal optical phonon, this leads to a reduced dielectric constant for BX, which is in contrast with the behavior of strongly confined nanocrystals.</description>

      <title>Near transform-limited single photons from rapid-thermal annealed quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-photon emitters are essential components for quantum communication systems, enabling applications such as secure quantum key distribution and the long-term vision of a quantum internet. Among various candidates, self-assembled InAs/GaAs quantum dots (QDs) remain highly promising due to their ability to emit coherent and indistinguishable photons, as well as their compatibility with photonic integration. In this work, we investigate the impact of post-growth rapid thermal annealing (RTA) on the quantum optical properties of single self-assembled QDs embedded in a p-i-n diode structure. The annealing process induces a controlled blueshift of the emission wavelength by promoting Ga in-diffusion and intermixing. Using resonance fluorescence measurements at cryogenic temperatures (4.2 K), we investigate the single-photon statistics, the emission linewidths, and coherence time $T_2$ of the emitted photons. Our results show that, despite the high annealing temperature of $760^\circ$C, the process does not degrade the optical quality of the quantum dots strongly. Instead, we observe single-photon emission with near transform-limited linewidths, where the dephasing time $T_2$ is only a factor 1.5 above the Fourier-limit $T_2=2T_1$. These findings demonstrate that rapid thermal annealing (RTA) serves as an effective tuning method that preserves the key single-photon emission properties and may help reduce undesirable effects such as non-radiative Auger recombination in quantum photonic applications.</description>

      <title>Significant electron-magnon scattering in layered ferromagnet Cr$_2$Te$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A layered ferromagnet Cr$_2$Te$_3$ is attracting growing interest because of its unique electronic and magnetic properties. Studies have shown that it exhibits sizable anomalous Hall effect (AHE) that changes sign with temperature. The origin of the AHE and the sign change, however, remains elusive. Here we show experimentally that electron-magnon scattering significantly contributes to the AHE in Cr$_2$Te$_3$ through magnon induced skew scattering, and that the sign change is caused by the competition with the Berry-curvature or impurity-induced side-jump contribution. The electron-magnon skew scattering is expected to arise from the exchange interaction between the itinerant Te $p$-electrons and the localized Cr $d$-electrons modified by the strong spin-orbit coupling on Te. These results suggest that the magnon-induced skew scattering can dominate the AHE in layered ferromagnets with heavy elements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) insulators with high Chern number (C) enables multiple dissipationless edge channels for low-power-consumption electronics. We report the realization of multiple high-C QAH insulators including C=3,5,6, and 7 in twisted monolayer-rhombohedral pentalayer graphene. In twist angles of approximately 1.40{\deg}, we observe QAH effect with C=5 at a filling of one electron per moir\'e unit cell, persisting up to 2 Kelvin. Furthermore, incommensurate QAH insulators with C=5,6, and 7 emerge at partial fillings. In twist angles of 0.89{\deg}, Chern insulators with C=3 and C=6 appear at fillings of two and three electrons, respectively. Our findings establish twisted rhombohedral multilayer graphene as a highly tunable platform for multichannel, dissipationless electronics and for the exploration of exotic quantum Hall states beyond traditional Landau level paradigm.</description>

      <title>High-frequency surface acoustic waves: Generation with sub-optical wavelength metal gratings and detection at the exciton resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate all-optical generation and detection of high-frequency (up to ~30 GHz) surface acoustic waves (SAWs) in GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructures with short-period Au gratings on top. We present a sensitive method of SAWs detection by means of a polarization-sensitive pump-probe technique that exploits the narrow exciton resonance in high-quality GaAs. The elastic strain of the SAW causes modulation of the exciton energy in the time domain. As a result, even a small deformation leads to a noticeable change in the dielectric function at the detection wavelength leading to an order of magnitude increase in the detection sensitivity as compared to detection apart from the resonance. A theoretical model is developed that considers two detection schemes: one accounting for probe light diffraction and one without.</description>

      <title>Exotic superconducting states in altermagnets</title>

Abstract: The interplay between magnetism and superconductivity is one of the central topics of condensed matter physics, which has recently been put into new light by the discovery of altermagnets. Here, we study this interplay from a fundamental symmetry perspective using irreducible co-representations of the altermagnetic spin-point groups. We construct and tabulate all symmetry-allowed pairing functions for altermagnets, which uncovers numerous exotic pairing states. We focus on three of them, namely: (i) a non-unitary superconductor with different spatial anisotropies for the spin-up and spin-down condensates, (ii) a half-and-half metal-superconductor where only electrons with one of the two spin components form Cooper pairs, and (iii) a spin chiral superconductor with spin-polarized edge states. Interestingly, the first of these three superconductors exhibits an unusual fractional ac Josephson current for only one of the two spin polarizations. We present phenomenological Ginzburg-Landau theories for these unconventional superconductors and show that they correspond to stable minima of the free energies. We examine their topological properties, study the effects of small spin-orbit coupling, consider possible material examples, and investigate their topological responses.</description>

      <title>Failed superconductivity in a Mott spin liquid material</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A central challenge for understanding unconventional superconductivity in most strongly correlated electronic materials is their complicated band structure and presence of competing orders. In contrast, quasi-two-dimensional organic spin liquids are single-band systems with superconductivity arising near the bandwidth-tuned Mott metal-insulator transition in the absence of other orders. Here, we study chemically substituted $\kappa$-organics in which superconducting fluctuations emerge in the phase coexistence region between the Mott insulator and the Fermi liquid. Using magnetotransport and ac susceptibility measurements, we find that global superconductivity fails to set in as temperature $T\rightarrow 0$. Our results indicate instead the presence of superconducting domains embedded in the metallic percolating cluster that undergo a magnetic field-tuned quantum superconductor-to-metal phase transition. Surprisingly, albeit consistent with the percolation picture, universal conductance fluctuations are seen at high fields in macroscopic samples. The observed interplay of the intrinsic inhomogeneity and quantum phase fluctuations provides a new insight into failed superconductivity, a phenomenon seen in various conventional and unconventional superconductors, including cuprates.</description>

      <title>Quorum sensing of light-activated colloids in nematic liquid crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motile living organisms routinely probe their surroundings to adapt in ever-evolving environments. Although synthetic microswimmers offer surrogates for self-propelled living entities, they often lack the complex feedback mechanisms that enable organisms to adapt. In this work, we present an experimental platform in which light-activated colloids dispersed in a nematic liquid crystal can (i) switch from directed to active Brownian motion depending on the nematic anchoring and (ii) mechanically adjust their motility in response to crowding, effectively enforcing quorum-sensing interactions. Both features are caused by a distinctive self-propulsion mechanism as unveiled through experiments, simulations, and theory. We characterize the dynamics of a single colloid and demonstrate that its motion is captured by an active Brownian particle model if the nematic anchoring is homeotropic, and by directed self-propulsion along the nematic director if the anchoring is planar. Next, we investigate the many-body dynamics, showing that it undergoes a clustering phase separation through effective quorum-sensing interactions. Our work suggests how to create adaptive materials with life-like capabilities using readily accessible properties of liquid crystals and colloids without explicitly engineering any of the needed mechano-chemical feedbacks.</description>

      <title>Topologically nontrivial multicritical points</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, the intriguing interplay between topology and quantum criticality has been unveiled in one-dimensional topological chains with extended nearest-neighbor couplings. In these systems, topologically distinct critical phases emerge with localized edge modes despite the vanishing bulk gap. In this work, we study the topological multicritical points at which distinct gapped and critical phases intersect. Specifically, we consider a topological chain with coupling up to the third nearest neighbors, which shows stable localized edge modes at the multicritical points. These points possess only nontrivial gapped and critical phases around them and are also characterized by the quadratic dispersion around the gap-closing points. We characterize the topological multicritical points in terms of the topological invariant obtained from the zeros of the complex function associated with the Hamiltonian. Further, we analyze the nature of zeros in the vicinity of the multicritical points by calculating the discriminants of the associated polynomial. The discriminant uniquely identifies the topological multicritical points and distinguishes them from the trivial ones. We finally study the robustness of the zero-energy modes at the multicritical points at weak disorder strengths, and reveal the presence of a topologically nontrivial gapless Anderson-localized phase at strong disorder strengths.</description>

      <title>Quantum fluctuations in two-dimensional altermagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The magnetic properties of two-dimensional altermagnets can be obtained from a square lattice Heisenberg model with antiferromagetic nearest neighbor interaction and two types of next-nearest neighbor interactions arranged in a checkerboard pattern. Using nonlinear spin-wave theory we calculate for this model the corrections to the renormalized magnon spectrum and the staggered magnetization to first order in the inverse spin quantum number $1/S$. We also show that to order $1/S^2$ the ground state energy is not sensitive to the component of the interaction which is responsible for altermagnetism. At the $\Gamma$-point the $1/S$-correction to the magnon dispersion vanishes so that quantum fluctuations do not induce a gap in the magnon spectrum of altermagnets, as expected by Goldstone's theorem. We extract the leading $1/S$-corrections to the spin-wave velocity and the effective mass characterizing the curvature of the magnon dispersion in altermagnets.</description>

      <title>Mesoscopic Fluctuations and Multifractality at and across Measurement-Induced Phase Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore statistical fluctuations over the ensemble of quantum trajectories in a model of two-dimensional free fermions subject to projective monitoring of local charge across the measurement-induced phase transition. Our observables are the particle-number covariance between spatially separated regions, $G_{AB}$, and the two-point density correlation function, $\mathcal{C}(r)$. Our results exhibit a remarkable analogy to Anderson localization, with $G_{AB}$ corresponding to two-terminal conductance and $\mathcal{C}(r)$ to two-point conductance, albeit with different replica limit and unconventional symmetry class, geometry, and boundary conditions. In the delocalized phase, $G_{AB}$ exhibits ``universal'', nearly Gaussian, fluctuations with variance of order unity. In the localized phase, we find a broad distribution of $G_{AB}$ with $\overline{-\ln G_{AB}} \sim L $ (where $L$ is the system size) and the variance $\mathrm{var}(\ln G_{AB}) \sim L^\mu$, and similarly for $\mathcal{C}(r)$, with $\mu \approx 0.5$. At the transition point, the distribution function of $G_{AB}$ becomes scale-invariant and $\mathcal{C}(r)$ exhibits multifractal statistics, $\overline{\mathcal{C}^{q}(r)}\sim r^{-q(d+1) - \Delta_{q}}$. We characterize the spectrum of multifractal dimensions $\Delta_q$. Our findings lay the groundwork for mesoscopic theory of monitored systems, paving the way for various extensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically study a Josephson junction consisting of s-wave superconductors and a p-wave magnet. We find that in the presence of a strength vector of p-wave magnet, the electrons' and holes' dispersion relation shifts in the k-space. Additionally, we demonstrate that the perpendicular component of the strength vector converts Andreev bound states into Andreev modes that can propagate along the junction's interfaces. These modes create a transverse spin supercurrent while their transverse charge supercurrent is zero. These features open an opportunity to design superconducting spintronics devices.</description>

      <title>Volcano-Like Ferroic Transitions Deviating from the Model of Landau Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We predict the existence of abnormal volcano-like temperature dependence of polarization or magnetization with maxima located at elevated temperature, distinct from classical model based on Landau theory. One case is ferroelectricity with long ion displacements and quantized polarizations that cannot be used for expansion in Landau model, and the switching pathway involves various metastable phases where the polar phase is higher both in energy and entropy compared with non-polar phase. Another case is compensated antiferromagnets with two opposite spin lattices of different spin exchange constants. Such difference can be utilized for a unique type of temperature differentiated multiferroicity, where large magnetizations can be reversed upon ferroelectric switching between two Curie temperature with alternating half of spins in paramagnetic state. We demonstrate these proposals by first-principles calculations on several paradigmatic systems, including magnetic bilayers intercalated by Ag ions or metal molecules.</description>

      <title>High temperature modulations, meso-scale interactions and hyperscaling breakdown in Ising models with frustration: some insights from thermodynamic geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we revisit the Axial Third Nearest Neighbour Ising (A3NNI) chain and examine in detail some aspects of its phase behaviour ensuing from competing interactions and resulting frustration. We probe the phase behaviour with two complimentary tools: a microscopic two-point correlation function $\mathcal{C}(n)$ which we carefully construct after appropriate spin transformations, and a macroscopic, thermodynamic curvature $R$ which we obtain from the free entropy. We report novel observations of phenomena such as hyperscaling breakdown and intermediate-ranged modulations among others. The zero field thermodynamic curvature $R_0$ is shown to systematically sub-divide the ground state phases into regions of attractive or repulsive effective interactions of varying strength. Furthermore, $R_0$ brings forth the significance of some third order moments in describing the effects of frustration, including the multiphase lines. Combined use of both the probes in the short-ranged modulated order regime confirms and further clarifies the discussion in [1] regarding the appropriate measure of high temperature correlation length in this regime.</description>

Abstract: Kagome lattices have emerged as an ideal platform for exploring exotic quantum phenomena in materials. Here, we report the discovery of Ti-based kagome metal YbTi3Bi4 which we characterize using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and magneto-transport, in combination with density functional theory calculations. Our ARPES results reveal the complex fermiology of YbTi3Bi4 and provide spectroscopic evidence of four flat bands. Our measurements also show the presence of multiple van Hove singularities originating from Ti 3d orbitals and a linearly-dispersing gapped Dirac-like bulk state at the K point in accord with our theoretical calculations. Our study establishes YbTi3Bi4 as a platform for exploring exotic phases in the wider LnTi3Bi4 (Ln= lanthanide) family of materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08263v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a microscopic theory for nonlinear optical response of moir\'e exciton-polaritons in bilayers of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). Our theory allows to study the tunnel-coupled intralayer and interlayer excitonic modes for a wide range of twist angles ($\theta$), external electric field, and light-matter coupling, providing insights into the hybridization regime inaccessible before. Specifically, we account for the Umklapp scattering processes of two exciton-polaritons responsible for enhanced nonlinearity, and show that it is crucial for describing interactions at strong hybridization. We reveal a regime of attractive nonlinearity for moir\'e polaritons, stemming from the anisotropic Coulomb interactions, which can explain some of experimental features of optical response in TMD bilayers. Furthermore, within our theory we demonstrate that the attractive nonlinearity can be tuned into repulsive by applying an external electric field. Our findings show that nonlinear moir\'e polaritons offer a controllable platform nonlinear polaritonic devices.</description>

      <title>Purely electrical detection of the spin-splitting vector in $p$-wave magnets based on linear and nonlinear conductivities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21854v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A $p$-wave magnet has a momentum-dependent spin splitting and zero-net magnetization just as in the case of an altermagnet. It will be useful for high-density and ultra-fast memory, where the direction of the spin-splitting vector may be used as a bit. The spin-splitting vector corresponds to the N\'{e}el vector in altermagnets. However, it is a nontrivial problem to detect the spin-splitting vector in a $p$-wave magnet because time-reversal symmetry is preserved, while this is not a problem in an altermagnet because the anomalous Hall conductivity is present due to the breaking of time-reversal symmetry. Here, we show that it is possible to detect the in-plane component of the spin-splitting vector in the $p$-wave magnet by measuring the linear transverse and longitudinal Drude conductivity. Remarkably, this measurement is possible without using magnetization. Furthermore, we study the nonlinear Drude conductivity, the quantum-metric and the Berry curvature dipole induced nonlinear conductivity in the presence of tiny magnetization along the $z$\ axis. It is possible to detect the $z$-component of the spin-splitting vector by measuring the above nonlinear conductivities. We obtain analytic formulae for them in the first-order perturbation theory, which agree quite well with numerical results without perturbation.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of persistent current in a non-Hermitian disordered ring</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12805v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have studied the Aharonov-Bohm flux-induced magnetic response of a disordered non-Hermitian ring. The disorder is introduced through an on-site quasiperiodic potential described by the Aubry-Andr\'{e}-Harper (AAH) model, incorporating a complex phase that renders the model non-Hermitian. Our findings reveal that this form of non-Hermiticity enhances the persistent current, without requiring hopping dimerization. We explore both non-interacting and interacting scenarios. In the former, we examine spinless fermions, while in the latter, we consider fermions with Hubbard interactions. The Non-Hermitian phase induces both the real and imaginary components of the current. We thoroughly analyze the energy eigenspectrum, ground state energy, and persistent current in both real and imaginary spaces for various system parameters. Our primary goal is to investigate the combined effects of non-Hermiticity and disorder strength on persistent currents. We find an enhancement in both the real and imaginary components of the persistent current with increasing disorder strength, as well as the non-Hermiticity, up to a critical value. Furthermore, we observe an enhancement in persistent current in the presence of Hubbard correlation. Our findings may provide a new route to get nontrivial characteristics in persistent current for a special type of non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Spin-Lattice Interaction Compatible with Discrete Translation Symmetry in Solids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00652v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent interest in orbital angular momentum has led to a rapid expansion of research on spin-orbit coupling effects in solids, while also highlighting significant technical challenges. The breaking of rotational symmetry renders the orbital angular momentum operator ill-defined, causing conceptual and computational issues in describing orbital motion. To address these issues, here we propose an alternative framework. Based on the Bloch representation of the full relativistic interaction, we derive a field that directly couples to electron spins while preserving discrete translational symmetry, thereby eliminating the need for the position operator. Our approach is fully compatible with existing first-principles computational frameworks for both static and time-dependent density functional theory. We demonstrate that this method offers a more effective description of the Edelstein and spin Hall effects compared to conventional orbital angular momentum formalisms.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Azimuthal RHEED construction for in-situ crystal growth characterization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15339v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reflection High-Energy Electron Diffraction (RHEED) is a powerful tool to probe the surface reconstruction during MBE growth. However, raw RHEED patterns are difficult to interpret, especially when the wafer is rotating. A more accessible representation of the information is therefore the so-called Azimuthal RHEED (ARHEED), an angularly resolved plot of the electron diffraction pattern during a full wafer rotation. However, ARHEED requires precise information about the rotation angle as well as of the position of the specular spot of the electron beam. We present a Deep Learning technique to automatically construct the Azimuthal RHEED from bare RHEED images, requiring no further measurement equipment. We use two artificial neural networks: an image segmentation model to track the center of the specular spot and a regression model to determine the orientation of the crystal with respect to the incident electron beam of the RHEED system. Our technique enables accurate, and potentially real-time ARHEED construction on any growth chamber equipped with a RHEED system.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric real topology of conduction and valence bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09524v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Previously, it was believed that conduction and valence bands exhibit a symmetry: They possess opposite topological invariants (e.g., the Chern numbers of conduction and valence bands for the Chern insulator are $\pm C$). However, we present a counterexample: The second Stiefel-Whitney numbers for conduction and valence bands over the Klein bottle may be asymmetric, with one being nontrivial while the other trivial. Here, the Stiefel-Whitney classes are the characteristic classes for real Bloch functions under $PT$ symmetry with $(PT)^2=1$, and the Klein bottle is the momentum-space unit under the projective anticommutation relation of the mirror reflection reversing $x$ and the translation along the $y$ direction. The asymmetry originates from the algebraic difference of real cohomology classes over the Klein bottle and torus. This discovery is rooted in the foundation of topological band theory, and has the potential to fundamentally refresh our current understanding of topological phases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14999v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graphene nanoribbons support a range of electronic phases that can be controlled via external stimuli. Zigzag-edged graphene nanoribbons (ZGNRs), in particular, exhibit an antiferromagnetic insulating ground state that transitions to a half-metallic phase under a transverse electric field or when embedded inside hexagonal Boron Nitride. Here, we consider a simple model of a heterostructure of a ZGNR with an Ising superconductor and show that, the Ising superconductor with a parent s-wave spin-singlet pairing can induce spin-triplet odd-parity pairing in the half-metallic phase of the ZGNR. The resulting superconducting phase is topologically nontrivial, with gate-tunable transitions that enable the emergence of Majorana zero modes.</description>

      <title>Quantum metric and localization in a quasicrystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15575v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the quantum metric to understand the properties of quasicrystals, represented by the one-dimensional (1D) Fibonacci chain. We show that the quantum metric can relate the localization properties of the eigenstates to the scale-invariance of both the chain and its energy spectrum. In particular, the quantum metric incorporates information about distances between the local symmetry centers of each eigenstate, making it much more sensitive to the localization properties of quasicrystals than other measures of localization, such as the inverse participation ratio. We further find that a full description of localization requires us to introduce a new phasonic component to the quantum metric, and a mixed phason-position Chern number. Finally, we show that the sum of both position and phasonic components of the quantum metric is lower-bounded by the gap labels associated with each energy gap of the Fibonacci chain. This establishes a direct link between the spatial localization and fractal energy spectrum of quasicrystals. Taken together, the quantum metric provides a unifying, yet accessible, understanding of quasicrystals, rooted in their scale-invariance and with intriguing consequences also for many-body physics.</description>

      <title>Tunable phase transitions from semimetals to Chern insulators in two-dimensional quadratic-band-crossing materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19378v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We systematically investigate how static symmetry-breaking perturbations and dynamic Floquet terms via a polarized light manipulate the topological phase transitions in the two-dimensional quadratic-band-crossing-point (QBCP) materials. The Berry curvature shows distinct behavior in such two situations. It is linearly and quadratically proportional to the product of microstructural parameters $t_{x,z}$ for the former and the latter, respectively. The static perturbation eliminates the QBCP and opens an energy gap, which leads to the momentum-inversion symmetry of Berry curvature. This yields a nontrivial Chern number determined by the microstructural parameters. In contrast, we demonstrate that either a circularly or an elliptically polarized light breaks the time-reversal symmetry, transforming the QBCP semimetal into a Chern insulator with a quantized anomalous Hall conductivity $\sigma_{xy} = Ce^2/\hbar$, where the Chern number is governed by the polarization angle. Moreover, the linear polarization preserves the central antisymmetry of the Berry curvature, giving rise to a topological trivial insulator. These results establish a tunable topological phase transition from a QBCP semimetal to Chern insulator in the two-dimensional QBCP materials.</description>

      <title>Fractional Thouless pumping of solitons: a unique manifestation of bulk-edge correspondence of nonlinear eigenvalue problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08016v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent foundational studies have established the bulk-edge correspondence for nonlinear eigenvalue problems using auxiliary eigenvalues $\hat{H}\Psi=\omega S(\omega)\Psi$, spanning both linear [T. Isobe et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 132, 126601 (2024)] and nonlinear [Chenxi Bai and Zhaoxin Liang, Phys. Rev. A. 111, 042201 (2025)] Hamiltionians. This raises a fundamental question: Can eigenvalue nonlinearity generate observable physical phenomena absent in conventional approaches ($\hat{H}\Psi=E\Psi$)? In this work, we demonstrate the first uniquely nonlinear manifestation of this correspondence: fractional Thouless pumping of solitons. Through systematic investigation of nonlinear Thouless pumping in an extended Rice-Mele model with next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) couplings, we discover that the NNN parameters can induce fractional topological phases despite quantized topological invariants from conventional approaches. Crucially, these fractional phases are explained within the auxiliary eigenvalue framework, linking nonlinear spectral features directly to bulk-boundary correspondence. This work reveals novel phenomena emerging from the interplay between nonlinearity and NNN couplings, providing key insights for designing topological insulators and controlling quantum edge states in nonlinear regimes.</description>

      <title>Anderson Delocalization in Strongly-Coupled Disordered Non-Hermitian Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03777v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Disorder and non-Hermitian effects together can upend how waves localize. In a 1D disordered chain, the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) can induce Anderson delocalization, defying the usual rule that disorder in low dimensions always localizes states. While weak disorder leaves the NHSE intact, strong disorder restores Anderson localization. Here, we study a surprising twist: coupling a strongly disordered Hatano-Nelson chain to a disordered Hermitian chain with their disorder anti-symmetrically correlated. Strikingly, once the inter-chain coupling exceeds a threshold, the system undergoes Anderson delocalization irrespective of disorder strength, reinstating the NHSE with no Hermitian counterpart. This transition arises from the interplay of non-reciprocal hopping, inter-chain coupling, and engineered disorder correlations, and is captured by a real-space winding number. To confirm this, we build an electrical-circuit analog and directly observe the re-emergent NHSE via voltage measurements. Our work uncovers unexplored and experimentally accessible physics at the crossroads of non-Hermiticity and disorder.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal quantum phase transition in cavity magnonics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08581v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the nonreciprocal quantum phase transition in a cavity magnonic system driven by a parametric field, where an yttrium iron garnet (YIG) sphere is placed in a spinning microwave resonator. The system exhibits a rich phase diagram due to both magnon Kerr nonlinearity in YIG and parametric drive on the resonator. Especially, Sagnac-Fizeau shift caused by the spinning of the resonator brings about a significant modification in the critical driving strengths for second- and first-order quantum phase transitions, which means that the highly controllable quantum phase can be realized by the spinning speed of the resonator. More importantly, based on the difference in the detunings of the counterclockwise and clockwise modes induced by spinning direction of the resonator, we show that the phase transition in this system is nonreciprocal, that is, the quantum phase transition occurs when the cavity is driven in one direction but not the other. Our work offers an alternative path to engineer and design nonreciprocal magnonic devices.</description>

      <title>Interplay between topology and electron-electron interactions in the moir\'{e} MoTe$_{\mathrm{2}}$/WSe$_{\mathrm{2}}$ heterobilayer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09170v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study, the interplay between topology and electron-electron interactions in the moir\'{e} MoTe\(_2\)/WSe\(_2\) heterobilayer. In our analysis we apply an effective two-band model with complex hoppings that incorporates the Ising-type spin-orbit coupling and lead to a non-trivial topology after the application of perpendicular electric field (displacement field). The model is supplemented by on-site and inter-site Coulomb repulsion terms and treated by both Hartree-Fock and Gutzwiller methods. According to our analysis, for the case of one hole per moir\'{e} unit cell, the system undergoes two phase transitions with increasing displacement field. The first one is from an in-plane 120$^\circ$ antiferromagnetic charge transfer insulator to a topological insulator. At the second transition, the system becomes topologically trivial and an out-of-plane ferrimagnetic metallic phase becomes stable. In the topological region a spontaneous spin-polarization appears and the holes are distributed in both layers. Additionally, we analyze the influence of the intersite Coulomb repulsion terms on the appearance of the topological phase as well as on the formation of the charge density wave state. We discuss the obtained results in the context of available experimental data.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic footprints of quantum friction in nonreciprocal and chiral media</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18044v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate how the quantum friction experienced by a polarizable atom moving with constant velocity parallel to a planar interface is modified when the latter consists of chiral or nonreciprocal media, with special focus on topological insulators. We use macroscopic quantum electrodynamics to obtain the velocity-dependent Casimir-Polder frequency shift and decay rate. These results are a generalization to matter with time-reversal symmetry breaking. We illustrate our findings by examining the nonretarded and retarded limits for five examples: a perfectly conducting mirror, a perfectly reflecting nonreciprocal mirror, a three-dimensional topological insulator, a perfectly reflecting chiral mirror and an isotropic chiral medium. We find different asymptotic power laws for all these materials. Interestingly, we find two bridges between chirality and nonreciprocity through the frequency shift that arise as a consequence of the magnetoelectric coupling. Namely, the position-dependent Casimir-Polder frequency shift for the nonreciprocal case depend on a geometric magnetic field associated with photoionization of chiral molecules, the Casimir-Polder depending on the velocities for the chiral case have the optical rotatory strength as the atomic response while those for the nonreciprocal case depend on an analog of the optical rotatory strength.</description>

      <title>Which chromium-sulfur compounds exist as 2D material?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09510v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) chromium-sulfides are synthesized by molecular beam epitaxy using graphene as a substrate. Structure characterization by employing scanning tunneling microscopy and low energy electron diffraction indicates that there are two 2D phases, Cr$_2$S$_3$-2D and Cr$_{2\frac{2}{3}}$S$_4$-2D, which have not been reported before. Cr$_{2\frac{2}{3}}$S$_4$-2D is related to bulk Cr$_5$S$_6$, but thinner than a bulk unit cell. For Cr$_2$S$_3$-2D, an even thinner material, no bulk counterpart exists. Both 2D materials are found to be structurally stable under ambient conditions and exhibit interesting electronic properties. Extensive first-principles calculations provide further insight into the electronic structure of these systems and indicate that they should be magnetic. Although single layers of CrS$_2$ were predicted to be stable by density functional theory calculations and reported in previous experimental studies, we were unable to synthesize CrS$_2$ under our range of experimental conditions.</description>

      <title>The Influence of V-Defects, Leakage, and Random Alloy Fluctuations on the Carrier Transport in Red InGaN MQW LEDs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19020v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Red InGaN-based light-emitting diodes (LEDs) exhibit lower internal quantum efficiencies (IQEs) than violet, blue, and green InGaN LEDs due to a reduction in radiative recombination rates relative to non-radiative recombination rates as the indium composition increases. Additionally, the larger polarization and band offset barriers between high indium content InGaN quantum wells and GaN quantum barriers increase the forward voltage. In blue and green LEDs, random alloy fluctuations and V-defects play a key role in reducing the forward voltage. When V-defects are present, either naturally or intentionally introduced, they create an alternative path for carrier injection into the MQWs through the V-defect sidewalls. This injection mechanism explains the turn-on voltages of green LEDs. However, in InGaN red LEDs, these two phenomena do not reduce the forward voltage as effectively as in blue and green LEDs, and consequently, the computed forward voltage remains significantly higher than the measured one. Furthermore, currents are observed at low voltages before the turn-on voltage (\(V &lt; \hbar\omega/e = 2.0 \, \text{V}\)) of red LEDs. To address this, we introduce dislocation-induced tail states in the modeling, suggesting that leakage current through these states may play a significant role both below and at turn-on voltages. The simulation also indicates that leakage carriers below turn-on accumulate, partially diffuse in the QWs, screen the polarization-induced barrier in the low injection regime, and further reduce the forward voltage. Despite these beneficial effects, a drawback of dislocation-induced tail states is the enhanced nonradiative recombination in the dislocation line region. This study provides a detailed analysis of device injection physics in InGaN QW red LEDs and outlines potential optimization strategies.</description>
