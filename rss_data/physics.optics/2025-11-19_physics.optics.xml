      <title>Quantum Metamorphosis: Programmable Emergence and the Breakdown of Bulk-Edge Dichotomy in Multiscale Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiscale synergy -- the interplay of a system's distinct characteristic length, time, and energy scales -- is becoming a unifying thread across many contemporary branches of science. Ranging from moir\'e and super-moir\'e materials and cold atoms to DNA-templated superlattices and nested photonic networks, multiscale synergy produces behaviors not obtainable at any single scale alone. Yet a general framework that programs cross-scale interplay to steer spectra, transport, and topology has been missing. Here, we elevate multiscale synergy from a byproduct to a general design principle for emergent phenomena. Specifically, we introduce a scale-programmable framework for hierarchically nested lattices (HNLs) that can host quantum metamorphosis (QuMorph) -- a continuous evolution between system-dependent features governed by a dimensionless tunable parameter $\alpha$ (the relative hopping). To exemplify, we show an HNL, in which as $\alpha$ changes, the spectrum metamorphoses from integer quantum Hall-like to anomalous quantum Hall-like, passing through a cocoon regime with proliferating mini-gaps. This multiscale mixing yields multiple novel phenomena, including hybrid edge-bulk states, scale-dependent topology, topologically embedded flat bands, and isolated edge bands. We propose a feasible photonic implementation using commercially available coupled-resonator arrays, outline spatial-spectral signatures to map QuMorph, and explore applications for multi-timescale nonlinear optics. Our work establishes a scalable and programmable paradigm for engineering multiscale emergent phenomena.</description>

      <title>Charge reservoir as a design concept for plasmonic antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plasmonic antennas exploit localized surface plasmons to shape, confine, and enhance electromagnetic fields with subwavelength resolution. The field enhancement is contributed to by various effects, such as the inherent surface localization of plasmons or the plasmonic lightning-rod effect. Inspired by nanofocusing observed for propagating plasmons, we test the hypothesis that plasmonic antennas with a large cross-section represent a large charge reservoir, enabling large induced charge and field enhancement. Our study reveals that a large charge reservoir is accompanied by large radiative losses, which are the dominant factor, resulting in a low field enhancement.</description>

      <title>Probing Local Topology in a Disordered Higher-Order Topological Insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Higher-order topology is prized for its ability to realize lower-dimensional boundary states which are stable beyond fine-tuning. However, disorder presents a failure mechanism that can destroy topological in-gap states. Here, we investigate a disordered two-dimensional polariton lattice and employ the spectral localizer framework to define a real-space topological index rooted in crystalline spatial symmetries. This framework enables direct real-space mapping of topology beyond conventional momentum-space classifications, confirming the presence of corner and edge modes in this generalized Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. Furthermore, it can directly quantify topological protection of a state. We leverage the versatility of our platform to experimentally realize normally distributed, random disorder and find that the corner states persist until the spectral gap closes. Experimentally, this corresponds to a disorder strength of approximately one quarter of the spectral gap. The spectral localizer accurately identifies the disorder strength at which the bandgap closes, establishing the framework as a predictive tool for every finite size system. Our results broaden the design principles for higher-order topological insulators and open the way towards imple menting disorder-resilient devices for robust lasing, light-routing, and quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Dielectric Function of Graphite Probed by Far- and Near-Field Spectroscopies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphite is a cornerstone material for revolutionary technologies, from energy storage to the entire field of two-dimensional materials. Despite its foundational role, the predictive power required for engineering emergent optical behavior in van der Waals heterostructures is severely constrained by persistent discrepancies in reported optical constants. We resolve this long-standing ambiguity by deploying a multi-modal approach that synergizes far-field spectroscopic ellipsometry with nanoscale near-field optical probing (s-SNOM) and micro-reflectance spectroscopy. We have established a new, self-consistent set of optical constants (n and k) for both in-plane and out-of-plane crystallographic directions across the ultraviolet-to-near-infrared spectrum. This work presents a unified set of optical constants that addresses inconsistencies in the existing literature. By establishing this definitive reference, we provide the essential foundation for the quantitative modeling and engineering of light-matter interactions in the evolving landscape of carbon-based nanophotonics.</description>

      <title>Universal Routing of Light via Optical Thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding and exploiting the dynamics of complex nonlinear systems is nowadays at the core of a broad range of scientific and technological endeavors. Within the optical domain, light evolution in a nonlinear multimode environment presents a formidable problem, as its chaotic evolution often hinders predictive insights. Recently, an optical thermodynamic framework has been put forward that, in a systematic manner, can not only predict but also harness the intricate behavior of these systems. In this work, by deploying entropic principles, we demonstrate a counterintuitive optical process in which light, launched into any input port of a judiciously designed nonlinear array, universally channels into a tightly localized ground state, a response that is completely unattainable in linear conservative arrangements. This phenomenon arises from the interplay between lattice structure and the way the kinetic and nonlinear Hamiltonian components unfold, leading to two optical thermal processes: a Joule-Thomson-like expansion followed by mode thermalization. Experimentally, this effect is demonstrated in properly configured nonlinear time-synthetic mesh lattices, where the optical temperature approaches near zero, causing light to condense at a single spot, regardless of the initial excitation position. The effect demonstrated here opens new avenues for applying the principles of optical thermodynamics in realizing novel optical functionalities, such as all-optical beam steering, multiplexing, and nonlinear beam shaping in high-power regimes, while also offering a greater understanding of the remarkable physics of light-matter interactions in multimode nonlinear systems.</description>

      <title>Ellipsometric Identification of Transition from Layered Metal-dielectric Film to Hyperbolic Metamaterial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperbolic Metamaterials (HMMs) continue to be intriguing due to their applications in super resolution imaging and spontaneous emission control. One of the successful realizations of HMMs is a layered metal-dielectric film. Despite the extensive knowledge in thin film technology and the promises of HMM's applications, the scale up and practical utilization of HMMs have not yet occurred. This is due to the difficulty in identifying versatile design parameters for HMM fabrication and characterization via accessible techniques. In this work, spectroscopic ellipsometry and numerical simulations are utilized to identify design parameters for fabrication of HMMs using the silver and alumina system as a model system. Four interdependent design parameters are explored: thicknesses of metal and dielectric layers, transition wavelength, and minimum number of periods required for a layered metal-dielectric film to display hyperbolic dispersion. The findings are presented as a practical engineering design chart.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop an imaging algorithm that exploits strong scattering to achieve super-resolution in changing random media. The method processes large and diverse array datasets using sparse dictionary learning, clustering, and multidimensional scaling. Starting from random initializations, the algorithm reliably extracts the unknown medium properties necessary for accurate imaging using back-propagation, $\ell_2$ or $\ell_1$ methods. Remarkably, scattering enhances resolution beyond homogeneous medium limits. When abundant data are available, the algorithm allows the realization of super-resolution in imaging.</description>

      <title>Experimental realization of a full-band wave antireflection based on temporal taper metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As time can be introduced as an additional degree of freedom, temporal metamaterials nowadays open up new avenues for wave control and manipulation. Among these advancements, temporal metamaterial-based antireflection coatings have recently emerged as an innovative method that inherently avoids additional spatial insertions. However, prior temporal antireflection models with finite inserted temporal transition sections that rely on the destructive interference mechanism exhibit residual periodic strong reflections at high frequencies, fundamentally limiting the achievable bandwidth. In this work, the concept of "temporal taper", the temporal counterpart of a conventional spatial taper with a nearly full-band antireflection feature and good compatibility with gradual time-varying components, has been experimentally realized. A 1D temporal metamaterial base on voltage-controlled varactors has been designed experimentally validated. The temporal taper based broadband antireflection exempts the system from spatial matching insertions, and enables agile impedance matching for various terminal loads, positioning it as a promising approach in future photonic systems.</description>

      <title>Stimulated Emission from 2D CdSe/CdS Nanoplatelets Integrated in a Liquid-Core Fiber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Colloidal nanocrystals are unique optical gain materials due to their high intrinsic absorption, excellent quantum yield, and tunable emission. However, integration of colloidal nanocrystal solutions into photonic systems for lasing applications is challenging since high concentration levels are required for optical amplification. Here, we address this challenge by integrating colloidally dispersed core/crown CdSe/CdS 2D nanoplatelets in liquid-core optical fibers as a scalable platform. The platform allowed achieving sufficiently effective gain for amplified spontaneous emission at a threshold as low as 1.8 kW/cm2 under quasi-CW pumping, even at a con-centration two orders of magnitude lower than the minimal concentration considered to be required for gain in conventional colloidal quantum dots. We show that the low-loss optical waveguiding of the fiber is crucial for efficient stimulated emission, rendering liquid-core fibers as a promising and unique platform to realize lasers based on colloidally dispersed nanocrystals.</description>

      <title>Record Index-Bandgap Trade-off: CdPS3 as a High-Index van der Waals Platform for Ultraviolet-Visible Nanophotonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of nanophotonics is hindered by a fundamental trade-off between a material's refractive index (n) and its electronic bandgap (Eg), which severely restricts the choice of materials for short-wavelength applications. This challenge is particularly acute in the visible and ultraviolet (UV) spectra, where high-performance devices require materials that are simultaneously highly refractive and transparent. Here, we report on the van der Waals (vdW) crystal cadmium phosphorus trisulfide (CdPS3) as a solution to this long-standing problem. Through comprehensive optical and structural characterization, we show that CdPS3 possesses an anomalously high in-plane refractive index across the visible spectrum approaching 3 in the near-UV, combined with a wide indirect bandgap. This combination of properties, which circumvents the empirical Moss's law, is validated by first-principles calculations and direct near-field imaging of highly confined waveguide modes. These findings establish CdPS3 as a leading material for UV-visible photonics, opening a new pathway for the development of high-density integrated circuits and metasurfaces.</description>

      <title>Reflectivity-based refractive index measurement of van der Waals materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a reflectivity-based method for measuring the in-plane refractive index of transparent van der Waals (vdW) materials. The approach enables the characterization of as small as $3 \times 3$~{\textmu}m$^2$ exfoliated flakes on a non-transmissive substrate without assuming any specific spectral shape of the refractive index. Exfoliated flakes are most commonly obtained through mechanical exfoliation, which generally produces vdW flakes with tens-of-micron lateral dimensions. As a result, conventional ellipsometry - which depends on large, uniform areas and specific spectral models - becomes challenging to apply. Our method determines the refractive index directly from the spectral position of reflectivity minima, provided the flake thickness and the substrate complex refractive index are known. We demonstrate the technique on hafnium disulfide (HfS$_2$), a vdW semiconductor with high refractive index and low absorption, retrieving its in-plane refractive index across the visible range. The results both validate previous ellipsometry measurements and establish this method as an accessible and spectral-model-free alternative for refractive index characterization of vdW materials.</description>

      <title>Fractal Polariton Topological Insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce higher order polariton topological insulator (HOTI) realized with fractal array of microcavity pillars arranged into Sierpinski gasket-like geometry. This system exhibiting self similarity in different generations, can support localized modes either in the external or multiple internal corners depending on the controllable distortion introduced into first generation structure. Nonlinear corner modes can be selectively excited in this dissipative system using resonant optical pumping. Strong polariton-polariton interactions lead to tilt of the resonance curves and bistability as the pump amplitude increases, allowing control over corner state profiles. Linear stability analysis illustrates dynamical stability of such states. Our results show how nontrivial topology manifests itself in self similar, aperiodic structures and indicate that fractal geometry may bring qualitatively new localization scenarios in polariton HOTIs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16394v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optomechanical cavities, with nonlinear photon-phonon interactions, offer a more compact approach to chaos generation than conventional feedback-based optical systems. However, proper study on chaos synchronization of two optomechanical cavities connected by optical means is still unexplored. In this work, we theoretically investigate all-optical complete synchronization between unidirectionally coupled optomechanical cavities in the master-slave configuration. Traditionally, achieving complete synchronization in nonlinear coupled oscillators and in optical systems necessitates identical systems. Our findings, which arise naturally from the fundamental mathematical properties of optomechanical cavities, demonstrate that parameter heterogeneity can, in fact, not only enable complete synchronization but make it stable.</description>

      <title>Emergence of an Epsilon-Near-Zero Medium from Microscopic Atomic Principles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13294v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that an effective near-zero refractive index can emerge from collective light scattering in a discrete atomic lattice, using essentially exact microscopic simulations. In a 25-layer array, cooperative response leads to over a thirtyfold increase in the effective optical wavelength within the medium, almost eliminating optical phase accumulation, with potential applications in spectroscopy and optical manipulation of quantum emitters. Crucially, the near-zero refractive index arises from first-principles microscopic theory, rather than being imposed through continuous phenomenological effective-medium model - providing conceptually important insight into the emergence of macroscopic electromagnetism from atomic-scale interactions.</description>

Here we suggest to employ Mie-tronics as a powerful approach to achieve the hybridization of different resonances for the enhanced confinement of light via interference effects. Contrary to a conventional approach, we employ the symmetry breaking in finite arrays of resonators to boost the Q factors by in-plane multiple scattering. Being applied to photonic moire structures, our approach yields a giant enhancement of the Purcell factor via twist-induced coupling between degenerate collective modes. Our findings reveal how finely tuned cooperative scattering can surpass conventional limits, advancing the control of wave localization in many subwavelength systems.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Paradox and Non-Hermitian Topological Singularities</title>

Abstract: Unidirectional modes in magnetically biased electromagnetic systems have long been associated with a thermodynamic paradox: the absence of counter-propagating channels may produce field "hotspots" that can act as unphysical sinks of thermal radiation. Here we revisit this problem and show that, surprisingly, material dissipation alone cannot fully regularize the singular behavior of the normal modes of a nonreciprocal cavity. We demonstrate that the paradox is resolved by nonlocal effects, which suppress the material response at short wavelengths and eliminate field singularities altogether. Our analysis reveals a fundamental link between nonlocality, topology, and thermodynamic consistency, showing that real-space singularities and ill-defined topologies go hand in hand, even in strongly dissipative platforms. These findings clarify the physical origin of the paradox and establish nonlocality as a natural and robust mechanism for its resolution, opening new avenues to explore the intertwined roles of topology and nonlocality in passive nonreciprocal photonics.</description>

      <title>Graphene-Enabled Terahertz Metamaterial Absorber for Ultra-Wide Refractive Index Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01012v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study introduces a graphene-assisted terahertz metamaterial absorber operating at a resonance frequency of 8.436 THz. The unit cell incorporates a graphene-based split-ring resonator (SRR) configuration with additional auxiliary splits on the top layer. The structure achieves near-perfect absorption of 99.99% under TM polarization, maintaining absorption above 90% for incident angles up to 75$^{\circ}$. In addition, the proposed design remains polarization-insensitive up to 50$^{\circ}$. The sensor demonstrates a figure of merit (FOM) of $4.22 RIU^{-1}$ and achieves a maximum Q-factor of 20.98, corresponding to a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 402 GHz. An equivalent circuit model is also developed to verify the resonance behavior. Due to the strong dependence of the resonant frequency on the surrounding refractive index (RI), the absorber is applied as an RI-based sensor. It exhibits a high sensitivity of 1698 GHz/RIU across a wide refractive index range from 1.0 to 2.0. The proposed design holds promise for sensing applications involving gases, oils, solvents, polymers, and high-index dielectric materials, including the biomedical refractive index window (1.30-1.39) for label-free biosensing.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Breaking and Mie-tronic Supermodes in Nonlocal Metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03560v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Breaking symmetry in Mie-resonant metasurfaces challenges the conventional view that it weakens optical confinement. Within the Mie-tronics framework, we show that symmetry breaking can instead enhance light trapping by strengthening in-plane nonlocal coupling pathways. Through diffraction and multiple-scattering analyses, we demonstrate that diffractive bands and Mie-tronic supermodes originate from the same underlying Mie resonances but differ fundamentally in physical nature. Finite arrays exhibit Q-factor enhancement driven by redistributed radiation channels, reversing the trend predicted by infinite-lattice theory. We further show that controlled symmetry breaking opens new electromagnetic coupling channels, enabling polarization conversion in nonlocal metasurfaces. These findings establish a unified wave picture linking scattering and diffraction theories and outline design principles for multifunctional metasurfaces that exploit nonlocality for advanced light manipulation, computation, and emission control.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Fusion Network for Micro-displacement Measurement via Michelson Interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12192v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a multimodal fusion network (MFN) for precise micro-displacement measurement using a modified Michelson interferometer. The model resolves the intrinsic half-wave displacement ambiguity that limits conventional single-wavelength interferometry by introducing a dual-head learning mechanism: one head performs sub-half-wave displacement regression, and the other classifies integer interference orders. Unlike dual-wavelength or iterative fitting methods, which require high signal quality and long computation time, MFN achieves robust, real-time prediction directly from interferometric images.
  Trained on 2x10^5 simulated interferograms and fine-tuned with only about 0.24% of real experimental data (about 500 images), the model attains a displacement precision of 4.84(15) nm and an order-classification accuracy of 98%. Even under severe noise, MFN maintains stable accuracy (about 16 nm RMSE), whereas conventional heuristic algorithms exhibit errors exceeding 100 nm. These results demonstrate that MFN offers a fast, noise-tolerant, and cost-efficient solution for single-wavelength interferometric metrology, eliminating the need for multi-wavelength hardware or complex phase fitting.</description>

      <title>Efficient bidirectional quantum frequency conversion between telecom and visible bands using programmable III-V nanophotonic waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16696v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum frequency conversion (QFC) is essential for interfacing quantum systems operating at different wavelengths and for realizing scalable quantum networks. Despite extensive progress, achieving QFC with simultaneous high efficiency, low pump power, minimal noise, broad bandwidth, and pump-wavelength flexibility remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate efficient, low-noise, and bidirectional QFC between the telecom (1550-nm) and visible (780-nm) bands using unpoled indium gallium phosphide (InGaP) $\chi^{(2)}$ nanophotonic waveguides, eliminating the need for a long-wavelength pump. Leveraging the large nonlinear susceptibility of InGaP together with programmable modal-phase-matching control, we obtain record-low pump power (20 mW) -- an order of magnitude lower than that in previous demonstrations using integrated thin-film waveguides -- and record-high loss-inclusive normalized conversion efficiency among non-resonant QFC implementations. The platform maintains quantum coherence and entanglement of input photons with noise well below the single-photon level. These results mark a significant advance in integrated nonlinear photonics for high-performance QFC, facilitating the development of versatile and scalable quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Beyond critical coupling: optimal design considerations for spontaneous four-wave mixing in microring resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08563v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a self-contained analytical model for biphoton generation in microring resonators. Encompassing both all-pass and add-drop geometries, identical and distinct pump and biphoton coupling coefficients, and continuous-wave and pulsed pumping, our interaction-picture-based approach reveals time-frequency biphoton correlations while also predicting absolute generation rates. Under continuous-wave excitation, we find critical coupling of both the pump and biphoton to maximize the rate of single photons extracted from the microring, whereas critical coupling of the pump but overcoupling of the biphoton maximize the two-photon rate. Under pulsed pumping, overcoupling of both pump and biphoton (to different degrees) maximizes photon extraction probabilities, albeit under a tradeoff with spectral factorability that we quantify via parameter scans over a range of coupler pairings. As a whole, our formalism should prove valuable for the practical design of integrated photon sources, merging a flexible and intuitive biphoton-centric depiction with quantitative predictions closely tied to experimental parameters.</description>

      <title>Smoothed-Cubic Spin-Glass Model of Random Lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13508v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the equilibrium glassy behavior of a multimode random laser model with nonlinear four-body quenched disordered interactions and a global smoothed-cubic constraint on mode intensities. This constraint, which provides a more realistic representation of gain saturation than the commonly used spherical constraint, prevents intensity condensation while preserving the dense, long-range interaction structure characteristic of many multistate random lasers. The model effective Hamiltonian is a function of mode amplitudes with random frequencies and is defined on a complete mode-locked graph. Using large-scale GPU-accelerated Monte Carlo simulations with the Parallel Tempering algorithm, we analyze systems of varying sizes to probe their thermodynamic-limit behavior. Finite-size scaling of the specific heat, of the Parisi overlap distributions, and of the inverse participation ratio's reveals a spin-glass transition, with critical exponents matching the mean-field Random Energy Model universality class. The smoothed-cubic constraint produces broad, non-condensed intensity distributions, avoiding the pseudo-condensation seen in spherical models on the same interaction graph. Our results show that more realistic gain-saturation constraints preserve spin-glass characteristics while enabling simulations of larger, more dilute systems, providing a robust framework for studying glassy random lasers with self-starting mode-locking.</description>
