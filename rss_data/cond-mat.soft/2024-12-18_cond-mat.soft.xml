      <title>Universal mesoscale heterogeneity and its spatial correlations in equilibrium amorphous solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Candidates for random network media include, e.g., systems consisting of long, flexible macromolecules cross-linked (i.e., permanently bonded) together at random to form the network. Owing to the random architecture, the characteristics of the thermal motion of the elements of these media vary randomly from point to point, provided the medium has been cross-linked sufficiently to exhibit the equilibrium amorphous solid state. A particular replica field theory has long been known to capture the essential physics of amorphous solids and the transition to them. Encoded in the mean value of the field associated with this theory--i.e., the transition's order parameter--is statistical information about the thermal motions of the constituents: (i) the fraction of localized constituents, and (ii) the heterogeneity of the strength of this localization. Encoded in the field's correlations is more refined information about the motions, e.g.: (i) how the localization characteristics of pairs of localized constituents are correlated, (ii) how the correlations between the position fluctuations of the pair are distributed, and (iii) how these descriptors vary with pair separation. This information about amorphous solids is referred to as mesoscale heterogeneity. Increasingly accurate approximations to the order parameter and field correlations are examined, beginning with mean-field theory, moving up to the incorporation of gapless (i.e., elastic-displacement) fluctuations, and finally via the qualitative examination of how the gapped branches of fluctuations would further improve accuracy. Hence, an increasingly accurate set of distributions is obtained, which characterize the mesoscale heterogeneity of amorphous solids. Along the way, attention is paid to the induced measure arising from the transformation from the fluctuating order-parameter field to the fluctuating elastic displacement fields.</description>

      <title>Droplet impact on elastic substrates: force scaling crossover</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Droplet impacts are fundamental to fluid-structure interactions, shaping processes from erosion to bioprinting. While previous scaling laws have provided insights into droplet dynamics, force scaling laws remain insufficiently understood, particularly for soft substrates where both the droplet and substrate deform significantly. Here, we show that droplet impacts on elastic substrates exhibit a scaling crossover in maximum impact force, transitioning from inertial force scaling, typical for rigid substrates under high inertia, to Hertzian impact scaling, characteristic of rigid spheres on elastic substrates. Using high-speed photoelastic tomography, we captured high-resolution dynamic stress fields and identified a similarity parameter governing the interplay between droplet inertia, substrate elasticity, and deformation time scales. Our findings redefine how substrate properties influence impact forces, demonstrating that droplets under high inertia -- long thought to follow inertial force scaling -- can instead follow Hertzian impact scaling on soft substrates. This framework provides practical insights for designing soft, impact-resistant materials.</description>

      <title>Proliferation and prevention of self-loops in ensembles of interacting binary elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Models based on spins or hysterons with appropriately chosen interactions can capture advanced memory effects in complex materials, such as transients in repeatedly compressed crumpled sheets or sequential computing in driven metamaterials. However, unphysical self-loops dominate the response when interactions are chosen randomly, undermining statistical approaches. Here, we uncover the origin of self-loop proliferation in randomly coupled models. We introduce the weakly asymmetric ensemble to suppress self-loops and then develop interaction ensembles that strictly eliminate them. Finally, we use these ensembles to explore the statistics of large systems. Our work highlights the subtle role of interaction symmetries and paves the way for statistical studies of the sequential response and memory effects in complex, multistable materials.</description>

      <title>Phase-field modeling of colloid-polymer mixtures in microgravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Colloid-polymer mixtures are an archetype for modeling phase transition processes, as they a exhibit low-density gas phase, high-density crystalline phase and an intervening liquid phase. While their equilibrium behavior has been studied extensively, the role of hydrodynamics in driving their phase separation is not yet understood. We present a theoretical model that describes hydrodynamic interactions in colloid-polymer mixtures in a microgravity environment. Our phase-field model consists of the Cahn-Hilliard equation, which describes phase separation processes in multicomponent mixtures, coupled with the Stokes equation for viscous fluid flow. We account for the dependence of the suspension viscosity on the colloid concentration, and the so-called Korteweg stresses that arise at the interfaces of colloidal phases. We process video microscopy images from NASA's Binary Colloid Alloy Test (BCAT) experiments, which were performed on the International Space Station. While terrestrial experiments would be dominated by gravitational forces and buoyancy-driven flows, the microgravity environment of the BCAT experiments allows for the visualization of phase separation by low interfacial tension, and thus enables a quantitative comparison between experiment and our model predictions.</description>

      <title>Sliding wear: role of plasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present experimental wear data for polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) sliding on tile, sandpaper, and polished steel surfaces, as well as for silica glass and quartz sliding on sandpaper. The experimental results are compared with a recently developed theory of sliding wear\cite{ToBe}. Our findings demonstrate that wear on surfaces with roughness below a critical threshold cannot result from crack propagation induced by frictional shear stress in block-substrate asperity contact regions and must, therefore, originate from a different mechanism.</description>

      <title>Electrodynamic forces driving DNA-protein interactions at large distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present paper we address the general problem of selective electrodynamic interactions between DNA and protein, which is motivated by decades of theoretical study and our very recent experimental findings (M. Lechelon et al, \textit{Sci Adv} \textbf{8,} eabl5855 (2022)). Inspired by the Davydov and Holstein-Fr\"{o}hlich models describing electron motion along biomolecules, and using a model Hamiltonian written in second quantization, the time-dependent variational principle (TDVP) is used to derive the dynamical equations of the system. We demonstrate the efficacy of this {second-quantized} model for a well-documented biochemical system consisting of a restriction enzyme, \textit{Eco}RI, which binds selectively to a palindromic six-base-pair target within a DNA oligonucleotide sequence to catalyze a DNA double-strand cleavage. The time-domain Fourier spectra of the electron currents numerically computed for the DNA fragment and for the \textit{Eco}RI enzyme, respectively, exhibit a cross-correlation spectrum with a sharp co-resonance peak. When the target DNA recognition sequence is randomized, this sharp co-resonance peak is replaced with a broad and noisy spectrum. Such a sequence-dependent charge transfer phenomenology is suggestive of a potentially rich variety of selective electrodynamic interactions influencing the coordinated activity of DNA substrates, enzymes, transcription factors, ligands, and other proteins under realistic biochemical conditions characterized by electron-phonon excitations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14440v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An increasing interest in molecular structures whose long term dynamics resemble those of bistable mechanical systems promotes the search of possible candidates that may operate as two-state switching units. Of particular interest are the systems that are capable to exhibit such bistable effects as spontaneous vibrations, stochastic resonance and spontaneous synchronization. Previously, in all-atom molecular dynamics simulations it has been demonstrated that short pyridine-furan springs show these bistable phenomena. In this article we introduce a coarse-grained model of such springs and investigate the possibility to observe the bistability effects, such as spontaneous vibrations. Our findings allow the studies of short pyridine-furan springs at large time and length scales and open field for further computational research of large bistable systems.</description>

      <title>Water cavitation results from the kinetic competition of bulk, surface and surface-defect nucleation events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17626v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Water at negative pressures can remain in a metastable state for a surprisingly long time before it reaches equilibrium by cavitation, i.e. by the formation of vapor bubbles. The wide spread of experimentally measured cavitation pressures depending on water purity, surface contact angle and surface quality implicates the relevance of water cavitation in bulk, at surfaces and at surface defects for different systems. We formulate a kinetic model that includes all three different cavitation pathways and determine the needed nucleation attempt frequencies in bulk, at surfaces and at defects from atomistic molecular dynamics simulations.
  Our model reveals that cavitation occurs in pure bulk water only for defect-free hydrophilic surfaces with wetting contact angles below 50{\deg} to 60{\deg} and at pressures of the order of $-$100 MPa, depending only slightly on system size and observation time. Cavitation on defect-free surfaces occurs only for higher contact angles, with the typical cavitation pressure rising to about $-$30 MPa for very hydrophobic surfaces. Nanoscopic hydrophobic surface defects act as very efficient cavitation nuclei and can dominate the cavitation kinetics in a macroscopic system. In fact, a nanoscopic defect that hosts a pre-existing vapor bubble can raise the critical cavitation pressure much further. Our results explain the wide variation of experimentally observed cavitation pressures in synthetic and biological systems and highlight the importance of surface and defect mechanisms for the nucleation of metastable systems.</description>

      <title>Electrostatic self-assembly of neutral particles on a dielectric substrate: A theoretical study via a multiple-image method and an effective-dipole approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22608v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A multiple-image method is developed to accurately calculate the electrostatic interaction between neutral dielectric particles and a uniformly charged dielectric substrate. The difference in dielectric constants between the particle and the solvent medium leads to a reversal of positive and negative polarizations in the particle. The variance in dielectric constants between the solvent medium and the substrate causes a transition from attractive to repulsive forces between the particle and the substrate. A nonuniform electrostatic field is generated by the polarized charges on the substrate due to mutual induction. These characteristics of electrostatic manipulation determine whether particles are adsorbed onto the substrate or pushed away from it. The self-assembled particles tend to aggregate in a stable hexagonal structure on the substrate. These findings provide new insights into self-assembly processes involving neutral particles on a dielectric substrate.</description>

      <title>Probing Langmuir monolayer self-assembly in condensed and collapsed phases: grazing incidence X-ray diffraction and X-ray standing waves studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12686v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ce-induced effects on the self-assembly of arachidic acid Langmuir monolayers was studied in this work. The monolayers were formed on the liquid subphase in the presence of Ce(III) ions. A new type of structural configuration is found for such monolayers, in which the monolayer maintains its structural ordering despite being compressed beyond the collapse point. Instead of forming 3D aggregates as in the typical collapsed state, the monolayer appears to be corrugated. Grazing incidence X-ray diffraction and X-ray standing waves confirm these findings. The diffraction pattern for the monolayer in a new state is represented by the unclosed diffraction rings with maxima near the sample horizon. This diffraction pattern is quantitatively reproduced in the numerical simulations by assuming the corrugated monolayer. The details of the conditions under which these corrugated Langmuir monolayers were observed and the analysis of the diffraction data are described.</description>

      <title>Surface chemistry-based continuous separation of polystyrene particles in a microchannel via diffusiophoresis and diffusioosmosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00246v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The separation of colloidal particles is of great importance in many fields, such as purification, sensing, and bioanalysis. However, separating particles based on their surface physical or chemical properties remains challenging. This study demonstrates through experimental and theoretical analyses that diffusiophoresis and diffusioosmosis enable the continuous separation of carboxylate polystyrene particles with similar sizes and zeta potentials but distinct surface concentrations of carboxyl groups. In the proposed approach, the particles are exposed to salt concentration gradients generated in a double-junction microfluidic device, fed with low and high electrolyte concentration streams. As the particles move across environments with varying salinity levels, their dynamics are influenced by the sensitivity of their zeta potential to the local salt concentration, which in turn is affected by surface conductance effects induced by the surface carboxyl groups. By harnessing these effects, colloids with comparable zeta potentials but different surface concentrations of carboxyl groups are separated with 100% efficiency when they exhibit opposite zeta potential sensitivities to salt. This simple approach, which relies on an easy-to-operate device with no external energy source, has discipline-spanning potential for the continuous separation of colloids distinguished solely by surface properties that influence their zeta potential sensitivities, like roughness, permeability, heterogeneity, and chemical composition.</description>

Abstract: We present a surface analog to a dripping faucet, where a viscous liquid slides down an immiscible meniscus. Periodic pinch-off of the dripping filament is observed, generating a succession of monodisperse floating lenses. We show that this interfacial dripping faucet can be described analogously to its single-phase counterpart, replacing surface tension by the spreading coefficient, and even undergoes a transition to a jetting regime. This liquid/liquid/gas system opens perspectives for the study of the dynamics of emulsions at interfaces.</description>

Abstract: Despite the large body of research on coalescence, firm agreement between experiment, theory, and computation has not been established for the very first moments following the initial contact of two liquid volumes. Combining a range of experimental and computational modeling approaches in two different geometries, namely drop-drop and drop-bath configurations, we have been able to elucidate the influence of the intervening gas and van der Waals forces on coalescence. For simple liquids considered here, the gas influences both pre- and post-contact regimes, with jump-to-contact being the primary mode of merging. Subsequently, wave-like air pockets are observed and ultimately influence the initial opening dynamics of the neck.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02135v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the process of thermal convection in jammed emulsions with a yield-stress rheology. We find that heat transfer occurs via an intermittent mechanism, whereby intense short-lived convective "heat bursts" are spaced out by long-lasting conductive periods. This behaviour is the result of a sequence of fluidization-rigidity transitions, rooted in a non-trivial interplay between emulsion yield-stress rheology and plastic activity, which we characterize via a statistical analysis of the dynamics at the droplet scale. We also show that droplets' coalescence induced during heat bursts leads to a spatially heterogeneous phase-inversion of the emulsion which eventually supports a sustained convective state.</description>

      <title>Mathematical model of fluid front dynamics driven by porous media pumps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14666v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Air-permeable porous media hosts air within their pores. Upon removal from the material's interior, these porous media have the tendency to replenish the air, effectively acting as a suction pump. Therefore, the technique used to convert a porous media into a pump, consists of degassing the material to remove their air inside. The suction property when recovering the air, can be used to move a liquid through a microfluidic channel, studying the dynamics of the liquid-air front. In this article, we have developed a theoretical mathematical model that precisely characterize the behavior of this kind of pumps and the dynamics of the liquid-air front. This model allows us to use porous media pumps as very accurate devices to move liquids in a completely controlled way, being able to obtain characteristic properties of fluids such as viscosity or the pressure applied to them. We have tested it using experimental data from the literature, and we have been able to observe that the theory fits satisfactorily with the experiments, being able to affirm that the model is correctly satisfied. This type of pump is of great interest to the scientific community because of its small size and the fact that it operates without any external power source.</description>

Abstract: Host-guest binding plays a crucial role in the functionality of various systems, and its efficiency is often quantified using the binding free energy, which represents the free-energy difference between the bound and dissociated states. Here, we propose a methodology to compute the binding free energy based on the energy representation (ER) theory of solution that enables us to evaluate the free-energy difference between the systems of interest with the molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Unlike the other free-energy methods, such as the Bennett acceptance ratio (BAR), the ER theory does not require the MD simulations for hypothetical intermediate states connecting the systems of interest, leading to reduced computational costs. By constructing the thermodynamic cycle of the binding process that is suitable for the ER theory, a robust calculation of the binding free energy is realized. We apply the present method to the self-association of \textit{N}-methylacetamide (NMA) in different solvents and the binding of aspirin to $\beta$-cyclodextrin (CD) in water. In the former case, the present method estimates that the binding free energy decreases as the solvent polarity decreases. This trend is consistent with the experimental finding. For the latter system, the binding free energies for the two representative CD-aspirin bound complexes, primary (P) and secondary (S) complexes, are estimated to be $-5.2\pm 0.1$ and $-5.03\pm 0.09~\mathrm{kcalmol^{-1}}$, respectively. These values are satisfactorily close to those from the BAR method [$-4.2\pm 0.2$ and $-4.1\pm 0.2\mathrm{kcal~mol^{-1}}$ for P and S, respectively]. Furthermore, the interaction-energy component analysis reveals that the van der Waals interaction between aspirin and CD dominantly contributes to the stabilization of the bound complexes, that is in harmony with the well-known binding mechanism in the CD systems.</description>
