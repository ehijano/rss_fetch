      <title>Expression with self-consistent magnetic units for calculation of critical current density using the Bean's Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss issues related to calculation of critical current density, Jc,mag, reported by Goyal et al [1] using the Bean's model [2,3] via the expression developed by Gyorgy et al. [4] for calculating Jc,mag. When used with the correct formalism with respect to magnetic units, this expression yields to errors in the reported values of Jc,mag, in A/cm2. The authors emphasize the need for self-consistent magnetic unit applications when employing the formula from Gyorgy et al., proposing an expression that eliminates ambiguities and aligns with the correct dimensional analysis. This note emphasizes the importance of using appropriate magnetic units and urges researchers to reconsider the established methodologies in the literature, fostering improved accuracy in future studies of (RE)BCO-based coated conductors.</description>

      <title>Non-linear Hall resistivity in overdoped Pr$_{1.82}$Ce$_{0.18}$CuO$_{4 + \delta}$ electron-doped cuprate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hall coefficient $R_\mathrm{H}$ as a function of temperature for Pr$_{2-x}$Ce$_{x}$CuO$_{4}$ (PCCO) at $x = 0.17$ shows two sign changes between 0 and 300K that can be explained qualitatively using the two-carrier model. Using this two-carrier model, one predicts the presence of a nonlinear $B^{3}$ contribution to the Hall resistivity $\rho_{yx}$ that should be easily observed when the linear coefficient $R_{H}$ is approaching zero. We present the measurement of this nonlinear Hall resistivity for overdoped PCCO thin films at $x=0.18$. We show that this weak nonlinear term persists at all temperatures despite being dominated by the linear term ($R_{H}B$). It is strongly temperature dependent and, analyzing it with the two-carrier model, we conclude that the density of electron carriers is larger than the hole density, but that the hole mobility is larger than that of the electrons. This nonlinear Hall resistivity should be observable for similar materials for which $R_{H}(T)$ goes through sign reversals as does overdoped PCCO.</description>

      <title>Topological phases in twisted Rashba superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the topological properties of a twisted superconducting bilayer with spin-singlet pairings and Rashba spin-orbital coupling. By introducing the chirality basis, we obtain the effective odd-parity superconductors with the help of spin-orbital coupling. For the twisted bilayer with $d$-wave pairings, two non-Abelian topological phases with Chern number $C=-1$ and $C=-5$ are identified, and the analytical expressions for the boundary of non-Abelian phase are derived as well within the circular Fermi surface approximation. We perform numerical calculations at the twisted angle of Moir\'e lattice, which further verify the topological phase diagram from the effective odd-parity Hamiltonian. For the bilayer with $d$-wave and $s_{\pm}$-wave pairings, we reveal the second-order topological superconductor with Majorana zero mode on each corner, by analyzing the relative configuration of the pairing nodes of superconductors and the Fermi surface of normal state. It is found that the regions of second-order topological phase are narrowed when the bilayer is twisted.</description>

      <title>Thermal conductivity of REBCO tapes with different stabilizers from 4.2 to 200 K</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: REBCO coated conductor is a high temperature superconductor that has a wide range of applications, one of which is the current leads of magnet systems. In the design of current leads, it is crucial to minimize their thermal conduction while maintain stable electrical conduction. Therefore, thermal conductivity of various REBCO tapes need to be characterized and analyzed. In this research, we measured thermal conductivity of REBCO tapes in the longitudinal direction from 4.2 to 200 K. Samples with Cu, Ag and Ag-3at%Au stabilizers of various thicknesses were measured. The electrical conductivity of these stabilizers was also characterized by residual resistance ratio (RRR) measurements and correlated with the thermal conductivity results. We showed that in samples with 10 micron or less Cu stabilizer, thermal conduction is dominated by that of the Cu which has much higher thermal conductivity than the Hastelloy substrate and the superconductor layer. In addition, the sample with 3 micron Ag-3at%Au stabilizer has significantly lower thermal conductivity than that with 3 micron silver stabilizer. It is concluded that REBCO with Ag-3at%Au stabilizer is promising for current lead applications.</description>

      <title>Residual resistance ratio of Cu stabilizer in commercial REBCO tapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Residual resistance ratio (RRR) of Cu stabilizer in REBCO coated conductor is an important design parameter for REBCO magnets. In this work, we measured RRR of electroplated Cu stabilizer in commercial REBCO tapes. Over 130 samples were measured for the quality assurance programs of REBCO magnet projects at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory, USA (NHMFL). The average RRR value was above 50. In order to investigate the factors that influence RRR, several samples were analyzed by using scanning electron microscopy, secondary ion mass spectroscopy, and inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy. We found that, in our samples, RRR was strongly correlated with the grain size. We demonstrated that RRR was primarily determined by grain boundary resistivity. Lower RRR was also strongly correlated with higher concentration of chlorine impurity. This is explained by that higher chlorine impurity hindered the grain growth in the room temperature self annealing process resulting smaller grain. Smaller grain resulted in lower RRR. In addition, thermal annealing significantly enhanced RRR. An activation energy of 0.4 eV was obtained from the annealing experiment which corresponds to the activation of Cu grain growth.</description>

      <title>REBCO delamination characterization by 90 degree peel test</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: REBCO tape has successfully used in ultra-high field magnets. Mechanically, it is very strong in its length direction but is prone to delamination in the thickness direction. In an epoxy impregnated REBCO magnet, thermal strain alone could delaminate the conductor. Even for dry wound REBCO coil, a conductor with very low delamination strength is still a concern. Therefore, it is important to characterize the delamination strength of the conductor. In the past decade, significant progresses have been made in the characterization of REBCO delamination strength. Among several developed characterization methods, the 90 degree peel test is simple to setup and seems to offer reproducible results. Therefore, this test could be used as a reliable method to characterize the relative delamination strength of REBCO tapes for quality control purposes. This paper presents our development of 90 degree peel test method for quality assurance test of the 40 T all-superconducting magnet project at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory. We investigated the factors that influence the test results, such as thickness and RRR of the copper layer. We found that peel strength increases with decreasing Cu thickness. We also found that peel strength is positively correlated with RRR of the copper. Despite these effects, 90 degree peel test is still a valuable quality assurance tool to evaluate delamination strength for large volume of tapes with the same copper thickness.</description>

      <title>Quantum-criticality and superconductivity in twisted transition metal di-chalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze a model for electronic structure and interactions in twisted transition metal chalcogenide WSe$_2$ for superconductivity. In this material, spin-orbit scattering locks the z-components of spins of low-energy fermions near the Dirac ${\bf K}$ and ${\bf K}'$ points of the hexagonal Brillouin zone, reducing the symmetry of spin-spin interactions to that of an xy model. We show that a nominally repulsive 4-fermion interaction gives rise to an attraction for pairing in a two-component $E^{-}$ channel, which is a hexagonal lattice representation of the $\ell =1$ channel. The gap function is inversion-odd and a linear combination of spin singlet and spin triplet. At weak coupling superconductivity emerges via the Kohn-Luttinger mechanism; we compute $T_c$ for the Fermi-level lying close to the van Hove singularity. At strong coupling, the pairing is mediated by XY magnetic fluctuations peaked at momenta ${\bf K}-{\bf K}' = 2 {\bf K}$ and we estimate $T_c$ using the form of the quantum-critical XY fluctuations, displaying $\omega/T$ scaling.</description>

      <title>Probing the Meissner effect in pressurized bilayer nickelate superconductors using diamond quantum sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent reports on the signatures of high-temperature superconductivity with a critical temperature Tc close to 80 K have triggered great research interest and extensive follow-up studies. Although zero-resistance state has been successfully achieved under improved hydrostatic pressure conditions, there is no clear evidence of superconducting diamagnetism in pressurized $\mathrm{La_{3}Ni_{2}O_{7-\delta}}$ due to the low superconducting volume fraction and limited magnetic measurement techniques under high pressure conditions. Here, using shallow nitrogen-vacancy centers implanted on the culet of diamond anvils as in-situ quantum sensors, we observe convincing evidence for the Meissner effect in polycrystalline samples $\mathrm{La_{3}Ni_{2}O_{7-\delta}}$ and $\mathrm{La_{2}PrNi_{2}O_{7}}$: the magnetic field expulsion during both field cooling and field warming processes. The correlated measurements of Raman spectra and NV-based magnetic imaging indicate an incomplete structural transformation related to the displacement of oxygen ions emerging in the non-superconducting region. Furthermore, comparative experiments on different pressure transmitting media (silicone oil and KBr) and nickelates ($\mathrm{La_{3}Ni_{2}O_{7-\delta}}$ and $\mathrm{La_{2}PrNi_{2}O_{7}}$) reveal that an improved hydrostatic pressure conditions and the substitution of La by Pr in $\mathrm{La_{3}Ni_{2}O_{7-\delta}}$ can dramatically increase the superconductivity. Our work clarifies the controversy about the Meissner effect of bilayer nickelate and contributes to a deeper understanding of the mechanism of nickelate high-temperature superconductors.</description>

      <title>Gate-tunable nonlocal Josephson effect through magnetic van der Waals bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well-known that the proximity effect at superconductor/ferromagnet (S/F) interfaces produces damped oscillatory behavior of the Cooper pair wave function within the ferromagnetic regions, which is analogous to the inhomogeneous Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) superconductivity. It is often called mesoscopic FFLO state and gives rise to $0-\pi$-transitions in S/F/S Josephson junctions. This paper offers an analysis of the proximity effect at interfaces between superconductors and magnetic van der Waals (vdW) bilayers. The specific feature of the proximity effect in the vdW bilayer systems is the presence of non-local Cooper pairs. We predict that the mesoscopic FFLO state formed by such pairs is sensitive to the difference between on-site energies of the monolayers composing the bilayer and, thus, can be controlled by applying a gating potential to one of the monolayers. This opens the possibility of implementing gate-controlled $0-\pi$ transitions in Josephson junctions through the magnetic vdW bilayer weak links.</description>

      <title>Interstitial anionic electrons involved superconductivity and T-linear resistivity behavior in electride La3In</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrides are unique materials because of the existence of interstitial anionic electrons (IAEs). Due to these loosely bound IAEs and their strong interaction with the framework of cations, electrides can host superconductivity with rather high Tc, especially under high pressure, as predicted in theory. However, the experimental observations of superconductivity in electrides are very rare, let alone the detailed studies on intrinsic properties of single crystals. Here, we report the superconducting and normal-state properties of electride La3In single crystals. La3In shows a type-II superconductivity with Tc ~ 9.4 K and a T-linear resistivity in a wide temperature range. Experimental measurements and theoretical calculations suggest that the relatively high Tc could be ascribed to the high density of states around the Fermi level caused by short flat bands along R-M direction and the strong electron-phonon coupling, partially derived from the IAEs. Meanwhile, the T-linear resistivity may reflect the significant electronic correlation effect in this material. These findings will shed light on understanding the role of IAEs in superconductivity and open a promising way to explore high-temperature superconductors in electrides.</description>

      <title>Non-bulk Superconductivity in Pr$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ Single Crystals Under Pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magneto-transport measurements of Pr$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ single crystals performed under externally applied pressures up to 73 GPa in diamond anvil cells with either KBr or Nujol oil as pressure media yield signatures of superconductivity with a maximum onset temperature of approximately 31 K. True zero resistance was not observed, consistent with a non-percolating superconducting volume fraction. Magnetization measurements provided corroborating evidence of superconductivity, with a pressure-dependent diamagnetic signal occurring below the onset temperature, and an estimate from the absolute value of the susceptibility suggests a superconducting volume fraction on the order of 10%. We observe sample-to-sample variations in the magnitude and pressure dependence of Tc as well as a dependence on the configuration of electrical contacts on a given sample. Possible causes of this behavior may be significant inhomogeneities in the pressure and/or damage to the samples induced by the pressure media as well as inhomogeneities in the crystals themselves. The results imply that our as-grown Pr$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ single crystals are not bulk superconductors but that there is a minority structure present within the crystals that is indeed superconducting.</description>

      <title>New Limits for Existence of Transverse Zero Sound in Fermi Liquid 3He</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Landau predicted that transverse sound propagates in a Fermi liquid with sufficiently strong Fermi liquid interactions, unlike a classical fluid which cannot support shear oscillations. Previous attempts to observe this unique collective mode yielded inconclusive results due to contributions from single particle excitations. Here, we have microfabricated acoustic cavities with a micron-scale path length that is suitable for direct detection of this sound mode. The interference fringes of these acoustic Fabry-Perot cavities can be used to determine both the real and imaginary parts of the acoustic impedance. We report a null-result in this search as no clear interference fringe has been observed in the Fermi liquid, indicating the attenuation of TZS is likely above 2000 cm^-1. We provide theoretical justification for why the sound mode may yet exist but not being directly detectable due to high attenuation.</description>

      <title>Unconventional superconductivity mediated by exciton density wave fluctuations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synthetic platforms afford an unparalleled degree of controllability in realizing strongly-correlated phases of matter. In this work, we study the possibility of electrically tunable exciton-mediated superconductivity arising in charge-imbalanced bilayer semiconductors. Focusing on the case of a bilayer semiconductor heterostructure, we identify the gating conditions required to achieve exciton density wave order within a self-consistent Hartree-Fock approximation. We analyze the role of the coupling of excitonic fluctuations to the fermionic charge carriers to find that the Goldstone mode of the density wave order can mediate attractive interactions leading to superconductivity. Furthermore, when the system is close to the density wave ordering, the interactions mediated by low-energy exciton modes can support an interlayer pair-density wave superconductor of anisotropic character. We discuss experimental signatures associated with these phenomena.</description>

      <title>Elastic properties of Cu-6wt\%Ag alloy wires for pulsed magnets investigated by ultrasonic techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conductor materials with good mechanical performance as well as high electrical- and thermal-conductivities are particularly important to break through the current bottle-neck limit ($\sim 100$ T) of pulsed magnets. Here we perform systematic studies on the elastic properties of the Cu-6wt%Ag alloy wires, a promising candidate material for the new-generation pulsed magnets, by employing two independent ultrasonic techniques - resonant ultrasound spectroscopy (RUS) and ultrasound pulse-echo experiments. Our RUS measurements manifest that the elastic properties of the Cu-6wt%Ag alloy wires can be improved by an electroplastic drawing procedure as compared with the conventional cold drawing. We also take this chance to test the availability of our newly-built ultrasound pulse-echo facility at Wuhan National High Magnetic Field Center (WHMFC, China), and the results suggest that the elastic performance of the electroplastically-drawn Cu-6wt%Ag alloy wire remains excellent without anomalous softening under extreme conditions, e.g., ultra-high magnetic field up to 50 T, nitrogen / helium cryogenic liquids.</description>

      <title>Towards an ab initio theory of high-temperature superconductors: a study of multilayer cuprates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Significant progress towards a theory of high-temperature superconductivity in cuprates has been achieved via the study of effective one- and three-band Hubbard models. Nevertheless, material-specific predictions, while essential for constructing a comprehensive theory, remain challenging due to the complex relationship between real materials and the parameters of the effective models. By combining cluster dynamical mean-field theory and density functional theory in a charge-self-consistent manner, here we show that the goal of material-specific predictions for high-temperature superconductors from first principles is within reach. We take on the challenge of explaining the remarkable physics of multilayer cuprates by focusing on the two representative Ca$_{(1+n)}$Cu$_{n}$O$_{2n}$Cl$_2$ and HgBa$_2$Ca$_{(n-1)}$Cu$_n$O$_{(2n+2)}$ families. We shed light on the microscopic origin of many salient features of multilayer cuprates, in particular the $n$-dependence of their superconducting properties. The maximum of $T_c$ for the tri-layer compounds is explained by an intertwined analysis of the charge-transfer gap, superexchange $J$, and inhomogeneous doping between the CuO$_{2}$ planes. We highlight the existence of a minimal doping (4\%) required for superconductivity to emerge. We capture material-specific properties such as the larger propensity of HgBa$_2$Ca$_{(n-1)}$Cu$_n$O$_{(2n+2)}$ to superconduct compared with Ca$_{(1+n)}$Cu$_{n}$O$_{2n}$Cl$_2$. We also find the coexistence of arcs and pockets observed with photoemission, the charge redistribution between copper and oxygen, and the link to the pseudogap. Our work establishes a framework for comprehensive studies of cuprates, enables detailed comparisons with experiment, and, through its \emph{ab initio} settings, unlocks opportunities for theoretical material design of high-temperature superconductors.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity and spin density wave in AA stacked bilayer graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07405v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work theoretically analyzes electronic ordering in AA-stacked bilayer graphene and the role of the Coulomb interaction in these many-body phenomena. Using the random phase approximation to account for screening, we find intra-layer effective interactions to be much stronger than inter-layer interactions; under certain circumstances, the latter may also become attractive. At zero doping, the Coulomb repulsion stabilizes the spin-density wave state, with a N{\'e}el temperature in the tens of Kelvin. While dominant in the undoped system, the spin-density wave is destroyed by sufficiently strong doping and a superconducting phase emerges. We find that the effective Coulomb inter-layer interaction can give rise to superconductivity. However, the corresponding critical temperature is negligibly small, and phonon-mediated attraction must be introduced to observe it. Strong intra-layer repulsion suppresses order parameters that couple two intra-layer electrons. We point out a possible superconducting state with finite Cooper pair momentum.</description>

Abstract: The presence of a non-centrosymmetric crystal structure and in-plane mirror symmetry allows an Ising spin-orbit coupling to form in some two-dimensional materials. Examples include transition metal dichalcogenide superconductors like monolayer NbSe$_2$, MoS$_2$, TaS$_2$, and PbTe$_2$, where a nontrivial nature of the superconducting state is currently being explored. In this study, we develop a microscopic formalism for Ising superconductors that captures the superconducting instability arising from a momentum-dependent spin- and charge-fluctuation-mediated pairing interaction. We apply our pairing model to the electronic structure of monolayer NbSe$_2$, where first-principles calculations reveal the presence of strong paramagnetic fluctuations. Our calculations provide a quantitative measure of the mixing between the even- and odd-parity superconducting states and its variation with Coulomb interaction. Further, numerical analysis in the presence of an external Zeeman field reveals the role of Ising spin-orbit coupling and mixing of odd-parity superconducting state in influencing the low-temperature enhancement of the critical magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Nanoscale structural correlations in a model cuprate superconductor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10411v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the extent and role of inhomogeneity is a pivotal challenge in the physics of cuprate superconductors. While it is known that structural and electronic inhomogeneity is prevalent in the cuprates, it has proven difficult to disentangle compound-specific features from universally relevant effects. Here we combine advanced neutron and x-ray diffuse scattering with numerical modeling to obtain insight into bulk structural correlations in HgBa$_2$CuO$_{4+\delta}$. This cuprate exhibits a high optimal transition temperature of nearly 100 K, pristine charge-transport behavior, and a simple average crystal structure without long-range structural instabilities, and is therefore uniquely suited for investigations of intrinsic inhomogeneity. We uncover diffuse reciprocal-space patterns that correspond to prominent nanoscale correlations of atomic displacements perpendicular to the CuO$_2$ planes. The real-space nature of the correlations is revealed through three-dimensional pair distribution function analysis and complementary numerical refinement. We find that relative displacements of ionic and CuO$_2$ layers play a crucial role, and that the structural inhomogeneity is not directly caused by the presence of conventional point defects. The observed correlations are therefore intrinsic to HgBa$_2$CuO$_{4+\delta}$, and thus likely important for the physics of cuprates more broadly. It is possible that the structural correlations are closely related to the unusual superconducting correlations and Mott-localization in these complex oxides. As advances in scattering techniques yield increasingly comprehensive data, the experimental and analysis tools developed here for large volumes of diffuse scattering data can be expected to aid future investigations of a wide range of materials.</description>

      <title>Pairing susceptibility in the weakly interacting multilayer Hubbard model evaluated by direct perturbative expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02656v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a systematic study of the interaction, doping, and layer dependence of the $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave pairing susceptibility of the Hubbard model for a stacked 2D square lattice. We perform a multi-index perturbative expansion up to fourth-order to obtain coefficients in powers of the Hubbard $U$, the inter-layer $V$, and the pair-hopping $J$ interactions. We evaluate the vertex diagrams that contribute to the pairing susceptibility for $\ell= 2,3, 4$ layered models in the $U$-$V$-$J$ interaction space. This provides unprecedented access to the pairing amplitudes, allowing us to identify the processes that enhance or reduce pairing. We distinguish pairing within the diagonal channel, $P^{\parallel}_{d}$, and off-diagonal channel, $P^{\perp}_{d}$, and find that, in the absence of $J$, the qualitative behavior of the layered system is equivalent to the single-layer model. In the presence of $J$, we show that pairing is enhanced sublinearly with increasing $\ell$ and is primarily mediated by the $P^{\perp}_{d}$ component and find which coefficients and diagram sets are responsible. Finally, we construct a generalized $\ell$-dependent equation for $ P^{\perp}_{d}$ to speculate pairing beyond $\ell=4$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09923v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically discuss the emergence of fractional Shapiro steps in a Josephson junction created by confining a two-dimensional electron gas at an oxide interface. This phenomenon is induced by an alternating current of proper amplitude and frequency and can be tuned by a magnetic field applied perpendicular to the Rashba spin-orbit axis. The presence of fractional Shapiro steps can be associated with the creation of Majorana bound states at the boundaries of the superconducting leads. Our findings represent a route for the identification of topological superconductivity in non-centrosymmetric materials and confined systems in the presence of spin--orbit interaction, offering also new insights into recently explored frameworks.</description>

      <title>Emergence and tunability of Fermi-pocket and electronic instabilities in layered Nickelates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16042v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Layered Nickelates have gained intensive attention as potential high-temperature superconductors, showing similarities and subtle differences to well-known Cuprates. This study introduces a modelling framework to analyze the tunability of electronic structures by focusing on effective orbitals and additional Fermi pockets, mimicking doping or external pressure qualitatively. It investigates the role of the $3d_{z^2}$ orbital in interlayer hybridization, which leads to the formation of a second pocket in the Fermi surface. The resulting effective model also predicts specific charge and spin susceptibility in the form of Lindhard susceptibility at wave vector $\mathbf{q_{0}} = (\pi, \pi)$, which can be tuned by doping or pressure. These results provide valuable insights into tunable orbital contributions and their influence on potential ordering and electronic instabilities in Layered Nickelates.</description>

      <title>The quantum and anharmonic effects on the vibrational and superconducting properties of H3Se in Im-3m phase under high pressure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10625v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hydrogen-based compounds have attracted significant attention in recent years due to the discovery of conventional superconductivity with high critical temperature under high pressure, rekindling hopes for searching room temperature superconductor. In this work, we investigated systematically the vibrational and superconducting properties of H3Se in Im-3m phase under pressures ranging from 75 to 200 GPa. Our approach combines the stochastic self-consistent harmonic approximation with first-principles calculations to address effects from the quantum and anharmonic vibrations of ions. It turns out that these effects significantly modify the crystal structure, increasing the inner pressure by about 8 GPa compared to situations where they are ignored. The phonon spectra suggest that with these effects included, the crystal can be stabilized at pressures as low as about 55 GPa, much lower than the previously predicted value of over 100 GPa. Our calculations also highlight the critical role of quantum and anharmonic effects on electron-phonon coupling properties. Neglecting these factors could result in a substantial overestimation of the superconducting critical temperature, by approximately 25 K at 125 GPa, for example.</description>

      <title>Nevanlinna Analytic Continuation for Migdal-Eliashberg Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02737v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we present a method to reconstruct real-frequency properties from analytically continued causal Green's functions within the framework of Migdal-Eliashberg (ME) theory for superconductivity. ME theory involves solving a set of coupled equations self-consistently in imaginary frequency space, but to obtain experimentally measurable properties like the spectral function and quasiparticle density of states, it is necessary to perform an analytic continuation to real frequency space. Traditionally, the ME Green's function is decomposed into three fundamental complex functions, which are analytically continued independently. However, these functions do not possess the causal properties of Green's functions, complicating or even preventing the application of standard methods such as Maximum Entropy. Our approach overcomes these challenges, enabling the use of various analytic continuation techniques that were previously impractical. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method by combining it with Nevanlinna analytic continuation to achieve accurate real-frequency results for ME theory, which are directly comparable to experimental data, with applications highlighted for the superconductors MgB$_2$ and LaBeH$_8$.</description>

Abstract: The dynamics of overdamped Josephson junctions under varying microwave-driving conditions have been studied through numerical simulations using the resistively-shunted junction (RSJ) model. The aim is to determine the optimal junction characteristics and external microwave (rf) parameters that maximize the width of quantum voltage levels (Shapiro steps) from order n = 0 to n &gt; 1. Both the rf and dc power requirements, along with the junction parameter spread and power attenuation, are analyzed as key factors that need to be optimized for improved performance of the quantum device. This work aims to advance the development of next-generation Programmable Josephson Voltage Standards with logic architectures that surpass the conventional binary and ternary codifications used in present quantum voltage arrays, while significantly reducing the overall number of junctions as well as the number of sub-arrays and bias lines.</description>

Abstract: Understanding the doped Mott insulator is a central challenge in condensed matter physics. In this work, we first explicitly identify a new sign structure in the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model on the square lattice that replaces the conventional Fermi statistics for weakly interacting electrons. Then we show that the singular, i.e., the phase-string part of the sign structure in the partition function can be precisely turned off in a modified model. The density matrix renormalization group method is then employed to study these two models comparatively on finite-size systems, which is designed to unveil the consequences of the phase-string component. We find that the hole pairing is present not only in the quasi-long-range superconducting phase but also in the stripe phase of the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model. However, once the phase-string is switched off, both the superconducting and stripe orders together with the underlying hole pairing disappear. The corresponding ground state reduces to a trivial Fermi-liquid-like state with small hole Fermi pockets that is decoupled from the antiferromagnetic spin background. It is in sharp contrast to the original $t$-$t'$-$J$ model where large Fermi surfaces can be restored in the stripe phase found at $t'/t&lt;0$ or the superconducting phase at $t'/t&gt;0$ in the six-leg ladder calculation. Our study clearly demonstrates that the strong correlation effect in doped Mott insulator should be mainly attributed to the long-range quantum entanglement between the spin and charge, which is, non-perturbatively, beyond a simple spin-charge separation under the no double occupancy constraint.</description>

Abstract: Charge stripes have been widely observed in many different types of unconventional superconductors, holding varying periods ($\mathcal{P}$) and intensities. However, a general understanding on the interplay between charge stripes and superconducting properties is still incomplete. Here, using large-scale unbiased numerical simulations on a general inhomogeneous Hubbard model, we discover that the charge-stripe period $\mathcal{P}$, which is variable in different real material systems, could dictate the pairing symmetries -- $d$ wave for $\mathcal{P} \ge 4$, $s$ and $d$ waves for $\mathcal{P} \le 3$. In the latter, tuning hole doping and charge-stripe amplitude can trigger a $d$-$s$ wave transition and magnetic-correlation shift, where the $d$-wave state converts to a pairing-density wave state, competing with the $s$ wave. These interesting phenomena arise from an unusual stripe-induced selection rule of pairing symmetries around on-stripe region and within inter-stripe region, giving rise to a critical point of $\mathcal{P}=3$ for the phase transition. In general, our findings offer new insights into the differences in the superconducting pairing mechanisms across many $\mathcal{P}$-dependent superconducting systems, highlighting the decisive role of charge stripe.</description>

Abstract: Anomalous metallic behavior is often observed near superconductor-insulator quantum critical points and, if persistent to zero temperature, poses a challenge to current theories of metals. One explanation for this behavior could be incomplete thermal equilibrium between the sample and the cryostat. However, despite decades of study, the temperature of an anomalous metal has not yet been measured. We introduce a new experimental probe by capturing microwave radiation emitted from the anomalous metal, using a two-dimensional array of superconductor-semiconductor hybrid Josephson junctions as a model system. The total emitted radiation exceeds the limits of thermodynamic equilibrium, and is well described by an elevated sample temperature. The extracted sample temperature matches the onset of anomalous metallic behavior. Additionally, we discover scaling behavior of radiative noise in the presence of an applied bias. Elements of our noise-scaling observations were predicted based on nonlinear critical field theories and gauge-gravity duality between current noise and Hawking radiation from a black hole. This work shows that, in a prominent model system, anomalous metallic behavior is a non-equilibrium effect, and opens a new frontier in the study of universal, non-equilibrium phenomena near quantum criticality.</description>
