      <title>Appropriateness of the McNamara and Bulland's (2004) methodology for computing frequency-dependent seismic power</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The methodology developed by McNamara and Bulland (2004) for computing Power Spectral Densities (PSDs) has gained popularity due to its low computational cost and reduction of spectral variance. This methodology is widely used in seismic noise studies and station performance evaluations and is implemented in tools like ISPAQ, MUSTANG, and PQLX. However, concerns have been raised about its appropriateness in certain contexts, particularly when high-resolution spectral detail is required. This study evaluates McNamara and Bulland's methodology by comparing it with Welch's method across three Alaskan stations with differing microseism conditions. When calculating seismic power across a band of frequencies--for example, the 5-10s secondary microseism--we find that both methodologies produce time series with nearly identical trends, albeit with slight differences in absolute power values. Our results demonstrate that McNamara and Bulland's methodology is fully appropriate for certain applications, specifically ones that rely on averaged seismic energy over a frequency band as opposed to a single discrete frequency.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Capabilities of Deep Learning for Processing and Interpreting One-Shot Multi-offset GPR Data: A Numerical Case Study for Lunar and Martian Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ground-penetrating radar (GPR) is a mature geophysical method that has gained increasing popularity in planetary science over the past decade. GPR has been utilised both for Lunar and Martian missions providing pivotal information regarding the near surface geology of Terrestrial planets. Within that context, numerous processing pipelines have been suggested to address the unique challenges present in planetary setups. These processing pipelines often require manual tuning resulting to ambiguous outputs open to non-unique interpretations. These pitfalls combined with the large number of planetary GPR data (kilometers in magnitude), highlight the necessity for automatic, objective and advanced processing and interpretation schemes. The current paper investigates the potential of deep learning for interpreting and processing GPR data. The one-shot multi-offset configuration is investigated via a coherent numerical case study, showcasing the potential of deep learning for A) reconstructing the dielectric distribution of the the near surface of Terrestrial planets, and B) filling missing or bad-quality traces. Special care was taken for the numerical data to be both realistic and challenging. Moreover, the generated synthetic data are properly labelled and made publicly available for training future data-driven pipelines and contributing towards developing pre-trained foundation models for GPR.</description>

      <title>Ensemble Kalman filter meets model predictive control in chaotic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06371v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although data assimilation originates from control theory, the relationship between modern data assimilation methods in geoscience and model predictive control has not been extensively explored. In the present paper, I discuss that the modern data assimilation methods in geoscience and model predictive control essentially minimize the similar quadratic cost functions. Inspired by this similarity, I propose a new ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF)-based method for controlling spatio-temporally chaotic systems, which can be applied to high-dimensional and nonlinear Earth systems. In this method, the reference vector, which serves as the control target, is assimilated into the state space as a pseudo-observation by ensemble Kalman smoother to obtain the appropriate perturbation to be added to a system. A proof-of-concept experiment using the Lorenz 63 model is presented. The system is constrained in one wing of the butterfly attractor without tipping to the other side by reasonably small control perturbations which are comparable with previous works.</description>

      <title>Machine learning potential for serpentines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16402v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Serpentines are layered hydrous magnesium silicates (MgO$\cdot$SiO$_2\cdot$H$_2$O) formed through serpentinization, a geochemical process that significantly alters the physical property of the mantle. They are hard to investigate experimentally and computationally due to the complexity of natural serpentine samples and the large number of atoms in the unit cell. We developed a machine learning (ML) potential for serpentine minerals based on density functional theory (DFT) calculation with the r$^2$SCAN meta-GGA functional for molecular dynamics simulation. We illustrate the success of this ML potential model in reproducing the high-temperature equation of states of several hydrous phases under the Earth's subduction zone conditions, including brucite, lizardite, and antigorite. In addition, we investigate the polymorphism of antigorite with periodicity $m$ = 13--24, which is believed to be all the naturally existent antigorite species. We found that antigorite with $m$ larger than 21 appears more stable than lizardite at low temperatures. This machine learning potential can be further applied to investigate more complex antigorite superstructures with multiple coexisting periodic waves.</description>

      <title>3-D Magnetotelluric Deep Learning Inversion Guided by Pseudo-Physical Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09388v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetotelluric deep learning (DL) inversion methods based on joint data-driven and physics-driven have become a hot topic in recent years. When mapping observation data (or forward modeling data) to the resistivity model using neural networks (NNs), incorporating the error (loss) term of the inversion resistivity's forward modeling response--which introduces physical information about electromagnetic field propagation--can significantly enhance the inversion accuracy. To efficiently achieve data-physical dual-driven MT deep learning inversion for large-scale 3-D MT data, we propose using DL forward modeling networks to compute this portion of the loss. This approach introduces pseudo-physical information through the forward modeling of NN simulation, further guiding the inversion network fitting. Specifically, we first pre-train the forward modeling networks as fixed forward modeling operators, then transfer and integrate them into the inversion network training, and finally optimize the inversion network by minimizing the multinomial loss. Theoretical experimental results indicate that despite some simulation errors in DL forward modeling, the introduced pseudo-physical information still enhances inversion accuracy and significantly mitigates the overfitting problem during training. Additionally, we propose a new input mode that involves masking and adding noise to the data, simulating the field data environment of 3-D MT inversion, thereby making the method more flexible and effective for practical applications.</description>
