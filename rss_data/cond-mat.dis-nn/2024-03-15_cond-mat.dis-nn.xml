      <title>Frustrated Quantum Magnetism on Complex Networks: What Sets the Total Spin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider equal antiferromagnetic Heisenberg interactions between qubits sitting at the nodes of a complex, nonbipartite network. We ask the question: How does the network topology determine the net magnetization of the ground state and to what extent is it tunable? By examining various network families with tunable properties, we demonstrate that (i) graph heterogeneity, i.e., spread in the number of neighbors, is essential for a nonzero total spin, and (ii) other than the average number of neighbors, the key structure governing the total spin is the presence of (disassortative) hubs, as opposed to the level of frustration. We also show how to construct simple networks where the magnetization can be tuned over its entire range across both abrupt and continuous transitions, which may be realizable on existing platforms. Our findings pose a number of fundamental questions and strongly motivate wider exploration of quantum many-body phenomena beyond regular lattices.</description>

      <title>Interaction-Driven Instabilities in the Random-Field XXZ Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite enormous efforts devoted to the study of the many-body localization (MBL) phenomenon, the nature of the high-energy behavior of the Heisenberg spin chain in a strong random magnetic field is lacking consensus. Here, we take a step back by exploring the weak interaction limit starting from the Anderson localized (AL) insulator. Through shift-invert diagonalization, we find that below a certain disorder threshold $h^*$, weak interactions necessarily lead to ergodic instability, whereas at strong disorder the AL insulator directly turns into MBL. This agrees with a simple interpretation of the avalanche theory for restoration of ergodicity. We further map the phase diagram for the generic XXZ model in the disorder $h$ -- interaction $\Delta$ plane. Taking advantage of the total magnetization conservation, our results unveil the remarkable behavior of the spin-spin correlation functions: in the regime indicated as MBL by standard observables, their exponential decay undergoes a unique inversion of orientation $\xi_z&gt;\xi_x$. We find that the longitudinal length $\xi_z$ is a key quantity for capturing ergodic instabilities, as it increases with system size near the thermal phase, in sharp contrast to its transverse counterpart $\xi_x$.</description>

      <title>Exploring Hilbert-Space Fragmentation on a Superconducting Processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Isolated interacting quantum systems generally thermalize, yet there are several counterexamples for the breakdown of ergodicity, such as many-body localization and quantum scars. Recently, ergodicity breaking has been observed in systems subjected to linear potentials, termed Stark many-body localization. This phenomenon is closely associated with Hilbert-space fragmentation, characterized by a strong dependence of dynamics on initial conditions. Here, we experimentally explore initial-state dependent dynamics using a ladder-type superconducting processor with up to 24 qubits, which enables precise control of the qubit frequency and initial state preparation. In systems with linear potentials, we observe distinct non-equilibrium dynamics for initial states with the same quantum numbers and energy, but with varying domain wall numbers. This distinction becomes increasingly pronounced as the system size grows, in contrast with disordered interacting systems. Our results provide convincing experimental evidence of the fragmentation in Stark systems, enriching our understanding of the weak breakdown of ergodicity.</description>

      <title>Emergent time scales of epistasis in protein evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a data-driven epistatic model of protein evolution, capable of generating evolutionary trajectories spanning very different time scales reaching from individual mutations to diverged homologs. Our in silico evolution encompasses random nucleotide mutations, insertions and deletions, and models selection using a fitness landscape, which is inferred via a generative probabilistic model for protein families. We show that the proposed framework accurately reproduces the sequence statistics of both short-time (experimental) and long-time (natural) protein evolution, suggesting applicability also to relatively data-poor intermediate evolutionary time scales, which are currently inaccessible to evolution experiments. Our model uncovers a highly collective nature of epistasis, gradually changing the fitness effect of mutations in a diverging sequence context, rather than acting via strong interactions between individual mutations. This collective nature triggers the emergence of a long evolutionary time scale, separating fast mutational processes inside a given sequence context, from the slow evolution of the context itself. The model quantitatively reproduces the extent of contingency and entrenchment, as well as the loss of predictability in protein evolution observed in deep mutational scanning experiments of distant homologs. It thereby deepens our understanding of the interplay between mutation and selection in shaping protein diversity and novel functions, allows to statistically forecast evolution, and challenges the prevailing independent-site models of protein evolution, which are unable to capture the fundamental importance of epistasis.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Pseudoentanglement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of quantum entanglement plays a central role in explaining the emergence of thermal equilibrium in isolated many-body systems. However, entanglement is notoriously hard to measure, and can in fact be forged: recent works have introduced a notion of pseudoentanglement describing ensembles of many-body states that, while only weakly entangled, cannot be efficiently distinguished from states with much higher entanglement, such as random states in the Hilbert space. In this work we initiate the study of the dynamical generation and propagation of pseudoentanglement. As generic quantum dynamics tends to maximize actual entanglement, we consider constrained models of time evolution: automaton (i.e. reversible classical) circuits that, when fed suitable input states, provably produce the "standard models" of pseudoentangled ensembles--uniformly random subset(-phase) states--at late times, a phenomenon we name 'pseudothermalization'. We examine (i) how a pseudoentangled ensemble on a small subsystem spreads to the whole system as a function of time, and (ii) how a pseudoentangled ensemble is generated from an initial product state. We map the above problems onto a family of classical Markov chains on subsets of the computational basis. The mixing times of such Markov chains are related to the time scales at which the states produced from the dynamics become indistinguishable from Haar-random states at the level of each statistical moment (or number of copies). Based on a combination of rigorous bounds and conjectures supported by numerics, we argue that each Markov chain's relaxation time and mixing time have different asymptotic behavior in the limit of large system size. This is a necessary condition for a cutoff phenomenon: an abrupt dynamical transition to equilibrium. We thus conjecture that our random circuits give rise to asymptotically sharp pseudothermalization transitions.</description>

      <title>The Threshold Energy of Low Temperature Langevin Dynamics for Pure Spherical Spin Glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.07956v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Langevin dynamics for spherical $p$-spin models, focusing on the short time regime described by the Cugliandolo-Kurchan equations. Confirming a prediction of [Cugliandolo-Kurchan, Phys. Rev. Lett. 1993], we show the asymptotic energy achieved is exactly $E_{\infty}(p)=2\sqrt{\frac{p-1}{p}}$ in the low temperature limit. The upper bound uses hardness results for Lipschitz optimization algorithms and applies for all temperatures. For the lower bound, we prove the dynamics reaches and stays above the lowest energy of any approximate local maximum. In fact the latter behavior holds for any Hamiltonian obeying natural smoothness estimates, even with disorder-dependent initialization and on exponential time-scales.</description>

      <title>Single-particle excitations across the localization and many-body localization transition in quasi-periodic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.12288v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study localization and many-body localization transition in one dimensional systems in the presence of deterministic quasi-periodic potential. We use single-particle excitations obtained through single-particle Green's function in real space to characterize the localization to delocalization transition. A single parameter scaling analysis of the ratio of the typical to average value of the local density of states (LDOS) of single particle excitations shows that the critical exponent with which the correlation length $\xi$ diverges at the transition point $\xi \sim |h-h_c|^{-\nu}$, coming from the localized side, satisfies the inequality $\nu \ge 1$ for the non-interacting Aubry-Andre (AA) model. For the interacting system with AA potential, we study single particle excitations produced in highly excited many-body eigenstates across the MBL transition and found that the critical exponent obtained from finite-size scaling of the ratio of the typical to average value of the LDOS satisfies $\nu \ge 1$ here as well. This analysis of local density of states shows that the localization and MBL transition in systems with quasi-periodic potential belong to a different universality class than the localization and MBL transition in systems with random disorder where $\nu \ge 2$. In complete contrast to this, finite-size scaling of the level spacing ratio is known to support the same universality class for MBL transitions in systems with quasiperiodic as well as random disorder potentials. For the interacting systems with quasiperiodic potentials, though finite-size scaling of the level spacing ratio shows a transition at $h_c^{lsr}$ which is close to the transition point obtained from LDOS within numerical precision, the critical exponent obtained from finite-size scaling of level spacing ratio is $\nu \sim 0.54$ in close similarity to the MBL systems with random disorder.</description>

      <title>Measuring Renyi Entropy in Neural Network Quantum States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.05513v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the Renyi entropy in a one-dimensional transverse-field quantum Ising model by employing a swapping operator acting on the states which are prepared from the neural network methods. In the static ground state, Renyi entropy can uncover the critical point of the quantum phase transition from paramagnetic to ferromagnetic. At the critical point, the relation between the Renyi entropy and the subsystem size satisfies the predictions from conformal field theory. In the dynamical case, we find coherent oscillations of the Renyi entropy after the end of the linear quench. These oscillations have universal frequencies which may come from the superpositions of excited states. The asymptotic form of the Renyi entropy implies a new length scale away from the critical point. This length scale is also verified by the overlap of the reduced Renyi entropy against the dimensionless subsystem size.</description>

      <title>Entanglement and Absorbing-State Transitions in Interactive Quantum Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.12526v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nascent quantum computers motivate the exploration of quantum many-body systems in nontraditional scenarios. For example, it has become natural to explore the dynamics of systems evolving under both unitary evolution and measurement. Such systems can undergo dynamical phase transitions in the entanglement properties of quantum trajectories conditional on the measurement outcomes. Here, we explore dynamics in which one attempts to (locally) use those measurement outcomes to steer the system toward a target state, and we study the resulting phase diagram as a function of the measurement and feedback rates. Steering succeeds when the measurement and feedback rates exceed a threshold, yielding an absorbing-state transition in the trajectory-averaged density matrix. We argue that the absorbing-state transition generally occurs at different critical parameters from the entanglement transition in individual trajectories and has distinct critical properties. The efficacy of steering depends on the nature of the target state: in particular, for local dynamics targeting long-range correlated states, steering is necessarily slow and the entanglement and steering transitions are well separated in parameter space.</description>

      <title>Delocalization in a partially disordered interacting many-body system</title>

Abstract: We study a partially disordered one-dimensional system with interacting particles. Concretely, we impose a disorder potential to only every other site, followed by a clean site. Our numerical analysis of eigenstate properties is based on the entanglement entropy and density distributions. Most importantly, at large disorder, there exist eigenstates with large entanglement entropies and significant correlations between the clean sites. These states have volume-law scaling, embedded into a sea of area-law states, reminiscent of inverted quantum-scar states. These eigenstate features leave fingerprints in the nonequilibrium dynamics even in the large-disorder regime, with a strong initial-state dependence. We demonstrate that certain types of initial charge-density-wave states decay significantly, while others preserve their initial inhomogeneity, the latter being the typical behavior for many-body localized systems. This initial-condition dependent dynamics may give extra control over the delocalization dynamics at large disorder strength and should be experimentally feasible with ultracold atoms in optical lattices.</description>
