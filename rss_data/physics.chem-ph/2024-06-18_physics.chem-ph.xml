      <title>Thermodynamic Transferability in Coarse-Grained Force Fields using Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coarse-graining is a molecular modeling technique in which an atomistic system is represented in a simplified fashion that retains the most significant system features that contribute to a target output, while removing the degrees of freedom that are less relevant. This reduction in model complexity allows coarse-grained molecular simulations to reach increased spatial and temporal scales compared to corresponding all-atom models. A core challenge in coarse-graining is to construct a force field that represents the interactions in the new representation in a way that preserves the atomistic-level properties. Many approaches to building coarse-grained force fields have limited transferability between different thermodynamic conditions as a result of averaging over internal fluctuations at a specific thermodynamic state point. Here, we use a graph-convolutional neural network architecture, the Hierarchically Interacting Particle Neural Network with Tensor Sensitivity (HIP-NN-TS), to develop a highly automated training pipeline for coarse grained force fields which allows for studying the transferability of coarse-grained models based on the force-matching approach. We show that this approach not only yields highly accurate force fields, but also that these force fields are more transferable through a variety of thermodynamic conditions. These results illustrate the potential of machine learning techniques such as graph neural networks to improve the construction of transferable coarse-grained force fields.</description>

      <title>The Role of Spin-Orbit Coupling on the Linear Absorption Spectrum and Intersystem Crossing Rate Coefficients of Ruthenium Polypyridyl Dyes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The successful use of molecular dyes for solar energy conversion requires efficient charge injection, which in turn requires the formation of states with sufficiently long lifetimes (e.g. triplets). The molecular structure elements that confer this property can be found empirically, however computational predictions using $\textit{ab initio}$ electronic structure methods are invaluable to identify structure-property relations for dye sensitizers. The primary challenge for simulations to elucidate the electronic and nuclear origins of these properties is a spin-orbit interaction which drives transitions between electronic states. In this work, we present a computational analysis of the spin-orbit corrected linear absorption cross sections and intersystem crossing rate coefficients for a derivative set of phosphonated tris(2,2'-bipyridine)ruthenium(2+) dye molecules. After sampling the ground state vibrational distributions, the predicted linear absorption cross sections indicate that the mixture between singlet and triplet states plays a crucial role in defining the line shape of the metal-to-ligand charge transfer bands in these derivatives. Additionally, an analysis of the intersystem crossing rate coefficients suggests that transitions from the singlet into the triplet manifolds are ultrafast with rate coefficients on the order of $10^{13}$ s$^{-1}$ for each dye molecule.</description>

      <title>Using the Haken-Strobl-Reineker Model to Determine the Temperature Dependence of the Diffusion Coefficient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic quantum Liouville equations (SQLE) are widely used to model energy and charge dynamics in molecular systems. The Haken-Strobl-Reineker (HSR) SQLE is a particular paradigm in which the dynamical noise that destroys quantum coherences arises from a white noise (i.e., constant-frequency) spectrum. A system subject to the HSR SQLE thus evolves to its `high-temperature' limit, whereby all the eigenstates are equally populated. This result would seem to imply that the predictions of the HSR model, e.g., the temperature dependence of the diffusion coefficient, have no validity for temperatures lower than the particle bandwidth. The purpose of this paper is to show that this assumption is incorrect for translationally invariant systems. In particular, provided that the diffusion coefficient is determined via the mean-squared-displacement, considerations about detailed-balance are irrelevant. Consequently, the high-temperature prediction for the temperature dependence of the diffusion coefficient may be extrapolated to lower temperatures, provided that the bath remains classical. Thus, for diagonal dynamical disorder the long-time diffusion coefficient, $D_{\infty}(T) = c_{1} /T$, while for both diagonal and off-diagonal disorder, $D_{\infty}(T) = c_{1}/T + c_{2} T$, where $c_{2} \ll c_{1}$. An appendix discusses an alternative interpretation from the HSR model of the `quantum to classical' dynamics transition, whereby the dynamics is described as stochastically punctuated coherent motion.</description>

      <title>Dissociative Electron Attachment on Metal Surfaces: The Case of HCl$^-$ on Au(111)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The transfer of charges, including electrons and holes, is a key step in heterogeneous catalysis, taking part in the reduction and oxidation of adsorbate species on catalyst surfaces. In plasmonic catalysis, electrons can transfer from photo-excited metal nanoparticles to molecular adsorbates, forming transient negative ions that can easily undergo reactions such as dissociation, desorption, or other chemical transformations. However, ab initio characterization of these anionic states has proven challenging, and little is known about the topology of their potential energy surfaces. In this work, we investigate the dissociative adsorption of HCl on Au(111) as a representative catalytic process with relatively low reaction probabilities, which could potentially be enhanced by electron transfer from photo-excited gold nanoparticles to HCl. We employ projection-based density embedding that combines the equation-of-motion electron-attachment coupled-cluster singles and doubles (EOM-EA-CCSD) method with density functional theory (DFT), and build dissociation curves of HCl$^-$ on Au(111) along the H-Cl bond distance. The HCl anion in the gas phase is unbound at equilibrium distances and only becomes bound as the bond stretches. However, our results show that, upon adsorption on Au(111), HCl$^-$ remains a stable, bound anion at all bond lengths due to charge delocalization to the metal. Forming bound anions is easier, and dissociation of HCl$^-$ on Au(111) is further facilitated, with its dissociation energy reduced by 0.61 eV compared to its neutral counterpart on Au(111), and by 1.16 eV relative to HCl. These results underscore the efficacy of embedded EOM-CCSD methods in addressing surface science challenges and highlight the potential of plasmonic catalysis proceeding via bound, rather than transient, anionic states.</description>

      <title>On the Modification of Liquid Water Properties under Vibrational Strong Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02510v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A computational study of how liquid water properties are modified when the system is coupled with a (model) Fabry-Perot cavity is reported. At this end, the Cavity-Molecular Dynamics approach proposed recently (Li et al., Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA, 2020, 117, 18324-18331) is employed. This formalism uses a fully atomistic representation of liquid water, which is able to mimic key features of light-matter hybridization under vibrational strong coupling (VSC). The cavity frequency was set to different frequencies, and in particular, following the IR spectrum of liquid water: high frequency (corresponding to O-H stretching modes), medium frequency (corresponding to water molecule bending) and low frequencies (corresponding to librational modes of liquid water). First, the splitting of the infrared spectrum and no visible effect of the cavity on the radial distribution function are confirmed. Second, an effect on the dielectric constant is found when the cavity is resonant with librational modes. Finally, we notice an interesting effect on some dynamical properties, like the diffusion coefficient and the hydrogen bond jumping time. Notably, this effect is strongly dependent on which vibrational mode the cavity is in resonance with.</description>

      <title>MBE-CASSCF Approach for the Accurate Treatment of Large Active Spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17836v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel implementation of the complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF) method that makes use of the many-body expanded full configuration interaction (MBE-FCI) method to incrementally approximate electronic structures within large active spaces. On the basis of a hybrid first-order algorithm employing both Super-CI and quasi-Newton strategies for the optimization of molecular orbitals, we demonstrate both computational efficacy and high accuracy of the resulting MBE-CASSCF method. We assess the performance of our implementation on a set of established numerical tests before applying MBE-CASSCF in the investigation of the triplet-quintet spin gap of iron(II) porphyrin with active spaces as large as 50 electrons in 50 orbitals.</description>

      <title>Efficient Spin-Adapted Implementation of Multireference Algebraic Diagrammatic Construction Theory. I. Core-Ionized States and X-Ray Photoelectron Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08161v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an efficient implementation of multireference algebraic diagrammatic construction theory (MR-ADC) for simulating core-ionized states and X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS). Taking advantage of spin adaptation, automatic code generation, and density fitting, our implementation can perform calculations for molecules with more than 1500 molecular orbitals, incorporating static and dynamic correlation in the ground and excited electronic states. We demonstrate the capabilities of MR-ADC methods by simulating the XPS spectra of substituted ferrocene complexes and azobenzene isomers. For the ground electronic states of these molecules, the XPS spectra computed using the extended second-order MR-ADC method (MR-ADC(2)-X) are in a very good agreement with available experimental results. We further show that MR-ADC can be used as a tool for interpreting or predicting the results of time-resolved XPS measurements by simulating the core ionization spectra of azobenzene along its photoisomerization, including the XPS signatures of excited states and the minimum energy conical intersection. This work is the first in a series of publications reporting the efficient implementations of MR-ADC methods.</description>

      <title>Bridging electronic and classical density-functional theory using universal machine-learned functional approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20270v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The accuracy of density-functional theory (DFT) is determined by the quality of the approximate functionals, such as exchange-correlation in electronic DFT and the excess functional in the classical DFT formalism of fluids. The exact functional is highly nonlocal for both electrons and fluids, yet most approximate functionals are semi-local or nonlocal in a limited weighted-density form. Machine-learned (ML) nonlocal density-functional approximations are promising in both electronic and classical DFT, but have so far employed disparate approaches with limited generality. Here, we formulate a universal approximation framework and training protocol for nonlocal ML functionals, combining features of equivariant convolutional neural networks and the weighted-density approximation. We prototype this approach for several 1D and quasi-1D problems and demonstrate that a functional with exactly the same hyperparameters achieves excellent accuracy for the hard-rod fluid, the inhomogeneous Ising model, the exact exchange functional for electrons, the electron kinetic energy functional for orbital-free DFT, as well as for liquid water with 1D inhomogeneities. These results lay the foundation for a universal ML approach to exact 3D functionals spanning electronic and classical DFT.</description>

      <title>Exploring Li-ion Transport Properties of Li$_3$TiCl$_6$: A Machine Learning Molecular Dynamics Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01077v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We performed large-scale molecular dynamics simulations based on a machine-learning force field (MLFF) to investigate the Li-ion transport mechanism in cation-disordered Li$_3$TiCl$_6$ cathode at six different temperatures, ranging from 25$^\mathrm{o}$C to 100$^\mathrm{o}$C. In this work, deep neural network method and data generated by $ab-initio$ molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations were deployed to build a high-fidelity MLFF. Radial distribution functions, Li-ion mean square displacements (MSD), diffusion coefficients, ionic conductivity, activation energy, and crystallographic direction-dependent migration barriers were calculated and compared with corresponding AIMD and experimental data to benchmark the accuracy of the MLFF. From MSD analysis, we captured both the self and distinct parts of Li-ion dynamics. The latter reveals that the Li-ions are involved in anti-correlation motion that was rarely reported for solid-state materials. Similarly, the self and distinct parts of Li-ion dynamics were used to determine Haven's ratio to describe the Li-ion transport mechanism in Li$_3$TiCl$_6$. Obtained trajectory from molecular dynamics infers that the Li-ion transportation is mainly through interstitial hopping which was confirmed by intra- and inter-layer Li-ion displacement with respect to simulation time. Ionic conductivity (1.06 mS/cm) and activation energy (0.29eV) calculated by our simulation are highly comparable with that of experimental values. Overall, the combination of machine-learning methods and AIMD simulations explains the intricate electrochemical properties of the Li$_3$TiCl$_6$ cathode with remarkably reduced computational time. Thus, our work strongly suggests that the deep neural network-based MLFF could be a promising method for large-scale complex materials.</description>

      <title>Influence of cholesterol on hydrogen-bond dynamics of water molecules in lipid-bilayer systems at varying temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08289v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cholesterol (Chol) plays a crucial role in shaping the intricate physicochemical attributes of biomembranes, exerting considerable influence on water molecules proximal to the membrane interface. In this study, we conducted molecular dynamics simulations on the bilayers of two lipid species, dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) and palmitoyl sphingomyelin (PSM); they are distinct with respect to the structures of the hydrogen-bond (H-bond) acceptors. Our investigation focuses on the dynamic properties and H-bonds of water molecules in the lipid-membrane systems, with particular emphasis on the influence of Chol at varying temperatures. Notably, in the gel phase at 303 K, the presence of Chol extends the lifetimes of H-bonds of the oxygen atoms acting as H-bond acceptors within DPPC with water molecules by a factor of 1.5 to 2.5. In the liquid-crystalline phase at 323 K, on the other hand, H-bonding dynamics with lipid membranes remain largely unaffected by Chol. This observed shift in H-bonding states serves as a crucial key to unraveling the subtle control mechanisms governing water dynamics in lipid-membrane systems.</description>

      <title>A Framework of SO(3)-equivariant Non-linear Representation Learning and its Application to Electronic-Structure Hamiltonian Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05722v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present both a theoretical and a methodological framework that addresses a critical challenge in applying deep learning to physical systems: the reconciliation of non-linear expressiveness with SO(3)-equivariance in predictions of SO(3)-equivariant quantities. Inspired by covariant theory in physics, we address this problem by exploring the mathematical relationships between SO(3)-invariant and SO(3)-equivariant quantities and their representations. We first construct theoretical SO(3)-invariant quantities derived from the SO(3)-equivariant regression targets, and use these invariant quantities as supervisory labels to guide the learning of high-quality SO(3)-invariant features. Given that SO(3)-invariance is preserved under non-linear operations, the encoding process for invariant features can extensively utilize non-linear mappings, thereby fully capturing the non-linear patterns inherent in physical systems. Building on this foundation, we propose a gradient-based mechanism to induce SO(3)-equivariant encodings of various degrees from the learned SO(3)-invariant features. This mechanism can incorporate non-linear expressive capabilities into SO(3)-equivariant representations, while theoretically preserving their equivariant properties as we prove. We apply our theory and method to the electronic-structure Hamiltonian prediction tasks, experimental results on eight benchmark databases covering multiple types of elements and challenging scenarios show dramatic breakthroughs on the state-of-the-art prediction accuracy, with improvements of up to 40% in predicting Hamiltonians and up to 76% in predicting downstream physical quantities such as occupied orbital energy. Our approach goes beyond handling physical systems and offers a promising general solution to the critical dilemma between equivariance and non-linear expressiveness for the deep learning paradigm.</description>
