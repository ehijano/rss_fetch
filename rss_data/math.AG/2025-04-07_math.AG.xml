      <title>The rationality problem for multinorm one tori</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the rationality problem for multinorm one tori, a natural generalization of norm one tori. We give a necessary and sufficient condition for the multinorm one tori to be stably rational and retract rational in the case that split over finite Galois extensions with nilpotent Galois groups. This generalizes the result of Endo in 2011 on the rationality problem for norm one tori. To accomplish it, we develop the technique of Endo in 2001, and construct some reduction methods for an investigation of the rationality problem for arbitrary multinorm one tori.</description>

      <title>Variation of cones of divisors in a family of varieties -- Fano type case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the relationship between the Fano type property on fibers over a Zariski dense subset and the global Fano type property. We establish the generic invariance of N\'eron-Severi spaces, effective cones, movable cones, and Mori chamber decompositions for a family of Fano type varieties. Additionally, we show the uniform behavior of the minimal model program for this family. These results are applied to the boundedness problem of Fano type varieties.</description>

      <title>Refined algebraic domains with finite sets in the boundaries respecting differential geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are interested in shapes of real algebraic curves in the plane and regions surrounded by them: they are named refined algebraic domains by the author.
  As characteristic finite sets, we consider points contained in two curves and the sets of singular points of the restrictions of the projections to the lines to the curves. As a new case, we respect differential geometry and consider inflection points and points of some double tangent lines of a single connected curve. We prove fundamental properties and investigate some examples.
  We have also previously considered the cases where the curves are straight lines, circles, or boundaries of ellipsoids for example. Such simple cases are trivial in our new consideration.</description>

      <title>On Fourier-Mukai transforms of upward flows for Hitchin systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the moduli space of semistable Higgs bundles on a smooth projective curve. Motivated by mirror symmetry, Hausel and Hitchin showed that over an open of the locus of smooth Hitchin fibers, the duality of Donagi-Pantev intertwines certain Lagrangian upward flows with hyperholomorphic vector bundles constructed from universal Higgs bundles. Using Arinkin's sheaf and some codimension estimates, we show a generalization of this result over the entire Hitchin base, for Higgs bundles of arbitrary degree.</description>

      <title>Clifford Multiplication on Spinor Abelian Varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A spinor Abelian variety, which we denote by $S_{\Delta}$, is a complex Abelian variety whose tangent space at the origin is a space of spinors for a suitable complex Clifford algebra $\mathbb{C}_{q}(V)$. We examine intrinsic properties of such varieties and related Clifford actions on them, which we call Clifford multiplication. We then extend the analysis of Clifford multiplication to the dual torus $\rm{Pic}^{0}(S_{\Delta})$. We conclude with a standard example of a spinor Abelian variety generated from the space of Dirac spinors, well known in the fields of mathematical physics and Clifford algebras.</description>

      <title>Ramified periods and field of definition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $L/K$ be an extension of number fields that is ramified above $p$. We give a new obstruction to the descent to $K$ of smooth projective varieties defined over $L$. The obstruction is a matrix of $p$-adic numbers that we call ``ramified periods'' arising from the comparison isomorphism between de Rham cohomology and crystalline cohomology. As an application, we give simple examples of hyperelliptic curves over $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt p)$ that are isomorphic to their Galois conjugates but such that their Jacobians do not descend to $\mathbb{Q}$ even up to isogeny.</description>

      <title>Laurent polynomials and deformations of non-isolated Gorenstein toric sigularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a correspondence between one-parameter deformations of an affine Gorenstein toric pair $(X_P,\partial X_P)$, defined by a polytope $P$, and mutations of a Laurent polynomial $f$ whose Newton polytope $\Delta(f)$ is equal to $P$. For a Laurent polynomial $f$ in two variables, we construct a formal deformation of a three-dimensional Gorenstein toric pair $(X_{\Delta(f)},\partial X_{\Delta(f)})$ over $\mathbb{C}[[t_f]]$, where $t_f$ is the set of deformation parameters coming from mutations. Moreover, we show that the general fiber of this deformation is smooth if and only if $f$ is $0$-mutable. Our construction provides a potential approach for classifying Fano manifolds with a very ample anticanonical bundle.</description>

      <title>Pullback and Weil transfer on Chow groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the paper ``Weil transfer of algebraic cycles'', published by the second author in Indagationes Mathematicae about 25 years ago, a Weil transfer map for Chow groups of smooth algebraic varieties has been constructed and its basic properties have been established. The proof of commutativity with the pullback homomorphisms given there used a variant of Moving Lemma suffering a lack of reference. Here we are providing an alternative proof based on a more contemporary construction of the pullback via a deformation to the normal cone.</description>

      <title>Motivic apsects of a remarkable class of Calabi-Yau threefolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note we consider the motivic aspect of the middle cohomology of more than 200 classes of quasi-smooth Calabi--Yau threefolds inside weighted projective 4-space which come with an action of a cyclic group of even order. The action induces a self-dual Chow--K\"unneth decomposition. All but one component correspond to Fano threefolds. For these the generalized Hodge conjecture is known, but thanks to the nature of the decomposition we can give a direct proof for one of the components.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove an extension of the theorem of Drinfeld, Grinberg and Kazhdan to arcs with arbitrary residue field. As an application we show that the embedding codimension is generically constant on each irreducible subset of the arc space which is not contained in the singular locus. In the case of maximal divisorial sets, this relates the corresponding finite formal models with invariants of singularities of the underlying variety.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the boundedness problem for log Calabi-Yau fibrations whose bases and general fibers are bounded. We prove that the total spaces of log Calabi-Yau fibrations are bounded in codimension one after fixing some natural invariants. We also prove that the total spaces are bounded if, in addition, the irregularity of the general fibers vanishes. Then we apply our results to the boundedness problem for stable minimal models and fibered Calabi-Yau varieties.</description>

      <title>BCFW tilings and cluster adjacency for the amplituhedron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 2005, Britto, Cachazo, Feng and Witten gave a recurrence (now known as the BCFW recurrence) for computing scattering amplitudes in N=4 super Yang Mills theory. Arkani-Hamed and Trnka subsequently introduced the amplituhedron to give a geometric interpretation of the BCFW recurrence. Arkani-Hamed and Trnka conjectured that each way of iterating the BCFW recurrence gives a "triangulation" or "tiling" of the m=4 amplituhedron. In this article we prove the BCFW tiling conjecture of Arkani-Hamed and Trnka. We also prove the cluster adjacency conjecture for BCFW tiles of the amplituhedron, which says that facets of tiles are cut out by collections of compatible cluster variables for the Grassmannian Gr(4,n). Moreover we show that each BCFW tile is the subset of the Grassmannian where certain cluster variables have particular signs.</description>

      <title>The Fascinating World of 2 $\times$ 2 $\times$ 2 Tensors: Its Geometry and Optimization Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This educational article highlights the geometric and algebraic complexities that distinguish tensors from matrices, to supplement coverage in advanced courses on linear algebra, matrix analysis, and tensor decompositions. Using the case of real-valued 2 $\times$ 2 $\times$ 2 tensors, we show how tensors violate many well-known properties of matrices: (1) The rank of a matrix is bounded by its smallest dimension, but a 2 $\times$ 2 $\times$ 2 tensor can be rank 3. (2) Matrices have a single typical rank, but the rank of a generic 2 $\times$ 2 $\times$ 2 tensor can be 2 or 3 - it has two typical ranks. (3) Any limit point of a sequence of matrices of rank $r$ is at most rank $r$, but a limit point of a sequence of 2 $\times$ 2 $\times$ 2 tensors of rank 2 can be rank 3 (a higher rank). (4) Matrices always have a best rank-$r$ approximation, but no rank-3 tensor of size 2 $\times$ 2 $\times$ 2 has a best rank-2 approximation. We unify the analysis of the matrix and tensor cases using tools from algebraic geometry and optimization, providing derivations of these surprising facts. To build intuition for the geometry of rank-constrained sets, students and educators can explore the geometry of matrix and tensor ranks via our interactive visualization tool.</description>

Abstract: We compute the $\mathbb{G}W^{r}$-spectrum of Grassmannians over fields of characteristic zero. We also compute the stabilized $\mathbb{L}$-Theory spectrum of Grassmannians. We observe, via base-change for exceptional collections, that our computations are valid for Grassmannians over commutative rings containing a field of characteristic zero. Along the way, some combinatorial identities involving Littlewood-Richardson coefficients are established, which might be of independent interest.</description>

Abstract: Dual representations $V$ and $V^*$ of a complex connected algebraic group $G$ simultaneously have either infinitely or finitely many orbits. Whenever the latter holds, the orbits in $V$ and $V^*$ are in a bijective correspondence called Pyasetskii duality. We obtain a complete description of this duality in the case of spherical representations.</description>

      <title>Notes on fundamental algebraic supergeometry. Hilbert and Picard superschemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.00700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2008.00700v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: These notes aim at providing a complete and systematic account of some foundational aspects of algebraic supergeometry, namely, the extension to the geometry of superschemes of many classical notions, techniques and results that make up the general backbone of algebraic geometry, most of them originating from Grothendieck's work. In particular, we extend to algebraic supergeometry such notions as projective and proper morphisms, finiteness of the cohomology, vector and projective bundles, cohomology base change, semicontinuity theorems, relative duality, Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity, flattening, Hilbert and Quot schemes, faithfully flat descent, quotient \'etale relations (notably, Picard schemes), among others. Some results may be found elsewhere, and, in particular, there is some overlap with a recent preprint by Moosavian and Zhou. However, many techniques and constructions are presented here for the first time, notably, a first development of Grothendieck relative duality for proper morphisms of superschemes, the construction of the Hilbert superscheme in a more general situation than the one already known (which in particular allows one to treat the case of sub-superschemes of supergrassmannians), and a rigorous construction of the Picard superscheme for a locally superprojective morphism of noetherian superschemes with geometrically integral fibres. Moreover, some of the proofs given here are new as well, even when restricted to ordinary schemes. In a final section we construct a period map from an open substack of the moduli of proper and smooth supercurves to the moduli stack of principally polarized abelian superchemes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.03534v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper gives a criterion for a moduli point to be a point of non-transversal intersection of the hyperelliptic locus and the supersingular locus in the Siegel moduli stack $\mathfrak{A}_3 \times \mathbb{F}_p$. It is shown that for infinitely many primes $p$ there exists such a point.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15890v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We generalize a construction of Barthel-Brasselet-Fieseler-Gabber-Kaup in the setting of complex varieties to the setting of finite type, complex algebraic stacks. Given two such stacks $\mathcal{X},\mathcal{Y}$ with affine stabilizers, and a morphism between them, we construct a morphism from the pullback of the intersection complex of $\mathcal{Y}$ to the intersection complex of $\mathcal{X}$. As an application, we show that the Borel-Moore fundamental class of a closed substack $\mathcal{Z}$ in a Deligne-Mumford stack $\mathcal{X}$ lifts to a class in the intersection cohomology of $\mathcal{X}$.</description>

Abstract: We prove an explicit form of the Crepant Transformation Conjecture for Grassmannian flops. Our approach uses abelianization to first relate the restrictions of the Lagrangian cones to degree-2 classes, and then deduces the general result using ``explicit reconstruction'' (also known as the method of big I-functions).</description>

      <title>Construction of birational trilinear volumes via tensor rank criteria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16936v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide effective methods to construct and manipulate trilinear birational maps $\phi:(\mathbb{P}^1)^3\dashrightarrow \mathbb{P}^3$ by establishing a novel connection between birationality and tensor rank. These yield four families of nonlinear birational transformations between 3D spaces that can be operated with enough flexibility for applications in computer-aided geometric design. More precisely, we describe the geometric constraints on the defining control points of the map that are necessary for birationality, and present constructions for such configurations. For adequately constrained control points, we prove that birationality is achieved if and only if a certain $2\times 2\times 2$ tensor has rank one. As a corollary, we prove that the locus of weights that ensure birationality is $\mathbb{P}^1\times\mathbb{P}^1\times\mathbb{P}^1$. Additionally, we provide formulas for the inverse $\phi^{-1}$ as well as the explicit defining equations of the irreducible components of the base loci. Finally, we introduce a notion of "distance to birationality" for trilinear rational maps, and explain how to continuously deform birational maps.</description>

      <title>Dependency equilibria: Boundary cases and their real algebraic geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19054v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is a significant step forward in understanding dependency equilibria within the framework of real algebraic geometry encompassing both pure and mixed equilibria. In alignment with Spohn's original definition of dependency equilibria, we propose two alternative definitions, allowing for an algebro-geometric comprehensive study of all dependency equilibria. We give a sufficient condition for the existence of a pure dependency equilibrium and show that every Nash equilibrium lies on the Spohn variety, the algebraic model for dependency equilibria. For generic games, the set of real points of the Spohn variety is Zariski dense. Furthermore, every Nash equilibrium in this case is a dependency equilibrium. Finally, we present a detailed analysis of the geometric structure of dependency equilibria for $(2\times2)$-games.</description>

Abstract: We give a non-Archimedean characterization of K-semistability of log Fano cone singularities, and show that it agrees with the definition originally defined by Collins--Sz\'ekelyhidi. As an application, we show that to test K-semistability, it suffices to test special test configurations. We also show that special test configurations give rise to lc places of torus equivariant bounded complements.</description>

      <title>Free summands of stably free modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15445v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $R$ be a commutative ring. One may ask when a general $R$-module $P$ that satisfies $P \oplus R \cong R^n$ has a free summand of a given rank. M. Raynaud translated this question into one about sections of certain maps between Stiefel varieties: if $V_r(\mathbb{A}^n)$ denotes the Stiefel variety $\textrm{GL}(n) / \textrm{GL}(n-r)$ over a field $k$, then the projection $V_r(\mathbb{A}^n) \to V_1(\mathbb{A}^n)$ has a section if and only if the following holds: any module $P$ over any $k$-algebra $R$ with the property that $P \oplus R \cong R^n$ has a free summand of rank $r-1$. Using techniques from $\mathbb{A}^1$-homotopy theory, we characterize those $n$ for which the map $V_r(\mathbb{A}^n) \to V_1(\mathbb{A}^n)$ has a section in the cases $r=3,4$ under some assumptions on the base field. We conclude that if $P \oplus R \cong R^{24m}$ and $R$ contains a field of characteristic $0$, then $P$ contains a free summand of rank $2$. If $R$ contains a quadratically closed field of characteristic $0$, or the field of real numbers, then $P$ contains a free summand of rank $3$. The analogous results hold for schemes and vector bundles over them.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16810v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a partition $\mu$ of $-2$, the stratum $\mathcal{H}(\mu)$ parametrizes meromorphic differential one-forms on the Riemann sphere $\mathbb{CP}^{1}$ with~$n$ zeros and $p$ poles of orders prescribed by $\mu$. The isoresidual fibration is defined by assigning to each differential in $\mathcal{H}(\mu)$ its configuration of residues at the poles. In the case of differentials with $n=2$ zeros, generic isoresidual fibers are complex curves endowed with a canonical translation structure, which we describe extensively in this paper. Quantitative characteristics of the translation structure on isoresidual fiber curves, including the orders of the singularities and a period central charge encapsulating the linear dependence of periods on the underlying configuration of residues, provide rich discrete invariants for these fibers. We also determine the Euler characteristic of generic isoresidual fiber curves from intersection-theoretic computations, relying on the multi-scale compactification of strata of differentials. In particular, we describe a wall and chamber structure for the Euler characteristic of generic isoresidual fiber curves in terms of the partition $\mu$. Additionally, we classify the connected components of generic isoresidual fibers for strata in genus zero with an arbitrary number of zeros.</description>

Abstract: Under mild hypotheses, given a scheme $U$ and an open subset $V$ whose complement has codimension at least two, the pushforward of a torsion-free coherent sheaf on $V$ is coherent on $U$. We prove an analog of this result in the context of formal schemes over a complete discrete valuation ring. We then apply this to obtain a result about gluing formal functions, where the patches do not cover the entire scheme.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01624v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To each multiple point $p$ in a line arrangement $ \mathcal A$ in the complex projective plane we associate a local derivation $\tilde D_p \in D_0( \mathcal A)$. We show first that these derivations span the graded module of derivations $D_0( \mathcal A)$ in all degrees $\geq d -3$, where $d$ is the number of lines in $ \mathcal A$, see Theorem 1.4 and Theorem 1.6. Then, to each local derivation $\tilde D_p \in D_0( \mathcal A)$ we associate a polynomial $g_p$ which seems to play a key role in the characterization of the freeness of $ \mathcal A$, see Theorem 1.10, as well as in the study of the position of the multiple points of $ \mathcal A$ with respect to unions of lines, see Corollary 1.13 and Conjecture 1.14. Corollary 1.9 gives a result of an independent interest, namely a lower bound for the maximal exponent of a plane curve having a line as an irreducible component.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16296v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Grothendieck classes of melonic graphs satisfy a recursive relation and may be written as polynomials in the class of the moduli space $\mathcal{M}_{0,4}$ with nonnegative integer coefficients, conjectured to be log-concave. In this article, we investigate log-concavity and ultra-log-concavity for the Grothendieck class of banana graphs and the three families of polynomials involved in the recursive relation. We prove that all four are log-concave, establishing the specific case of banana graphs for the log-concavity conjecture. We additionally introduce the infinite family of clasped necklaces, melonic graphs obtained by replacing an edge of a $2$-banana with a string of $m$-bananas. Using the recursive relation, we explicitly compute the classes of clasped necklaces and prove that they too are log-concave.</description>

Abstract: For a family of log points with constant log structure and for a proper SNCL scheme with an SNCD over the family, we construct a fundamental l-adic bifiltered complex as a geometric application of the theory of the derived category of (bi)filtered complexes in our papers. By using this bifiltered complex, we give the formulation of the log l-adic relative monodromy-weight conjecture with respect to the filtration arising from the SNCD. That is, we state that the relative l-adic monodromy filtration should exist for the Kummer log etale cohomological sheaf of the proper SNCL scheme with an SNCD and it should be equal to the l-adic weight filtration.</description>

Abstract: We present a method for constructing covariantly constant endomorphisms for the mod $p$ equivariant quantum connection, using the quantum Steenrod power operations of Fukaya and Wilkins. The example of the cotangent bundle of the projective line is fully computed, and we discuss the relationship with the mod $p$ solutions of trigonometric KZ equation recently constructed by Varchenko. As a byproduct, we compute the first examples of quantum Steenrod operations that are not a priori determined by ordinary Gromov--Witten theory and classical Steenrod operations, which may be of independent interest.</description>

Abstract: This is the first of a pair of papers devoted to the local invariants of Goursat distributions. The study of these distributions naturally leads to a tower of spaces over an arbitrary surface, called the monster tower, and thence to connections with the topic of singularities of curves on surfaces. Here we study those invariants of Goursat distributions akin to those of curves on surfaces, which we call structural invariants. In the subsequent paper we will relate these structural invariants to the small growth invariants.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05384v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Chow class of the closure of the torus orbit of a point in a Grassmannian only depends on the matroid associated to the point. The Chow class can be extended to a matroid invariant of arbitrary matroids. We call the coefficients appearing in the expansion of the Chow class in the Schubert basis the Schubert coefficients of the matroid. These Schubert coefficients are conjectured by Berget and Fink to be non-negative. We compute the Schubert coefficients of a disconnected matroid in terms of the Schubert coefficients of its connected components. And we compute the Schubert coefficients for all sparse paving matroids, and confirm their non-negativity.</description>

      <title>On pro-cdh descent on derived schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04378v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a `pro-cdh descent' result for suitably connective localizing invariants and the cotangent complex on arbitrary qcqs derived schemes. As an application, we deduce that the K-groups of arbitrary qcqs schemes vanish below the negative of their valuative dimension.</description>

      <title>Finiteness and cofiniteness of fine Selmer groups over function fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06938v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the dual fine Selmer group of an abelian variety over the unramified $\mathbb{Z}_{p}$-extension of a function field is finitely generated over $\mathbb{Z}_{p}$. This is a function field version of a conjecture of Coates--Sujatha. We further prove that the fine Selmer group is finite (respectively zero) if the separable $p$-primary torsion of the abelian variety is finite (respectively zero). These results are then generalized to certain ramified $p$-adic Lie extensions.</description>

      <title>A physical basis for cosmological correlators from cuts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09695v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Significant progress has been made in our understanding of the analytic structure of FRW wavefunction coefficients, facilitated by the development of efficient algorithms to derive the differential equations they satisfy. Moreover, recent findings indicate that the twisted cohomology of the associated hyperplane arrangement defining FRW integrals overestimates the number of integrals required to define differential equations for the wavefunction coefficient. We demonstrate that the associated dual cohomology is automatically organized in a way that is ideal for understanding and exploiting the cut/residue structure of FRW integrals. Utilizing this understanding, we develop a systematic approach to organize compatible sequential residues, which dictates the physical subspace of FRW integrals for any $n$-site, $\ell$-loop graph. In particular, the physical subspace of tree-level FRW wavefunction coefficients is populated by differential forms associated to cuts/residues that factorize the integrand of the wavefunction coefficient into only flat space amplitudes. After demonstrating the validity of our construction using intersection theory, we develop simple graphical rules for cut tubings that enumerate the space of physical cuts and, consequently, differential forms without any calculation.</description>

      <title>Mahler measure and $L$-functions of $K3$ surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00893v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We express the Mahler measure of an exact polynomial in arbitrarily many variables in terms of Deligne-Beilinson cohomology using the Goncharov polylogarithmic complexes. Applying this to the case of four-variable exact polynomials, we study the relationship between the Mahler measure and the special value of $L$-functions of $K3$ surfaces at $s = 4$. This result is an extension of the three-variable case in \cite{Tri23}. In particular, we study the motivic cohomology and Deligne-Beilinson cohomology of singular $K3$ surfaces. Finally, we prove, under Beilinson's conjecture, that the Mahler measure of the four-variable exact polynomial $(x+1)(y+1)(z+1) + t$ is expressed in terms of the Riemann zeta function and the $L$-function of the modular form of weight 3, level 7.</description>

      <title>Collapsing of K3 Surfaces and Special K\"ahler Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18203v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the structure of $\mathfrak{M}_2$, the set of half-dimensional collapsing spaces of hyperk\"ahler metrics on K3 surfaces. We show that $\mathfrak{M}_2$ consists precisely of those underlying metric spaces of integral singular special K\"ahler structures (SKSs) on $ \mathbb{P}^1 $. Furthermore, we establish a bijection between integral singular SKSs on $\mathbb{P}^1 $ and Jacobian elliptic K3 surfaces with a marked holomorphic volume form. Additionally, we compute the number of Jacobian elliptic K3 surfaces that correspond to a given metric on $ \mathbb{P}^1 $.</description>
