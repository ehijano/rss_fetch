      <title>Structure formation with primordial black holes to alleviate early star formation tension revealed by JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This Letter explores the potential role of primordial black holes (PBHs) to address cosmological tensions as the presence of more massive than expected galaxies at high redshifts, as indicated by recent James Webb Space Telescope observations. Motivated by inflation models that enhance the power at scales beyond the observable range that produce PBHs with Schechter-like mass functions, we aim to explain the excess of high redshift galaxies via a modification of the $\Lambda$ cold dark matter power spectrum that consists in adding (i) a blue spectral index $n_b$ at $k_{\text{piv}}=10/$Mpc and (ii) Poisson and isocurvature contributions from massive PBHs that only make up $0.5\%$ of the dark matter.We simulated these models using the SWIFT code and find an increased abundance of high redshift galaxies in simulations that include PBHs. We compared these models to estimates from James Webb Space Telescope observations.Unlike the $\Lambda$ cold dark matter model, the inclusion of PBHs allowed us to reproduce the the observations with reasonable values for the star formation efficiency. Furthermore, the power spectra we adopted potentially produce PBHs that can serve as seeds for supermassive black holes with masses $7.57 \times 10^4 M_{\odot}$.</description>

      <title>Spatial curvature with the Alcock-Paczynski effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a methodology to measure the cosmological spatial curvature by employing the deviation from statistical isotropy due to the Alcock-Paczy\'nski effect of large scale galaxy clustering. This approach has a higher degree of model independence than most other proposed methods, being independent of calibration of standard candles, rulers, or clocks, of the power spectrum shape (and thus also of the pre-recombination physics), of the galaxy bias, of the theory of gravity, of the dark energy model and of the background cosmology in general. We find that a combined DESI-Euclid galaxy survey can achieve $\Delta \Omega_{k0}=0.057$ at 1$\sigma$ C.L. in the redshift range $z&lt;2$ by combining power-spectrum and bispectrum measurements.</description>

      <title>Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope \mbox{(AtLAST)} Science: Probing the Transient and Time-variable Sky</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of transient and variable events, including novae, active galactic nuclei, and black hole binaries, has historically been a fruitful path for elucidating the evolutionary mechanisms of our universe. The study of such events in the millimeter and submillimeter is, however, still in its infancy. Submillimeter observations probe a variety of materials, such as optically thick dust, which are hard to study in other wavelengths. Submillimeter observations are sensitive to a number of emission mechanisms, from the aforementioned cold dust, to hot free-free emission, and synchrotron emission from energetic particles. Study of these phenomena has been hampered by a lack of prompt, high sensitivity submillimeter follow-up, as well as by a lack of high-sky-coverage submillimeter surveys. In this paper, we describe how the proposed Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST) could fill in these gaps in our understanding of the transient universe. We discuss a number of science cases that would benefit from AtLAST observations, and detail how AtLAST is uniquely suited to contributing to them. In particular, AtLAST's large field of view will enable serendipitous detections of transient events, while its anticipated ability to get on source quickly and observe simultaneously in multiple bands make it also ideally suited for transient follow-up. We make theoretical predictions for the instrumental and observatory properties required to significantly contribute to these science cases, and compare them to the projected AtLAST capabilities. Finally, we consider the unique ways in which transient science cases constrain the observational strategies of AtLAST, and make prescriptions for how AtLAST should observe in order to maximize its transient science output without impinging on other science cases.</description>

      <title>Ultra-high frequency gravitational waves from cosmic strings with friction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We include the effect of the frictional force caused by interactions between cosmic strings and the particles of the background plasma in the computation of the stochastic gravitational wave background generated by cosmic string loops. Although our results show that friction leads to a partial suppression of the emission of gravitational radiation by cosmic string loops, we also find that loop production is very intense in the early stages of the Kibble regime. We show that, in many instances, this leads to a prominent signature of friction in the ultra-high frequency range of the spectrum, in the form of a secondary peak. The signature of friction is not only sensitive to cosmic string properties, but also to the initial conditions of the network and its surroundings. A detection of this signature would then allow us to extract information about the physics of the early universe that cannot be uncovered when probing the rest of the stochastic gravitational wave background spectrum.</description>

      <title>Constraining Viscous Dark Matter in light of CMB Spectral Distortion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the $\mu$- and \textit{y}-type spectral distortions of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), taking a non-standard interaction between baryons and viscous dark matter. Using the CMB spectral distortion observations, we can constrain any exotic mechanism that may change the energy of the CMB photon, leading to a CMB spectrum distortion. Depending on the viscosity of dark matter, the energy transfer between dark matter and baryons may modify, leading to a modification in CMB distortion. The existing Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE)/FIRAS and the Primordial Inflation Explorer (PIXIE) set limits on \textit{y} and $\mu$ types of distortions to $y = 1.5\times10^{-5}$, $\mu = 9.0\times10^{-5}$ and $y = 10^{-8}$, $\mu = 5.0\times10^{-8}$, respectively. In this paper, we discuss the pre-recombination contributions to $\mu$ and \textit{y}-type distortions by viscous dark matter and constrain the parameter space using PIXIE bounds on spectral distortion.</description>

      <title>New galaxy UV luminosity constraints on warm dark matter from JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We exploit the recent {\it James Webb Space Telescope} (JWST) determination of galaxy UV luminosity functions over the redshift range $z=9-14.5$ to derive constraints on warm dark matter (WDM) models. The delayed structure formation in WDM universe makes high redshift observations to be a powerful probe to set limits on the particle mass $m_\mathrm{x}$ of WDM candidates. By integrating these observations with blank-field surveys conducted by {\it Hubble Space Telescope} (HST) at redshifts $z=4-8$, we impose constraints on both astrophysical and WDM parameters simultaneously. We find a new limit of $m_\mathrm{x} \geq 3.2$ keV for the mass of thermal relic WDM particles at $95\%$ confidence level. This bound is tighter than the most stringent result derived using HST data before. Future JWST observations could further reduce the observation uncertainties and improve this constraint.</description>

      <title>Learning Galaxy Intrinsic Alignment Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intrinsic alignments (IA) of galaxies, regarded as a contaminant in weak lensing analyses, represents the correlation of galaxy shapes due to gravitational tidal interactions and galaxy formation processes. As such, understanding IA is paramount for accurate cosmological inferences from weak lensing surveys; however, one limitation to our understanding and mitigation of IA is expensive simulation-based modeling. In this work, we present a deep learning approach to emulate galaxy position-position ($\xi$), position-orientation ($\omega$), and orientation-orientation ($\eta$) correlation function measurements and uncertainties from halo occupation distribution-based mock galaxy catalogs. We find strong Pearson correlation values with the model across all three correlation functions and further predict aleatoric uncertainties through a mean-variance estimation training procedure. $\xi(r)$ predictions are generally accurate to $\leq10\%$. Our model also successfully captures the underlying signal of the noisier correlations $\omega(r)$ and $\eta(r)$, although with a lower average accuracy. We find that the model performance is inhibited by the stochasticity of the data, and will benefit from correlations averaged over multiple data realizations. Our code will be made open source upon journal publication.</description>

      <title>Exact CMB B-mode power spectrum from anisotropic cosmic birefringence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the cosmic microwave background (CMB) $B$-mode power spectrum resulting from anisotropic cosmic birefringence, without relying on the thin approximation of the last scattering surface. Specifically, we consider the influence of anisotropic cosmic birefringence arising from massless axion-like particles. Comparing our results to those obtained using the thin approximation, we observe a suppression in the amplitude of the $B$-mode power spectrum by approximately an order of magnitude at large angular scales ($\ell \lesssim 10$) and by a factor of two at small angular scales ($\ell \gtrsim 100$) when not employing the thin approximation. We also constrain the amplitude of the angular power spectrum of the scale-invariant anisotropic cosmic birefringence using the SPTpol $B$-mode power spectrum. We find that the amplitude is constrained as $A_{\rm CB}\times10^4=1.03^{+0.91}_{-0.97}\,(2\,\sigma)$. The numerical code is publicly available at https://github.com/toshiyan/biref-aniso-bb/tree/main.</description>

      <title>The Self-Consistency of DESI Analysis and Comment on "Does DESI 2024 Confirm $\Lambda$CDM?"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the constraints on the evolution of dark energy implemented by the DESI collaboration may be insufficient or incomplete using their own BAO data. Using large enough prior ranges for the present-day equation of state of dark energy $\omega_0$ and amplitude of dark energy evolution $\omega_a$, we obtain the complete $1\,\sigma$ and $2\,\sigma$ constraints $\omega_0=1.04^{+0.91+2.00}_{-1.00-1.90}$ and $\omega_a=-7.4^{+3.8+6.8}_{-3.2-7.3}$ indicating a beyond $2\,\sigma$ preference of quintessence-like dark energy today and an evidence of evolving dark energy at beyond $2\,\sigma$ CL, respectively. Our results are different from $\omega_0=-0.55^{+0.39}_{-0.21}$ and the $2\,\sigma$ upper limit $\omega_a&lt;-1.32$ reported by the DESI collaboration \cite{DESI:2024mwx}. Employing a data combination of cosmic microwave background, DESI BAO and type Ia supernova, we obtain the $1\,\sigma$, $2\,\sigma$ and $3\,\sigma$ constraints $\omega_0=-0.707^{+0.089+0.18+0.24}_{-0.089-0.17-0.22}$ and $\omega_a=-1.09^{+0.38+0.67+0.82}_{-0.31-0.72-1.00}$, which reveals a $\sim4\,\sigma$ evidence of dynamical dark energy when the redshift $z\lesssim0.1$. We verify that the BAO data point from luminous red galaxies at the effective redshift $z_{\rm eff}=0.51$ hardly affects the joint constraint from the data combination of cosmic microwave background, DESI BAO and type Ia supernova. We also point out the shortcomings and advantages of the binning method widely used in cosmological analyses.</description>

      <title>Reproducible empirical evidence of cosmological-scale asymmetry in galaxy spin directions: comment on arXiv:2404.06617</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The distribution of the spin directions of galaxies has been a question in the past decade, with numerous Earth-based and space-based experiments showing that the distribution is not necessarily random. These experiments were based on different statistical methods, one of them was a simple and empirically verified open source $\chi^2$ method. Patel &amp; Desmond (2024) proposed that previous experiments showing non-random distribution are flawed since they assume Gaussian distribution. To address that, they apply a new complex ad-hoc statistical method to several datasets, none of them except for one were used in the past to claim for a dipole axis. The new method showed that all datasets except for one exhibit isotropy. This paper discusses the soundness of the contention that Gaussian distribution cannot be assumed for galaxy spin directions. More importantly, simple empirical analyses show that the new statistical method is not fully responsive to asymmetry in the distribution of galaxy spin directions, and does not identify non-random distribution even in situations where a dipole axis clearly exists in the data, or when an artificial bias is added to the data to create an extremely non-random dataset. Results using Monte Carlo simulation show substantial differences between the results of the simulation and the results of the new statistical method. Code and data to reproduce the experiments are available, and released in a manner that is easily reproducible. Possible reasons leading to the results are also discussed. The claims that the actual results are different from the results reported in the papers are examined in an open and transparent manner. These claims are found to be inaccurate, as the previous literature results are fully reproducible. These findings further reinforce the need to study astrophysical or cosmological explanations for the non-random distribution.</description>

      <title>Exploring accelerated expansion in the universe: A study of $f(Q,T)$ gravity with parameterized EoS and cosmological constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study conducted in this research paper utilizes the $f(Q,T)$ gravity, where $Q$ represents non-metricity and $T$ represents the trace of the energy-momentum tensor, to investigate the accelerated expansion of the universe. To complete the study, an effective EoS with one parameter $\alpha$, is parameterized as $\omega _{eff}=-\frac{3}{\alpha (1+z)^{3}+3}$. The linear version of $f(Q,T)=-Q+\sigma T$ is also considered, where $\sigma$ is a constant. By constraining the model with six BAO points, 57 Hubble points, and 1048 Pantheon sample datasets, the parameters $\alpha$ and $\sigma$ are determined to best match the data. The cosmological parameters and energy conditions for the model are derived and examined. The results show that the model is in good agreement with observations, and can serve as a valuable starting point for analyzing FLRW models in the $f(Q,T)$ theory of gravity.</description>

      <title>Constraining the emergent dark energy models with cosmology-independent observational data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the phenomenologically emergent dark energy (PEDE) model and its generalized form, namely the generalized emergent dark energy (GEDE) model, which introduces a free parameter \unboldmath {\( \Delta \)} that can discriminate between the \unboldmath{$\mathrm{\Lambda}$}CDM model and the PEDE model. Fitting the emergent dark energy (EDE) models with the observational datasets including the cosmology-independent gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) at high-redshift and the observational Hubble data (OHD), we find a large value of $H_0$ which is close to the results of local measurement of $H_0$ from the SH0ES Collaboration in both EDE models. These results suggest that PEDE and GEDE models can %serve as an important supplement and be possible alternative to the standard cosmological model, pending further theoretical explorations and observational verifications.</description>

      <title>The DELVE Quadruple Quasar Search I. A Lensed Low Luminosity AGN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A quadruply lensed source, J125856.3-031944, has been discovered using the DELVE survey and WISE W1 - W2 colors. Followup direct imaging carried out with the MPIA 2.2 m and the Baade 6.5 m telescopes is analyzed, as is spectroscopy from the 2.5 m Nordic Optical Telescope. The lensed image configuration is kite-like, with the faintest image 2 magnitudes fainter than the other three. Redward of 6000 AA that image is badly blended with the lensing galaxy, which is elongated along the symmetry axis of the kite. Magellan direct imaging carried out in Sloan g permits better deblending. As the lensed image configuration is nearly circular, simple models give individual magnifications of at least 25 for the 3 brighter images. The source's narrow emission lines and low intrinsic luminosity qualify it as a type 2 AGN.</description>

      <title>Mechanisms for producing Primordial Black Holes from Inflationary Models Beyond Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we present an analysis of the fine-tuning required in various inflationary models in order to explain the production of Primordial Black Holes (PBHs). We specifically examine the degree of fine-tuning necessary in two prominent single field inflationary models: those with an inflection point and those with step-like features in the potential. Our findings indicate that models with step-like features generally require less fine-tuning compared to those with an inflection point, making them more viable for consistent PBH production. An interesting outcome of these models is that, in addition to improved fine-tuning, they may also predict low-frequency signals that can be detected by pulsar timing array (PTA) collaborations. Additionally, we extend our analysis to multifield inflationary models to assess whether the integration of additional fields can further alleviate the fine-tuning demands. The study also explores the role of a spectator field and its impact on the fine-tuning process. Through a comparative analysis across these models, we evaluate their parametric sensitivities and alignment with the constraints from Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) observations. Our results indicate that although mechanisms involving a spectator field can circumvent the issue of fine-tuning parameters for PBH production, both multifield models and models with step-like features present promising alternatives. While fine-tuning involves multiple considerations, our primary objective is to evaluate various inflationary models to identify the one that most naturally explains the formation of PBHs. Hence, this study aims to the development of less constrained inflationary scenarios that align with observational data and support the theoretical possibility of PBH production.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quintessence scalar fields are a natural candidate for evolving dark energy. Unlike the phenomenological $w_0w_a$ parameterization of the dark energy equation of state, they cannot accommodate the phantom regime of dark energy $w(z) &lt; -1$, or crossings into the phantom regime. Recent baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) indicate a preference for evolving dark energy over a cosmological constant, ranging from $2.6\sigma-3.9\sigma$ when fitting to $w_0w_a$, and combining the DESI BAO measurements with other cosmological probes. In this work, we directly fit three simple scalar field models to the DESI BAO data, combined with cosmic microwave background anisotropy measurements and supernova data sets. Quantifying the preference for scalar field dynamics exhibited by the data, we find that $2-4\%$ of kinetic scalar field energy $\Omega_{\rm scf,k}$, is preferred over $\Lambda$CDM at the $95\%$ confidence level, for a canonical scalar field with a quadratic or linear potential. Fitting to the supernova data sets Pantheon, Pantheon+, DES-Y5, and Union3, we show that the mild tension ($n_{\sigma}&lt; 3.4 $) under $\Lambda$CDM emerges from a BAO preference for smaller values of fractional mass-energy density $\Omega_m &lt; 0.29$, while all supernova data sets, except for Pantheon, prefer larger values, $\Omega_m &gt; 0.3$. The tension under $\Lambda$CDM remains noticeable ($n_{\sigma} &lt;2.8$), when replacing two of the DESI BAO measurements redshift bins with effective redshifts $z_{\text{eff}} =0.51$, and $z_{\text{eff}}= 0.706$ with comparable BOSS DR 12 BAO measurements at $z_{\text{eff}} =0.51$, and $z_{\text{eff}}= 0.61$. Canonical scalar fields as dark energy are successful in mitigating that tension.</description>

      <title>Towards testing the general bounce cosmology with the CMB B-mode auto-bispectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been shown that a three-point correlation function of tensor perturbations from a bounce model in general relativity with a minimally-coupled scalar field is highly suppressed, and the resultant three-point function of cosmic microwave background (CMB) B-mode polarizations is too small to be detected by CMB experiments. On the other hand, bounce models in a more general class with a non-minimal derivative coupling between a scalar field and gravity can predict the three-point correlation function of the tensor perturbations without any suppression, the amplitude of which is allowed to be much larger than that in general relativity. In this paper, we evaluate the three-point function of the B-mode polarizations from the general bounce cosmology with the non-minimal coupling and show that a signal-to-noise ratio of the B-mode auto-bispectrum in the general class can reach unity for $\ell_{\rm max}\geq9$ and increase up to $5.39$ for $\ell_{\rm max}=100$ in the full-sky case. We also discuss the possibility to test the general class of bounce models by upcoming CMB experiments.</description>

      <title>A covariant formulation for cosmological radiative transfer of the 21-cm line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 21-cm hyperfine line of neutral hydrogen is a useful tool to probe the conditions of the Universe during the Dark Ages, Cosmic Dawn, and the Epoch of Reionisation. In most of the current calculations, the 21-cm line signals at given frequencies are computed, using an integrated line-of-sight line opacity, with the correction for cosmological expansion. These calculations have not fully captured the line and continuum interactions in the radiative transfer, in response to evolution of the radiation field and the variations of thermal and dynamic properties of the line-of-sight medium. We construct a covariant formulation for the radiative transfer of the 21-cm line and derive the cosmological 21-cm line radiative transfer (C21LRT) equation. The formulation properly accounts for local emission and absorption processes and the interaction between the line and continuum when the radiation propagates across the expanding Universe to the present observer. Our C21LRT calculations show that methods simply summing the line optical depth could lead to error of $5\%$ in the 21-cm signals for redshift $z \sim 12-35$ and of $&gt;10\%$ for redshift $z \lesssim 8$. Proper covariant radiative transfer is therefore necessary for producing correct theoretical templates for extracting information of the structural evolution of the Universe through the Epoch of Reionisation from the 21-cm tomographic data.</description>

      <title>A Multiverse Outside of the Swampland</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Multiverse can arise from landscapes without de Sitter minima. It can be populated during a period of eternal inflation without trans-Planckian field excursions and without flat potentials. This Multiverse can explain the values of the cosmological constant and of the weak scale. In the process of proving these statements we derive a few simple, but counter-intuitive results. We show that it is easy to write models of eternal inflation compatible with the distance and refined de Sitter conjectures. Secondly, tunneling transitions that move fields from a lower-energy vacuum to a higher-energy vacuum and generate baby Universes are possible, and occur during eternal inflation. Finally, we relax the assumption of no de Sitter minima and show that this more standard Multiverse can be populated by Coleman-De Luccia transitions in about 100 $e$-folds of inflation.</description>

      <title>Charged analog of anisotropic dark energy star in Rastall gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark energy is one of the potential strategies for preventing compact objects from gravitationally collapsing into singularities. Because it is the cause of the accelerated expansion of our universe, it has the greatest impact on the cosmos. Thus, it is plausible that dark energy will interact with any stellar object that is compact in the universe [\textit{Phys. Rev. D} \textbf{103}, 084042 (2021)]. Our main goal in this work is to create a simplified model, in the Rastall gravitational framework, of a charged strange star coupled to anisotropic dark energy in Krori-Barua spacetime [\textit{J. Phys. A, Math. Gen.} \textbf{8}:508, 1975]. Here, we consider a specific strange star object, Her X-1, with observed values of mass $=(0.85 \pm 0.15)M_{\odot}$ and radius $= 8.1_{-0.41}^{+0.41}$ km., so that we can develop our model. In this context, we began by modeling dark energy using the equation of state (EoS), in which the dark energy density is proportional to the isotropic perfect fluid matter-energy density. The Darmois-Israel condition has been used to calculate the unknown constants that are present in the metric. We perform a detailed analysis of the model's physical properties, including the mass-radius relation, pressure, density, metric function, and dark energy parameters, by varying the Rastall coupling parameter. We also examine the stability and force equilibrium of our proposed stellar configuration. Following a comprehensive theoretical analysis, we discovered that our suggested model is both singularity-free and meets all stability requirements needed to be a stable, physically reasonable stellar model.</description>

      <title>Finding accreted stars in the Milky Way: clues from NIHAO simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exploring the marks left by galactic accretion in the Milky Way helps us understand how our Galaxy was formed. However, finding and studying accreted stars and the galaxies they came from has been challenging. This study uses a simulation from the NIHAO project, which now includes a wider range of chemical compositions, to find better ways to spot these accreted stars. By comparing our findings with data from the GALAH spectroscopic survey, we confirm that the observationally established diagnostics of [Al/Fe] vs. [Mg/Mn] also show a separation of in-situ and accreted stars in the simulation, but stars from different accretion events tend to overlap in this plane even without observational uncertainties. Looking at the relationship between stellar age and linear or logarithmic abundances, such as [Fe/H], we can clearly separate different groups of these stars if the uncertainties in their chemical makeup are less than 0.15 dex and less than 20% for their ages. This method shows promise for studying the history of the Milky Way and other galaxies. Our work highlights how important it is to have accurate measurements of stellar ages and chemical content. It also shows how simulations can help us understand the complex process of galaxies merging and suggest how these events might relate to the differences we see between our Galaxy's thin and thick disk stars. This study provides a way to compare theoretical models with real observations, opening new paths for research in both our own Galaxy and beyond.</description>

      <title>DALI sensitivity to streaming axion dark matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark matter substructures emerge naturally in a scenario in which the axion angular field acquires propagating degrees of freedom in a post-inflationary Universe. The DALI experiment is a new generation wavy dark matters interferometer currently in prototyping. Although DALI's main objective is to explore the virialized DM in our Galaxy, to a large degree in this article we explore the prospect for detection of fine grained streams made of axions that would enter the Solar System, as suggested by previous work. We find that DALI will have a sensitivity to encounters with these coherent objects that fully spans the window defined by the coupling strength to photons of representative axion models over a stacked bandwidth of two decades in mass.</description>

      <title>Kinematic morphology of low-mass galaxies in IllustrisTNG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The origin of diverse kinematic morphologies observed in low-mass galaxies is unclear. In this study, we investigate the kinematic morphologies of central galaxies with stellar mass $10^{8.5-9.0} M_{\odot}$ at $z=0$ in the TNG50-1 cosmological simulation. The majority of the low-mass galaxies in TNG50-1 are dispersion-dominated, consistent with observations. By tracing the evolutionary histories of simulated low-mass galaxies, we find that while most stars form in rotating cold gas discs, the orientation of the star-forming discs relative to the galaxies may evolve with cosmic time. If the cold gas disc remains aligning with the galaxy during its evolution, stars formed at different times share the same rotational direction, leading to a rotation-dominated system. On the contrary, frequent misalignment of cold gas disc would result in a dispersion-dominated system. In addition, we also find that the two-body scattering can have a non-negligible numerical heating effect on the simulated galaxy morphology, especially at central regions of galaxies and for relatively low-mass galaxies. By comparing results of simulations with different resolutions, our results suggest that the simulated morphology of galaxies is reliable when their number of stellar particles exceeds about $10^{4}$, and bulge morphology of galaxies can not be resolved robustly at the resolution level of TNG50-1.</description>

      <title>Impact of astrophysical effects on the dark matter mass constraint with 21cm intensity mapping</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.01256v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an innovative approach to constraining the non-cold dark matter model using a convolutional neural network (CNN). We perform a suite of hydrodynamic simulations with varying dark matter particle masses and generate mock 21cm radio intensity maps to trace the dark matter distribution. Our proposed method complements the traditional power spectrum analysis. We compare our CNN classification results with those from the power spectrum of the differential brightness temperature map of 21cm radiation, and find that the CNN outperforms the latter. Moreover, we investigate the impact of baryonic physics on the dark matter model constraint, including star formation, self-shielding of HI gas, and UV background model. We find that these effects may introduce some contamination in the dark matter constraint, but they are insignificant when compared to the realistic system noise of the SKA instruments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.16467v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a cosmology-independent method to constrain cosmological models from the latest 221 gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) sample, including 49 GRBs from Fermi catalog with the Amati relation (the $E_{\rm p}$-${E}_{\rm iso}$ correlation), which calibrated by using a Gaussian process from the Pantheon+ type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) sample. With 182 GRBs at $0.8\le z\le8.2$ in the Hubble diagram and the latest observational Hubble data (OHD) by the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, we obtained $\Omega_{\rm m}$ = $0.348^{+0.048}_{-0.066}$ and $h$ = $0.680^{+0.029}_{-0.029}$ for the flat $\Lambda$CDM model, and $\Omega_{\rm m}$ = $0.318^{+0.067}_{-0.059}$, $h$ = $0.704^{+0.055}_{-0.068}$, $w$ = $-1.21^{+0.32}_{-0.67}$ for the flat $w$CDM model. These results are consistent with those in which the coefficients of the Amati relation and the cosmological parameters fitted simultaneously.</description>

      <title>Euclid preparation. XXXIV. The effect of linear redshift-space distortions in photometric galaxy clustering and its cross-correlation with cosmic shear</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.00052v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The cosmological surveys that are planned for the current decade will provide us with unparalleled observations of the distribution of galaxies on cosmic scales, by means of which we can probe the underlying large-scale structure (LSS) of the Universe. This will allow us to test the concordance cosmological model and its extensions. However, precision pushes us to high levels of accuracy in the theoretical modelling of the LSS observables, so that no biases are introduced into the estimation of the cosmological parameters. In particular, effects such as redshift-space distortions (RSD) can become relevant in the computation of harmonic-space power spectra even for the clustering of the photometrically selected galaxies, as has previously been shown in literature. In this work, we investigate the contribution of linear RSD, as formulated in the Limber approximation by a previous work, in forecast cosmological analyses with the photometric galaxy sample of the Euclid survey. We aim to assess their impact and to quantify the bias on the measurement of cosmological parameters that would be caused if this effect were neglected. We performed this task by producing mock power spectra for photometric galaxy clustering and weak lensing, as is expected to be obtained from the Euclid survey. We then used a Markov chain Monte Carlo approach to obtain the posterior distributions of cosmological parameters from these simulated observations. When the linear RSD is neglected, significant biases are caused when galaxy correlations are used alone and when they are combined with cosmic shear in the so-called 3$\times$2pt approach. These biases can be equivalent to as much as $5\,\sigma$ when an underlying $\Lambda$CDM cosmology is assumed. When the cosmological model is extended to include the equation-of-state parameters of dark energy, the extension parameters can be shifted by more than $1\,\sigma$.</description>

      <title>Elucidating the impact of massive neutrinos on halo assembly bias</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07650v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Massive neutrinos have non-negligible impact on the formation of large-scale structures. We investigate the impact of massive neutrinos on the halo assembly bias effect, measured by the relative halo bias $\hat{b}$ as a function of the curvature of the initial density peak $\hat{s}$, neutrino excess $\epsilon_\nu$, or halo concentration $\hat{c}$, using a large suite of $\Sigma M_\nu{=}0.0$ eV and $0.4$ eV simulations with the same initial conditions. By tracing dark matter haloes back to their initial density peaks, we construct a catalogue of halo twins that collapsed from the same peaks but evolved separately with and without massive neutrinos, thereby isolating any effect of neutrinos on halo formation. We detect a $2\%$ weakening of the halo assembly bias as measured by $\hat{b}(\epsilon_\nu)$ in the presence of massive neutrinos. As there exists a significant correlation between $\hat{s}$ and $\epsilon_\nu$ ($r_{cc}{=}0.319$), the impact of neutrinos persists at a reduced level~($0.1\%$) in the halo assembly bias measured by $\hat{b}(\hat{s})$. However, we do not detect any neutrino-induced impact on $\hat{b}(\hat{c})$, consistent with earlier studies and the lack of correlation between $\hat{c}$ and $\epsilon_\nu$ ($r_{cc}{=}0.087$). We also discover an analogous assembly bias effect for the neutrino haloes, whose concentrations are anti-correlated with the large-scale clustering of neutrinos.</description>

Abstract: We present constraints on the extended Starobinsky and Weyl gravity model of inflation using updated available observational data. The data includes cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy measurements from Planck and BICEP/Keck 2018 (BK18), as well as large-scale structure data encompassing cosmic shear and galaxy autocorrelation and cross-correlation functions measurements from Dark Energy Survey (DES), baryonic acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements from 6dF, MGS and BOSS, and distance measurements from supernovae type Ia from Pantheon+ samples. By introducing a single additional parameter, each model extends the Starobinsky model to encompass larger region of parameter space while remaining consistent with all observational data. Our findings demonstrate that the inclusion of higher-order terms loosen the constraint on the upper bound of $e$-folding number $N_{\rm e}$ due to the presence of small additional parameter. The maximum limit on $N_{\rm e}$ could be refined by considering the reheating process to $N_{\rm e}&lt;55-59$ for $k_{*}=0.002-0.05\ {\rm Mpc}^{-1}$. These models extend viable range of tensor-to-scalar ratio ($r$) to very small value $r&lt;0.002$ in contrast to the original $R^2$ Starobinsky model. In addition, our results continue to emphasize the tension in $H_0$ and $S_8$ between early-time CMB measurements and late-time large-scale structure observations.</description>

Abstract: Natural inflation is a well-motivated model for the early universe in which an inflaton potential of the pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone form, $V(\phi) = \Lambda^4[1 + \cos{(\phi/f)}]$, can naturally drive a cosmic accelerated epoch. This paper investigates the observational viability of the minimally and non-minimally coupled natural inflation scenarios in light of current Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) observations. We find that a small and negative coupling of the field with gravity can alleviate the well-known observational discrepancies of the minimally coupled model. We perform a Monte Carlo Markov Chain analysis of the Planck 2018 CMB and BICEP/Keck Array B-mode polarization data to estimate how strong the coupling $\xi$ should be to achieve concordance with data. We also briefly discuss the impact of these results on the physical interpretation of the natural inflation scenario.</description>

      <title>A New Solution for the Observed Isotropic Cosmic Birefringence Angle and its Implications for the Anisotropic Counterpart through a Boltzmann Approach</title>

Abstract: Cosmic Birefringence (CB) is a phenomenon in which the polarization of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation is rotated as it travels through space due to the coupling between photons and an axion-like field. We look for a solution able to explain the result obtained from the \textit{Planck} Public Release 4 (PR4), which has provided a hint of detection of the CB angle, $\alpha=(0.30\pm0.11)^{\circ}$. In addition to the solutions, already present in the literature, which need a non-negligible evolution in time of the axion-like field during recombination, we find a new region of the parameter space which allows for a nearly constant time evolution of such a field in the same epoch. The latter reinforces the possibility to employ the commonly used relations connecting the observed CMB spectra with the unrotated ones, through trigonometric functions of the CB angle. However, if the homogeneous axion field sourcing isotropic birefringence is almost constant in time during the matter-dominated era, this does not automatically implies that the same holds true also for the associated inhomogeneous perturbations. For this reason, in this paper we present a full generalized Boltzmann treatment of this phenomenon, that is able, for the first time to our knowledge to deal with the time evolution of anisotropic cosmic birefringence (ACB). We employ this approach to provide predictions of ACB, in particular for the set of best-fit parameters found in the new solution of the isotropic case. If the latter is the correct model, we expect an ACB spectrum of the order of $(10^{-15}\div10^{-32})$ deg$^2$ for the auto-correlation, and $(10^{-7}\div10^{-17})$ $\mu $K$\cdot\,$deg for the cross-correlations with the CMB $T$ and $E$ fields, depending on the angular scale.</description>

      <title>Simulating the epoch of Helium Reionization in photon-conserving semi-numerical code SCRIPT</title>

Abstract: The reionization of the second electron of helium (HeII) leaves important imprints on the thermal and ionization state of the intergalactic medium (IGM). Observational evidence suggests that HeII reionization ended at $z \simeq 3$ due to ionizing photons emitted predominantly by quasars. We present efficient semi-numerical simulations of helium reionization in a $230 \ \mathrm{h^{-1}~Mpc}$ box, that takes into account the spatial patchiness of reionization coupled with photoheating of the IGM. Dark matter haloes are assigned quasars using empirical measurements of the quasar luminosity function, assuming a universal quasar lifetime consistent with duty cycle values inferred from measurements of the quasar clustering. The ionizing photon field from quasars is then included in the semi-numerical Code for ReionIzation with PhoTon conservation (SCRIPT), which was originally developed for modeling hydrogen reionization. In this work, we make appropriate modifications to SCRIPT for modeling inhomogenous HeII reionization and the corresponding thermal history of the IGM is modelled via a subgrid prescription. Our model has three main free parameters i.e. the global clumping factor $\mathcal{C}_{HeIII}$, the temperature increase due to photoheating $T^{re}_{He}$ and the quasar spectral energy distribution (SED) index, $\alpha_{UV}$. Our fiducial model with $\mathcal{C}_{HeIII}=15.6$ and $T^{re}_{He} \sim 6000 \ K$ gives reasonable values for the empirical measurements of the temperature density equation of state at these redshifts, assuming that quasars brighter than $\mathrm{M_{1450}}&lt;-21$ and having $\alpha_{UV}=1.7$ contribute to HeII reionization. The efficiency of our code shows promising prospects for performing parameter estimation in future, for models of HeII reionization using observations of the Ly$\alpha$ forest.</description>

Abstract: Gravitational wave standard sirens typically require electromagnetic (EM) data to obtain redshift information to constrain cosmology. Difficult to find EM counterparts for bright sirens and galaxy survey systematics for dark sirens make cosmological constraints with spectral sirens, a gravitational wave data-only approach, extremely appealing. In this work, we use the GWTC-3 BBH detections as spectral sirens to constrain the BBH population and the underlying cosmological expansion with a flexible model for the black hole mass spectrum. We use a binned Gaussian process to model the BBH mass distribution in the source frame without any astrophysical assumptions on the shape and or inclusion (or lack of) features that drive the cosmological constraints as the redshifted detector frame masses become consistent with the underlying astrophysical mass distribution features. For GWTC-3 we find a measurement on the Hubble constant of $H_0=73.0^{+13.3}_{-7.7} \ {\rm{km \ s^{-1} \ Mpc^{-1}}}$ at $68\%$ C.L. when combined with that obtained from the bright standard siren analysis with GW170817 and its associated host galaxy NGC 4993. We find an improved estimate for the Hubble constant of around a factor of 1.4 times better than the GW170817 measurement alone. We validate our nonparametric spectral siren approach with simulations and benchmark its scalability and constraining performance when compared with parametric methods.</description>

      <title>Production of Alternate Realizations of DESI Fiber Assignment for Unbiased Clustering Measurement in Data and Simulations</title>

Abstract: A critical requirement of spectroscopic large scale structure analyses is correcting for selection of which galaxies to observe from an isotropic target list. This selection is often limited by the hardware used to perform the survey which will impose angular constraints of simultaneously observable targets, requiring multiple passes to observe all of them. In SDSS this manifested solely as the collision of physical fibers and plugs placed in plates. In DESI, there is the additional constraint of the robotic positioner which controls each fiber being limited to a finite patrol radius. A number of approximate methods have previously been proposed to correct the galaxy clustering statistics for these effects, but these generally fail on small scales. To accurately correct the clustering we need to upweight pairs of galaxies based on the inverse probability that those pairs would be observed (Bianchi \&amp; Percival 2017). This paper details an implementation of that method to correct the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey for incompleteness. To calculate the required probabilities, we need a set of alternate realizations of DESI where we vary the relative priority of otherwise identical targets. These realizations take the form of alternate Merged Target Ledgers (AMTL), the files that link DESI observations and targets. We present the method used to generate these alternate realizations and how they are tracked forward in time using the real observational record and hardware status, propagating the survey as though the alternate orderings had been adopted. We detail the first applications of this method to the DESI One-Percent Survey (SV3) and the DESI year 1 data. We include evaluations of the pipeline outputs, estimation of survey completeness from this and other methods, and validation of the method using mock galaxy catalogs.</description>

      <title>Imaging dark matter at the smallest scales with $z\approx1$ lensed stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08033v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Observations of caustic-crossing galaxies at redshift $0.7&lt;z&lt;1$ show a wealth of transient events. Most of them are believed to be microlensing events of highly magnified stars. Earlier work predicted such events should be common near the critical curves (CCs) of galaxy clusters, but some are found relatively far away from these CCs. We consider the possibility that substructure on milliarcsecond scales (few parsecs in the lens plane) is boosting the microlensing signal. We study the combined magnification from the macrolens, millilenses, and microlenses (3M-lensing). After considering realistic populations of millilenses and microlenses, we conclude that the enhanced microlensing rate around millilenses is not sufficient to explain the high fraction of observed events in the far region. Instead we find a that the shape of the luminosity function (LF) of the lensed stars combined with the amount of substructure in the lens plane determines the number of mcirolensing events found near and far from the CC. By measuring $\beta$ (the exponent of the LF), and the number density of microlensing events at each location, one can create a pseudoimage of the underlying distribution of mass on small scales. We identify two regimes: (i) positive imaging regime where $\beta&gt;2$ and the number density of events is greater around substructureand the number density of events is greater around substructures, and (ii) negative imaging regime where $\beta&lt;2$. We study the particular case of seven microlensing events found by HST in the Dragon arc (at z=0.725). We find that a population of supergiant stars with a steep LF with $\beta=2.55$ fits the distribution of these events. We identify a small region of high density of microlensing events, and interpret it as evidence of a possible invisible substructure, for which we derive a mass of $\sim 1.3 \times 10^8\,\Msun$ (within its Einstein radius).</description>

Abstract: The lightest $Z_2$ odd particle in the scotogenic model, referred to as scotogenic dark matter (DM), is a widely studied candidate for DM. This scotogenic DM is generated through well-known thermal processes as well as via the evaporation of primordial black holes (PBHs). Recent reports suggested that the curvature fluctuations of PBHs during an epoch dominated by these entities in the early universe can serve as the source of so-called induced gravitational waves (GWs). In this study, we demonstrate that stringent constraints on the mass of scotogenic DM and PBHs can be obtained through the detection of induced GWs using future detectors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12668v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The backreaction of quantum fields in their vacuum state results in equilibrium structures that surpass the Buchdahl compactness limit. Such backreaction is encapsulated in the vacuum expectation value of the renormalized stress-energy tensor (RSET). In previous works we presented analytic approximations to the RSET, obtained by dimensional reduction, available in spherical symmetry, and showed that the backreaction-generated solutions described ultracompact fluid spheres with a negative mass interior. Here, we derive a novel approximation to the RSET that does not rely on dimensional reduction, but rather on a reduction of the differential order. This approximation also leads to regular stars surpassing the Buchdahl limit. We conclude that this is a consequence of the negative energies associated with the Boulware vacuum which, for sufficiently compact fluid spheres, make the Misner-Sharp mass negative near the centre of spherical symmetry. Our analysis provides further cumulative evidence that quantum vacuum polarization is capable of producing new forms of stellar equilibrium with robust properties accross different analytical approximations to the RSET.</description>

      <title>Atomic Hydrogen Shows its True Colours: Correlations between HI and Galaxy Colour in Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16884v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Intensity mapping experiments are beginning to measure the spatial distribution of neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) to constrain cosmological parameters and the large-scale distribution of matter. However, models of the behaviour of HI as a tracer of matter are complicated by galaxy evolution. In this work, we examine the clustering of HI in relation to galaxy colour, stellar mass, and HI mass in IllustrisTNG at $z$ = 0, 0.5, and 1. We compare the HI-red and HI-blue galaxy cross-power spectra, finding that HI-red has an amplitude 1.5 times higher than HI-blue at large scales. The cross-power spectra intersect at $\approx 3$ Mpc in real space and $\approx 10$ Mpc in redshift space, consistent with $z \approx 0$ observations. We show that HI clustering increases with galaxy HI mass and depends weakly on detection limits in the range $M_{\mathrm{HI}} \leq 10^8 M_\odot$. In terms of $M_\star$, we find blue galaxies in the greatest stellar mass bin cluster more than blue galaxies in other stellar mass bins. Red galaxies in the greatest stellar mass bin, however, cluster the weakest amongst red galaxies. These trends arise due to central-satellite compositions. Centrals correlate less with HI for increasing stellar mass, whereas satellites correlate more, irrespective of colour. Despite the clustering relationships with stellar mass, we find that the cross-power spectra are largely insensitive to detection limits in HI and galaxy surveys. Counter-intuitively, all auto and cross-power spectra for red and blue galaxies and HI decrease with time at all scales in IllustrisTNG. We demonstrate that processes associated with quenching contribute to this trend. The complex interplay between HI and galaxies underscores the importance of understanding baryonic effects when interpreting the large-scale clustering of HI, blue, and red galaxies at $z \leq 1$.</description>

      <title>Honing cross-correlation tools for inference on ultra-high-energy cosmic-ray composition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.17699v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The chemical composition of the highest-energy cosmic rays, namely the atomic number $Z$ of rays with energies $E\gtrsim40~\mathrm{EeV}$, remains to date largely unknown. Some information on the composition can be inferred from the deflections that charged ultra-high-energy cosmic rays experience while they traverse intervening magnetic fields. Indeed, such deflections distort and suppress the original anisotropy in the cosmic ray arrival directions; thus, given a source model, a measure of the anisotropy is also a measurement of the deflections, which in turn informs us on the chemical composition. In this work, we show that, by quantifying ultra-high-energy cosmic ray anisotropies through the angular cross-correlation between cosmic rays and galaxies, we would be able to exclude iron fractions $f_{\rm Fe}\geq{\cal O}(10\%)$ assuming a fiducial hydrogen map at $2\,\sigma$ level, and even smaller fractions in the reverse case of hydrogen on an iron map, going well below $f_{\rm H}\approx10\%$ when we mask the Galactic Centre up to latitudes of $40^\circ$. This is an improvement of a factor of a few compared to our previous method, and is mostly ascribable to a new test statistics which is sensitive to each harmonic multipole individually. Our method can be applied to real data as an independent test of the recent claim that current cosmic-ray data can not be reproduced by any existing model of the Galactic magnetic field, as well as an additional handle to compare any realistic, competing, data-driven composition models.</description>

Abstract: We apply the gradient expansion approximation to the light-cone gauge, obtaining a separate universe picture at non-linear order in perturbation theory within this framework. Thereafter, we use it to generalize the $\delta N$ formalism in terms of light-cone perturbations. As a consistency check, we demonstrate the conservation of the gauge invariant curvature perturbation on uniform density hypersurface $\zeta$ at the completely non-linear level. The approach studied provides a self-consistent framework to connect at non-linear level quantities from the primordial universe, such as $\zeta$, written in terms of the light-cone parameters, to late time observables.</description>

Abstract: The Bayes factor surface is a new way to present results from experimental searches for new physics. Searches are regularly expressed in terms of phenomenological parameters - such as the mass and cross-section of a weakly interacting massive particle. Bayes factor surfaces indicate the strength of evidence for or against models relative to the background only model in terms of the phenomenological parameters that they predict. They provide a clear and direct measure of evidence, may be easily reinterpreted, but do not depend on choices of prior or parameterization. We demonstrate the Bayes factor surface with examples from dark matter, cosmology, and collider physics.</description>

Abstract: In galaxy cluster collisions, the gas can be separated from dark matter halos. Abell~56 displays signatures of a dissociative bullet-like merger with a possible high inclination angle between the plane of orbit and the sky. Our objective is to provide a comprehensive description of the features observed in the collision scenario of Abell~56. Additionally, we aim to apply a potential weak lensing mass bias correction attributed to the merger to evaluate its impact on our findings. To investigate this, we perform tailored hydrodynamical $N$-body simulations, varying the impact parameter. We initially identified an early scenario at $0.12$\,Gyr after the central passage that reproduces some observational features. However, the mean temperature of $9.7$\,keV exceeded the observed value. Our best model corresponds to the late scenario at $0.52$\,Gyr after the pericenter, reproducing observed features of Abell~56, with an inclination of $58^\circ$. These features include the offset of $103$\,kpc between the main gas density peak and the south dark matter density peak, gas morphology, a line of sight relative velocity of $184$\,km\,s$^{-1}$, and a mean temperature of $6.7$\,keV. This late model provides a plausible scenario to describe the dynamics of Abell~56. The weak lensing mass bias did not significantly impact the overall dynamics of this cluster merger.</description>
