      <title>Internet of medical things for non-invasive and non-contact dehydration monitoring away from the hospital: state-of-the-art, challenges and prospects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17813</link>

Abstract: Dehydration occurs when the body loses more water than it takes in. Mild dehydration can lead to fatigue, cognitive impairments, and physical complications, while severe dehydration can cause life-threatening conditions like heat stroke, kidney damage, and hypovolemic shock. Traditional bio chemistry-based clinical gold standard methods are expensive, time-consuming, and invasive. Thus, there is a pressing need to design novel non-invasive methods that could do in-situ, early and accurate detection of dehydration, which will in turn allow timely intervention. This article presents a methodological review of the literature on a range of innovative internet of medical things-based techniques for dehydration monitoring. We begin by briefly describing the pathophysiology of the dehydration problem, its clinical significance, and current clinical gold-standard methods for assessing hydration level. Subsequently, we critically examine a number of non-invasive and non-contact hydration assessment studies. We also discuss multi-modal sensing methods and assess the impact of dehydration among specific population groups (e.g., elderly, infants, athletes) and on different organs. We also provide a list of existing public and private datasets which make the backbone of machine learning-driven research on dehydration monitoring. Finally, we provide our opinion statement on the challenges and future prospects of non-invasive and non-contact hydration monitoring.</description>

Abstract: This paper explores the potential of Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) technology to enhance grid stability and support sustainable mobility in Dresden's Ostra district. By enabling electric vehicles to serve as mobile energy storage units, V2X offers grid stabilization and new business opportunities. We examine pilot projects and business use cases, focusing on Building Integrated Vehicle Energy Solutions (BIVES) and Resilient Energy Storage and Backup (RESB) as stepping stones towards full Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) implementation. Our analysis highlights the feasibility, advantages, and challenges of implementing V2X in urban settings, underscoring its significant role in transitioning to a resilient, low-carbon urban energy system. The paper concludes with recommendations for addressing technical, regulatory, and business model challenges to accelerate V2X adoption in Dresden and beyond.</description>

      <title>EEG-Based Mental Imagery Task Adaptation via Ensemble of Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank Adapters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is widely researched for neural decoding in Brain Computer Interfaces (BCIs) as it is non-invasive, portable, and economical. However, EEG signals suffer from inter- and intra-subject variability, leading to poor performance. Recent technological advancements have led to deep learning (DL) models that have achieved high performance in various fields. However, such large models are compute- and resource-intensive and are a bottleneck for real-time neural decoding. Data distribution shift can be handled with the help of domain adaptation techniques of transfer learning (fine-tuning) and adversarial training that requires model parameter updates according to the target domain. One such recent technique is Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), which requires only a small fraction of the total trainable parameters compared to fine-tuning the whole model. Therefore, we explored PEFT methods for adapting EEG-based mental imagery tasks. We considered two mental imagery tasks: speech imagery and motor imagery, as both of these tasks are instrumental in post-stroke neuro-rehabilitation. We proposed a novel ensemble of weight-decomposed low-rank adaptation methods, EDoRA, for parameter-efficient mental imagery task adaptation through EEG signal classification. The performance of the proposed PEFT method is validated on two publicly available datasets, one speech imagery, and the other motor imagery dataset. In extensive experiments and analysis, the proposed method has performed better than full fine-tune and state-of-the-art PEFT methods for mental imagery EEG classification.</description>

      <title>RUL forecasting for wind turbine predictive maintenance based on deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predictive maintenance (PdM) is increasingly pursued to reduce wind farm operation and maintenance costs by accurately predicting the remaining useful life (RUL) and strategically scheduling maintenance. However, the remoteness of wind farms often renders current methodologies ineffective, as they fail to provide a sufficiently reliable advance time window for maintenance planning, limiting PdM's practicality. This study introduces a novel deep learning (DL) methodology for future RUL forecasting. By employing a multi-parametric attention-based DL approach that bypasses feature engineering, thereby minimizing the risk of human error, two models: ForeNet-2d and ForeNet-3d are proposed. These models successfully forecast the RUL for seven multifaceted wind turbine (WT) failures with a 2-week forecast window. The most precise forecast deviated by only 10 minutes from the actual RUL, while the least accurate prediction deviated by 1.8 days, with most predictions being off by only a few hours. This methodology offers a substantial time frame to access remote WTs and perform necessary maintenance, thereby enabling the practical implementation of PdM.</description>

      <title>Ensemble Machine Learning Model for Inner Speech Recognition: A Subject-Specific Investigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inner speech recognition has gained enormous interest in recent years due to its applications in rehabilitation, developing assistive technology, and cognitive assessment. However, since language and speech productions are a complex process, for which identifying speech components has remained a challenging task. Different approaches were taken previously to reach this goal, but new approaches remain to be explored. Also, a subject-oriented analysis is necessary to understand the underlying brain dynamics during inner speech production, which can bring novel methods to neurological research. A publicly available dataset, Thinking Out Loud Dataset, has been used to develop a Machine Learning (ML)-based technique to classify inner speech using 128-channel surface EEG signals. The dataset is collected on a Spanish cohort of ten subjects while uttering four words (Arriba, Abajo, Derecha, and Izquierda) by each participant. Statistical methods were employed to detect and remove motion artifacts from the Electroencephalography (EEG) signals. A large number (191 per channel) of time-, frequency- and time-frequency-domain features were extracted. Eight feature selection algorithms are explored, and the best feature selection technique is selected for subsequent evaluations. The performance of six ML algorithms is evaluated, and an ensemble model is proposed. Deep Learning (DL) models are also explored, and the results are compared with the classical ML approach. The proposed ensemble model, by stacking the five best logistic regression models, generated an overall accuracy of 81.13% and an F1 score of 81.12% in the classification of four inner speech words using surface EEG signals. The proposed framework with the proposed ensemble of classical ML models shows promise in the classification of inner speech using surface EEG signals.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Machine and Deep Learning for Optical Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ever-growing complexity of optical communication systems and networks demands sophisticated methodologies to extract meaningful insights from vast amounts of heterogeneous data. Machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) have emerged as frontrunners in this domain, offering a transformative approach to data analysis and enabling automated self-configuration in optical communication systems. The adoption of ML and DL in optical communication is driven by the exponential increase in system and link complexity, stemming from the introduction of numerous adjustable and interdependent parameters. This is particularly evident in areas like coherent transceivers, advanced digital signal processing, optical performance monitoring, cross-layer network optimizations, and nonlinearity compensation. While the potential benefits of ML and DL are immense, the extent to which these methods can revolutionize optical communication remains largely unexplored. Additionally, many ML and DL algorithms have yet to be deployed in this field, highlighting the nascent nature of this research area.</description>

      <title>CPFI-EIT: A CNN-PINN Framework for Full-Inverse Electrical Impedance Tomography on Non-Smooth Conductivity Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a hybrid learning framework that combines convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to address the challenging problem of full-inverse electrical impedance tomography (EIT). EIT is a noninvasive imaging technique that reconstructs the spatial distribution of internal conductivity based on boundary voltage measurements from injected currents. This method has applications across medical imaging, multiphase flow detection, and tactile sensing. However, solving EIT involves a nonlinear partial differential equation (PDE) derived from Maxwell's equations, posing significant computational challenges as an ill-posed inverse problem. Existing PINN approaches primarily address semi-inverse EIT, assuming full access to internal potential data, which limits practical applications in realistic, full-inverse scenarios. Our framework employs a forward CNN-based supervised network to map differential boundary voltage measurements to a discrete potential distribution under fixed Neumann boundary conditions, while an inverse PINN-based unsupervised network enforces PDE constraints for conductivity reconstruction. Instead of traditional automatic differentiation, we introduce discrete numerical differentiation to bridge the forward and inverse networks, effectively decoupling them, enhancing modularity, and reducing computational demands. We validate our framework under realistic conditions, using a 16-electrode setup and rigorous testing on complex conductivity distributions with sharp boundaries, without Gaussian smoothing. This approach demonstrates robust flexibility and improved applicability in full-inverse EIT, establishing a practical solution for real-world imaging challenges.</description>

      <title>Predictive Modeling of Shading Effects on Photovoltaic Panels Using Regression Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Drones have become indispensable assets during human-made and natural disasters, offering damage assessment, aid delivery, and communication restoration capabilities. However, most drones rely on batteries that require frequent recharging, limiting their effectiveness in continuous missions. Photovoltaic (PV) powered drones are an ideal alternative. However, their performance degrades in variable lighting conditions. Hence, machine learning (ML) controlled PV cells present a promising solution for extending the endurance of a drone. This work evaluates five regression models, linear regression, lasso regression, ridge regression, random forest regression, and XGBoost regression, to predict shading percentages on PV panels. Accurate prediction of shading is crucial for improving the performance and efficiency of ML-controlled PV panels in varying conditions. By achieving a lower MSE and higher R2 Scores, XGBoost and random forest methods were the best-performing regression models. Notably, XGBoost showed superior performance with an R2 Score of 0.926. These findings highlight the possibility of utilizing the regression model to enhance PV-powered drones' efficiency, prolong flight time, reduce maintenance costs, and improve disaster response capabilities.</description>

      <title>Decoding individual words from non-invasive brain recordings across 723 participants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning has recently enabled the decoding of language from the neural activity of a few participants with electrodes implanted inside their brain. However, reliably decoding words from non-invasive recordings remains an open challenge. To tackle this issue, we introduce a novel deep learning pipeline to decode individual words from non-invasive electro- (EEG) and magneto-encephalography (MEG) signals. We train and evaluate our approach on an unprecedentedly large number of participants (723) exposed to five million words either written or spoken in English, French or Dutch. Our model outperforms existing methods consistently across participants, devices, languages, and tasks, and can decode words absent from the training set. Our analyses highlight the importance of the recording device and experimental protocol: MEG and reading are easier to decode than EEG and listening, respectively, and it is preferable to collect a large amount of data per participant than to repeat stimuli across a large number of participants. Furthermore, decoding performance consistently increases with the amount of (i) data used for training and (ii) data used for averaging during testing. Finally, single-word predictions show that our model effectively relies on word semantics but also captures syntactic and surface properties such as part-of-speech, word length and even individual letters, especially in the reading condition. Overall, our findings delineate the path and remaining challenges towards building non-invasive brain decoders for natural language.</description>

      <title>A Beginner's Guide to Power and Energy Measurement and Estimation for Computing and Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Concerns about the environmental footprint of machine learning are increasing. While studies of energy use and emissions of ML models are a growing subfield, most ML researchers and developers still do not incorporate energy measurement as part of their work practices. While measuring energy is a crucial step towards reducing carbon footprint, it is also not straightforward. This paper introduces the main considerations necessary for making sound use of energy measurement tools and interpreting energy estimates, including the use of at-the-wall versus on-device measurements, sampling strategies and best practices, common sources of error, and proxy measures. It also contains practical tips and real-world scenarios that illustrate how these considerations come into play. It concludes with a call to action for improving the state of the art of measurement methods and standards for facilitating robust comparisons between diverse hardware and software environments.</description>

      <title>High-resolution on-road air pollution exposure informed by taxi-based mobile monitoring sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Air pollutant exposure exhibits significant spatial and temporal variability, with localized hotspots, particularly in traffic microenvironments, posing health risks to commuters. Although widely used for air quality assessment, fixed-site monitoring stations are limited by sparse distribution, high costs, and maintenance needs, making them less effective in capturing on-road pollution levels. This study utilizes a fleet of 314 taxis equipped with sensors to measure NO\textsubscript{2}, PM\textsubscript{2.5}, and PM\textsubscript{10} concentrations and identify high-exposure hotspots. The findings reveal disparities between mobile and stationary measurements, map the spatiotemporal exposure patterns, and highlight local hotspots. These results demonstrate the potential of mobile monitoring to provide fine-scale, on-road air pollution assessments, offering valuable insights for policymakers to design targeted interventions and protect public health, particularly for sensitive populations.</description>

      <title>MANGO: Multimodal Acuity traNsformer for intelliGent ICU Outcomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimation of patient acuity in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) is vital to ensure timely and appropriate interventions. Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have significantly improved the accuracy of acuity predictions. However, prior studies using machine learning for acuity prediction have predominantly relied on electronic health records (EHR) data, often overlooking other critical aspects of ICU stay, such as patient mobility, environmental factors, and facial cues indicating pain or agitation. To address this gap, we present MANGO: the Multimodal Acuity traNsformer for intelliGent ICU Outcomes, designed to enhance the prediction of patient acuity states, transitions, and the need for life-sustaining therapy. We collected a multimodal dataset ICU-Multimodal, incorporating four key modalities, EHR data, wearable sensor data, video of patient's facial cues, and ambient sensor data, which we utilized to train MANGO. The MANGO model employs a multimodal feature fusion network powered by Transformer masked self-attention method, enabling it to capture and learn complex interactions across these diverse data modalities even when some modalities are absent. Our results demonstrated that integrating multiple modalities significantly improved the model's ability to predict acuity status, transitions, and the need for life-sustaining therapy. The best-performing models achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.76 (95% CI: 0.72-0.79) for predicting transitions in acuity status and the need for life-sustaining therapy, while 0.82 (95% CI: 0.69-0.89) for acuity status prediction...</description>

      <title>Transfer Learning with Active Sampling for Rapid Training and Calibration in BCI-P300 Across Health States and Multi-centre Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning and deep learning advancements have boosted Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) performance, but their wide-scale applicability is limited due to factors like individual health, hardware variations, and cultural differences affecting neural data. Studies often focus on uniform single-site experiments in uniform settings, leading to high performance that may not translate well to real-world diversity. Deep learning models aim to enhance BCI classification accuracy, and transfer learning has been suggested to adapt models to individual neural patterns using a base model trained on others' data. This approach promises better generalizability and reduced overfitting, yet challenges remain in handling diverse and imbalanced datasets from different equipment, subjects, multiple centres in different countries, and both healthy and patient populations for effective model transfer and tuning.
  In a setting characterized by maximal heterogeneity, we proposed P300 wave detection in BCIs employing a convolutional neural network fitted with adaptive transfer learning based on Poison Sampling Disk (PDS) called Active Sampling (AS), which flexibly adjusts the transition from source data to the target domain. Our results reported for subject adaptive with 40% of adaptive fine-tuning that the averaged classification accuracy improved by 5.36% and standard deviation reduced by 12.22% using two distinct, internationally replicated datasets. These results outperformed in classification accuracy, computational time, and training efficiency, mainly due to the proposed Active Sampling (AS) method for transfer learning.</description>

      <title>EEG-GMACN: Interpretable EEG Graph Mutual Attention Convolutional Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) is a valuable technique to record brain electrical activity through electrodes placed on the scalp. Analyzing EEG signals contributes to the understanding of neurological conditions and developing brain-computer interface. Graph Signal Processing (GSP) has emerged as a promising method for EEG spatial-temporal analysis, by further considering the topological relationships between electrodes. However, existing GSP studies lack interpretability of electrode importance and the credibility of prediction confidence. This work proposes an EEG Graph Mutual Attention Convolutional Network (EEG-GMACN), by introducing an 'Inverse Graph Weight Module' to output interpretable electrode graph weights, enhancing the clinical credibility and interpretability of EEG classification results. Additionally, we incorporate a mutual attention mechanism module into the model to improve its capability to distinguish critical electrodes and introduce credibility calibration to assess the uncertainty of prediction results. This study enhances the transparency and effectiveness of EEG analysis, paving the way for its widespread use in clinical and neuroscience research.</description>

      <title>SCFNet:A Transferable IIIC EEG Classification Network</title>

Abstract: Epilepsy and epileptiform discharges are common harmful brain activities, and electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are widely used to monitor the onset status of patients. However, due to the lack of unified EEG signal acquisition standards, there are many obstacles in practical applications, especially the difficulty in transferring and using models trained on different numbers of channels. To address this issue, we proposes a neural network architecture with a single-channel feature extraction (Singal Channel Feature) model backend fusion (SCFNet). The feature extractor of the model is an RCNN network with single-channel input, which does not depend on other channels, thereby enabling easier migration to data with different numbers of channels. Experimental results show that on the IIIC-Seizure dataset, the accuracy of EEG-SCFNet has improved by 4% compared to the baseline model and also increased by 1.3% compared to the original RCNN neural network model. Even with only fine-tuning the classification head, its performance can still maintain a level comparable to the baseline. In addition, in terms of cross-dataset transfer, EEG-SCFNet can still maintain certain performance even if the channel leads are different.</description>

      <title>Constraint-Based Model in Multimodal Learning to Improve Ventricular Arrhythmia Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cardiac disease evaluation depends on multiple diagnostic modalities: electrocardiogram (ECG) to diagnose abnormal heart rhythms, and imaging modalities such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Computed Tomography (CT) and echocardiography to detect signs of structural abnormalities. Each of these modalities brings complementary information for a better diagnosis of cardiac dysfunction. However, training a machine learning (ML) model with data from multiple modalities is a challenging task, as it increases the dimension space, while keeping constant the number of samples. In fact, as the dimension of the input space increases, the volume of data required for accurate generalisation grows exponentially. In this work, we address this issue, for the application of Ventricular Arrhythmia (VA) prediction, based on the combined clinical and CT imaging features, where we constrained the learning process on medical images (CT) based on the prior knowledge acquired from clinical data. The VA classifier is fed with features extracted from a 3D myocardium thickness map (TM) of the left ventricle. The TM is generated by our pipeline from the imaging input and a Graph Convolutional Network is used as the feature extractor of the 3D TM. We introduce a novel Sequential Fusion method and evaluate its performance against traditional Early Fusion techniques and single-modality models. The crossvalidation results show that the Sequential Fusion model achieved the highest average scores of 80.7% $\pm$ 4.4 Sensitivity and 73.1% $\pm$ 6.0 F1 score, outperforming the Early Fusion model at 65.0% $\pm$ 8.9 Sensitivity and 63.1% $\pm$ 6.3 F1 score. Both fusion models achieved better scores than the single-modality models, where the average Sensitivity and F1 score are 62.8% $\pm$ 10.1; 52.1% $\pm$ 6.5 for the clinical data modality and 62.9% $\pm$ 6.3; 60.7% $\pm$ 5.3 for the medical images modality.</description>

      <title>Cross-Species and Cross-Modality Epileptic Seizure Detection via Multi-Space Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Epilepsy significantly impacts global health, affecting about 65 million people worldwide, along with various animal species. The diagnostic processes of epilepsy are often hindered by the transient and unpredictable nature of seizures. Here we propose a multi-space alignment approach based on cross-species and cross-modality electroencephalogram (EEG) data to enhance the detection capabilities and understanding of epileptic seizures. By employing deep learning techniques, including domain adaptation and knowledge distillation, our framework aligns cross-species and cross-modality EEG signals to enhance the detection capability beyond traditional within-species and with-modality models. Experiments on multiple surface and intracranial EEG datasets of humans and canines demonstrated substantial improvements in the detection accuracy, achieving over 90% AUC scores for cross-species and cross-modality seizure detection with extremely limited labeled data from the target species/modality. To our knowledge, this is the first study that demonstrates the effectiveness of integrating heterogeneous data from different species and modalities to improve EEG-based seizure detection performance. The approach may also be generalizable to different brain-computer interface paradigms, and suggests the possibility to combine data from different species/modalities to increase the amount of training data for large EEG models.</description>

      <title>Zero-Shot Generalization for Blockage Localization in mmWave Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel method for predicting blockages in millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication systems towards enabling reliable connectivity. It employs a self-supervised learning approach to label radio frequency (RF) data with the locations of blockage-causing objects extracted from light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data, which is then used to train a deep learning model that predicts object`s location only using RF data. Then, the predicted location is utilized to predict blockages, enabling adaptability without retraining when transmitter-receiver positions change. Evaluations demonstrate up to 74% accuracy in predicting blockage locations in dynamic environments, showcasing the robustness of the proposed solution.</description>

      <title>Polymer/paper-based double touch mode capacitive pressure sensing element for wireless control of robotic arm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, a large area, low cost and flexible polymer/paper-based double touch mode capacitive pressure sensor is demonstrated. Garage fabrication processes are used which only require cutting, taping and assembly of aluminum (Al) coated polyimide (PI) foil, PI tape and double-sided scotch tape. The presented pressure sensor operates in different pressure regions i.e. normal (0 to 7.5 kPa), transition (7.5 to 14.24 kPa), linear (14.24 to 54.9 kPa) and saturation (above 54.9 kPa). The advantages of the demonstrated double touch mode capacitive pressure sensors are low temperature drift, long linear range, high pressure sensitivity, precise pressure measurement and large die area. The linear output along with a high sensitivity range (14.24 to 54.9 kPa pressure range) of the sensor are utilized to wirelessly control the movement of a robotic arm with precise rotation and tilt movement capabilities.</description>

      <title>Parkinson Disease Detection Based on In-air Dynamics Feature Extraction and Selection Using Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurological disorder that impairs movement control, leading to symptoms such as tremors, stiffness, and bradykinesia. Many researchers analyzing handwriting data for PD detection typically rely on computing statistical features over the entirety of the handwriting task. While this method can capture broad patterns, it has several limitations, including a lack of focus on dynamic change, oversimplified feature representation, lack of directional information, and missing micro-movements or subtle variations. Consequently, these systems face challenges in achieving good performance accuracy, robustness, and sensitivity. To overcome this problem, we proposed an optimized PD detection methodology that incorporates newly developed dynamic kinematic features and machine learning (ML)-based techniques to capture movement dynamics during handwriting tasks. In the procedure, we first extracted 65 newly developed kinematic features from the first and last 10% phases of the handwriting task rather than using the entire task. Alongside this, we also reused 23 existing kinematic features, resulting in a comprehensive new feature set. Next, we enhanced the kinematic features by applying statistical formulas to compute hierarchical features from the handwriting data. This approach allows us to capture subtle movement variations that distinguish PD patients from healthy controls. To further optimize the feature set, we applied the Sequential Forward Floating Selection method to select the most relevant features, reducing dimensionality and computational complexity. Finally, we employed an ML-based approach based on ensemble voting across top-performing tasks, achieving an impressive 96.99\% accuracy on task-wise classification and 99.98% accuracy on task ensembles, surpassing the existing state-of-the-art model by 2% for the PaHaW dataset.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extracting signals from noisy backgrounds is a fundamental problem in signal processing across a variety of domains. In this paper, we introduce Noisereduce, an algorithm for minimizing noise across a variety of domains, including speech, bioacoustics, neurophysiology, and seismology. Noisereduce uses spectral gating to estimate a frequency-domain mask that effectively separates signals from noise. It is fast, lightweight, requires no training data, and handles both stationary and non-stationary noise, making it both a versatile tool and a convenient baseline for comparison with domain-specific applications. We provide a detailed overview of Noisereduce and evaluate its performance on a variety of time-domain signals.</description>

      <title>Compact Neural Network Algorithm for Electrocardiogram Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a high-performance, compact electrocardiogram (ECG)-based system for automatic classification of arrhythmias, integrating machine learning approaches to achieve robust cardiac diagnostics. Our method combines a compact artificial neural network with feature enhancement techniques, including mathematical transformations, signal analysis and data extraction algorithms, to capture both morphological and time-frequency features from ECG signals. A novel aspect of this work is the addition of 17 newly engineered features, which complement the algorithm's capability to extract significant data and physiological patterns from the ECG signal. This combination enables the classifier to detect multiple arrhythmia types, such as atrial fibrillation, sinus tachycardia, ventricular flutter, and other common arrhythmic disorders. The system achieves an accuracy of 97.36% on the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database, using a lower complexity compared to state-of-the-art models. This compact tool shows potential for clinical deployment, as well as adaptation for portable devices in long-term cardiac health monitoring applications.</description>

      <title>EnhancePPG: Improving PPG-based Heart Rate Estimation with Self-Supervision and Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heart rate (HR) estimation from photoplethysmography (PPG) signals is a key feature of modern wearable devices for health and wellness monitoring. While deep learning models show promise, their performance relies on the availability of large datasets. We present EnhancePPG, a method that enhances state-of-the-art models by integrating self-supervised learning with data augmentation (DA). Our approach combines self-supervised pre-training with DA, allowing the model to learn more generalizable features, without needing more labelled data. Inspired by a U-Net-like autoencoder architecture, we utilize unsupervised PPG signal reconstruction, taking advantage of large amounts of unlabeled data during the pre-training phase combined with data augmentation, to improve state-of-the-art models' performance. Thanks to our approach and minimal modification to the state-of-the-art model, we improve the best HR estimation by 12.2%, lowering from 4.03 Beats-Per-Minute (BPM) to 3.54 BPM the error on PPG-DaLiA. Importantly, our EnhancePPG approach focuses exclusively on the training of the selected deep learning model, without significantly increasing its inference latency</description>

      <title>An Ultra-Wideband Study of Vegetation Impact on Upper Midband / FR3 Communication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Growing demand for high data rates is driving interest in the upper mid-band (FR 3) spectrum (6-24 GHz). While some propagation measurements exist in literature, the impact of vegetation on link performance remains under-explored. This study examines vegetation-induced losses in an urban scenario across 6-18 GHz. A simple method for calculating vegetation depth is introduced, along with a model that quantifies additional attenuation based on vegetation depth and frequency, divided into 1 GHz sub-bands. We see that excess vegetation loss increases with vegetation depth and higher frequencies. These findings provide insights for designing reliable, foliage-aware communication networks in FR 3.</description>

      <title>Underwater Acoustic Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces: from Principle to Practice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article explores the potential of underwater acoustic reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (UA-RIS) for facilitating long-range and eco-friendly communication in marine environments. Unlike radio frequency-based RIS (RF-RIS), which have been extensively investigated in terrestrial contexts, UA-RIS is an emerging field of study. The distinct characteristics of acoustic waves, including their slow propagation speed and potential for noise pollution affecting marine life, necessitate a fundamentally different approach to the architecture and design principles of UA-RIS compared to RF-RIS. Currently, there is a scarcity of real systems and experimental data to validate the feasibility of UA-RIS in practical applications. To fill this gap, this article presents field tests conducted with a prototype UA-RIS consisting of 24 acoustic elements. The results demonstrate that the developed prototype can effectively reflect acoustic waves to any specified directions through passive beamforming, thereby substantially extending the range and data rate of underwater communication systems.</description>

      <title>Antenna Health-Aware Selective Beamforming for Hardware-Constrained DFRC Systems I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the optimization challenges in dual-functional radar-communication (DFRC) systems with a focus on array selection and beamforming in dynamic and heterogeneous operational contexts. We propose a novel array selection criterion that integrates antenna health information into the optimization process, distinguishing our approach from traditional methods. Our methodology employs gradient dual ascent and dual proximal-gradient ascent for tackling the constrained non-convex and non-smooth nature of sparse array selection problems. A key feature of our strategy is the implementation of proportional fairness among communication users, which aligns with system resource limitations while meeting the minimum rate requirements for all users. This facet of our method not only enhances system efficiency and responsiveness but also ensures a fair distribution of resources. Through extensive simulations, the efficacy of the proposed solutions in optimizing DFRC system performance is validated, illustrating their applicability in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) scenarios. Our findings contribute to the evolving field of DFRC systems, offering new perspectives and solutions for the challenges in array selection and beamforming optimisation.</description>

      <title>Antenna Health-Aware Selective Beamforming for Hardware-Constrained DFRC Systems II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces an innovative beamforming design approach that incorporates the reliability of antenna array elements into the optimization process, termed "antenna health-aware selective beamforming". This method strategically focuses transmission power on more reliable antenna elements, thus enhancing system resilience and operational integrity. By integrating antenna health information and individual power constraints, our research leverages advanced optimization techniques such as the Group Proximal-Gradient Dual Ascent (GPGDA) to efficiently address nonconvex challenges in sparse array selection. Applying the proposed technique to a Dual-Functional Radar-Communication (DFRC) system, our findings highlight that increasing the sparsity promotion weight ($\rho_s$) generally boosts spectral efficiency and communication data rate, achieving perfect system reliability at higher $\rho_s$ values but also revealing a performance threshold beyond which further sparsity is detrimental. This underscores the importance of balanced sparsity in beamforming for optimizing performance, particularly in critical communication and defense applications where uninterrupted operation is crucial. Additionally, our analysis of the time complexity and power consumption associated with GPGDA underscores the need for optimizing computational resources in practical implementations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The design of large complex wave systems (filters, networks, vacuum-electronic devices, metamaterials, smart radio environments, etc.) requires repeated evaluations of the scattering parameters resulting from complex connections between constituent subsystems. Instead of starting each new evaluation from scratch, we propose a computationally efficient method that updates the outcomes of previous evaluations using the Woodbury matrix identity. To enable this method, we begin by identifying a closed-form approach capable of evaluating arbitrarily complex connection schemes of multi-port networks. We pedagogically present unified equivalence principles for interpretations of system connections, as well as techniques to reduce the computational burden of the closed-form approach using these equivalence principles. Along the way, we also achieve the closed-form retrieval of the power waves traveling through connected ports. We illustrate our techniques considering a complex meta-network involving serial, parallel and cyclic connections between multi-port subsystems. We further validate all results with physics-compliant calculations considering graph-based subsystems, and we conduct exhaustive statistical analyses of computational benefits originating from the reducibility and updatability enabled by our approach. Finally, we find that working with scattering parameters (as opposed to impedance or admittance parameters) presents a fundamental advantage regarding an important class of connection schemes whose closed-form analysis requires the treatment of some connections as delayless, lossless, reflectionless and reciprocal two-port scattering systems. We expect our results to benefit the design (and characterization) of large composite (reconfigurable) wave systems.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Signal Analysis for Automated Subsurface Defect Detection Using Impact Echo in Concrete Slabs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This pilot study presents a novel, automated, and scalable methodology for detecting and evaluating subsurface defect-prone regions in concrete slabs using Impact Echo (IE) signal analysis. The approach integrates advanced signal processing, clustering, and visual analytics to identify subsurface anomalies. A unique adaptive thresholding method tailors frequency-based defect identification to the distinct material properties of each slab. The methodology generates frequency maps, binary masks, and k-means cluster maps to automatically classify defect and non-defect regions. Key visualizations, including 3D surface plots, cluster maps, and contour plots, are employed to analyze spatial frequency distributions and highlight structural anomalies. The study utilizes a labeled dataset constructed at the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) Advanced Sensing Technology Nondestructive Evaluation Laboratory. Evaluations involve ground-truth masking, comparing the generated defect maps with top-view binary masks derived from the information provided by the FHWA. The performance metrics, specifically F1-scores and AUC-ROC, achieve values of up to 0.95 and 0.83, respectively. The results demonstrate the robustness of the methodology, consistently identifying defect-prone areas with minimal false positives and few missed defects. Adaptive frequency thresholding ensures flexibility in addressing variations across slabs, providing a scalable framework for detecting structural anomalies. Additionally, the methodology is adaptable to other frequency-based signals due to its generalizable thresholding mechanism and holds potential for integrating multimodal sensor fusion. This automated and scalable pipeline minimizes manual intervention, ensuring accurate and efficient defect detection, further advancing Non-Destructive Evaluation (NDE) techniques.</description>

      <title>PowerRadio: Manipulate Sensor Measurementvia Power GND Radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sensors are key components enabling various applications, e.g., home intrusion detection and environmental monitoring. While various software defenses and physical protections are used to prevent sensor manipulation, this paper introduces a new threat vector, PowerRadio, that bypasses existing protections and changes sensor readings from a distance. PowerRadio leverages interconnected ground (GND) wires, a standard practice for electrical safety at home, to inject malicious signals. The injected signal is coupled by the sensor's analog measurement wire and eventually survives the noise filters, inducing incorrect measurement. We present three methods to manipulate sensors by inducing static bias, periodical signals, or pulses. For instance, we show adding stripes into the captured images of a surveillance camera or injecting inaudible voice commands into conference microphones. We study the underlying principles of PowerRadio and identify its root causes: (1) the lack of shielding between ground and data signal wires and (2) the asymmetry of circuit impedance that enables interference to bypass filtering. We validate PowerRadio against a surveillance system, broadcast systems, and various sensors. We believe that PowerRadio represents an emerging threat, exhibiting the advantages of both radiated and conducted EMI, e.g., expanding the effective attack distance of radiated EMI yet eliminating the requirement of line-of-sight or approaching physically. Our insights shall provide guidance for enhancing the sensors' security and power wiring during the design phases.</description>

      <title>FOGNA: An effective Sum-Difference Co-Array Design Based on Fourth-Order Cumulants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Array structures based on the fourth-order difference co-array (FODCA) provide more degrees of freedom (DOF). However, since the growth of DOF is limited by a single case of fourth-order cumulant in FODCA, this paper aims to design a sparse linear array (SLA) with higher DOF via exploring different cases of fourth-order cumulants. This paper presents a mathematical framework based on fourth-order cumulant to devise a fourth-order extend co-array (FOECA), which is equivalent to FODCA. A novel SLA, namely fourth-order generalized nested array (FOGNA), is proposed based on FOECA to provide closed-form expressions for the sensor locations and enhance DOF to resolve more signal sources in direction of arrival (DOA) estimation. FOGNA is consisted of three subarrays, where the first is a concatenated nested array and the other two subarrays are SLA with big inter-spacing between sensors. When the total physical sensors of FOGNA are given, the number of sensors in each subarray is determined by the designed method, which can obtain the maximum DOF under the proposed array structure and derive closed-form expressions for the sensor locations of FOGNA. The proposed array structure not only achieves higher DOF than those of existing FODCAs but also reduces mutual coupling effects. Numerical simulations are conducted to verify the superiority of FOGNA on DOA estimation performance and enhanced DOF over other existing FODCAs.</description>

      <title>Computation-and-Communication Efficient Coordinated Multicast Beamforming in Massive MIMO Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main challenges in designing downlink coordinated multicast beamforming in massive multiple-input multiple output (MIMO) cellular networks are the complex computational solutions and significant fronthaul overhead for centralized coordination. This paper proposes a coordinated multicast beamforming solution that is both computation and communication efficient. For joint BS coordination with individual base station transmit power budgets, we first obtain the optimal structure of coordinated multicast beamforming. It reveals that the beamformer at each BS is naturally distributed and only depends on the local channel state information (CSI) at its serving BS. Moreover, the optimal beamformer is a weighted minimum mean square error (MMSE) beamformer with a low-dimensional structure of unknown weights to be optimized, independent of the number of BS antennas. Utilizing the optimal structural properties, we propose fast algorithms to determine the unknown parameters for the optimal beamformer. The main iterative algorithm decomposes the problem into small subproblems, yielding only closed/semi-closed form updates. Furthermore, we propose a semi-distributed computing approach for the proposed algorithm that allows each BS to compute its beamformer based on the local CSI without the need of global CSI sharing, resulting in the fronthaul overhead independent of the number of BS antennas. We further extend our results to the design under the imperfect CSI and other coordination scenarios. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed methods can achieve near-optimal performance with significantly lower computational time for massive MIMO systems than the conventional approaches.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Learning Approach for Beamforming in Cell-Free Integrated Sensing and Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cell-free massive multiple input multiple output (MIMO) systems can provide reliable connectivity and increase user throughput and spectral efficiency of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. This can only be achieved through intelligent beamforming design. While many works have proposed optimization methods to design beamformers for cell-free systems, the underlying algorithms are computationally complex and potentially increase fronthaul link loads. To address this concern, we propose an unsupervised learning algorithm to jointly design the communication and sensing beamformers for cell-free ISAC system. Specifically, we adopt a teacher-student training model to guarantee a balanced maximization of sensing signal to noise ratio (SSNR) and signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR), which represent the sensing and communication metrics, respectively. The proposed scheme is decentralized, which can reduce the load on the central processing unit (CPU) and the required fronthaul links. To avoid the tradeoff problem between sensing and communication counterparts of the cell-free system, we first train two identical models (teacher models) each biased towards one of the two tasks. A third identical model (a student model) is trained based on the maximum sensing and communication performance information obtained by the teacher models. While the results show that our proposed unsupervised DL approach yields a performance close to the state-of-the-art solution, the proposed approach is more computationally efficient than the state of the art by at least three orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Towards Fault Diagnosis in Induction Motor using Fractional Fourier Transform</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A method for determining the current signature faults using Fractional Fourier Transform (FrFT) has been developed. The method has been applied to the real-time steady-state current of the inverter-fed high power induction motor for fault determination. The method incorporates calculating the relative norm error to find the threshold value between healthy and unhealthy induction motor at different operating frequencies. The experimental results demonstrate that the total harmonics distortion of unhealthy motor is much larger than the healthy motor, and the threshold relative norm error value of different healthy induction motors is less than 0.3, and the threshold relative norm error value of unhealthy induction motor is greater than 0.5. The developed method can function as a simple operator-assisted tool for determining induction motor faults in real-time.</description>

      <title>An Improved Fault Diagnosis Strategy for Induction Motors Using Weighted Probability Ensemble Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Early detection of faults in induction motors is crucial for ensuring uninterrupted operations in industrial settings. Among the various fault types encountered in induction motors, bearing, rotor, and stator faults are the most prevalent. This paper introduces a Weighted Probability Ensemble Deep Learning (WPEDL) methodology, tailored for effectively diagnosing induction motor faults using high-dimensional data extracted from vibration and current features. The Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) is employed to extract features from both vibration and current signals. The performance of the WPEDL fault diagnosis method is compared against conventional deep learning models, demonstrating the superior efficacy of the proposed system. The multi-class fault diagnosis system based on WPEDL achieves high accuracies across different fault types: 99.05% for bearing (vibrational signal), 99.10%, and 99.50% for rotor (current and vibration signal), and 99.60%, and 99.52% for stator faults (current and vibration signal) respectively. To evaluate the robustness of our multi-class classification decisions, tests have been conducted on a combined dataset of 52,000 STFT images encompassing all three faults. Our proposed model outperforms other models, achieving an accuracy of 98.89%. The findings underscore the effectiveness and reliability of the WPEDL approach for early-stage fault diagnosis in IMs, offering promising insights for enhancing industrial operational efficiency and reliability.</description>

      <title>Achieving Robustness in Blind Modulo Analog-to-Digital Conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The need to digitize signals with intricate spectral characteristics often challenges traditional analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). The recently proposed modulo-ADC architecture offers a promising alternative by leveraging inherent features of the input signals. This approach can dramatically reduce the number of bits required for the conversion while maintaining the desired fidelity. However, the core algorithm of this architecture, which utilizes a prediction filter, functions properly only when the respective prediction error is bounded. In practice, this assumption may not always hold, leading to considerable instability and performance degradation. To address this limitation, we propose an enhanced modulo-unfolding solution without this assumption. We develop a reliable detector to successfully unfold the signals, yielding a robust solution. Consequently, the reinforced system maintains proper operation in scenarios where the original approach fails, while also reducing the quantization noise. We present simulation results that demonstrate the superior performance of our approach in a representative setting.</description>

      <title>Extremum Encoding for Joint Baseband Signal Compression and Time-Delay Estimation for Distributed Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ubiquitous time-delay estimation (TDE) problem becomes nontrivial when sensors are non-co-located and communication between them is limited. Building on the recently proposed "extremum encoding" compression-estimation scheme, we address the critical extension to complex-valued signals, suitable for radio-frequency (RF) baseband processing. This extension introduces new challenges, e.g., due to unknown phase of the signal of interest and random phase of the noise, rendering a na\"ive application of the original scheme inapplicable and irrelevant. In the face of these challenges, we propose a judiciously adapted, though natural, extension of the scheme, paving its way to RF applications. While our extension leads to a different statistical analysis, including extremes of non-Gaussian distributions, we show that, ultimately, its asymptotic behavior is akin to the original scheme. We derive an exponentially tight upper bound on its error probability, corroborate our results via simulation experiments, and demonstrate the superior performance compared to two benchmark approaches.</description>

      <title>Joint Adaptive OFDM and Reinforcement Learning Design for Autonomous Vehicles: Leveraging Age of Updates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Millimeter wave (mmWave)-based orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) stands out as a suitable alternative for high-resolution sensing and high-speed data transmission. To meet communication and sensing requirements, many works propose a static configuration where the wave's hyperparameters such as the number of symbols in a frame and the number of frames in a communication slot are already predefined. However, two facts oblige us to redefine the problem, (1) the environment is often dynamic and uncertain, and (2) mmWave is severely impacted by wireless environments. A striking example where this challenge is very prominent is autonomous vehicle (AV). Such a system leverages integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) using mmWave to manage data transmission and the dynamism of the environment. In this work, we consider an autonomous vehicle network where an AV utilizes its queue state information (QSI) and channel state information (CSI) in conjunction with reinforcement learning techniques to manage communication and sensing. This enables the AV to achieve two primary objectives: establishing a stable communication link with other AVs and accurately estimating the velocities of surrounding objects with high resolution. The communication performance is therefore evaluated based on the queue state, the effective data rate, and the discarded packets rate. In contrast, the effectiveness of the sensing is assessed using the velocity resolution. In addition, we exploit adaptive OFDM techniques for dynamic modulation, and we suggest a reward function that leverages the age of updates to handle the communication buffer and improve sensing. The system is validated using advantage actor-critic (A2C) and proximal policy optimization (PPO). Furthermore, we compare our solution with the existing design and demonstrate its superior performance by computer simulations.</description>

      <title>Hilbert Transform on Graphs: Let There Be Phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the past years, many signal processing operations have been successfully adapted to the graph setting. One elegant and effective approach is to exploit the eigendecomposition of a graph shift operator (GSO), such as the adjacency or Laplacian operator, to define a graph Fourier transform when projecting graph signals on the corresponding basis. However, the extension of this scheme to directed graphs is challenging since the associated GSO is non-symmetric and, in general, not diagonalizable. Here, we build upon a recent framework that adds a minimal number of edges to allow diagonalization of the GSO and thus provide a proper graph Fourier transform. We then propose a generalization of the Hilbert transform that leads to a number of simple and elegant recipes to effectively exploit the phase information of graph signals provided by the graph Fourier transform. The feasibility of the approach is demonstrated on several examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Capacitive pressure sensors have several advantages in areas such as robotics, automation, aerospace, biomedical and consumer electronics. We present mathematical modelling, finite element analysis (FEA), fabrication and experimental characterization of ultra-low cost and paper-based, touch-mode, flexible capacitive pressure sensor element using Do-It-Yourself (DIY) technology. The pressure sensing element is utilized to design large-area electronics skin for low-cost prosthetic hands. The presented sensor is characterized in normal, transition, touch and saturation modes. The sensor has higher sensitivity and linearity in touch mode operation from 10 to 40 kPa of applied pressure compared to the normal (0 to 8 kPa), transition (8 to 10 kPa) and saturation mode (after 40 kPa) with response time of 15.85 ms. Advantages of the presented sensor are higher sensitivity, linear response, less diaphragm area, less von Mises stress at the clamped edges region, low temperature drift, robust structure and less separation gap for large pressure measurement compared to normal mode capacitive pressure sensors. The linear range of pressure change is utilized for controlling the position of a servo motor for precise movement in robotic arm using wireless communication, which can be utilized for designing skin-like structure for low-cost prosthetic hands.</description>

      <title>UAV Communications: Impact of Obstacles on Channel Characteristics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have been utilized as effective platforms for carrying Wi-Fi Access Points (APs) and cellular Base Stations (BSs), enabling low-cost, agile, and flexible wireless networks with high Quality of Service (QoS). The next generation of wireless communications will rely on increasingly higher frequencies, which are easily obstructed by obstacles. One of the most critical concepts yet to be fully addressed is positioning the UAV at optimal coordinates while accounting for obstacles. To ensure a line of sight (LoS) between UAVs and user equipment (UE), improve QoS, and establish reliable wireless links with maximum coverage, obstacles must be integrated into the proposed placement algorithms. This paper introduces a simulation-based measurement approach for characterizing an air-to-ground (AG) channel in a simple scenario. By considering obstacles, we present a novel perspective on channel characterization. The results, in terms of throughput, packet delivery, packet loss, and delay, are compared using the proposed positioning approach.</description>

      <title>Text-Aware Adapter for Few-Shot Keyword Spotting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in flexible keyword spotting (KWS) with text enrollment allow users to personalize keywords without uttering them during enrollment. However, there is still room for improvement in target keyword performance. In this work, we propose a novel few-shot transfer learning method, called text-aware adapter (TA-adapter), designed to enhance a pre-trained flexible KWS model for specific keywords with limited speech samples. To adapt the acoustic encoder, we leverage a jointly pre-trained text encoder to generate a text embedding that acts as a representative vector for the keyword. By fine-tuning only a small portion of the network while keeping the core components' weights intact, the TA-adapter proves highly efficient for few-shot KWS, enabling a seamless return to the original pre-trained model. In our experiments, the TA-adapter demonstrated significant performance improvements across 35 distinct keywords from the Google Speech Commands V2 dataset, with only a 0.14% increase in the total number of parameters.</description>

      <title>Performance Optimizations and Evaluations for the Small Direct Currents Measurement System</title>

Abstract: Ionization chambers are essential for activity determinations in radionuclide metrology. We have developed a high-precision integrating-differentiating (int-diff) system for measuring small currents. It is anticipated to enhance the ionization current measurement capability of the 4$\pi\gamma$ ionization chamber radioactivity standard at the National Institute of Metrology (NIM), China. Besides, it has broad application prospects in physical experiments and fundamental metrology. The design of the measurement system is optimized through circuit analysis and simulation. The structure of the integrating capacitor array is redesigned to reduce the error of the amplification gain, and a relay is used as the reset switch to achieve improved noise and bias. The digital readout and control module is also enhanced in terms of flexibility and functionality. High-precision test platforms utilizing the standard small current source at NIM China and an ionization chamber were developed to evaluate the performance of the system. The results demonstrate an ultra-low noise floor &lt;1 fA/$\surd$Hz and a low current bias &lt;1 fA, as well as a low temperature coefficient of the amplification gain of 2.1 ppm/{\textdegree}C. The short-term stability and linearity of the gain are also tested and exhibit comparable indicators to those of the Keithley 6430. Reasonable results are obtained in the long-term reproducibility test. Therefore, the system enables high-precision measurements for small direct currents and shows promise for applications in ionization chambers.</description>

      <title>GDM4MMIMO: Generative Diffusion Models for Massive MIMO Communications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) offers significant advantages in spectral and energy efficiencies, positioning it as a cornerstone technology of fifth-generation (5G) wireless communication systems and a promising solution for the burgeoning data demands anticipated in sixth-generation (6G) networks. In recent years, with the continuous advancement of artificial intelligence (AI), a multitude of task-oriented generative foundation models (GFMs) have emerged, achieving remarkable performance in various fields such as computer vision (CV), natural language processing (NLP), and autonomous driving. As a pioneering force, these models are driving the paradigm shift in AI towards generative AI (GenAI). Among them, the generative diffusion model (GDM), as one of state-of-the-art families of generative models, demonstrates an exceptional capability to learn implicit prior knowledge and robust generalization capabilities, thereby enhancing its versatility and effectiveness across diverse applications. In this paper, we delve into the potential applications of GDM in massive MIMO communications. Specifically, we first provide an overview of massive MIMO communication, the framework of GFMs, and the working mechanism of GDM. Following this, we discuss recent research advancements in the field and present a case study of near-field channel estimation based on GDM, demonstrating its promising potential for facilitating efficient ultra-dimensional channel statement information (CSI) acquisition in the context of massive MIMO communications. Finally, we highlight several pressing challenges in future mobile communications and identify promising research directions surrounding GDM.</description>

      <title>Signal Constellation Construction via Radio Frequency Mirrors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By integrating feedback with Radio Frequency (RF) mirrors, we develop a closed-loop media-based modulation system for efficient utilization of the signal space. Specifically, this closed-loop construction optimizes the inherited signal constellation from the media, achieving a significantly larger minimum pairwise Euclidean distance than the original configuration. The initial signal constellation, derived from the media, is used to compute a set of complex weights for all activation patterns of the RF mirrors. These complex weights are then fed back to the transmitter to refine the transmit signal before it reaches the mirrors. This feedback mechanism ensures that the received, shaped signal constellation retains improved properties, enabling more reliable transmission. Notably, the closed-loop approach enables the media-based modulation to approach the performance of an AWGN channel, while the channel from each mirror to the single-antenna receiver is modeled as Rayleigh fading.</description>

      <title>A Zero-Shot Physics-Informed Dictionary Learning Approach for Sound Field Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sound field reconstruction aims to estimate pressure fields in areas lacking direct measurements. Existing techniques often rely on strong assumptions or face challenges related to data availability or the explicit modeling of physical properties. To bridge these gaps, this study introduces a zero-shot, physics-informed dictionary learning approach to perform sound field reconstruction. Our method relies only on a few sparse measurements to learn a dictionary, without the need for additional training data. Moreover, by enforcing the Helmholtz equation during the optimization process, the proposed approach ensures that the reconstructed sound field is represented as a linear combination of a few physically meaningful atoms. Evaluations on real-world data show that our approach achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art dictionary learning techniques, with the advantage of requiring only a few observations of the sound field and no training on a dataset.</description>

      <title>Clutter Resilient Occlusion Avoidance for Tightly-Coupled Motion-Assisted Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Occlusion is a key factor leading to detection failures. This paper proposes a motion-assisted detection (MAD) method that actively plans an executable path, for the robot to observe the target at a new viewpoint with potentially reduced occlusion. In contrast to existing MAD approaches that may fail in cluttered environments, the proposed framework is robust in such scenarios, therefore termed clutter resilient occlusion avoidance (CROA). The crux to CROA is to minimize the occlusion probability under polyhedron-based collision avoidance constraints via the convex-concave procedure and duality-based bilevel optimization. The system implementation supports lidar-based MAD with intertwined execution of learning-based detection and optimization-based planning. Experiments show that CROA outperforms various MAD schemes under a sparse convolutional neural network detector, in terms of point density, occlusion ratio, and detection error, in a multi-lane urban driving scenario.</description>

      <title>GeXSe (Generative Explanatory Sensor System): An Interpretable Deep Generative Model for Human Activity Recognition in Smart Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.15857v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce GeXSe (Generative Explanatory Sensor System), a novel framework designed to extract interpretable sensor-based and vision domain features from non-invasive smart space sensors. We combine these to provide a comprehensive explanation of sensor-activation patterns in activity recognition tasks. This system leverages advanced machine learning architectures, including transformer blocks, Fast Fourier Convolution (FFC), and diffusion models, to provide a more detailed understanding of sensor-based human activity data. A standout feature of GeXSe is our unique Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) with linear, ReLU, and normalization layers, specially devised for optimal performance on small datasets. It also yields meaningful activation maps to explain sensor-based activation patterns. The standard approach is based on a CNN model, which our MLP model outperforms.GeXSe offers two types of explanations: sensor-based activation maps and visual domain explanations using short videos. These methods offer a comprehensive interpretation of the output from non-interpretable sensor data, thereby augmenting the interpretability of our model. Utilizing the Frechet Inception Distance (FID) for evaluation, it outperforms established methods, improving baseline performance by about 6\%. GeXSe also achieves a high F1 score of up to 0.85, demonstrating precision, recall, and noise resistance, marking significant progress in reliable and explainable smart space sensing systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09012v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the uplink of a hardware-impaired intelligent reflective surfaces (IRS) aided multi-cell massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) system with mobile user equipments, whose channel age with time. For this system, we analyze the distortion due to hardware impairments, and the effect of channel aging, and propose a novel distortion-and-aging-aware MMSE (DAA-MMSE) receiver that not only provides a higher spectral efficiency (SE) than conventional maximal ratio and distortion-unaware MMSE (DU-MMSE) receivers, but also reduces the pilot overhead. By considering non-ideal hardware and spatially-correlated Rician fading channels with phase shifts, we also derive the SE lower bound for this system. We show that the SE gain of the DAA-MMSE receiver over DU-MMSE receiver increases with hardware impairments, and channel aging. Along with DAA-MMSE receiver, the IRS is also shown to reduce the pilot overhead in a mMIMO system with channel aging.</description>

      <title>Joint Source-Channel Optimization for UAV Video Coding and Transmission</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06667v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) video coding and transmission in scenarios such as emergency rescue and environmental monitoring. Unlike existing methods of modeling UAV video source coding and channel transmission separately, we investigate the joint source-channel optimization issue for video coding and transmission. Particularly, we design eight-dimensional delay-power-rate-distortion models in terms of source coding and channel transmission and characterize the correlation between video coding and transmission, with which a joint source-channel optimization problem is formulated. Its objective is to minimize end-to-end distortion and UAV power consumption by optimizing fine-grained parameters related to UAV video coding and transmission. This problem is confirmed to be a challenging sequential-decision and non-convex optimization problem. We therefore decompose it into a family of repeated optimization problems by Lyapunov optimization and design an approximate convex optimization scheme with provable performance guarantees to tackle these problems. Based on the theoretical transformation, we propose a Lyapunov repeated iteration (LyaRI) algorithm. Both objective and subjective experiments are conducted to comprehensively evaluate the performance of LyaRI. The results indicate that, compared to its counterparts, LyaRI achieves better video quality and stability performance, with a 47.74% reduction in the variance of the obtained encoding bitrate.</description>

      <title>Multi-Source EEG Emotion Recognition via Dynamic Contrastive Domain Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10235v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) provides reliable indications of human cognition and mental states. Accurate emotion recognition from EEG remains challenging due to signal variations among individuals and across measurement sessions. We introduce a multi-source dynamic contrastive domain adaptation method (MS-DCDA) based on differential entropy (DE) features, in which coarse-grained inter-domain and fine-grained intra-class adaptations are modeled through a multi-branch contrastive neural network and contrastive sub-domain discrepancy learning. Leveraging domain knowledge from each individual source and a complementary source ensemble, our model uses dynamically weighted learning to achieve an optimal tradeoff between domain transferability and discriminability. The proposed MS-DCDA model was evaluated using the SEED and SEED-IV datasets, achieving respectively the highest mean accuracies of $90.84\%$ and $78.49\%$ in cross-subject experiments as well as $95.82\%$ and $82.25\%$ in cross-session experiments. Our model outperforms several alternative domain adaptation methods in recognition accuracy, inter-class margin, and intra-class compactness. Our study also suggests greater emotional sensitivity in the frontal and parietal brain lobes, providing insights for mental health interventions, personalized medicine, and preventive strategies.</description>

      <title>Power Efficient Cooperative Communication within IIoT Subnetworks: Relay or RIS?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12557v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The forthcoming sixth-generation (6G) industrial Internet-of-Things (IIoT) subnetworks are expected to support ultra-fast control communication cycles for numerous IoT devices. However, meeting the stringent requirements for low latency and high reliability poses significant challenges, particularly due to signal fading and physical obstructions. In this paper, we propose novel time division multiple access (TDMA) and frequency division multiple access (FDMA) communication protocols for cooperative transmission in IIoT subnetworks. These protocols leverage secondary access points (sAPs) as Decode-and-Forward (DF) and Amplify-and-Forward (AF) relays, enabling shorter cycle times while minimizing overall transmit power. A classification mechanism determines whether the highest-gain link for each IoT device is a single-hop or two-hop connection, and selects the corresponding sAP. We then formulate the problem of minimizing transmit power for DF/AF relaying while adhering to the delay and maximum power constraints. In the FDMA case, an additional constraint is introduced for bandwidth allocation to IoT devices during the first and second phases of cooperative transmission. To tackle the nonconvex problem, we employ the sequential parametric convex approximation (SPCA) method. We extend our analysis to a system model with reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), enabling transmission through direct and RIS-assisted channels, and optimizing for a multi-RIS scenario for comparative analysis. Simulation results show that our cooperative communication approach reduces the emitted power by up to 7.5 dB while maintaining an outage probability and a resource overflow rate below $10^{-6}$. While the RIS-based solution achieves greater power savings, the relay-based protocol outperforms RIS in terms of outage probability.</description>

      <title>3D Extended Target Sensing in ISAC: Cram\'er-Rao Bound Analysis and Beamforming Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06353v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system where the sensing target is a three-dimensional (3D) extended target, for which multiple scatterers from the target surface can be resolved. We first introduce a second-order truncated Fourier series surface model for an arbitrarily-shaped 3D ET. Utilizing this model, we derive tractable Cramer-Rao bounds (CRBs) for estimating the ET kinematic parameters, including the center range, azimuth, elevation, and orientation. These CRBs depend explicitly on the transmit covariance matrix and ET shape. Then we formulate two transmit beamforming optimization problems for the base station (BS) to simultaneously support communication with multiple users and sensing of the 3D ET. The first minimizes the sensing CRB while ensuring a minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) for each user, and it is solved using semidefinite relaxation. The second balances minimizing the CRB and maximizing communication rates through a weight factor, and is solved via successive convex approximation. To reduce the computational complexity, we further propose ISACBeam-GNN, a novel graph neural network-based beamforming method that employs a separate-then-integrate structure, learning communication and sensing (C&amp;S) objectives independently before integrating them to balance C&amp;S trade-offs. Simulation results show that the proposed beamforming designs that account for ET shapes significantly outperform existing baselines, offering better communication-sensing performance trade-offs as well as an improved beampattern for sensing. Results also demonstrate that ISACBeam-GNN is an efficient alternative to the optimization-based methods, with remarkable adaptability and scalability.</description>

      <title>CognitionCapturer: Decoding Visual Stimuli From Human EEG Signal With Multimodal Information</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10489v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals have attracted significant attention from researchers due to their non-invasive nature and high temporal sensitivity in decoding visual stimuli. However, most recent studies have focused solely on the relationship between EEG and image data pairs, neglecting the valuable ``beyond-image-modality" information embedded in EEG signals. This results in the loss of critical multimodal information in EEG. To address this limitation, we propose CognitionCapturer, a unified framework that fully leverages multimodal data to represent EEG signals. Specifically, CognitionCapturer trains Modality Expert Encoders for each modality to extract cross-modal information from the EEG modality. Then, it introduces a diffusion prior to map the EEG embedding space to the CLIP embedding space, followed by using a pretrained generative model, the proposed framework can reconstruct visual stimuli with high semantic and structural fidelity. Notably, the framework does not require any fine-tuning of the generative models and can be extended to incorporate more modalities. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that CognitionCapturer outperforms state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.

      <title>CwA-T: A Channelwise AutoEncoder with Transformer for EEG Abnormality Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14522v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are critical for detecting abnormal brain activity, but their high dimensionality and complexity pose significant challenges for effective analysis. In this paper, we propose CwA-T, a novel framework that combines a channelwise CNN-based autoencoder with a single-head transformer classifier for efficient EEG abnormality detection. The channelwise autoencoder compresses raw EEG signals while preserving channel independence, reducing computational costs and retaining biologically meaningful features. The compressed representations are then fed into the transformer-based classifier, which efficiently models long-term dependencies to distinguish between normal and abnormal signals. Evaluated on the TUH Abnormal EEG Corpus, the proposed model achieves 85.0% accuracy, 76.2% sensitivity, and 91.2% specificity at the per-case level, outperforming baseline models such as EEGNet, Deep4Conv, and FusionCNN. Furthermore, CwA-T requires only 202M FLOPs and 2.9M parameters, making it significantly more efficient than transformer-based alternatives. The framework retains interpretability through its channelwise design, demonstrating great potential for future applications in neuroscience research and clinical practice.

Abstract: Extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) communications, enabled by numerous antenna elements integrated into large antenna surfaces, can provide increased effective degree of freedom (EDoF) to achieve high diversity gain. However, it remains an open problem that how the EDoF is influenced by the directional radiation pattern of antenna elements. In this work, empowered by the wavenumber-domain channel representation, we analyze the EDoF in a general case where the directivity of antennas, determined by the antenna structure and element spacing, is considered. Specifically, we first reveal the uneven distribution of directivity-aware wavenumber-domain coupling coefficients, i.e., channel gain towards different directions, in the isotropic Rayleigh fading channel. EDoF is then calculated based on such distribution of coupling coefficients. A numerical method is also provided to obtain coupling coefficients via electromagnetic full-wave simulations. Due to the influence of antenna directivity, how EDoF and ergodic channel capacity vary with the element spacing are explored via simulations for different antenna types.</description>
