      <title>Sensitivity of ECG QRS Complexes to His-Purkinje Structure in Computational Heart Models</title>

Abstract: Cardiac digital twins (CDT) are emerging as a potentially transformative tool in cardiology. A critical yet understudied determinant of CDT accuracy is the His-Purkinje system (HPS), which influences ventricular depolarization and shapes the QRS complex of the electrocardiogram (ECG). Here, we quantify how structural variations in the HPS alter QRS morphology and identify which parameters drive this variability. We generated HPS structures using a fractal-tree, rule-based algorithm, systematically varying nine model parameters and assessing their effects on ten QRS-related metrics. We conducted a Sobol sensitivity analysis to quantify direct and interaction-driven contributions of each parameter to observed variability. Our results suggest that most minor changes in HPS structure exert minimal influence on individual QRS features; however, certain parameter combinations can produce abnormal QRS morphologies. Wave durations and peak amplitudes of the QRS complex exhibit low sensitivity to individual HPS parameter variations; however, we found that specific parameter combinations can result in interactions that significantly alter these aspects of QRS morphology. We found that certain HPS structures can cause premature QRS formation, obscuring P-wave formation. QRS timing variability was primarily driven by interactions among branch and fascicle angles and branch repulsivity, though other parameters also showed notable interaction effects. In addition to interactions, individual variations in the number of branches in the HPS also affected QRS timing. While future models should account for these potential sources of variability, this study indicates that minor anatomical differences between a healthy patient's HPS and that of a generic model are unlikely to significantly impact model fidelity or clinical interpretation when both systems are physiologically normal.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Solutions Integrated in an IoT Healthcare Platform for Heart Failure Risk Stratification</title>

Abstract: The management of chronic Heart Failure (HF) presents significant challenges in modern healthcare, requiring continuous monitoring, early detection of exacerbations, and personalized treatment strategies. In this paper, we present a predictive model founded on Machine Learning (ML) techniques to identify patients at HF risk. This model is an ensemble learning approach, a modified stacking technique, that uses two specialized models leveraging clinical and echocardiographic features and then a meta-model to combine the predictions of these two models. We initially assess the model on a real dataset and the obtained results suggest that it performs well in the stratification of patients at HR risk. Specifically, we obtained high sensitivity (95\%), ensuring that nearly all high-risk patients are identified. As for accuracy, we obtained 84\%, which can be considered moderate in some ML contexts. However, it is acceptable given our priority of identifying patients at risk of HF because they will be asked to participate in the telemonitoring program of the PrediHealth research project on which some of the authors of this paper are working. The initial findings also suggest that ML-based risk stratification models can serve as valuable decision-support tools not only in the PrediHealth project but also for healthcare professionals, aiding in early intervention and personalized patient management. To have a better understanding of the value and of potentiality of our predictive model, we also contrasted its results with those obtained by using three baseline models. The preliminary results indicate that our predictive model outperforms these baselines that flatly consider features, \ie not grouping them in clinical and echocardiographic features.</description>
