      <title>Helicons in multi-Weyl semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Helicons are transverse electromagnetic modes in three dimension(3D) electron systems in the presence of a static magnetic field. This modes have been proposed in isotropic or single Weyl semimetals(sWSMs) (Francesco M.D. Pellegrino et al, Phys. Rev. B 92, 201407(R) (2015)). In this work, we extend our study to investigate helicons modes in gapless multi-Weyl semimetals(mWSMs) within semiclassical Boltzmann approach and discuss the differences that arise compared to single Weyl semimetals.</description>

      <title>Nernst power factor and figure of merit in compensated semimetal ScSb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, topological semimetals have emerged as strong candidates for solid state thermomagnetic refrigerators due to their enhanced Nernst effect. This enhancement arises from the combined contributions of the Berry curvature induced anomalous Nernst coefficient associated with topological bands and the normal Nernst effect resulting from synergistic electron-hole compensation. Generally, these two effects are intertwined in topological semimetals, making it challenging to evaluate them independently. Here, we report the observation of high Nernst effect in the electron hole compensated semimetal ScSb with topologically trivial electronic band structures. Remarkably, we find a high maximum Nernst power factor of $PF_N \sim 35 \times 10^{-4}$ W m$^{-1}$ K$^{-2}$ in ScSb. The Nernst thermopower ($S_{xy}$) exhibits a peak of $\sim$ 47 $\mu$V/K at 12 K and 14 T, yielding a Nernst figure of merit ($z_N$) of $\sim 28 \times 10^{-4}$ K$^{-1}$. Notably, despite its trivial electronic band structure, both the $PF_N$ and $z_N$ values of ScSb are comparable to those observed in topological semimetals with Dirac band dispersions. The origin of the large Nernst signal in ScSb is explained by well compensated electron and hole carriers, through Hall resistivity measurements, angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations.</description>

      <title>Coupled Instantons In A Four-Well Potential With Application To The Tunneling Of A Composite Particle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coupled instantons are introduced by generalizing the double well potential to multiple mutually coupled wells. Physically this corresponds to the simultaneous tunneling of multiple degrees of freedom. A system with four equal minima is examined in detail. It has three instanton types or flavors with distinct actions. For weak coupling and subject to there being a single large (or small) parameter, the interactive system can be handled perturbatively. The zero mode problem arising from time translation symmetry is handled via the Fadeev-Popov procedure. A diagrammatic procedure allows corrections to the fluctuation determinant to be calculated systematically. Independent instanton contributions are summed over by extending the dilute gas approximation to three flavors and energy splittings of the lowest four states is calculated. All tunneling amplitudes are concisely expressed in terms of elementary functions. While the model is possibly useful for a variety of physical systems, an application is made here to the tunneling of a composite particle in one dimension.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Spin Nernst Effect and Chiral Edge Modes in van der Waals Ferromagnetic Insulators: Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya vs. Kitaev Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15964v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The thermomagnetic Nernst effect and chiral edge states are key signatures of nontrivial topology and emerging Berry curvature in magnonic systems. Implementing atomistic spin simulations, we theoretically demonstrate the emergence of chiral magnon edge states at the boundaries of a ferromagnetic hexagonal lattice in the presence of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya and Kitaev interactions, which are robust against nonlinear magnon interactions. In our simulations, we consider the spin parameters of CrI$_3$ as a prototype of van der Waals magnetic layers. We show that the spin accumulation is reduced in the presence of Kitaev spin interactions compared to systems governed by Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions. This reduction stems from the breaking of the $U(1)$ symmetry, which leads to a shorter spin coherence length imposed by the Kitaev interaction. We propose that measuring the angular dependence of the Nernst signal in a magnetic field provides an effective indirect method for identifying the microscopic origin of topological magnons. Our findings hold promising potential for advancing next-generation energy-harvesting Nernst materials and facilitating the integration of topological magnetic materials with spintronic-based quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Excitons and trions in CrSBr bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15493v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study theoretically the neutral and charged excitons in two-dimensional semiconductors with anisotropic dispersion of charge carriers. Such a situation is realized in CrSBr-based van der Waals heterostructures. We calculate the binding energies of excitons and trions and explore their dependence on the mass ratio, dielectric screening, and interlayer distance in bilayer structures. We also address the effects of exciton-light coupling, including the radiative decay and long-range electron-hole exchange interaction, and briefly analyze correlations between the excitons and the Fermi sea of resident electrons. The estimates for CrSBr bilayers are in reasonable agreement with recent experiments.</description>
