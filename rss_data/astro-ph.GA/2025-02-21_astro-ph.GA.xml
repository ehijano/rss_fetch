      <title>A new prescription for the spectral properties of population III stellar populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated various emission properties of extremely low metallicity stellar populations in the Epoch of Reionization (EoR), using the new GALSEVN model, which has shown promising agreement between spectral predictions and observations at lower redshifts and higher metallicities. We find that emission-line diagnostics previously proposed to discriminate between population III (Pop III) stars and other primordial ionizing sources are effective, but only for stellar-population ages below $\sim1$ Myr. We provide other key quantities relevant to modeling Pop III stellar populations in the EoR, such as the production efficiency of ionizing photons, which is critical for reionization studies, the production rate of Lyman-Werner photons, which can dissociate H$_2$ and influence the efficiency of star formation, and the rates of different types of supernov\ae, offering insights into the timescales of chemical enrichment in metal-poor environments. We complement our study with a self-consistent investigation of the gravitational-wave signals generated by the mergers of binary black holes that formed through stellar evolution and their detectability. The results presented here provide valuable predictions for the study of the EoR, on the crucial role of low-metallicity stellar populations in reionization mechanisms and star formation, as well as meaningful insights into potential observational counterparts to direct detections of Pop III stars.</description>

      <title>Modeling Galaxies in the Early Universe with Supernova Dust Attenuation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supernova may be the dominant channel by which dust grains accumulate in galaxies during the first Gyr of cosmic time as formation channels important for lower redshift galaxies, e.g., AGB stars and grain growth, may not have had sufficient time to take over. Supernovae (SNe) produce fewer small grains, leading to a flatter attenuation law. In this work, we fit observations of 138 spectroscopically confirmed z&gt;6 galaxies adopting standard spectral energy distribution modeling assumptions and compare standard attenuation law prescriptions to that of supernova-produced dust alone. Compared to SMC dust, SNe attenuation yields up to 0.5 mag higher $A_V$, and 0.4 dex larger stellar masses. SNe dust attenuation also finds better fits to the rest-frame UV photometry with lower $\chi^2_{\rm UV}$. This allows the observed UV luminosities taken from the models to be fainter by 0.2 dex on average. The systematically fainter rest-frame UV luminosities for fixed observed photometry could help resolve current tension between the ionizing photon production implied by JWST observations and the redshift evolution of the neutral hydrogen fraction. Given these systematic effects and the physical constraint of cosmic time itself, pure supernova dust attenuation laws should be a standard consideration in fitting to the spectral energy distributions of z&gt;6 galaxies.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the active galactic nucleus and starburst activity of local ultraluminous infrared galaxies from a broad range of torus models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we further explore the properties of the HERschel Ultra Luminous Infrared Galaxy Survey (HERUS) sample of 42 local ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) with our recently developed Bayesian spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting code SMART (Spectral energy distributions Markov chain Analysis with Radiative Transfer models). SMART fits SEDs exclusively with multicomponent radiative transfer models. Mid-infrared spectroscopy can be included in the fitting at a spectral resolution matched to that of the radiative transfer models. We fit the SEDs of the HERUS ULIRGs with four different models for the active galactic nucleus (AGN) torus, a starburst and a spheroidal galaxy model, to put constraints on the AGN fraction of the galaxies and their star formation rate (SFR). Two of the AGN torus models we explored are smooth and two are two-phase. We find that, in most cases, a smooth tapered AGN torus provides the best fit to the data. We also find that solutions with other torus models may predict AGN and total luminosities up to an order of magnitude or more lower, but very rarely higher than the best-fitting model. In contrast, we find that, with minor exceptions, the predicted SFR and stellar mass of the ULIRGs are generally robustly estimated irrespective of the assumed torus model. This is despite the fact that one of the AGN torus models we use assumes fluffy grains with high emissivity in the far-infrared and submillimetre, which could potentially reduce the contribution of a starburst at those wavelengths and reduce the SFR.</description>

      <title>Two categories of UV-upturn galaxies revealed by semi-analytic models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: UV-upturn galaxies are characterized by unusually excessive flux in the far-ultraviolet (FUV) band, observed in some elliptical galaxies and the bulges of disk galaxies. We examine UV-upturn galaxies within the semi-analytic model GABE, which embeds the formation of extreme horizontal branch (EHB) stars -- proposed as key candidates responsible for the UV-upturn phenomenon. We have analyzed all related physical processes, including stellar evolution, initial mass functions (IMFs), dust attenuation, galaxy age, metallicity, and binary fractions, in an effort to determine which processes play significant roles. Our findings reveal two categories of UV-upturn galaxies in the semi-analytic model, each with distinct formation channels: old metal-rich quenched elliptical galaxies, which are intrinsic UV-upturn galaxies induced by EHB stars within their old stellar populations, and dusty star-forming galaxies, which are relatively young and may also be photometrically identified as UV-upturn galaxies when accounting for dust attenuation. Dust attenuation contributes to 20%-60% of the UV-upturn galaxies, depending on the specific dust attenuation models adopted. With the binary star formation model of EHB stars, both of these formation channels exhibit strong preferences for high stellar metallicity. The high-mass end slope of the IMFs is found to have a marginal effect, indicating that a universal IMF is adequate for studying the UV-upturn phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Growth of Ex-situ Diffuse Intragroup Light in Simulated Galaxy Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep surface photometry reveals a faint, diffuse baryonic component in a significant fraction of galaxy groups, permeating the intragroup space. This intragroup light (IGL) is primarily formed by stars removed from their host galaxies through gravitational interactions and now drifting freely, unbound to any galaxy. We conduct a detailed analysis to investigate how various physical parameters of galaxy groups influence the formation of ex-situ IGL during the earliest stages of group assembly, and to explore their correlations with this component. Additionally, we evaluate the potential of the IGL as a luminous tracer of the total mass distribution in galaxy groups, with particular focus on systems that are far from being dynamically relaxed. We use controlled numerical simulations of 100 low-mass galaxy groups spanning a range of masses and numbers of constituent galaxies. We show that the IGL typically begins to form in significant amounts after the turnaround epoch (redshift ~ 0.85), increasing steadily thereafter. We observe a sublinear relationship between the masses of this component and the brightest group galaxy, indicating intertwined formation histories but differing growth rates, which suggests that other group members may also significantly contribute to the diffuse light. Additionally, we observe indications that IGL formation is enhanced in groups with lower internal velocity dispersions, suggesting that gravitational interactions among member galaxies become more effective when their relative velocities are reduced. Two-thirds of our groups reveal significant alignment between the radial surface density profiles of the total and IGL mass, with fractional discrepancies below 25%. This supports the notion that this diffuse and faint baryonic component serves as a reliable tracer of the total gravitational potential in galaxy aggregations, regardless of their dynamical state.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the Effect of Bars on Environmental Dependence of Disc Galaxies with MaNGA Survey Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bars are fundamental structures in disc galaxies, although their role in galaxy evolution is still not fully known. This study investigates the effect of the presence of bars on the environmental dependence of disc galaxies' properties using the volume-limited sample from Mapping Nearby Galaxies at APO (MaNGA) survey. The disc galaxies with and without bars samples were obtained using the Galaxy Zoo 2 project then assigned into field and group sub-samples. These sub-samples were used to compare the stellar mass, star formation rate, $g-r$ colour, concentration index and gas phase metallicity, and their relationships between field and group environments. Then these are used to investigate if there is an existence of any difference between galaxies with and without bars. A one-to-one correspondence between field and group galaxies' properties were observed, and a strong dependence on the environment for properties of unbarred galaxies was observed when compared to barred. The stellar mass against star formation rate, $g-r$ colour against concentration index and stellar mass against gas phase metallicity of unbarred galaxies strongly depend on environment while for barred these relations weakly depend on environment. The study concludes that bars in disc galaxies decrease the dependence of analysed properties and its relations on the environment.</description>

      <title>Modeling Tidal Streams and Tidal Tails around Galaxies Using Deep Wendelstein Imaging Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From the $\Lambda$ cold dark matter paradigm it is expected that galaxies merge and grow in their environments. These processes form various tidal features depending on the merger mass ratio, orbital parameters, and gas richness. We inspected 170 $g'$-band Abell cluster observations from the 2.1m Fraunhofer-Teleskop Wendelstein and identify 111 of such features from which we select nine streams and five tails. A fast and innovative technique was developed for determining their photometric properties. The model is a Gaussian, including higher-order moments to describe the light profile in slices perpendicular to the elongation direction. From these models, FWHM apertures are generated. The method was developed, tested, and applied on the selected features and corresponding $g$- and $r$-band data from the Legacy Survey DR10. Regarding the novel modeling approach, we can measure surface and total brightnesses with precisions of 4% and 7%, respectively. Mean stream width precision, which also translates to the mean $R_\mathrm{e}$ along the feature is on average within 3% uncertainty. The measured streams have on average a surface brightness of $\sim26.25$ $g'$ mag arcsec$^{-2}$ and are dimmer than the tails in our sample ($\sim25.14$ $g'$ mag arcsec$^{-2}$). We infer that the progenitors of our streams can come from dwarfs, early-type galaxies or disks, based on the streams structural parameters. Furthermore, brightnesses and colors of the streams and tails are consistent with those of galaxies that populate the red sequence in the Coma cluster within $2\sigma$.</description>

      <title>ALMA 360 pc high-frequency observations reveal warm dust in the center of a $z=6.9$ quasar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The temperature of the cold dust in z&gt;6 galaxies is a potential tracer of Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) and stellar feedback, and is the dominant source of uncertainty in inferring properties from the far-infrared (FIR) emission of these galaxies. We present the first resolved dust temperature map in a $z&gt;6$ quasar host galaxy. We combine new 360 pc resolution ALMA Band 9 continuum observations with literature 190 pc Band 6 observations to derive the dust temperature and opacity at 0.1&lt;r&lt;0.5 kpc scales in a $z=6.9$ luminous quasar host galaxy (J2348-3054). We find that the dust temperature (and opacity) increases at the center (r&lt;216 pc) of the galaxy up to $T_d=73-88$ K, and potentially up to $T_d&lt;149$ K at r&lt;110 pc. The combination of the resolved and integrated FIR Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) further reveal a dust temperature gradient and a significant contribution of the AGN hot dust torus at $\nu_{\rm{obs}}\gtrsim 700$ GHz. By taking into account the torus contribution and resolved optically-thick emission, we derive a total infrared luminosity ($L_{TIR}=8.78\pm0.10)\times 10^{12}L_\odot$) and corresponding star-formation rate (SFR$=1307\pm15\ M_\odot\ \rm{yr}^{-1}$), that are at least a factor $\sim 3.6$ ($\sim0.56$ dex) lower than previous measurements assuming optically-thin emission. We compare the resolved dust temperature, mass and IR luminosity profiles to simulations where they are only reproduced by models in which the AGN radiation heats the dust in the center of the galaxy. Our observations provide evidence that dust in J2348--3054 cannot be assumed to be uniformly cold and optically thin. Whether J2348-3054 is representative of the larger population of high-redshift quasars and galaxies remains to be determined with dedicated high-resolution and high-frequency ALMA observations.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the fractional changes of the fundamental constants at a look-back time of 2.5 Myrs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum nature of gravity remains one of the greatest mysteries of modern physics, with many unified theories predicting variations in fundamental constants across space and time. Here we present precise measurements of these variations at galactic dynamical timescales - a critical but previously unexplored regime. Using simultaneous observations of H \textsc{i} and OH lines in M31, we probe potential variations of fundamental constants at a lookback time of 2.5 million years. We obtained $\Delta(\mu\alpha^2g_p^{0.64})/(\mu\alpha^2g_p^{0.64}) &lt; 3.6 \times 10^{-6}$, with complementary constraints on $\Delta(\mu\alpha^2)/(\mu\alpha^2) &lt; 4.6 \times 10^{-3}$, and $\Delta g_p/g_p &lt; 7.2 \times 10^{-3}$, where $\alpha$ is the fine structure constant, $\mu$ is the proton-electron mass ratio, and $g_p$ is the proton $g$-factor. These results bridge the gap between laboratory tests and cosmological observations, providing unique insights into the coupling between local dynamics and fundamental physics. Our findings challenge theories predicting significant variations over galactic timescales, while demonstrating a powerful new probe of quantum gravity models.</description>

      <title>Lopsided and Bulging Distribution of Satellites around Paired Halos. I. Observational Measurements and Comparison with Halo-based Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the angular distribution of satellite galaxies in and around pairs of galaxy groups in SDSS and compare the results with the satellite distribution in pairs of dark matter halos by constructing mock catalogs that account for the same selection effects as the observational sample. We find that the angular distribution of satellites in both SDSS and the mock catalog exhibits a pronounced tendency towards lopsidedness, with satellites preferentially located between the two central galaxies. Additionally, there is a significant bulging distribution characterized by a higher concentration of satellites along the line connecting the two centrals compared to those found perpendicular to it. The lopsided and bulging distributions strengthen as pair separation and halo mass increase. The mock catalog successfully reproduces the observational results across all cases considered. We find that the lopsided and bulging distribution of satellites can largely be explained by overlapping two randomly selected halos matched in mass to the actual halo pairs, along with their surrounding satellite distribution, provided that the alignment between the orientations of the halos and the line connecting the halo pairs is taken into account. This suggests that the angular distribution of satellites is a natural consequence of the formation and evolution of large-scale structure in a $\Lambda$CDM universe, eliminating the need to introduce other physical origins.</description>

      <title>Disturbed cold gas in galaxy and structure formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cold and cool gas (T $\leq 10^4$ K) in the circumgalactic medium (CGM) and its interaction with galaxies remain poorly understood. Simulations predict that cold gas flows into galaxies through cosmic filaments, determining the disk formation and galaxy evolution. The cold gas accretion modes in the CGM and their dependence on dark matter halo mass and redshift remain puzzling. Resolving the kiloparsec-scale kinematics and dynamics of cold gas interacting with the disk, dust, and metals in different environments is particularly lacking at z &gt; 2. Here we report two disturbed cold gas structures traced by ultra-strong MgII absorbers (rest-frame equivalent width Wr &gt; 2 \AA) exhibiting high kinematic velocities (&gt; 500 km/s) and their environments at z ~ 4.9 and z ~ 2.6. Observations were conducted with VLT/MUSE, JWST/NIRCam, and ALMA to detect Lya and nebular emission lines, as well as dust continuum emission in the vicinity of these two absorbing gas structures. We identify two Lya emitters associated with a strong MgII absorber pair separated by ~1000 km/s at z~ 4.87. The pair exhibits relative differences in metallicity, dust content, and ionization states, suggesting internal metal and dust exchange within the ultra-large cold gas structure. For the strong MgII absorber at z = 2.5652$, we detect a dusty star-forming galaxy at a projected distance of $D = 38$ kpc. This galaxy exhibits prominent HeI, [SIII], and Paschen$\gamma$ lines, along with significant dust continuum. It has a star formation rate of ~ 121 +/- 33 $M_{\odot}$/yr and likely harbors a rotating disk. These findings tentatively suggest that cold gas at high redshifts plays a critical role in driving disk formation and actively participates in the transfer of metals and dust within the overdense regions of the CGM.</description>

      <title>Super-Eddington Accretion in Quasars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This review provides an observational perspective on the fundamental properties of super-Eddington accretion onto supermassive black holes in quasars. It begins by outlining the selection criteria, particularly focusing on optical and UV broad-line intensity ratios, used to identify a population of unobscured super-Eddington candidates. Several defining features place these candidates at the extreme end of the Population A in main sequence of quasars: among them are the highest observed singly-ionized iron emission, extreme outflow velocities in UV resonance lines, and unusually high metal abundances. These key properties reflect the coexistence of a virialized sub-system within the broad-line region alongside powerful outflows, with the observed gas enrichment likely driven by nuclear or circumnuclear star formation. The most compelling evidence for the occurrence of super-Eddington accretion onto supermassive black holes comes from recent observations of massive black holes at early cosmic epochs. These black holes require rapid growth rates that are only achievable through radiatively inefficient super-Eddington accretion. Furthermore, extreme Eddington ratios, close to or slightly exceeding unity, are consistent with the saturation of radiative output per unit mass predicted by accretion disk theory for super-Eddington accretion rates. The extreme properties of super-Eddington candidates suggest that these quasars could make them stable and well-defined cosmological distance indicators, leveraging the correlation between broad-line width and luminosity expected in virialized systems. Finally, several analogies with accretion processes around stellar-mass black holes, particularly in the high/soft state, are explored to provide additional insight into the mechanisms driving super-Eddington accretion.</description>

      <title>Lensing and wave optics in the strong field of a black hole</title>

Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) are lensed by matter, offering a unique probe of both the large-scale structure of the Universe and the fundamental properties of GW propagation. GWs can also be affected by wave optics effects when their wavelength is comparable to the size of the lens. While this regime has been well studied in the Newtonian approximation, the role of strong gravitational fields remains largely unexplored. This is particularly relevant for lensing by intermediate and supermassive black holes (BHs), which can occur near active galactic nuclei or in compact triple systems. In this work, we analyze the lensing of GWs by a non-rotating BH and compare our results to the Newtonian point-mass approximation. We construct frequency-dependent amplification factors that incorporate strong-field effects, revealing explicit polarization mixing and absorption by the event horizon. Using a fiducial GW event, we explore key phenomenological signatures of BH lensing, highlighting new observational opportunities to probe strong gravitational fields through GW lensing.</description>

      <title>Meridional Circulation. I. A Formation Channel for Lithium-rich and Super Lithium-rich Red Clump Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current observations indicate that stars with higher rotation rates appear to maintain more surface lithium, and the majority of lithium-rich giants are indeed red clump stars. Hence, we investigate the mechanisms behind lithium enrichment in rotating red clump stars and the pathways to forming lithium-rich red clump stars. Meridional circulation is prevalent in the radiative zone of rotating giants. We model its radial mixing as a diffusion process and derive the corresponding diffusion coefficient based on its material transfer effect. Due to uncertainties in numerical calculations, we consider an average diffusion effect. Additionally, certain limiting conditions for the radial velocity of meridional circulation are incorporated. With varying input rotation velocities, we simulate the lithium evolution for red clump stars with this model. Our results indicate that the material transfer effect due to meridional circulation can efficiently transport beryllium, produced by H burning, into the convective envelope. This meridional circulation can lead to lithium enrichment, with a maximum lithium abundance increment approaching \(3.0\,\rm dex\). Consequently, it is capable of forming both lithium-rich and super lithium-rich red clump stars. The degree of lithium enrichment exhibits a strong positive correlation with the rotation velocity, i.e., faster red clump stars show more surface lithium. Furthermore, our models indicate that lithium-rich red clump stars are relatively young (\(\sim 10^6\,\rm yr\)), which aligns with observation evidences.</description>

      <title>COSMIC-S: a photometric Catalogue of Observed Stars in the Small MagellanIc Cloud</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Dark Energy Camera (DECam) is a wide-field instrument mounted on the 4m V. Blanco Telescope (CTIO). Its impressive technical characteristics makes it one of the most suitable ground-based telescope for the production of accurate stellar photometry even towards crowded regions such as the Magellanic Clouds. We analysed DECam images acquired from February 2018 to January 2020 towards the Small Magellanic Cloud. We performed a PSF photometry by using the SExtractor and PSFEx tools and producing a comprehensive photometric catalogue in the SDSS system, considering the $gri$ filters. Then, we present COSMIC-S, a photometric catalogue consisting of 10 971 906 sources, including $gri$ magnitudes with a mean error $&lt;\sigma_m&gt; \simeq 0.04$ mag. A total of 2 456 434 sources have good photometry in all three bands. The catalogue appears virtually complete to $m \simeq 22$, with a limiting magnitude $m\simeq 25$. We derived the colour-magnitude and colour-colour diagrams in order to prove the goodness of the catalogue.</description>

      <title>MOJAVE -- XXII. Brightness temperature distributions and geometric profiles along parsec-scale AGN jets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radial gradients of the brightness temperatures along the parsec-scale jets of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) can be used to infer the energy balance and to estimate the parameter range of physical conditions in these regions. In this paper, we present a detailed study of the brightness temperature gradients and geometry profiles of relativistic jets of 447 AGN based on 15 GHz Very Long Baseline Array observations performed between 1994 and 2019. We used models of the jet structure using two-dimensional Gaussian components and analysed variations in their brightness temperatures and sizes along the jets. The size of the jet components, R, increases with projected distance from the jet base, r, as $R\propto r^{1.02\pm0.03}$, i.e., typically following a conically expanding streamline and therefore indicating that the size of jet components is a good tracer of jet geometry. The brightness temperature gradients along the jets typically follow a power-law $T_\mathrm{b} \propto r^{-2.82\pm0.07}$. Half of the sample sources show non-monotonic R(r) or Tb(r) profiles and their distributions were characterised by a double power-law model. We found at least six scenarios to explain the enhancement of the brightness temperature by a presence of inhomogeneities (shocks, jet recollimation) or curvature effects (helical structures, helical magnetic field, non-radial motion, bent jets). Our results are consistent with the scenario that the jet features can be simplified as optically thin moving blobs. In the sources demonstrating transition from a conical to parabolic jet shape, the gradient of the Tb(R) changes at the position of the break consistent with the model of magneto-hydrodynamic acceleration.</description>

      <title>Lopsided and Bulging Distribution of Satellites around Paired Halos. II. 3D Analysis and Dependence on Projection and Selection Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the distribution of subhalos in the vicinity of dark matter halo pairs in the Illustris-TNG simulation. The satellites around halo pairs with separations $d_{\text{sep}} &gt; 0.5~h^{-1} \text{Mpc}$ exhibit a non-uniform distribution, which is a combined result of two distinct features: the ``bulging'' distribution, characterized by an overabundance along the pairwise direction, and the ``lopsided'' distribution, which shows an overabundance in the region between the paired halos. The bulging signal is stronger for halo pairs that are more widely separated and involve less massive halos, while the lopsidedness strengthens as the halo mass increases. Both signals depend weakly on halo mass ratio, and are primarily contributed by subhalos that are relatively distant from host halos. These measurements can be broadly reproduced by the overlap effect, provided the spatial alignment of halos is properly taken into account. Our results imply that the lopsidedness and bulging distribution may arise from two distinct origins: the former is caused simply by the overlap of two closely placed halos, while the latter is driven by the alignment of halos with large-scale filamentary structures. We examine the impact of projection and selection effects by conducting the same analysis of satellite distribution in two dimensions and in a mock catalog that replicates the selection effects of the SDSS galaxy sample. We find that the 3D-to-2D projection significantly suppresses the bulging distribution, with particularly strong effects at large pair separations, low halo masses, and large halo mass ratios.</description>

      <title>Disentangling gamma-beta: the 4th-order velocity moments based on spherical Jeans analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12671v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Distinguishing a core and a cusp within dark matter halos is complexified by the existence of mass-anisotropy degeneracy, where various combinations of velocity anisotropy ($\beta$) and inner density slope ($\gamma$) yield similar observational signatures. We construct a dynamical model that incorporates the 4th-order velocity moments to alleviate this challenge. The inclusion of the 4th-order velocity moments enables stars' line-of-sight velocity distribution (LOSVD) to be flexible. This flexible LOSVD can cover from a thin-tailed to a heavy-tailed distribution that is inaccessible if only the 2nd-order moments are considered. We test the model on four mock galaxies having isotropic orbits, $\beta = 0$: two resembling dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) and two resembling ultra-faint dwarfs (UFDs) in terms of velocity dispersion. Each category includes one galaxy with a cuspy NFW profile and one with a cored density profile. Results show that a ratio of the global velocity dispersion to velocity error, $\sigma_{\rm los,global} / \delta v_{\rm los} \gtrsim 4$, is crucial to avoid systematic biases arising from the strong sensitivity of 4th-order moments to the LOSVD tails. In cases where this velocity ratio condition is met, our model reliably recovers $\gamma$ in dSph mock galaxies, with the true value recovered within $\sim 1\sigma$, and strongly excludes a cuspy NFW profile for the cored dSph mock galaxy. However, recovering the density profiles of UFDs remains challenging due to their intrinsically low velocity dispersions.</description>

      <title>The FAST HI 21-cm absorption blind survey. II. -- Statistic Exploration for Associated and Intervening systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14411v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an extragalactic HI 21-cm absorption lines catalog from a blind search at z $\leqslant$ 0.35, using drift-scan data collected in 1325.6 hours by the ongoing Commensal Radio Astronomy FasT Survey (CRAFTS) and FAST All Sky HI Survey (FASHI), which spans a sky area of 6072.0 deg$^{2}$ and covers 84533 radio sources with a flux density greater than 12 mJy. 14 previously identified HI absorbers and 20 newly discovered HI absorbers were detected, comprising 15 associated systems, 10 intervening systems, and 9 systems with undetermined classifications. Through spectral stacking, the mean peak optical path, mean velocity-integrated optical path, mean FWHM and mean HI column density are measured to be 0.47 and 0.30; 27.19 and 4.36 km s$^{-1}$; 42.61 and 9.33 km s$^{-1}$; 0.49 and 0.08 T$_{s} \times$ 10$^{20}$cm$^{-2}$K$^{-1}$, for the associated and intervening samples, respectively. Statistical analysis also reveals that associated systems tend to be hosted by red ($g-r&gt;$0.7) galaxies at lower redshifts, whereas galaxies hosting intervening HI absorption are typically found at higher redshifts and are of a bluer ($g-r\leqslant$0.7) type. A noticeable difference is observed in the positions of foregrounds, backgrounds of intervening systems, and high-redshift and low-redshift associated systems on the WISE color-color diagram. All identified foreground sources in our sample have W1-W2 magnitudes below 0.8, suggesting no Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). In contrast, backgrounds of intervening systems tend to have W1-W2 magnitudes above 0.8, indicating AGN presence. For associated absorption, most low-redshift ($z\leqslant$0.5) systems show W1-W2 values below 0.8, while higher-redshift associated absorption ($z&gt;$0.5) displays a broader range of W1-W2 values.</description>

      <title>Discovering Large-Scale Structure at $2&lt;z&lt;5$ in the C3VO Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00237v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Charting Cluster Construction with VUDS and ORELSE (C3VO) survey is an ongoing imaging and spectroscopic campaign aiming to map out the growth of structure up to $z\sim5$ and was born from the combination of the Visible Multi-Object Spectrograph Ultra Deep Survey and the Observations of Redshift Evolution in Large-Scale Environments (ORELSE) survey. As we previously accomplished with the ORELSE survey, we apply our technique known as Voronoi tessellation Monte Carlo (VMC) mapping to search for serendipitous galaxy overdensities at $2&lt;z&lt;5$ in the three C3VO fields. We also apply the same technique to mock observations of simulated galaxies with properties derived from the GAlaxy Evolution and Assembly semianalytic model in order to judge the effectiveness of our search algorithm as a function of redshift, total mass, and fraction of spectroscopic redshifts. We find completeness and purity values of the order of 30-50\% for $\log (M_{z=0}/M_{\odot}) &gt; 14$ and $2&lt;z&lt;4$, with a strong dependence on mass and redshift, with values as high as $\sim$80\% and $\sim$70\%, respectively, in the best-case scenario for $\log (M_{z=0}/M_{\odot}) &gt; 14.5$. In the C3VO fields, we were able to recover many of the previously known structures in the literature as well as find hundreds of new overdensity candidates, once again demonstrating the powerful capabilities of VMC mapping when applied to wide-field optical and infrared galaxy evolution surveys at ever higher redshifts.</description>

      <title>Turbulent Pressure Heats Gas and Suppresses Star Formation in Galactic Bar Molecular Clouds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09258v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) of the Milky Way is fed by gas inflows from the Galactic disk along almost radial trajectories aligned with the major axis of the Galactic bar. However, despite being fundamental to all processes in the nucleus of the galaxy, these inflows have been studied significantly less than the CMZ itself. We present observations of various molecular lines between 215 and 230 GHz for 20 clouds with $|\ell| &lt; 10^\circ$, which are candidates for clouds in the Galactic bar due to their warm temperatures and broad lines relative to typical Galactic disk clouds, using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Atacama Compact Array (ACA). We measure gas temperatures, shocks, star formation rates, turbulent Mach numbers, and masses for these clouds. Although some clouds may be in the Galactic disk despite their atypical properties, nine clouds are likely associated with regions in the Galactic bar, and in these clouds, turbulent pressure is suppressing star formation. In clouds with no detected star formation, turbulence is the dominant heating mechanism, whereas photo-electric processes heat the star-forming clouds. We find that the ammonia (NH$_3$) and formaldehyde (H$_2$CO) temperatures probe different gas components, and in general each transition appears to trace different molecular gas phases within the clouds. We also measure the CO-to-H$_2$ X-factor in the bar to be an order of magnitude lower than the typical Galactic value. These observations provide evidence that molecular clouds achieve CMZ-like properties before reaching the CMZ</description>

      <title>Properties of black hole-star binaries formed in $N$-body simulations of massive star clusters: implications for Gaia black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17323v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate black hole-star binaries formed in $N$-body simulations of massive, dense star clusters. We simulate 32 clusters with varying initial masses ($10^{4}~\rm M_{\odot}$ to $10^{6}~\rm M_{\odot}$), densities ($1200~\rm M_{\odot}~pc^{-3}$ to $10^{5}~\rm M_{\odot}~pc^{-3}$), and metallicities $(Z = 0.01,~0.001,~0.0001)$. Our results reveal that star clusters produce a diverse range of BH-star binaries, with dynamical interactions leading to extreme systems characterised by large orbital separations and high black hole masses. Of the ejected BH-main sequence (BH-MS) binaries, $20\%$ form dynamically, while the rest originate from the primordial binary population initially present in the cluster. Ejected BH-MS binaries that are dynamically formed have more massive black holes, lower-mass stellar companions, and over half are in a hierarchical triple system. All unbound BH-giant star (BH-GS) binaries were ejected as BH-MS binaries and evolved into the BH-GS phase outside the cluster. Due to their lower-mass companions, most dynamically formed binaries do not evolve into BH-GS systems within a Hubble time. Consequently, only 2 of the 35 ejected BH-GS binaries are dynamically formed. We explore the formation pathways of Gaia-like systems, identifying two Gaia BH1-like binaries that formed through dynamical interactions, and two Gaia BH2-like systems with a primordial origin. We did not find any system resembling Gaia BH3, which may however be attributed to the limited sample size of our simulations.</description>

      <title>HYPERION: broad-band X-ray-to-near-infrared emission of Quasars in the first billion years of the Universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02105v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We aim at characterizing the X-ray-to-optical/near-infrared broad-band emission of luminous QSOs in the first Gyr of cosmic evolution to understand whether they exhibit differences compared to the lower-\textit{z} QSO population. Our goal is also to provide for these objects a reliable and uniform catalog of SED fitting derivable properties such as bolometric and monochromatic luminosities, Eddington ratios, dust extinction, strength of the hot dust emission. We characterize the X-ray/UV emission of each QSO using average SEDs from luminous Type 1 sources and calculate bolometric and monochromatic luminosities. Finally we construct a mean SED extending from the X-rays to the NIR bands. We find that the UV-optical emission of these QSOs can be modelled with templates of $z\sim$2 luminous QSOs. We observe that the bolometric luminosities derived adopting some bolometric corrections at 3000 \AA\ ($BC_{3000\text{\AA}}$) largely used in the literature are slightly overestimated by 0.13 dex as they also include reprocessed IR emission. We estimate a revised value, i.e. $BC_{3000\text{\AA}}=3.3 $ which can be used for deriving $L_\text{bol}$ in \textit{z} $\geq$ 6 QSOs. A sub-sample of 11 QSOs is provided with rest-frame NIR photometry, showing a broad range of hot dust emission strength, with two sources exhibiting low levels of emission. Despite potential observational biases arising from non-uniform photometric coverage and selection biases, we produce a X-ray-to-NIR mean SED for QSOs at \textit{z} $\gtrsim$ 6, revealing a good match with templates of lower-redshift, luminous QSOs up to the UV-optical range, with a slightly enhanced contribution from hot dust in the NIR.</description>

Abstract: We report on the optical spectroscopic observations of the host galaxy of the hyperactive repeating fast radio burst, FRB 20240114A. The host galaxy is a dwarf galaxy at a redshift of $z=0.1306\pm0.0002$. With a rest-frame coverage of 4300-7900 \AA, we have detected H$\rm{\alpha}$, H$\rm{\beta}$, [O III]$\lambda\lambda$4959,5007, [N II]$\lambda\lambda$6548,6583, and [S II]$\lambda$6716 emission lines. The emission line ratios suggest that the ionization in the host galaxy is dominated by star formation. The star formation rate (SFR) derived from the H$\rm{\alpha}$ emission line is $(0.06 \pm 0.01) \ \rm{M_{\odot} \ yr^{-1}}$, and the SED fitting suggests the lower limit of the SFR(UV) is $0.09 \ \rm{M_{\odot} \ yr^{-1}}$. The stellar mass is $(\rm 4.0 \pm 1.8) \times 10^8 \ M_{\odot}$, making the specific star formation rate $\rm log \ sSFR(H\rm \alpha) = -9.8 \pm 0.2 \ yr^{-1}$. The line ratios indicate an upper limit of a metallicity of $\rm 12+log_{10} ([O/H]) \sim 8.5$. As the nearest dwarf host galaxy with a repeating FRB, the activity of FRB 20240114A and the properties of this host galaxy closely resemble those of FRB 20121102A and FRB 20190520B. The H$\rm{\alpha}$-traced dispersion measure (DM) provided by the ionized gas of the host galaxy has a moderate contribution of $\sim 200 \rm \ pc \ cm^{-3}$, assuming a warm ionized gas. We found that the distributions of the stellar mass versus SFR are significantly different between repeating and one-off FRBs, as determined by the MANOVA test with $p=0.0116$.</description>

      <title>Stellar populations from H-band VLT spectroscopy in a sample of seven active galaxies</title>

Abstract: The relationship between an active galactic nucleus (AGN) and its host galaxy is still far from being understood. Properties of the host galaxies of Seyfert nuclei, such as luminosity concentration, morphological type, metallicity, and age of the stellar population are expected to be related with nuclear activity -- either at the epoch of galaxy formation or in the present days via feeding of the central black-hole. In this paper we investigate whether stellar ages and metallicities are linked to the activity within the nucleus in a sample of AGN of various types. Our sample includes seven AGN, from Seyfert 1 to LINERs, observed with VLT/ISAAC and VLT/SINFONI. Based on an inverse method using a stellar library, we analyse H band infrared spectra, in a wavelength region devoid of emission lines, at a spectral resolution of about 3000, in the central few 100 pc. HST images are used to visualise the regions defined in each galaxy. For each galaxy, we give the results of the spectral synthesis, in particular the percentages of the stellar, power law and blackbody continua, and the percentages of various stellar types that account for the stellar lines. Out of the seven galaxies, three show strong and recent star formation in the inner 100 pc, while no star formation is detected in the three genuine Seyfert 2 galaxies. Beyond a radius of 100 pc, all show more or less recent star formation. Moreover we can conclude that the star formation history of the inner nucleus is highly heterogeneous.</description>
