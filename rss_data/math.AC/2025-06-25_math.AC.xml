      <title>On complete integral closedness of the $p$-adic completion of absolute integral closure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fix a prime $p$ and let $(R,\mathfrak{m})$ be a Noetherian complete local domain of mixed characteristic $(0,p)$ with fraction field $K$. Let $R^+$ denote the absolute integral closure of $R$, which is the integral closure of $R$ in an algebraic closure $\overline{K}$ of $K$. The first author has shown that $\widehat{R^+}$, the $p$-adic completion of $R^+$, is an integral domain. In this paper, we prove that $\widehat{R^+}$ is completely integrally closed in $\widehat{R^+}\otimes_{R^+}\overline{K}$, but $\widehat{R^+}$ is not completely integrally closed in its own fraction field when $\dim(R)\geq 2$.</description>

      <title>Free commutative skew braces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The main result of this paper is an explicit construction of the free commutative skew brace -- that is, a skew brace whose circle group is commutative -- on an arbitrary generating set $X$. We embed this object into a set of rational functions and show that a simple linear equation characterizes the image of this embedding. As a consequence, comparing elements in this skew brace is no more difficult than comparing elements in the free commutative group generated by $X$.</description>

      <title>Projective length, phantom extensions, and the structure of torsion modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.03477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2102.03477v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The notion of phantom extension of order a given ordinal $\alpha $ has been introduced in collaboration with Casarosa, as an algebraic analogue of the order of a phantom map in topology, to study the structure of flat modules. In this companion paper we characterize phantom extension of \emph{torsion} modules over a countable Dedekind domain $R$. After localizing, one can assume that $R$ is a discrete valuation domain with maximal ideal generated by $p\in R$. In this case, the phantom extensions of order $\alpha $ of a countable torsion module are precisely the $p^{\omega \left( 1+\alpha\right) }$-pure extensions introduced by Nunke in the 1960s. A module has projective length at most $\alpha $ if and only if it is a projective object with respect to the exact structure defined by phantom extensions of order $\alpha $. We prove that a countable torsion module has projective length at most $\alpha $ if and only if it is reduced and has Ulm length at most $1+\alpha $, if and only if it is the colimit of a presheaf of finite torsion modules over a countable well-founded forest of rank at most $1+\alpha $.</description>

      <title>When is the \'etale open topology a field topology?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.02398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.02398v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the following question: Given a field $K$, when is the \'etale open topology $\mathcal{E}_K$ induced by a field topology? On the positive side, when $K$ is the fraction field of a local domain $R\neq K$, using a weak form of resolution of singularities due to Gabber, we show that $\mathcal{E}_K$ agrees with the $R$-adic topology when $R$ is quasi-excellent and henselian. Various pathologies appear when dropping the quasi-excellence assumption. For locally bounded field topologies, we introduce the notion of generalized t-henselianity (gt-henselianity) following Prestel and Ziegler. We establish the following: For a locally bounded field topology $\tau$, the \'etale open topology is induced by $\tau$ if and only if $\tau$ is gt-henselian and some non-empty \'etale image is $\tau$-bounded open. On the negative side, we obtain that for a pseudo-algebraically closed field $K$, $\mathcal{E}_K$ is never induced by a field topology.</description>

      <title>A classification of finite groups with small Davenport constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00363v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite group. By a sequence over $G$, we mean a finite unordered string of terms from $G$ with repetition allowed, and we say that it is a product-one sequence if its terms can be ordered so that their product is the identity element of $G$. Then, the Davenport constant $\mathsf D (G)$ is the maximal length of a minimal product-one sequence, that is a product-one sequence which cannot be factored into two non-trivial product-one subsequences. The Davenport constant is a combinatorial group invariant that has been studied fruitfully over several decades in additive combinatorics, invariant theory, and factorization theory, etc. Apart from a few cases of finite groups, the precise value of the Davenport constant is unknown. Even in the abelian case, little is known beyond groups of rank at most two. On the other hand, for a fixed positive integer $r$, structural results characterizing which groups $G$ satisfy $\mathsf D (G) = r$ are rare. We only know that there are finitely many such groups. In this paper, we study the classification of finite groups based on the Davenport constant.</description>

      <title>Profinite Rigidity over Noetherian Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10278v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We initiate the study of profinite rigidity for modules over a Noetherian domain: to what extent are these objects determined by their finite images? We establish foundational statements in analogy to classical results in the category of groups. We describe three profinite invariants of modules over any Noetherian domain $\Lambda$. We show that free modules are profinitely rigid when $\Lambda$ satisfies a homological condition, and characterise the profinite genus of all modules when $\Lambda$ is a Dedekind domain. In the case where $\Lambda$ is a PID, we find that all finitely generated modules are profinitely rigid. As an application, we prove that solvable Baumslag--Solitar groups are profinitely rigid in the absolute sense. These are the first examples of absolute profinite rigidity among non-abelian one-relator groups and among non-LERF groups.</description>
