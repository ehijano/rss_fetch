      <title>Numerical investigation of fracture behaviour of polyurethane adhesives under the influence of moisture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polyurethane adhesives are extensively used in manufacturing of the lightweight components. These adhesives are hygroscopic in nature causing the material to degrade their mechanical properties due to ageing under environmental conditions. Polyurethane adhesive shows non-linear rate-dependent behaviour due to viscoelastic properties and assumes nearly incompressible deformation. Finite-strain viscoelastic model is formulated based on the continuum rheological model by combining spring and Maxwell elements in parallel. Nearly incompressible property is considered by decomposing the mechanical free energy into volumetric and isochoric parts. This work focuses on the investigation of the influence of moisture on the fracture behaviour. Phase-field damage model proved to be an efficient method to investigate the fracture behaviour. Therefore, the finite-strain viscoelastic material model is coupled with the phase-field model to investigate fracture behaviour. Material is assumed to be isotropic, therefore the total mechanical energy is considered for bulk degradation. Experiments are conducted on the samples aged for different humid conditions to understand tear strength. These test results are used to identify the phase-field damage material parameters from numerical investigation.</description>

      <title>Rheological properties of acid-induced carboxymethylcellulose hydrogels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cellulose ethers represent a class of water-soluble polymers widely utilized across diverse sectors, spanning from healthcare to the construction industry. This experimental study specifically delves into aqueous suspensions of carboxymethylcellulose (CMC), a polymer that undergoes gel formation in acidic environments due to attractive interactions between hydrophobic patches along its molecular chain. We use rheometry to determine the linear viscoelastic properties of both CMC suspensions and acid-induced gels at various temperatures. Then, applying the time-temperature superposition principle, we construct master curves for the viscoelastic spectra, effectively described by fractional models. The horizontal shift factors exhibit an Arrhenius-like temperature dependence, allowing us to extract activation energies compatible with hydrophobic interactions. Furthermore, we show that acid-induced CMC gels are physical gels that display a reversible yielding transition under external shear. In particular, we discuss the influence of pH on the non-linear viscoelastic response under large-amplitude oscillatory shear. Overall, our results offer a comprehensive description of the linear and non-linear rheological properties of a compelling case of physical hydrogel involving hydrophobic interactions.</description>

      <title>Efficient backward x-ray emission in a finite-length plasma irradiated by a laser pulse of ps duration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by experiments employing ps-long, kilojoule laser pulses, we examined x-ray emission in a finite-length underdense plasma irradiated by such a pulse using two dimensional particle-in-cell simulations. We found that, in addition to the expected forward emission, the plasma also efficiently emits in the backward direction. Our simulations reveal that the backward emission occurs when the laser exits the plasma. The longitudinal plasma electric field generated by the laser at the density down-ramp turns around some of the laser-accelerated electrons and re-accelerates them in the backward direction. As the electrons collide with the laser, they emit hard x-rays. The energy conversion efficiency is comparable to that for the forward emission, but the effective source size is smaller. We show that the ps laser duration is required for achieving a spatial overlap between the laser and the backward energetic electrons. At peak laser intensity of $1.4\times 10^{20}~\rm{W/cm^2}$, backward emitted photons (energies above 100~keV and $10^{\circ}$ divergence angle) account for $2 \times 10^{-5}$ of the incident laser energy. This conversion efficiency is three times higher than that for similarly selected forward emitted photons. The source size of the backward photons ($5~\rm{\mu m}$) is three times smaller than the source size of the forward photons.</description>

      <title>Selective temperature sensing in nanodiamonds using dressed states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Temperature sensing at the nanoscale is a significant experimental challenge. Here, we report an approach using dressed states to make a leading quantum sensor (the nitrogen vacancy (NV) center in diamond) selectively sensitive to temperature, even in the presence of normally-confounding magnetic fields. Using an experimentally straightforward approach, we are able to suppress the magnetic sensitivity of the NV center by a factor of seven while retaining full temperature sensitivity and narrowing the NV center linewidth. These results demonstrate the power of engineering the sensor Hamiltonian using external control fields to enable sensing with improved specificity to target signals.</description>

      <title>Entanglement engineering of optomechanical systems by reinforcement learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entanglement is fundamental to quantum information science and technology, yet controlling and manipulating entanglement -- so-called entanglement engineering -- for arbitrary quantum systems remains a formidable challenge. There are two difficulties: the fragility of quantum entanglement and its experimental characterization. We develop a deep reinforcement-learning (RL) approach to entanglement engineering, in which feedback control together with weak continuous measurement and partial state observation is exploited to generate and maintain desired entanglement. We employ quantum optomechanical systems with linear or nonlinear photon-phonon interactions to demonstrate the workings of our machine-learning-based entanglement engineering protocol. In particular, the RL agent sequentially interacts with one or multiple parallel quantum optomechanical environments, collects trajectories, and updates the policy to maximize the accumulated reward to create and stabilize quantum entanglement over an arbitrary amount of time. The machine-learning-based control principle is applicable to entanglement engineering of experimental quantum systems in general.</description>

      <title>Metasurfaces for infrared multi-modal microscopy: phase contrast and bright field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04576v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Different imaging modalities are used to extract the diverse information carried in an optical field. Two prominent modalities include bright field and phase contrast microscopy that can visualize the amplitude and phase features of a sample, respectively. However, capturing both of these images on the same camera typically requires interchanging optical components. Metasurfaces are ultra-thin nanostructures that can merge both of these operations into a single miniaturized device. Here, a silicon-based metasurface that supports a Mie resonance is demonstrated to perform near-infrared phase contrast and bright field multi-modal microscopy that can be tuned by changing the polarization of the illumination. We performed experiments using optical fields with phase variations synthesized by a spatial light modulator and introduced by propagation through semi-transparent samples, including C. elegans, unstained human prostate cancer cells and breast tissue. The results demonstrate the potential of metasurfaces for label-free point-of-care testing.</description>

Abstract: The 3D printing technology based on digital light processing (DLP) has highlighted its powerful manufacturing capabilities for optical components. However, the printing structure obtained by DLP based down projection printing is easily adhered to the printing window below, and the printed lens surface will have a step effect. This article uses DLP 3D printing technology to print non spherical lenses. During the printing process, a new type of inert liquid fluoride solution was used as the isolation layer, which can more effectively and conveniently prevent the printing structure from sticking to the printing window. At the same time, a vertical lifting immersion method was proposed to smooth the step effect on the surface of the lens.</description>

      <title>Embracing Nonlinearity and Geometry: A dimensional analysis guided design of shock absorbing materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Protective applications require energy-absorbing materials that are soft and compressible enough to absorb kinetic energy from impacts, yet stiff enough to bear crushing loads. Achieving this balance requires careful consideration of both mechanical properties and geometric design. Conventional shock-absorbing pads are made of very thick foams that exhibit a plateau of constant stress in their stress-strain response. Contrary to this belief, we report that foams with a nonlinear stress-strain response can be useful to achieve simultaneously thin and lightweight protective pads. We introduce a new framework for the thickness or volume-constrained design of compact and lightweight protective foams while ensuring the desired structural integrity and mechanical performance. Our streamlined dimensional analysis approach provides geometric constraints on the dimensionless thickness and cross-sectional area of a protective foam with a given stress-strain response to limit the acceleration and compressive strain within desired critical limits. We also identify optimal mechanical properties that will result in the most compact and lightest protective foam layer for absorbing a given kinetic energy of impact. Guided by this design framework, we achieve optimal protective properties in hierarchically architected vertically aligned carbon nanotube (VACNT) foams, enabling next generation protective applications in extreme environments.</description>

      <title>Experimental Evaluation of All-Optical Up- and Down-Conversion of 3GPP 5G NR Signals using an Optomechanical Crystal Cavity Frequency Comb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optomechanical crystal cavities (OMCCs) allow the interaction between localized optical and mechanical modes through the radiation-pressure force. Driving such cavities with blue-detuned lasers relative to the optical resonance can induce a phonon lasing regime where the OMCC supports self-sustained mechanical oscillations. This dynamic state results in a narrow and stable microwave tone that modulates the laser at integer multiples of the mechanical resonance frequency, ultimately creating an optomechanical (OM) frequency comb suitable for microwave photonics applications. OMCCs enable compact, low-cost power-efficient all-photonic processing of multiple microwave signals, crucial for current 5G and future beyond-5G systems, whilst being compatible with silicon integrated photonic circuits. This work reports the experimental demonstration of all-optical multi-frequency up- and down-conversion of 3GPP 5G new-radio (NR) signals from the low- to mid- and extended-mid bands using the first and second harmonics of the frequency comb generated in a silicon OMCC. The OM comb generates up to 6 harmonics in the K-band, which is suitable for microwave photonic applications. The experimental demonstration also evaluates the impact of the phase-noise and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the frequency-converted 5G NR signals when the first and second OMCC harmonics are employed for frequency conversion.</description>

      <title>Dispersive Qubit Readout with Intrinsic Resonator Reset</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04891v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A key challenge in quantum computing is speeding up measurement and initialization. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a dispersive measurement method for superconducting qubits that simultaneously measures the qubit and returns the readout resonator to its initial state. The approach is based on universal analytical pulses and requires knowledge of the qubit and resonator parameters, but needs no direct optimization of the pulse shape, even when accounting for the nonlinearity of the system. Moreover, the method generalizes to measuring an arbitrary number of modes and states. For the qubit readout, we can drive the resonator to $\sim 10^2$ photons and back to $\sim 10^{-3}$ photons in less than $3 \kappa^{-1}$, while still achieving a $T_1$-limited assignment error below 1\%. We also present universal pulse shapes and experimental results for qutrit readout.</description>

Abstract: As an important optical component, lens is widely used in scientific inquiry and production. At present, lens manufacturing mainly relies on grinding, polishing and other methods. However, these methods often require expensive equipment and complex processes. This paper presents a method of injecting liquid material into the frame structure and curing it quickly. At the same time, based on the principle of energy minimization, we give a set of theory that can accurately predict the lens face shape, and give the simulation results by software. In this paper, 3D printing technology was used to produce different shapes of borders, which were used to produce free-form surface and spherical lens samples. By characterizing their surface contours and optical properties, the practicability of the method was verified. This method has the advantages of low cost, fast forming, high surface smoothness, and can theoretically prepare any size aperture lens, which has great potential for development.</description>

Abstract: Edholm's Law predicts exponential growth in data rate and spectrum bandwidth for communications and is forecasted to remain true for the upcoming deployment of 6G. Compounding this issue is the exponentially increasing demand for deep neural network (DNN) compute, including DNNs for signal processing. However, the slowing of Moore's Law due to the limitations of transistor-based electronics means that completely new paradigms for computing will be required to meet these increasing demands for advanced communications. Optical neural networks (ONNs) are promising DNN accelerators with ultra-low latency and energy consumption. Yet state-of-the-art ONNs struggle with scalability and implementing linear with in-line nonlinear operations. Here we introduce our multiplicative analog frequency transform ONN (MAFT-ONN) that encodes the data in the frequency domain, achieves matrix-vector products in a single shot using photoelectric multiplication, and uses a single electro-optic modulator for the nonlinear activation of all neurons in each layer. We experimentally demonstrate the first hardware accelerator that computes fully-analog deep learning on raw RF signals, performing single-shot modulation classification with 85% accuracy, where a 'majority vote' multi-measurement scheme can boost the accuracy to 95% within 5 consecutive measurements. In addition, we demonstrate frequency-domain finite impulse response (FIR) linear-time-invariant (LTI) operations, enabling a powerful combination of traditional and AI signal processing. We also demonstrate the scalability of our architecture by computing nearly 4 million fully-analog multiplies-and-accumulates for MNIST digit classification. Our latency estimation model shows that due to the Shannon capacity-limited analog data movement, MAFT-ONN is hundreds of times faster than traditional RF receivers operating at their theoretical peak performance.</description>

      <title>Emergence of odd elasticity in a microswimmer using deep reinforcement learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01973v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use the Deep Q-Network with reinforcement learning to investigate the emergence of odd elasticity in an elastic microswimmer model. For an elastic microswimmer, it is challenging to obtain the optimized dynamics due to the intricate elastohydrodynamic interactions. However, our machine-trained model adopts a novel transition strategy (the waiting behavior) to optimize the locomotion. For the trained microswimmers, we evaluate the performance of the cycles by the product of the loop area (called non-reciprocality) and the loop frequency, and show that the average swimming velocity is proportional to the performance. By calculating the force-displacement correlations, we obtain the effective odd elasticity of the microswimmer to characterize its non-reciprocal dynamics. This emergent odd elasticity is shown to be closely related to the loop frequency of the cyclic deformation. Our work demonstrates the utility of machine learning in achieving optimal dynamics for elastic microswimmers and introduces post-analysis methods to extract crucial physical quantities such as non-reciprocality and odd elasticity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.02492v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One challenge of using nonlinear optical phenomena for practical applications is the need to perform phase-matching. Recently, epsilon-near-zero materials have been shown to demonstrate strong optical nonlinearities, in addition to their other unique properties. As suggested by their name, the permittivity of the material is close to zero for a certain wavelength range. We demonstrate that this small permittivity allows for efficient three-wave mixing interactions to take place in indium-tin-oxide thin films without the need for phase matching the pump and signal beams. The efficiency of the second-order nonlinear interactions is characterized, and cascaded three-wave mixing is demonstrated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01963v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The significance of mass spectrometry lies in its unparalleled ability to accurately identify and quantify molecules in complex samples, providing invaluable insights into molecular structures and interactions. Here, we leverage diamond nanostructures as highly sensitive mass sensors by utilizing a self-excitation mechanism under an electron beam in a conventional scanning electron microscope (SEM). The diamond molecular balance (DMB) exhibits exceptional mass resolution of a few MDa and an extensive dynamic range from MDa to TDa, positioning itself as a forefront molecular balance operating at room temperature. Notably, the DMB measures the mass of a single bacteriophage T4, achieving a mass resolution of 4.7 MDa for an analyte at 184 MDa, while precisely determining their positional information on the device. These findings highlight the groundbreaking potential of the DMB as a revolutionary tool for mass analysis at room temperature.</description>
