      <title>Coexistence of positive and negative information in information-epidemic dynamics on multiplex networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the coexistence of positive and negative information in the context of information-epidemic dynamics on multiplex networks. In accordance with the tenets of mean field theory, we present not only the analytic solution of the prevalence threshold, but also the coexistence conditions of two distinct forms of information (i.e., the two phase transition points at which a single form of information becomes extinct). In regions where multiple forms of information coexist, two completely distinct patterns emerge: monotonic and non-monotonic. The physical mechanisms that give rise to these different patterns have also been elucidated. The theoretical results are robust with regard to the network structure and show a high degree of agreement with the findings of the Monte Carlo simulation.</description>

      <title>Fractional and fractal extensions of epidemiological models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One way to study the spread of disease is through mathematical models. The most successful models compartmentalize the host population according to their infectious stage, e.g., susceptible (S), infected (I), exposed (E), and recovered (R). The composition of these compartments leads to the SI, SIS, SIR, and SEIR models. In this Chapter, we present and compare three formulations of SI, SIS, SIR, and SEIR models in the framework of standard (integer operators), fractional (Caputo sense), and fractal derivatives (Hausdorff sense). As an application of the SI model, we study the evolution of AIDS cases in Bangladesh from 2001 to 2021. For this case, our simulations suggest that fractal formulation describes the data well. For the SIS model, we consider syphilis data from Brazil from 2006 to 2017. In this case, the three frameworks describe the data with good accuracy. We used data from Influenza A to adjust the SIR model in previous approaches and observed that the fractional formulation was better. The last application considers the COVID-19 data from India in the range 2020-04-10 to 2020-12-31 to adjust the parameters of the SEIR model. The standard formulation fits the data better than the other approaches. As a common result, all models exhibit steady solutions in the different formulations. The time to reach a steady solution is correlated to the considered approach. The standard and fractal formulations reach the steady state earlier when compared with the fractional formulation.</description>

      <title>Tournament design: A review from an operational research perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05034v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Every sport needs rules. Tournament design refers to the rules that determine how a tournament, a series of games between a number of competitors, is organized. This study aims to provide an overview of the tournament design literature from the perspective of operational research. Three important design criteria are discussed: efficacy, fairness, and attractiveness. Our survey classifies the papers discussing these properties according to the main components of tournament design: format, seeding, draw, scheduling, and ranking. We also outline several open questions and promising directions for future research.</description>

      <title>Female representation across mythologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11482v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Social groups have been studied throughout history to understand how different configurations impact those within them. Along with this came the interest in investigating social groups of both fictional and mythological works. Over the last decade these social groups have been studied through the lens of network science allowing for a new level of comparison between these stories. We use this approach to focus on the attributes of the characters within these networks, specifically looking at their gender. With this we review how the female populations within various narratives and to some extent the societies they are based in are portrayed. Through this we find that although there is not a trend of all narratives of the same origin having similar levels of representation some are noticeably better than others. We also observe which narratives overall prioritise important female characters and which do not.</description>

      <title>Crossing the disciplines - a starter toolkit for researchers who wish to explore early Irish literature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11858v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The inspiration behind this paper came from both authors' long-term collaboration with our friend and colleague, Professor Ralph Kenna. This connection emerged initially through his interest in Rathcroghan and in our paper, `Exploring the Nature of the Fr\'aoch Saga', which we concluded with the statement that we believed it `presents a case that will hopefully ignite conversation between disciplines'. This led us to consider the potential value for researchers of compiling a template list of useful and reliable sources and resources to consult, in other words a type of starter toolkit or guide for any individual from an alternative discipline or background, who might possess, or, in time, develop a personal or professional interest in Early Ireland and Early Irish literature. In doing this, we decided for ease of illustration, to take the example of the location name Rathcroghan/Cruachan A\'i, (the prehistoric Royal Site of Connacht in the west of Ireland and the place that we both work in and interact with on a daily basis), as a case study in order to demonstrate an initial methodological approach to not only the types of resources and information available, but also to highlight some potential pitfalls that may arise in the course of an investigation.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the role of supernatural entities and the effect of missing data in Irish sagas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12071v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For over a decade, complex networks have been applied to mythological texts in order to quantitatively compare them. This has allowed us to identify similarities between texts in different cultures, as well as to quantify the significance of some heroic characters. Analysing a full mythology of a culture requires gathering data from many individual myths which is time consuming and often impractical. In this work, we attempt to bypass this by analysing the network of characters in a dictionary of mythological characters. We show that the top characters identified by different centrality measures are consistent with central figures in the Irish sagas. Although much of Irish mythology has been lost, we demonstrate that these most central characters are highly robust to a large random removal of edges.</description>

      <title>Emergent Strategies for Shepherding a Flock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.04352v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate how a shepherd should move to effectively herd a flock towards a target. Using an agent-based (ABM) and a coarse-grained (ODE) model for the flock, we pose and solve for the optimal strategy of a shepherd that must keep the flock cohesive and coerce it towards a target. Three distinct strategies emerge naturally as a function of the scaled herd size {and} the scaled shepherd speed: (i) mustering, where the shepherd circles the herd to ensure compactness, (ii) droving, where the shepherd chases the herd in a desired direction while sweeping back and forth, and (iii) driving, where the flock surrounds a shepherd that drives it from within. A minimal dynamical model for the size, shape, and position of the herd captures the effective behavior of the ABM and further allows us to characterize the different herding strategies in terms of the behavior of the shepherd that librates (mustering), oscillates (droving), or moves steadily (driving).</description>

      <title>Collective memory, consensus, and learning explained by social cohesion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14386v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Humans cluster in social groups where they discuss their shared past, problems, and potential solutions; they learn collectively when they repeat activities; they synchronize when they sing or dance together; and they bond through social cohesion. Intuitively, a group is more cohesive if people are closer together in their network and are bonded by multiple connections. This intuition is made precise by the second smallest eigenvalue of the Laplacian matrix of the group network, called the algebraic connectivity. This measure is key to explaining and predicting the outcomes of said activities.</description>

      <title>Wastewater-based Epidemiology for COVID-19 Surveillance and Beyond: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15291v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The pandemic of COVID-19 has imposed tremendous pressure on public health systems and social economic ecosystems over the past years. To alleviate its social impact, it is important to proactively track the prevalence of COVID-19 within communities. The traditional way to estimate the disease prevalence is to estimate from reported clinical test data or surveys. However, the coverage of clinical tests is often limited and the tests can be labor-intensive, requires reliable and timely results, and consistent diagnostic and reporting criteria. Recent studies revealed that patients who are diagnosed with COVID-19 often undergo fecal shedding of SARS-CoV-2 virus into wastewater, which makes wastewater-based epidemiology for COVID-19 surveillance a promising approach to complement traditional clinical testing. In this paper, we survey the existing literature regarding wastewater-based epidemiology for COVID-19 surveillance and summarize the current advances in the area. Specifically, we have covered the key aspects of wastewater sampling, sample testing, and presented a comprehensive and organized summary of wastewater data analytical methods. Finally, we provide the open challenges on current wastewater-based COVID-19 surveillance studies, aiming to encourage new ideas to advance the development of effective wastewater-based surveillance systems for general infectious diseases.</description>
