      <title>Rough sets semantics for the three-valued extension of first-order Priest's da Costa logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a rough sets semantics for the three-valued extension of first-order Priest's da Costa logic, which we studied in a previous paper. The semantics follows the usual pattern of the semantics for first-order classical logic.</description>

      <title>Cyclic system for an algebraic theory of alternating parity automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: $\omega$-regular languages are a natural extension of the regular languages to the setting of infinite words. Likewise, they are recognised by a host of automata models, one of the most important being Alternating Parity Automata (APAs), a generalisation of B\"uchi automata that symmetrises both the transitions (with universal as well as existential branching) and the acceptance condition (by a parity condition).
  In this work we develop a cyclic proof system manipulating APAs, represented by an algebraic notation of Right Linear Lattice expressions. This syntax dualises that of previously introduced Right Linear Algebras, which comprised a notation for non-deterministic finite automata (NFAs). This dualisation induces a symmetry in the proof systems we design, with lattice operations behaving dually on each side of the sequent. Our main result is the soundness and completeness of our system for $\omega$-language inclusion, heavily exploiting game theoretic techniques from the theory of $\omega$-regular languages.</description>

      <title>Anti-classification results for conjugacy of diffeomorphisms on manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the topological conjugacy relation of diffeomorphisms on any manifold of dimension at least 2 is not classifiable by countable structures. This answers a question of Foreman and Gorodetski. We also prove that $E_0$ is reducible into the topological conjugacy relation of minimal diffeomorphisms on the 2-torus, which answers a question of Foreman.</description>

      <title>SAD Neural Networks: Divergent Gradient Flows and Asymptotic Optimality via o-minimal Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study gradient flows for loss landscapes of fully connected feed forward neural networks with commonly used continuously differentiable activation functions such as the logistic, hyperbolic tangent, softplus or GELU function. We prove that the gradient flow either converges to a critical point or diverges to infinity while the loss converges to an asymptotic critical value. Moreover, we prove the existence of a threshold $\varepsilon&gt;0$ such that the loss value of any gradient flow initialized at most $\varepsilon$ above the optimal level converges to it. For polynomial target functions and sufficiently big architecture and data set, we prove that the optimal loss value is zero and can only be realized asymptotically. From this setting, we deduce our main result that any gradient flow with sufficiently good initialization diverges to infinity. Our proof heavily relies on the geometry of o-minimal structures. We confirm these theoretical findings with numerical experiments and extend our investigation to real-world scenarios, where we observe an analogous behavior.</description>

      <title>Fine structure from normal iterability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.10037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2011.10037v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that (i) the standard fine structural properties for premice follow from normal iterability (whereas the classical proof relies on iterability for stacks of normal trees), and (ii) every mouse which is finitely generated above its projectum, is an iterate of its core.
  That is, let $m$ be an integer and let $M$ be an $m$-sound, $(m,\omega_1+1)$-iterable premouse. Then (i) $M$ is $(m+1)$-solid and $(m+1)$-universal, $(m+1)$ condensation holds for $M$, and if $m\geq 1$ then $M$ is super-Dodd-sound, a slight strengthening of Dodd-soundness. And (ii) if there is $x\in M$ such that $M$ is the $\mathrm{r}\Sigma_{m+1}$-hull of parameters in $\rho_{m+1}^M\cup\{x\}$, then $M$ is a normal iterate of its $(m+1)$-core $C=\mathfrak{C}_{m+1}(M)$; in fact, there is an $m$-maximal iteration tree $\mathcal{T}$ on $C$, of finite length, such that $M=M^{\mathcal{T}}_\infty$, and $i^{\mathcal{T}}_{0\infty}$ is just the core embedding.
  Applying fact (ii), we prove that if $M\models\mathrm{ZFC}$ is a mouse and $W\subseteq M$ is a ground of $M$ via a strategically $\sigma$-closed forcing $\mathbb{P}\in W$, and if $M|\aleph_1^M\in W$ (that is, the initial segment of $M$ of height $\aleph_1^M$ is in $W$), then the forcing is trivial; that is, $M\subseteq W$.
  And if there is a measurable cardinal, then there is a non-solid premouse.
  The results hold for premice with Mitchell-Steel indexing, allowing extenders of superstrong type to appear on the extender sequence.</description>

      <title>Fra\"{i}ss\'{e}'s Conjecture and big Ramsey degrees of structures admitting finite monomorphic decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20307v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we show that a countable structure admitting a finite monomorphic decomposition has finite big Ramsey degrees if and only if so does every monomorphic part in its minimal monomorphic decomposition. The necessary prerequisite for this result is the characterization of monomorphic structures with finite big Ramsey degrees: a countable monomorphic structure has finite big Ramsey degrees if and only if it is chainable by a chain with finite big Ramsey degrees. Interestingly, both characterizations require deep structural properties of chains. Fra\"{i}ss\'{e}'s Conjecture (actually, its positive resolution due to Laver) is instrumental in the characterization of monomorphic structures with finite big Ramsey degrees, while the analysis of big Ramsey combinatorics of structures admitting a finite monomorphic decomposition requires a product Ramsey theorem for big Ramsey degrees. We find this last result particularly intriguing because big Ramsey degrees misbehave notoriously when it comes to general product statements.</description>
