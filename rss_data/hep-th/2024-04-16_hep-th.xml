      <title>Quantum effective dynamics of the Calogero-Sutherland model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the quantum dynamics described by the effective field theory of the Calogero-Sutherland model in terms of fields that carry representations of the W-infinity algebra. Our formulation of the effective theory is based in the standard procedure in conformal field theory, in which the Hilbert space is completely known a priori in terms of irreducible representations of the sym- metry algebra, and not by the diagonalization of the hamiltonian. For the purposes of comparison with alternative effective theories based on quantum hydrodynamics, we consider one chirality and study the hamiltonian equation of motion of the density field, which is shown to obey the quantum Benjamin- Ono equation, in agreement with previous hydrodynamic results. In this study, all calculations are performed at the quantum operator level, without making any assumption on the semiclassical limit of the fields and their equations of motion. We consider this result to be a reliable indication of the equivalence between the quantum field theoric and quantum hydrodynamical formulations of the effective theories of the Calogero-Sutherland model.</description>

      <title>Wormholes and Factorization in Exact Effective Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the general framework of effective theories obtained via exact path integration of a complete theory over some sector of its degrees of freedom. Theories constructed this way contain multi-integrals which couple fields arbitrarily far apart, and in certain settings even on path-disconnected components of the space. These are not just entanglement, but genuine non-local interactions that we dub quantum wormholes.
  Any state the path integral of such an effective theory prepares is shown to be a partial trace of a state of the complete theory over the integrated-out sector. The resulting reduced density operator is generally mixed due to bra-ket wormholes. An infinite family of ensembles of pure states of the complete theory giving the same effective state is identified. These allow one to equivalently interpret any effective state as being prepared by an ensemble of theories. When computing entropic quantities, bra-ket wormholes give rise to replica wormholes. This causes replica path integrals for the effective theory to not factorize even when the underlying manifold does, as expected from mixing. In contrast, effective theories obtained by derivative expansions have no quantum wormholes and prepare pure states. There exist operators in the algebra of effective theories which can distinguish mixed from pure states, implying a breakdown of non-exact effective theories for sufficiently complex observables.
  This framework unifies and provides new insights into much of the phenomena observed in quantum gravity, including the interplay between wormholes and unitarity, the breakdown of bulk effective theory, the factorization puzzle, state ensembles, theory ensembles, quantum error correction, and baby universes. Some interesting lessons are drawn accounting also for characteristic aspects of gravity concerning IR/UV mixing and Kaluza-Klein reductions.</description>

      <title>JT gravity from non-Abelian T-duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the geometries obtained by performing super non-Abelian T-duality of the Principal Chiral Model on OSp$(1|2)$. While the initial model represents an appropriate 3D supergravity background, interpretable as the superspace version of AdS$_{3}$, the T-dual model fails solving the 3D supergravity torsion constraints. We argue that this has to do with a factorisation pattern taking place under dualisation: the dual 3D geometry can be rewritten as the supersymmetric version of AdS$_{2}$, satisfying the supergravity constraints, fibered over what we interpret as the superspace equivalent of the standard bosonic line. We discuss an interesting connection between T-duals of generic Principal Chiral Models and Poisson sigma models. We exploit it to show that in a suitable limit the dual action studied in this work gives rise to JT (super)gravity.</description>

      <title>Dark Dimension and the Effective Field Theory limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In [1] we pointed out that in the Dark Dimension scenario [2] theoretical issues arise when the prediction for the vacuum energy $\rho$, that is obtained from swampland conjectures in string theory, is confronted with the corresponding result for $\rho$ in the field theory limit. One of the problems arises from the field theory side and is due to previous results for $\rho$ that, according to our analysis, turn out to be incorrect, although widely spread. Our work was challenged in [3]. Here we show why in our opinion the claims in [3] are inconsistent, actually based on arguments deprived of physical meaning, providing further support to our findings. We conclude by discussing ideas on the physical mechanism that could trigger the suppression of large UV contributions to $\rho$.</description>

      <title>Quantum backreactions in (A)dS3 massive gravity and logarithmic asymptotic behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the interplay between higher curvature terms and the backreaction of quantum fluctuations in 3-dimensional massive gravity in asymptotically (Anti-)de Sitter space. We focus on the theory at the special point of the parameter space where the two maximally symmetric vacua coincide. In the case of positive cosmological constant, this corresponds to the partially massless point, at which the classical theory admits de Sitter black holes and exhibits an extra conformal symmetry at linear level. We explicitly find the quantum corrected black hole geometry in the semiclassical approximation and show that it induces a relaxation of the standard asymptotic conditions. Nonetheless, the new asymptotic behavior is still preserved by an infinite-dimensional algebra, which, in addition to Virasoro, contains logarithmic supertranslations. Finally, we show that all the results we obtain for the quadratic massive gravity theory can be extended to theories including cubic and quartic terms in the curvature.</description>

      <title>Higher-curvature gravity in AdS$_3$, holographic $c$-theorems and black hole microstates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct higher-derivative gravity theories in three dimensions that admit holographic $c$-theorems and exhibit a unique maximally symmetric vacuum, at arbitrary order $n$ in the curvature. We show that these theories exhibit special properties, the most salient ones being the decoupling of ghost modes around Anti-de Sitter (AdS) space, the enhancement of symmetries at linearized level, and the existence of a one-parameter generalization of the Ba\~nados-Teitelboim-Zanelli (BTZ) black hole that, while being asymptotically AdS, is not of constant curvature but rather exhibits a curvature singularity. For such black holes, we provide a holographic derivation of their thermodynamics. This gives a microscopic picture of black hole thermodynamics for non-supersymmetric solutions, of non-constant curvature in higher-derivative theories of arbitrary order in the curvature.</description>

      <title>On the gauge invariance of the higher-derivative Yang-Mills-Chern-Simons action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the perturbative generation of the gauge invariant effective action for the non-Abelian gauge field in a $(2+1)$-dimensional spacetime. We present a detailed analysis of the two, three and four-point functions in order to determine the non-Abelian Chern-Simons terms (parity odd) and Yang-Mills terms (parity even). Moreover, these terms are supplemented by the higher-derivative corrections which resulted in the Alekseev-Arbuzov-Baikov effective action (parity even) plus the higher-derivative corrections to the Chern-Simons terms (parity odd). In order to highlight some features about the perturbative generation of the effective action, we present a discussion based on the dimensional analysis, which allows us to establish the general structure of the permissible terms to guarantee the gauge invariance of the higher-derivative parts.</description>

      <title>On the spectrum of open strings in the Hard-Wall model of AdS/QCD: the role of $S^5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of a classical open string representing a meson in the hard-wall geometry and consider the $S^5$ compact space. The existence of a confining region due to the hard cut-off leads to a discrete set of string configurations parameterized by the number of complete turnarounds $S^5$ great circles. On the one hand, for a given angular momentum, there is a discrete set of possible separations, and the confined quarks on the boundary are restrict to a lattice. On the other hand, for a given separation in the confining region, there is a discrete set of permitted values for the angular momentum. The $q\bar{q}$ potential is linear for large separations, and the string tension is very sensitive to the angular momentum.</description>

      <title>Holographic Renormalization Group and Stress Tensor Operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The holographic duality conjectures a relation between strongly coupled quantum systems and quantum gravity in higher-dimensional spacetimes. Gravitational theories in two and three dimensions are meaningful examples for classical and quantum exploration due to their unique characteristics, notably the absence of propagating bulk degrees of freedom and the presence of only boundary degrees of freedom, distinguishing them from higher-dimensional counterparts. These gravitational theories exhibit complex interactions when the bulk spacetime has a finite size, regulated by Zamolodchikov's double-trace irrelevant $T\overline{T}$ operator.
  This thesis aims to gain a holographic understanding of $\mathrm{AdS}_3$ and JT gravity under the influence of the $T\overline{T}$ deformation. Under a finite radial cutoff, these theories exhibit perturbative behavior that implies the emergence of the Nambu-Goto action for the corresponding boundary graviton action. We also conducted semi-classical calculations of observables related to finite-cutoff gravity and its dual $T\overline{T}$-deformed CFT description, including correlation functions involving stress tensors and gravitational Wilson lines, along with an analysis of their supersymmetric extensions. Additionally, we explored the implications of general stress tensor deformations within field-theoretic and holographic settings.
  This thesis integrates previously adapted publications while also pioneering new ground, notably exploring the definition of a quantum $T\overline{T}$ operator beyond two dimensions with $\frac{1}{N}$ corrections, investigating quantum-corrected higher point correlators for a planar boundary, and offering insights into a two-dimensional spherical boundary at a finite cutoff. Furthermore, throughout the thesis, we show more details in calculations at various points.</description>

      <title>The semi-classical saddles in three-dimensional gravity via holography and mini-superspace approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We determine the complex geometries dual to the semi-classical saddles in three-dimensional gravity with positive or negative cosmological constant. We examine the semi-classical saddles in Liouville field theory and interpret them in terms of gravity theory. For this, we describe the gravity theory by Chern Simons theory and classify the possible saddles based on homotopy group argument. We further realize the semi-classical saddles using the mini-superspace model of quantum gravity and explicitly determine the integral contour. In the case of positive cosmological constant, we recovered the geometry used for no-boundary proposal of Hartle and Hawking. In the case of negative cosmological constant, the geometry can be identified with Euclidean anti-de Sitter space attached with imaginary radius spheres. The geometry should be unphysical and several arguments on this issue are provided. Partial results were already presented in our earlier letter, and more detailed derivations and explanations on the results are given along with additional results. In particular, we reproduce the classical Liouville action from the Chern-Simons formulation of dual gravity theory.</description>

      <title>How does Casimir energy fall in $\kappa$-deformed space-time?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the response of Casimir energies to fluctuations in a scalar field in a weak gravitational field in the $\kappa$-deformed space-time. We model the Casimir plates in a gravitational field by $\kappa$-deformed Rindler coordinates and calculate the Casimir energy using the $\kappa$-deformed scalar field. We show that the Casimir energy accelerates in a weak gravitational field like a mass. Thus, our calculations show that the mass-energy equivalence principle holds in $\kappa$-deformed space-time even though a length scale is introduced through space-time non-commutativity.</description>

      <title>Classification of the Mott gap</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we demonstrate the classification of the gap in a holographic setup by studying the density of states. A gap can be classified into order gap and Mott gap depending on the presence of the order due to the symmetry breaking or not. A Mott insulating gap appears in the fermion spectrum due to the strong Coulomb interaction between the electrons. We then classify all Mott gaps as well as order gaps in one-flavor and two-flavor fermions. We also identified possible non-minimal interactions that may produce a flatband.</description>

      <title>Gauge theory is about the geometry of internal spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In general relativity, the strong equivalence principle is underpinned by a geometrical interpretation of fields on spacetime: all fields and bodies probe the same geometry. This geometric interpretation implies that the parallel transport of all spacetime tensors and spinors is dictated by a single affine connection. Can something similar be said about gauge theory? Agreed, in gauge theory different symmetry groups rule the interactions of different types of charges, so we cannot expect to find the same kind of universality found in the gravitational case. Nonetheless, the parallel transport of all the fields that are charged under the same symmetry group is dictated by a single 'gauge connection', and they all transform jointly under a gauge transformation. Is this kind of 'restricted universality' as geometrically underpinned as in general relativity? Here I argue that it is. The key difference is that the gauge geometry concerns 'internal', as opposed to 'external', spaces. The gauge symmetry of the standard model is thus understood as merely the automorphism group of an internal geometric structure -- $C^3\otimes C^2\otimes C^1$ endowed with an orientation and canonical inner product -- in the same way as spacetime symmetries (such as Poincare transformations), are understood as the automorphism group of an external geometric structure (respectively, a Minkowski metric). And the Ehresmann connection can then be understood as determining parallelism for this internal geometry.</description>

      <title>Strong-weak symmetry and quantum modularity of resurgent topological strings on local $\mathbb{P}^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantizing the mirror curve to a toric Calabi-Yau threefold gives rise to quantum operators whose fermionic spectral traces produce factorially divergent formal power series in the Planck constant and its inverse. These are conjecturally captured by the Nekrasov-Shatashvili and standard topological string free energies, respectively, via the TS/ST correspondence. The resurgent structures of the first fermionic spectral trace of local $\mathbb{P}^2$ in both weak and strong coupling limits were solved exactly by the second author in [1]. Here, we take the perspective of the Stokes constants and their generating functions. We prove that a full-fledged strong-weak resurgent symmetry is at play, exchanging the perturbative/nonperturbative contributions to the holomorphic and anti-holomorphic blocks in the factorization of the spectral trace. This relies on a global net of relations connecting the perturbative series and the discontinuities in the dual regimes, which is built upon the analytic properties of the $L$-functions with coefficients given by the Stokes constants and the $q$-series acting as their generating functions. Then, we show that the latter are holomorphic quantum modular forms for $\Gamma_1(3)$ and are reconstructed by the median resummation of their asymptotic expansions.</description>

      <title>Universal distributions of overlaps from unitary dynamics in generic quantum many-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the preparation of a quantum state using a circuit of depth $t$ from a factorized state of $N$ sites. We argue that in the appropriate scaling limit of large $t$ and $N$, the overlap between states evolved under generic many-body chaotic dynamics belongs to a family of universal distribution that generalizes the celebrated Porter-Thomas distribution. This is a consequence of a mapping in the space of replicas to a model of dilute domain walls. Our result provides a rare example in which analysis at an arbitrary number of replicas is possible, giving rise to the complete overlap distribution. Our general picture is derived and corroborated by the exact solution of the random phase model and of an emergent random matrix model given by the Ginibre ensemble. Finally, numerical simulations of two distinct random circuits show excellent agreement, thereby demonstrating universality.</description>

Abstract: We perform in this work an analysis of the background dynamics for $\alpha$-attractor models in the context of loop quantum cosmology. Particular attention is given to the determination of the duration of the inflationary phase that is preceded by the quantum bounce in these models. From an analysis of the general predictions for these models, it is shown that we can be able to put constraints in the parameter $\alpha$ of the potentials and also on the quantum model itself, in special the Barbero-Immirzi parameter.</description>

      <title>A solvable non-unitary fermionic long-range model with extended symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define and study a long-range version of the XX model, arising as the free-fermion point of the XXZ-type Haldane-Shastry (HS) chain. It has a simple realisation via non-unitary fermions, based on the free-fermion Temperley-Lieb algebra, and may also be viewed as an alternating $\mathfrak{gl}(1|1)$ spin chain. Even and odd length behave very differently; we focus on odd length. The model is integrable, and we explicitly identify two commuting hamiltonians. While non-unitary, their spectrum is real by PT-symmetry. One hamiltonian is chiral and quadratic in fermions, while the other is parity-invariant and quartic. Their one-particle spectra have two linear branches, realising a massless relativistic dispersion on the lattice. The appropriate fermionic modes arise from 'quasi-translation' symmetry, which replaces ordinary translation symmetry. The model exhibits exclusion statistics, like for the isotropic HS chain, with even more 'extended symmetry' and larger degeneracies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using Ernst formalism, stationary axisymmetric black hole solution in Einstein-dark matter-dark energy gravity has been elaborated. The dark sector was chosen as dark photon concept, where an auxiliary U(1)-gauge field coupled to ordinary Maxwell one was introduced, while dark energy was modelled by the existence of positive cosmological constant. Refining our studies to the case of vanishing cosmological constant, the uniqueness theorem for the black hole in question has been proved.</description>

      <title>Scalar field dark matter with time-varying equation of state</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new model of scalar field dark matter interacting with dark energy. Adopting a fluid description of the dark matter field in the regime of rapid oscillations, we find that the equation of state for dark matter is non-zero and even becomes increasingly negative at late times during dark energy domination. Furthermore, the speed of sound of dark matter is non-vanishing at all length scales, and a non-adiabatic pressure contribution arises. The results indicate that there are still unexplored possible interactions within the dark sector that lead to novel background effects and can impact structure formation processes.</description>

      <title>Anomaly of Subsystem Symmetries in Exotic and Foliated $BF$ Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the mixed 't Hooft anomaly of the subsystem symmetries in the exotic $BF$ theory and the foliated $BF$ theory in 2+1 dimensions, both of which are fractonic quantum field theories describing the equivalent physics. In the anomaly inflow mechanism, the 't Hooft anomaly of the subsystem symmetries can be cancelled by combining a subsystem symmetry-protected topological (SSPT) phase in one dimension higher. In this work, we construct the exotic and foliated $BF$ theories with background gauge fields and the exotic and foliated forms of the SSPT phases using the foliated-exotic duality. In the foliated form, we see that the non-topological operator can be viewed as a symmetry-like operator. We also show that the SSPT phases with different foliation structures cancel the same anomaly. This may provide a clue to the characterization of the 't Hooft anomaly of subsystem symmetries.</description>

      <title>Modulating Hamiltonian Approach to Quantum Many-Body Systems and Crystalline Topological Phases Protected by Generalized Magnetic Translations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the topology of the parameter space of invertible phases with an onsite symmetry $G$, i.e., quantum many-body ground states that have neither fractionalization nor spontaneous breaking of the symmetry. The classification of invertible phases is known to be obtained by counting the connected components in the parameter space of the invertible phases. We consider its generalization -- the deformation classes of the mappings from $n$-dimensional spheres $S^n$ to this parameter space for arbitrary integer $n$. We argue a direct one-to-one correspondence in the framework of lattice models between the non-contractibility of $S^n$ and (i) the classification of invertible phases in $d$ dimensions when $d\geq n$; or (ii) zero-dimensional invertible Hamiltonians parametrized by $S^{n-d}$ when $d&lt;n$, using an isotropic modulating Hamiltonian approach. Explicitly, we construct the noncontractible spheres of two-dimensional invertible phases, i.e., $n=2$ and $d=2$. We also propose a large class of crystalline topological phases protected by a generalized magnetic translations.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Inflation at the Crossroads</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The capability of Cosmic Inflation to explain the latest Cosmic Microwave Background and Baryonic Acoustic Oscillation data is assessed by performing Bayesian model comparison within the landscape of nearly three-hundred models of single-field slow-roll inflation. We present the first Bayesian data analysis based on the third-order slow-roll primordial power spectra. In particular, the fourth Hubble-flow function $\epsilon_4$ remains unbounded while the third function verifies, at two-sigma, $\epsilon_{3}\in[-0.4,0.5]$, which is perfectly compatible with the slow-roll predictions for the running of the spectral index. We also observe some residual excess of $B$-modes within the BICEP/Keck data favoring, at a non-statistically significant level, non-vanishing primordial tensor modes: $\log(\epsilon_{1}) &gt; -3.9$, at $68\%$ confidence level. Then, for 283 models of single-field inflation, we compute the Bayesian evidence, the Bayesian dimensionality and the marginalized posteriors of all the models' parameters, including the ones associated with the reheating era. The average information gain on the reheating parameter $R_\mathrm{reh}$ reaches $1.3 \pm 0.18$ bits, which is more than a factor two improvement compared to the first Planck data release. As such, inflationary model predictions cannot meet data accuracy without specifying, or marginalizing over, the reheating kinematics. We also find that more than $40\%$ of the scenarios are now strongly disfavored, which shows that the constraining power of cosmological data is winning against the increase of the number of proposed models. In addition, about $20\%$ of all models have evidences within the most probable region and are all favored according to the Jeffreys' scale of Bayesian evidences.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the influence of anti-symmetric tensor effects, which trigger the Lorentz symmetry breaking, on charged spherically symmetric black holes. Initially, we address an overview of the model, laying the groundwork for deriving solutions to black holes. With this, we analyze the horizons, critical orbits, and geodesics. We compute quasinormal modes with a particular emphasis on vectorial perturbations. In addition, we derive the Hawking temperature to perform the calculation of the remnant mass. Additionally, we estimate the lifetime of the black holes until they reach their final stage after the evaporation process. Furthermore, we explore the emission rate, and the deflection angle. Finally, we investigate the correlation between quasinormal modes and shadows.</description>

Abstract: Ultralight bosons can condense to form the so-called bosonic clouds around spinning black holes by superradiance instability. When quantum effects are taken into account, the classical black holes were replaced by exotic compact objects including area quantized black holes. In this work, we consider the superradiant instabilities of massive scalar fields around area quantized Kerr black hole. We introduce the reflectivity of area quantized black hole possesses the distinct discrete feature, and the scalar fields have the superradiant modes solution only within the specific mass range. In addition, the area quantization may terminate the superradiance when the black hole spins down, or even suppress the formation of the bosionic cloud.</description>

Abstract: The quantum vacuum interaction energy between a pair of semitransparent two-dimensional plates represented by Dirac delta potentials and its first derivative, embedded in the topological background of a sine-Gordon kink, is studied through an extension of the TGTG-formula (developped by O. Kenneth and I. Klich in the scattering approach). Quantum vacuum oscillations around the sine-Gordon kink solutions are interpreted as a quantum scalar field theory in the spacetime of a domain wall. Moreover, the relation between the phase shift and the density of states (the well-known Dashen-Hasslacher-Neveu formula) is also exploited to characterize the quantum vacuum energy.</description>

      <title>Does the Cosmological Constant really indicate the existence of a Dark Dimension?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.16548v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been recently proposed that we might live in a universe with a single compact extra dimension, whose mesoscopic size is dictated by the measured value of the cosmological constant. Central to this proposal is the result that in a $4+n$ dimensional theory with $n$ compact dimensions a tower of Kaluza-Klein (KK) states contributes an amount $m_{_{\rm KK}}^4$ to the vacuum energy $\rho_4$, where $m_{_{\rm KK}}$ is the KK scale of the tower. We show that the result $\rho_4 \sim m_{_{\rm KK}}^4$ comes from a mistreatment of the asymptotics of the loop momenta in the $4+n$ original theory. When the latter are correctly treated, new UV-sensitive terms appear in $\rho_4$ that invalidate the prediction of the dark dimension. We also show that, despite recent claims to the contrary, it is always possible to perform consistent effective field theory calculations that include only a finite number of tower states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.04033v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In interacting theories, hydrodynamics describes the universal behavior of states close to local thermal equilibrium at late times and long distances in a gradient expansion. In the hydrodynamic regime of metals, momentum relaxes slowly with a rate $\Gamma$, which formally appears on the right-hand side of the momentum dynamical equation and causes a Drude-like peak in the frequency dependence of the thermoelectric conductivities. Here we study the structure and determine the physical implications of momentum-relaxing gradient corrections beyond Drude, \emph{i.e.} arising at subleading order in the gradient expansion. We find that they effectively renormalize the weight of the Drude pole in the thermoelectric conductivities, and contribute to the dc conductivities at the same order as previously-known gradient corrections of translation-invariant hydrodynamics. Turning on a magnetic field, extra derivative corrections appear and renormalize the cyclotron frequency and the Hall conductivity. This relaxed hydrodynamics provides a field-theoretic explanation for previous results obtained using gauge-gravity duality. In strongly-coupled metals where quasiparticles are short-lived and which may be close to a hydrodynamic regime, the extra contributions we discuss are essential to interpret experimentally measured magneto-thermoelectric conductivities. Specializing to metals close to a Fermi liquid phase, the effective mass measured either through the specific heat or the spectral weight of the Drude-like peak are found to differ, as was indeed reported in overdoped cuprate superconductors. More generally, we expect such terms to be present in any hydrodynamic theory with approximate symmetries, which arise in many physical systems.</description>

Abstract: We consider three-dimensional ${\mathcal N}=2$ supersymmetric field theories defined on general complex-valued backgrounds of Euclidean new minimal supergravity admitting two Killing spinors of opposite $R$-charges. We compute partition functions for theories defined on general circle bundles over spindles $\Sigma$, including $\Sigma\times S^1$ as well as branched and squashed lens spaces, thus obtaining novel observables characterizing three-dimensional supersymmetric gauge theories. We discuss both twisted and anti-twisted theories compactified on $\Sigma\times S^1$ and demonstrate that their partition functions are encoded by a single formula that we refer to as the spindle index, unifying and generalizing superconformal and topologically twisted indices in the limit where orbifold singularities are absent. Furthermore, we test our new index using non-perturbative dualities and obtain one-loop determinants of two-dimensional supersymmetric gauge theories compactified on the spindle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00502v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We review $F(R,\mathcal{D})$ gravity in the metric-affine framework, where $\mathcal{D}$ is the divergence of the dilation current appearing in the hypermomentum tensor. We assume only linear couplings between the general affine connection and the matter fields (minimal coupling) and break projective invariance to preserve a nonvanishing dilation current. For $F(R,\mathcal{D})$ linear in $\mathcal{D}$ the dilation current dependence in the function $F(R,\mathcal{D})$ does not contribute to the field equations of the theory.
  We show that, on the other hand, in more complicated cases (e.g., considering the function $F(R,\mathcal{D})=R+\alpha \mathcal{D}^2$), the $\mathcal{D}$ contribution to the metric field equations is nontrivial and can affect the cosmology of the theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05483v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scattering amplitudes for the simplest theory of colored scalar particles - the Tr($\Phi^3$) theory - have recently been the subject of active investigations. In this letter we describe an unanticipated wider implication of this work: the Tr($\Phi^3$) theory secretly contains Non-linear Sigma Model (NLSM) amplitudes to all loop orders. The NLSM amplitudes are obtained from Tr$(\Phi^3)$ amplitudes by a unique shift of kinematic variables. We show that this shifted kinematics produces amplitudes for a cubic theory with a linear term in potential, with extrema spontaneously breaking $U(N) \to U(N-k) \times U(k)$. The Goldstone amplitudes for this theory coincide with those of pions in the $U(N) \times U(N) \to U(N)$ chiral Lagrangian to all orders in the planar limit. We also give a purely on-shell understanding of this correspondence, showing integrands defined by the kinematic shifts have the correct residues on poles and appropriately produce the Adler zero. Finally, we discuss how similar kinematic shifts produce certain infinite classes of mixed amplitudes of pions and Tr($\Phi^3$) scalars, most of which are not interpretable from the Lagrangian description.</description>

Abstract: Symmetry is a powerful tool for studying dynamics in QFT: it provides selection rules, constrains RG flows, and often simplifies analysis. Currently, our understanding is that the most general form of symmetry is described by categorical symmetries which can be realized via Symmetry TQFTs or ``SymTFTs." In this paper, we show how the framework of the SymTFT, which is understood for discrete symmetries (i.e. finite categorical symmetries), can be generalized to continuous symmetries. In addition to demonstrating how $U(1)$ global symmetries can be incorporated into the paradigm of the SymTFT, we apply our formalism to study cubic $U(1)$ anomalies in $4d$ QFTs, describe the $\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}$ non-invertible chiral symmetry in $4d$ theories, and conjecture the SymTFT for general continuous $G^{(0)}$ global symmetries.</description>

Abstract: Many theories of nonlinear electrodynamics (NLED) that have been proposed in physical contexts involving strong fields are causal for weak fields but acausal for strong fields. We show that for any such theory there is a unique causal and self-dual (electromagnetic duality invariant) theory with the same Lagrangian at zero magnetic field. This follows from a construction of the general causal self-dual NLED, which shows that strong-field causality is implied by weak-field causality for self-dual theories. We illustrate our results with explicit examples.</description>

Abstract: We study interactions of higher-spin massless fields $\varphi$ with conserved currents multilinear in the off-shell matter fields $\phi$. Specifically, we focus on the 3d case where a slight modification of the $\sigma_-$-cohomology technique developed earlier is directly applicable to control nontriviality of the interaction vertices at the convention that the vertices removable by a local field redefinition of a higher-spin field or having schematic form $F(\varphi) G(\phi)$, where $F(\varphi)$ is a gauge invariant field strength of a free higher-spin field, are called deformationally trivial. It is demonstrated how the $\sigma_-$-cohomology approach can be applied to the analysis of nonlinear vertices. Generally, deformationally trivial vertices are not $\sigma_-$-closed while the deformationally non-trivial ones must be in $H(\sigma_-)$. It is shown that, at least in the $3d$ case, the relevant cohomology group $H^1(\sigma_-)=0$ and, hence, no deformationally non-trivial off-shell vertices exist. On the other hand, there exists an infinite class of deformationally trivial vertices, that includes the vertex recently proposed for spin three. Our analysis goes beyond the higher-spin vertices allowing to show that, at least in three dimensions, nonlinear combinations of the off-shell scalar fields and their derivatives cannot obey non-trivial equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06897v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the spectra associated with various semiclassical string states that propagate over $\mathcal{N}=2$ Gaiotto-Maldacena backgrounds. As an interesting special case, for the Abelian T- dual solution, we discover giant magnon and single spike configurations while imposing appropriate boundary conditions. However, for Sfetsos-Thompson backgrounds, one has to adopt a different string embedding which reveals ``modified'' dispersion relations both for magnons and spikes. These results boil down into the standard dispersion relations in the limit when the rank of the associated $SU(N_c)$ color gauge group becomes large enough. We further generalize our analysis in the presence of flavor D6 branes. Our analysis reveals a new set of dispersion relations, which shows that both magnons and spikes are ceased to exist in the presence of flavor excitations.</description>

      <title>Exotic supergravities and the Swampland</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15535v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In six dimensions, there is an exotic $\mathcal{N}=(4,0)$ supermultiplet that contains only fields of spin $\leq 2$, but no graviton, and that on a circle reduces to 5D $\mathcal{N}=4$ supergravity. It has been proposed that, if suitable interactions exist, the $(4,0)$ theory might provide a consistent alternative UV completion for $\mathcal{N}=4$ 5D supergravity, realizing a supersymmetric version of asymptotic safety. In this note we argue that any Lorentz-invariant $(4,0)$ theory (interacting or not) carries an exact global symmetry when compactified on $S^1$, and is therefore incompatible with the Swampland no global symmetries conjecture. Another example of exotic supergravity, the 6D $(3,1)$ theory, does not have this problem. We study the general case and find that the only exotic spin-2 field that reduces to Einsteinian gravity and has no global symmetries when compactified on a high-dimensional torus is that of the $(3,1)$ theory. All other possibilities either yield several gravitons or have global symmetries.</description>

      <title>The Boundary Proposal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18892v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the leading ideas for the beginning of the Universe is the Hartle-Hawking `No-Boundary Proposal.' Since the Cobordism Conjecture claims that any spacetime allows for a dynamical boundary, we suggest that one may equally well consider a `Boundary Proposal'. Specifically, the corresponding euclidean instanton is a sphere with two holes around north and south pole cut out. Analogously to the Hartle-Hawking proposal, the sphere is then cut in two at the equator and half of it is dropped. The equator is glued to an expanding Lorentzian de Sitter space, implementing a beginning of the Universe with a spacelike spherical boundary at its earliest moment. This process is in principle on equal footing with the one based on the no-boundary instanton. In fact, if the Linde-Vilenkin sign choice is used, this `Boundary' creation process may even dominate. An intriguing implication arises if tensionless end-of-the-world branes, as familiar from type-IIA or M-theory, are available: Analogously to the Boundary Proposal, one may then be able to create a compact, flat torus universe from nothing, without any exponential suppression or enhancement factors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05789v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that any nonlinear field theory giving rise to static solutions with finite energy like, e.g., topological solitons, allows us to derive a continuous infinity of integral identities which any such solution has to obey. These integral identities can always be understood as being generated by field transformations and their related Noether currents. We also explain why all integral identities generated by coordinate transformations become trivial for Bogomolnyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) solitons, i.e., topological solitons which saturate a topological energy bound. Finally, we consider applications of these identities to a broad class of nonlinear scalar theories, including the Skyrme model. More concretely, we find nontrivial integral identities that can be seen as model-independent relations between certain physical properties of the solitons in such theories, and we comment on the possible connection between these new relations and those already found in the context of astrophysical compact objects. We also demonstrate the usefulness of said identities to estimate the precision of the numerical calculation of soliton observables.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05945v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Employing extended phase space formalism, we study critical phenomenon of A-charge and C-charge for holographic theories dual to Gauss-Bonnet black holes. We find a universal critical Gauss-Bonnet coupling, giving rise to a universal ratio between the two central charges at the critical point. This leads to a new intepretation for critical behavior of Gauss-Bonnet black holes in terms of the boundary degrees of freedoms, although the solutions are electrically neutral. Another novel feature is for either of the central charges, the transition temperature is beyond the critical point but is upper bounded by causality of the boundary theories.</description>

Abstract: A common feature of collapse models and an expected signature of the quantization of gravity at energies well below the Planck scale is the deviation from ordinary quantum-mechanical behavior. Here, we analyze the general consequences of such modifications from the point of view of quantum information theory and we anticipate applications to different quantum systems. We show that quantum systems undergo corrections to the quantum speed limit which, in turn, imply the modification of the Heisenberg limit for parameter estimation. Our results hold for a wide class of scenarios beyond ordinary quantum mechanics. For some nonlocal models inspired by quantum gravity, the bounds are found to oscillate in time, an effect that could be tested in future high-precision quantum experiments.</description>

      <title>Quantum simulation of lattice gauge theories via deterministic duality transformations assisted by measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.12277v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum simulation is one of the major applications of quantum devices. In the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era, however, the general quantum simulation is not yet feasible, such as that of lattice gauge theories, which is likely limited due to the violation of the Gauss law constraint and the complexity of the real-time dynamics, especially in the deconfined phase. Inspired by the recent works of S. Ashkenazi and E. Zohar [Phys. Rev. A 105, 022431 (2022)] and of N. Tantivasadakarn, R. Thorngren, A. Vishwanath, and R. Verresen [arXiv: 2112.01519], we propose to simulate dynamics of lattice gauge theories by using the Kramers-Wannier transfomation via cluster-state-like entanglers, mid-circuit measurements and feedforwarded corrections, which altogether is a constant-depth deterministic operation. In our scheme, specifically, we first quantum simulate the time evolution under a corresponding symmetric Hamiltonian from an initial symmetric state, and then apply the Kramers-Wannier procedure. This results in a wave function that has time evolved under the corresponding lattice gauge theory from a corresponding initial, gauged wave function. In the presence of noises in time evolution, the procedure succeeds when we can pair up magnetic monopoles represented by non-trivial measurement outcomes. Further, given a noise-free Kramers-Wannier transformation, the resulting wave function from a noisy time evolution satisfies the Gauss law constraint. We give explicit examples with the low dimensional pure gauge theories and gauge theories coupled to bosonic/fermionic matters such as the Fradkin-Shenker model.</description>

Abstract: We study the properties of the charged kaon in symmetric nuclear matter using a Bethe-Salpeter amplitude to model the quark-anti-quark bound state, which is well constrained by previous studies of its vacuum properties. The electromagnetic form factor, charge radius, decay constant and the light-front valence component probability are investigated in symmetric nuclear matter. In order to describe the constituent up and anti-strange quarks in nuclear matter, we adopt the ``quark-meson coupling (QMC) model", which has been widely applied to various hadronic and nuclear phenomena in the nuclear medium.</description>

      <title>Charged particle motion and acceleration around Kerr-MOG black hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.16936v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the most important issues in relativistic astrophysics is to explain the origin mechanisms of (ultra)high energy charged particle components of cosmic rays. Black holes (BHs) being huge reservoirs of (gravitational) energy can be candidates for such particle sources. The main idea of this work is to study the effects of scalar-tensor-vector gravity (STVG) on particle acceleration by examining charged particle dynamics and their acceleration through the magnetic Penrose process (MPP) near magnetized Kerr-MOG BHs. First, we study the horizon structure of the BH. Also, we study the effective potential to gain insight into the stability of circular orbits. Our results show that the magnetic field can extend the region of stable circular orbits, whereas the STVG parameter reduces the {instability} of the circular orbit. The motion of charged particles around the magnetized BH reveals various feasible regimes of the ionized Keplerian disk behavior. Thus, from the examination of particle trajectories we observe that at fixed values of other parameters, the Schwarzschild BH captures the test particle; in the case of Kerr BH, the test particle escapes to infinity or is captured by the BH, while in Kerr-MOG BH, the test particle is trapped in some region around BH and starts orbiting it. On investigating the MPP, we found that with increasing magnetic field, the behavior of orbits becomes more chaotic. As a result, the particle escapes to infinity more quickly.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17991v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the SYK model -- an important toy model for quantum gravity on IBM's superconducting qubit quantum computers. By using a graph-coloring algorithm to minimize the number of commuting clusters of terms in the qubitized Hamiltonian, we find the gate complexity of the time evolution using the first-order product formula for $N$ Majorana fermions is $\mathcal{O}(N^5 J^{2}t^2/\epsilon)$ where $J$ is the dimensionful coupling parameter, $t$ is the evolution time, and $\epsilon$ is the desired precision. With this improved resource requirement, we perform the time evolution for $N=6, 8$ with maximum two-qubit circuit depth of 343. We perform different error mitigation schemes on the noisy hardware results and find good agreement with the exact diagonalization results on classical computers and noiseless simulators. In particular, we compute return probability after time $t$ and out-of-time order correlators (OTOC) which is a standard observable of quantifying the chaotic nature of quantum systems.</description>

Abstract: An explicit realistic model featuring a supercooled phase transition, which allows us to explain the background of gravitational waves recently detected by pulsar timing arrays, is constructed. In this model the phase transition corresponds to radiative symmetry breaking (and mass generation) in a dark sector featuring a dark photon associated with the broken symmetry. The completion of the transition is ensured by a non-minimal coupling between gravity and the order parameter and fast reheating occurs thanks to a preheating phase. Finally, it is also shown that the model leads to primordial black hole production.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04193v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider local quenches from initial states generated by a single spin-flip in either the true or the false vacuum state of the confining quantum Ising spin chain in the ferromagnetic regime. Contrary to global quenches, where the light-cone behaviour is strongly suppressed, we find a significant light-cone signal propagating with a nonzero velocity besides the expected localised oscillating component. Combining an analytic representation of the initial state with a numerical description of the relevant excitations using the two-fermion approximation, we can construct the spectrum of post-quench excitations and their overlaps with the initial state, identifying the underlying mechanism. For confining quenches built upon the true vacuum, the propagating signal consists of superpositions of left and right-moving mesons escaping confinement. In contrast, for anti-confining quenches built upon the false vacuum it is composed of superpositions of left and right-moving bubbles which escape Wannier-Stark localisation.</description>

      <title>Krylov localization as a probe for ergodicity breaking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14384v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Krylov complexity has recently gained attention where the growth of operator complexity in time is measured in terms of the off-diagonal operator Lanczos coefficients. The operator Lanczos algorithm reduces the problem of complexity growth to a single-particle semi-infinite tight-binding chain (known as the Krylov chain). Employing the phenomenon of Anderson localization, we propose the inverse localization length on the Krylov chain as a probe to detect weak ergodicity-breaking. On the Krylov chain we find delocalization in an ergodic regime, as we show for the SYK model, and localization in case of a weakly ergodicity-broken regime. Considering the dynamics beyond scrambling, we find a collapse across different system sizes at the point of weak ergodicity-breaking leading to a quantitative prediction. We further show universal traits of different operators in the ergodic regime beyond the scrambling dynamics. We test for two settings: (1) the coupled SYK model, and (2) the quantum East model. Our findings open avenues for mapping ergodicity/weak ergodicity-breaking transitions to delocalization/localization phenomenology on the Krylov chain.</description>

Abstract: Quantum computing provides a promising approach for solving the real-time dynamics of systems consist of quarks and gluons from first-principle calculations that are intractable with classical computers. In this work, we start with an initial problem of the ultra-relativistic quark-nucleus scattering and present an efficient and precise approach to quantum simulate the dynamics on the light front. This approach employs the eigenbasis of the asymptotic scattering system and implements the compact scheme for basis encoding. It exploits the operator structure of the light-front Hamiltonian of the scattering system, which enables the Hamiltonian input scheme that utilizes the quantum Fourier transform for efficiency. It utilizes the truncated Taylor series for the dynamics simulations. The qubit cost of our approach scales logarithmically with the Hilbert space dimension of the scattering system. The gate cost has optimal scaling with the simulation error and near optimal scaling with the simulation time. These scalings make our approach advantageous for large-scale dynamics simulations on future fault-tolerant quantum computers. We demonstrate our approach with a simple scattering problem and benchmark the results with those from the Trotter algorithm and the classical calculations, where good agreement between the results is found.</description>

      <title>Primordial black holes and induced gravitational waves in non-singular matter bouncing cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03779v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel model-independent generic mechanism for primordial black hole formation within the context of non-singular matter bouncing cosmology. In particular, considering a short duration transition from the matter contracting phase to the Hot Big Bang expanding Universe, we find naturally enhanced curvature perturbations on very small scales which can collapse and form primordial black holes. Interestingly, the primordial black hole masses that we find can lie within the observationally unconstrained asteroid-mass window, potentially explaining the totality of dark matter. Remarkably, the enhanced curvature perturbations, collapsing to primordial black holes, can induce as well a stochastic gravitational-wave background, being potentially detectable by future experiments, in particular by SKA, PTAs, LISA and ET, hence serving as a new portal to probe the potential bouncing nature of the initial conditions prevailed in the early Universe.</description>

      <title>The Standard Model Gauge Group, SMEFT, and Generalized Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04229v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss heavy particles that can be used to pin down the faithful Standard Model (SM) gauge group and their patterns in the SM effective field theory (SMEFT). These heavy particles are not invariant under a specific $\mathbb{Z}_6$ subgroup of $SU(3)_c\times SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y$, which however acts trivially on all the SM particles, hence the faithful SM gauge group remains undetermined. Different realizations of the faithful SM gauge group correspond to different spectra of heavy particles, and they also correspond to distinct sets of line operators with one-form global symmetry acting on them. We show that the heavy particles not invariant under the $\mathbb{Z}_6$ group cannot appear in tree-level ultraviolet completions of SMEFT, this enforces us to consider one-loop UV completions of SMEFT to identify the $\mathbb{Z}_6$ non-invariant heavy particles. We demonstrate with examples that correlations between Wilson coefficients provide an efficient way to examine models with $\mathbb{Z}_6$ non-invariant heavy particles. Finally, we prove that all the scalars that can trigger electroweak symmetry breaking must be invariant under the $\mathbb{Z}_6$ group, hence they cannot be used to probe the faithful SM gauge group.</description>

      <title>Internal Lagrangians and spatial-gauge symmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06606v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A direct reformulation of the Hamiltonian formalism in terms of the intrinsic geometry of infinitely prolonged differential equations is obtained. Concepts of spatial equation and spatial-gauge symmetry of a Lagrangian system of equations are introduced. A non-covariant canonical variational principle is proposed and demonstrated using the Maxwell equations as an example. A covariant canonical variational principle is formulated. The results obtained are applicable to any variational equations, including those that do not originate in physics.</description>

      <title>Classical double copy in the black hole mini-superspace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09374v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a novel formulation of classical double copy in the mini-superspace of static, spherically symmetric black holes where the map between the solutions of general relativity and Maxwell's theory can be realized in Boyer-Lindsquit coordinates. By employing the reduced action principle, we show that the double copy structure can be generalized to Lovelock gravities and quasi-topological gravities. However, the gravitational solutions are mapped to the purely electric solutions of Maxwell's theory with a difference: instead of a direct match between the Kerr-Schild scalar in the gravity side and the scalar potential in the gauge theory side, the scalar potential becomes a polynomial in the Kerr-Schild scalar, giving rise to a generalization of the Kerr-Schild double copy. We calculate the Regge-Teitelboim surface charges and prove that the mass of the black hole solution is identified with the electric charge corresponding to the Coulomb part of the gauge theory solution in the same way it does in the case of general relativity.</description>
