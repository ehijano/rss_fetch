      <title>Assessment of hydrodynamic characteristics and computational resources for submarine resistance analysis: A comparative study between CFD Codes with application of the BB2 Submarine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Submarines are vital for maritime defense, requiring optimized hydrodynamic performance to minimize resistance. Advancements in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) enable accurate predictions of submarine hydrodynamics for optimal design. This study compared the meshing capabilities of OpenFOAM and commercial software as well as the performance of High-Performance Computing (HPC) and standard PC resources upon hydrodynamic characteristics. The RANS turbulence model with was employed to analyze the resistances of the MARIN's BB2-class submarine. CFD simulations were conducted at a model scale (1:35.1) at a speed of 1.8235 m/s ( of 21 knots) upon various mesh densities from 1 to 97 million cells. Empirical equations were initialized for turbulence parameters. Mesh sensitivity and iteration convergence ensured validated results. The findings showed that the results were validated with errors ranging from 0.3% to 10% across different mesh densities. The lowest error (0.3%) was achieved with 97 million cells generated by the commercial meshing tool with HPC, while 13 million cells by OpenFOAM with a standard PC resulted in a 3.4% error. Accuracy improved with precise initialization of turbulence parameters, mesh strategy, numerical schemes, and computing resources. The application of a standard PC with the OpenFOAM meshing tool was able to produce an acceptable accuracy, with less than 5% error for lower mesh densities. Thus, it can be suggested that using a standard PC was beneficial for preliminary hydrodynamic simulations. However, HPC with commercial software was essential for detailed industrial analyses, such as full-scale resistance and propulsion simulations.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive Numerical Hydrodynamic Analysis of Submarine in a Straight Course Simulation Using Wall-Resolved RANS Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research explores several critical factors affecting CFD-based prediction accuracy of submarine hydrodynamics and builds upon previous work on preliminary mesh and solver benchmarking. A scaled submarine model is analyzed numerically using the Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) turbulence model at a Reynold number (Re) of 3.6x106 with wall-resolved meshes targeting y+ &lt;5. Based on prior work using a 13x106 cells mesh generated with SnappyHexMesh, a mesh convergence study was performed with increasing resolution of fine (15x106 cells), finer (18x106 cells), and finest (22x106 cells). Subsequently, five turbulence closure models which are k-$\omega$ SST, k-$\omega$ 2006, Lien Cubic, k-$\epsilon$ Launder-Sharma, and Spalart-Allmaras were assessed for predictive performance and computational efficiency. Boundary layer fidelity was examined by comparing velocity profiles extracted from Cadence and SnappyHexMesh meshes against the theoretical law of the wall. In the final phase, the influence of appendages on local and global resistance was analyzed. The results presented that the finest mesh (22x106 cells) achieved a near mesh-independent solution with an error of 1.16% and extrapolated to less than 0.11% showing strong agreement with lab-scale data. Among the turbulence models, the k-$\omega$ SST model demonstrated the most reliable performance, with resistance predictions less than 1.2% of error. In addition, the law-of-the-wall analysis illustrated that the Cadence allowed full resolution of the viscous sublayer, while SnappyHexMesh performance was constrained by wall-normal cell sizing. Appendage analysis revealed that the sail alone contributed up to 7.1% of the pressure drag and 7.7% of viscous drag, while the rudder added 3.7% and 5.6% respectively, indicating a substantial impact on overall resistance. These findings contribute to developing robust and accurate CFD strategies for submarine hydrodynamics and offer a reliable framework for future resistance evaluation and design assessment in complex maritime applications.</description>

      <title>Assessment of Hybrid RANS-LES and WALE Formulations for Wake and Resistance Prediction of the BB2 Submarine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03383</link>

Abstract: Submarine hydrodynamics presents unique challenges in accurately predicting flow separation, wake structure, and resistance due to complex geometry and turbulent behaviour at high Reynolds (Re) numbers. Traditional Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) approaches are often limited in resolving unsteady flow structures and turbulence in the near and far regions. To address these limitations, hybrid RANS-LES models such as Detached Eddy Simulation (DES) and Large Eddy Simulation (LES) offer improved performance in capturing near-wall vortical structures. The capturing of turbulent vortices and wake structures significantly contributes to conduct hydrodynamic noise analysis. Detailed resolution and understanding of these coherent structures help minimize hydroacoustic signatures, essential for submarines' stealth characteristics. Based on prior studies, Breuer et al. (2003) reported that RANS failed to capture unsteady vortex shedding, producing only steady results even in 3D simulations. In contrast, DES and LES successfully resolved asymmetric shedding across different grid resolutions. Spalart (2009) reported that DES is more effective than RANS or LES for high Re flows, although it suffers from challenges related to ambiguous grids and nonmonotonic grid refinement behaviour. Whereas Liang \&amp; Xue (2014) found that DES predicts tip vortex flow characteristics more accurately than RANS-SA and can capture complex 3D vortex structures. In addition, Guilmineau et al. (2018) demonstrated that the IDDES model accurately predicts recirculation bubbles and aligns more closely with experimental data for flow prediction. Long et al. (2021) confirmed the capability of DDES in simulating cavitating flows around hydrofoils and marine propellers. Lungu (2022) highlighted the efficiency and accuracy of the hybrid IDDES-SST model in DARPA submarine simulations. Zhang et al. (2023) also noted that URANS struggles with resolving small-scale turbulence structures, whereas IDDES is better suited for predicting complex phenomena such as ship air wake asymmetry. Nevertheless, capturing the unsteadiness and turbulence fluctuations scales is extremely challenging because the cell size requirements should suit each turbulence model employed. Thus, as a continuation of the prior work of Abidin et al. (2024), the unsteady simulation with high mesh resolution at $U_m=1.8235$ m/s and Re of $3.6\times 10^6$ to generate the asymmetrical wake dynamic and vortical structure. The current research expands the methodology by parameterizing the meshes and numerical scheme based on Taylor microscale refinement with respect to the characteristic length of (L, B and D) of submarine, particularly focusing on hybrid turbulence model and WALE to observe the ability to resolve turbulence in the wake region. The transient simulations were performed initially using wall-resolved mesh (76x10^6 cells) at y^+ &lt; 5 and then wall-modelled mesh (56x10^6 to 74x10^6 cells) at y^+ &gt; 30, which produced notably different and more detailed results (vortices and turbulence fluctuation) than previous steady-state RANS simulations without risking the accuracy of quantity of interest (global resistance).</description>

      <title>Jefimenko Made Easy: Electromagnetic Fields through Retardation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.14930v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Oleg D. Jefimenko's electrodynamics textbook is unique in its approaches to deriving the electric and magnetic fields of arbitrary charge and current distributions and of an arbitrarily moving point charge. However, an uncommon form of the inhomogeneous wave equation often poses difficulties for readers right from the beginning. In this paper, we substitute in a commonly used form, making his approaches readily accessible.</description>

      <title>Time-Symmetric Action-at-a-Distance Electrodynamics and the Principle of Action and Reaction for Particles at Relative Rest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18428v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a theory of time-symmetric action-at-a-distance electrodynamic or gravitational interactions where the four-forces depend only on the electric charges, the rest masses, the position four-vectors, and the four-velocities of the two interacting particles, but not on their four-accelerations or higher derivatives. The goal is to prove that the principle of action and reaction is obeyed due to the fact that, for a given pair of corresponding infinitesimal segments along the worldlines of the two particles, the impulse of the advanced four-force and the impulse of the retarded four-force are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. For two particles at relative rest, we derive this result as the outcome of a symmetry operation in flat conformal space. We start by assuming a positive spacetime interval between the two interacting particles, and we perform a conformal inversion (an improper inversion in a hypersphere), after which the two particles exchange their position and time coordinates and their rest masses. Then we perform an improper reflection across the axis connecting the two particles, after which the two particles recover their initial four-velocities, up to a minus sign. Two improper coordinate transformations are needed together in order to obtain a resulting positive Jacobian determinant. In the final step we go to the limit of a null spacetime interval between the endpoints of the corresponding infinitesimal segments. When the two interacting particles are at rest, or move with the same velocity, the initial and the final physical parameters that determine the four-forces are identical. Due to symmetry, the principle of action and reaction emerges. We make the conjecture that another, undetermined yet, symmetry operation must also apply, in order for the principle of action and reaction to hold even for particles moving with different velocities.</description>

      <title>Long-Range Interacting Particles on a Helix: A Statistical and Correlation Analysis of Equilibrium Configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19189v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a statistical and correlational analysis of the spatial and energetic properties of equilibrium configurations of a few-body system of two to eight equally charged classical particles that are confined on a one-dimensional helical manifold. The two-body system has been demonstrated to yield an oscillatory effective potential, thus providing stable equilibrium configurations despite the repulsive Coulomb interactions. As the system size grows, the number of equilibria increases, approximately following a power-law. This can be attributed to the increasing complexity in the highly non-linear oscillatory behavior of the potential energy surface. This property is reflected in a crossover from a spatially regular distribution of equilibria for the two-body system to a heightened degree of disorder upon the addition of particles. However, in accordance with the repulsion within a helical winding, the observed interparticle distances in equilibrium configurations cluster around values of odd multiples of half a helical winding, thus maintaining an underlying regularity. Furthermore, an energetic hierarchy exists based on the spatial location of the local equilibria, which is subject to increasing fluctuations as the system size grows.</description>

      <title>Enhanced dispersion of active microswimmers in confined flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08369v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the presence of a laminar shear flow, the diffusion of passive colloidal particles is enhanced in the direction parallel to the flow. This classical phenomenon is known as Taylor-Aris dispersion. Besides, microorganisms, such as active microswimmers, exhibit an effective diffusive behavior at long times. Combining the two ingredients above, a natural question then emerges on how the effective diffusion of active microswimmers is altered in shear flows -- a widespread situation in natural environments with practical implications, \textit{e.g.} regarding biofilm formation. In this Letter, we investigate the motility and dispersion of \textit{Chlamydomonas reinhardtii} microalgae, within a rectangular microfluidic channel subjected to a sinusoidal Poiseuille flow. Using high-resolution optical microscopy and a particle-tracking algorithm, we reconstruct individual trajectories in various flow conditions and statistically analyze them through moment theory and sliding windowed demodulation. We find that the velocity fluctuations and the dispersion coefficient increase as the flow amplitude is increased, with only weak dependencies on the flow periodicity. Importantly, our results demonstrate that the generalization of Taylor-Aris law to active particles is valid.</description>
