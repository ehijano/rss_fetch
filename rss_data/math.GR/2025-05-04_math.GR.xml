      <title>On The Relative Cohomology For Algebraic Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be an algebraic group over a field $k$. In 1961, Hochschild showed how one can define $\text{Ext}_{G}^{i}(M,N)$, and consequently the cohomology groups, for $G$ and $G$-modules $N$ and $M$. Afterwards, in 1965, Kimura showed that one can generalize this to get relative cohomology for algebraic groups. The cohomology groups play an important role in understanding the representation theory of $G$, but the role of relative cohomology has been left untouched. In this paper the author expands upon the work of Kimura to get more general results. In particular, we will state when there is a relative Grothendieck spectral sequence, which we will then use to show when relative cohomology is an interesting invariant.</description>

      <title>Helly-type theorems, CAT$(0)$ spaces, and actions of automorphism groups of free groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a variety of fixed-point theorems for groups acting on CAT$(0)$ spaces. Fixed points are obtained by a bootstrapping technique, whereby increasingly large subgroups are proved to have fixed points: specific configurations in the subgroup lattice of $\Gamma$ are exhibited and Helly-type theorems are developed to prove that the fixed-point sets of the subgroups in the configuration intersect. In this way, we obtain lower bounds on the smallest dimension ${\rm{FixDim}}(\Gamma)+1$ in which various groups of geometric interest can act on a complete CAT$(0)$ space without a global fixed point. For automorphism groups of free groups, we prove ${\rm{FixDim}}({\rm{Aut}}(F_n)) \ge \lfloor 2n/3\rfloor$.</description>

      <title>Epimorphic subgroups of simple algebraic groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A morphism of linear algebraic groups $\phi:K\rightarrow G$ is called an epimorphism if it admits right cancellation. A subgroup $H\leq G$ is epimorphic if the inclusion map is an epimorphism. For $G$ a simple algebraic group over an algebraically closed field of arbitrary characteristic we construct epimorphic subgroups of bounded dimension (at most five).</description>

      <title>Finite and profinite groups with small Engel sinks of p-elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A (left) Engel sink of an element g of a group G is a subset containing all sufficiently long commutators [...[[x,g],g],...,g], where x ranges over G. We prove that if p is a prime and G a finite group in which, for some positive integer m, every p-element has an Engel sink of cardinality at most m, then G has a normal subgroup N such that G/N is a p'-group and the index [N:O_p(G)] is bounded in terms of m only.
  Furthermore, if G is a profinite group in which every p-element possesses a finite Engel sink, then G has a normal subgroup N such that N is virtually pro-p while G/N is a pro-p' group.</description>

      <title>Conciseness of first-order formulae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A word $w$ is concise in a class of groups $\mathcal{C}$ if, for every group $G$ in $\mathcal{C}$, the verbal subgroup $w(G)$ is finite whenever $w$ takes only finitely many values in $G$. This notion can be naturally extended to first-order formulae in the language of groups. We consider this more general setting and establish conciseness for various classes of groups and formulae. We prove that all formulae are concise in the class of abelian groups and that every existential formula is concise in the class of torsion-free locally class-2 nilpotent groups. In addition, we construct new examples of weakly rational words, which allow us to produce a wide variety of formulae that are concise in the class of residually finite groups.</description>

      <title>Fault-Tolerant Multi-Modal Localization of Multi-Robots on Matrix Lie Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consistent localization of cooperative multi-robot systems during navigation presents substantial challenges. This paper proposes a fault-tolerant, multi-modal localization framework for multi-robot systems on matrix Lie groups. We introduce novel stochastic operations to perform composition, differencing, inversion, averaging, and fusion of correlated and non-correlated estimates on Lie groups, enabling pseudo-pose construction for filter updates. The method integrates a combination of proprioceptive and exteroceptive measurements from inertial, velocity, and pose (pseudo-pose) sensors on each robot in an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) framework. The prediction step is conducted on the Lie group $\mathbb{SE}_2(3) \times \mathbb{R}^3 \times \mathbb{R}^3$, where each robot's pose, velocity, and inertial measurement biases are propagated. The proposed framework uses body velocity, relative pose measurements from fiducial markers, and inter-robot communication to provide scalable EKF update across the network on the Lie group $\mathbb{SE}(3) \times \mathbb{R}^3$. A fault detection module is implemented, allowing the integration of only reliable pseudo-pose measurements from fiducial markers. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method through experiments with a network of wheeled mobile robots equipped with inertial measurement units, wheel odometry, and ArUco markers. The comparison results highlight the proposed method's real-time performance, superior efficiency, reliability, and scalability in multi-robot localization, making it well-suited for large-scale robotic systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We answer a question of Freedman and Krushkal, producing filling links in any closed, orientable 3-manifold. The links we construct are hyperbolic, and have large essential systole, contrasting earlier geometric constraints on hyperbolic links in 3-manifolds due to Adams-Reid and Lakeland-Leininger.</description>

      <title>On homomorphisms from finite subgroups of $SU(2)$ to Langlands dual pairs of groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $N(\Gamma,G)$ be the number of homomorphisms from $\Gamma$ to $G$ up to conjugation by $G$. Physics of four-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=4$ supersymmetric gauge theories predicts that $N(\Gamma,G)=N(\Gamma , \tilde G)$ when $\Gamma$ is a finite subgroup of $SU(2)$, $G$ is a connected compact simple Lie group and $\tilde G$ is its Langlands dual. This statement is known to be true when $\Gamma=\mathbb{Z}_n$, but the statement for non-Abelian $\Gamma$ is new, to the knowledge of the authors. To lend credence to this conjecture, we prove this equality in a couple of examples, namely $(G,\tilde G)=(SU(n),PU(n))$ and $(Sp(n),SO(2n+1))$ for arbitrary $\Gamma$, and $(PSp(n),Spin(2n+1))$ for exceptional $\Gamma$. A more refined version of the conjecture, together with proofs of some concrete cases, will also be presented. The authors would like to ask mathematicians to provide a more uniform proof applicable to all cases.</description>

      <title>Isoperimetric Profiles and Regular Embeddings of locally compact groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16787v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we extend the notion of $L^p$-measure subgroups couplings, a quantitative asymmetric version of measure equivalence that was introduced by Delabie, Koivisto, Le Ma\^itre and Tessera for finitely generated groups, to the setting of locally compact compactly generated unimodular groups. As an example of these couplings; using ideas from Bader and Rosendal, we prove a "dynamical criteria" for the existence of regular embeddings between amenable locally compact compactly generated unimodular groups, namely the existence of an $L^\infty$-measure subgroup coupling that is coarsely $m$-to-$1$. We also prove that the existence of an $L^p$-measure subgroup that is coarsely $m$-to-$1$ implies the monotonicity of the $L^p$-isoperimetric profile, as well as sublinear version of this result. As a corollary we obtain that the $L^p$-isoperimetric profile is monotonous under regular embeddings, as well as coarse embeddings, between amenable unimodular locally compact compactly generated groups.</description>

      <title>Hopf-Galois structures on parallel extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10172v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $L/K$ be a finite separable extension of fields of degree $n$, and let $E/K$ be its Galois closure. Greither and Pareigis showed how to find all Hopf--Galois structures on $L/K$. We will call a subextension $L'/K$ of $E/K$ \textit{parallel} to $L/K$ if $[L':K]=n$.
  In this paper, we investigate the relationship between the Hopf--Galois structures on an extension $L/K$ and those on the related parallel extensions. We give an example of a transitive subgroup corresponding to an extension admitting a Hopf--Galois structure but that has a parallel extension admitting no Hopf--Galois structures. We show that once one has such a situation, it can be extended into an infinite family of transitive subgroups admitting this phenomenon. We also investigate this fully in the case of extensions of degree $pq$ with $p,q$ distinct odd primes, and show that there is no example of such an extension admitting the phenomenon.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02121v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a non-positively curved cube complex with hyperbolic fundamental group. We prove that $\pi_1(X)$ has a non-free subgroup of infinite index unless $\pi_1(X)$ is either free or a surface group, answering questions of Gromov and Whyte (in a special case) and Wise. A similar result for one-relator groups follows, answering a question posed by several authors. The proof relies on a careful analysis of free and cyclic splittings of cubulated groups.</description>

      <title>Certain residual properties of HNN-extensions with normal associated subgroups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00262v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb{E}$ be the HNN-extension of a group $B$ with subgroups $H$ and $K$ associated according to an isomorphism $\varphi\colon H \to K$. Suppose that $H$ and $K$ are normal in $B$ and $(H \cap K)\varphi = H \cap K$. Under these assumptions, we prove necessary and sufficient conditions for $\mathbb{E}$ to be residually a $\mathcal{C}$-group, where $\mathcal{C}$ is a class of groups closed under taking subgroups, quotient groups, and unrestricted wreath products. Among other things, these conditions give new facts on the residual finiteness and the residual $p$-finiteness of the group $\mathbb{E}$.</description>

      <title>Simple closed curves, non-kernel homology and Magnus embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.13196v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the subspace of the homology of a covering space spanned by lifts of simple closed curves. Our main result is the existence of unbranched covers of surfaces where this is a proper subspace. More generally, for a fixed finite solvable quotient of the fundamental group we exhibit a cover whose homology is not generated by the lifts of curves in the complement of its kernel. We explain how the existing approach of Malestein and Putman (for branched covers) relates to the Magnus embedding, and by doing so we simplify their construction. We then generalise it to unbranched covers by producing embeddings of surface groups into units of certain graded associative algebras, which may be of independent interest.</description>
