      <title>Cycles of Well-Linked Sets and an Elementary Bound for the Directed Grid Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2015, Kawarabayashi and Kreutzer proved the directed grid theorem confirming a conjecture by Reed, Johnson, Robertson, Seymour, and Thomas from the mid-nineties. The theorem states the existence of a function $f$ such that every digraph of directed tree-width $f(k)$ contains a cylindrical grid of order $k$ as a butterfly minor, but the given function grows non-elementarily with the size of the grid minor.
  In this paper we present an alternative proof of the directed grid theorem which is conceptually much simpler, more modular in its composition and also improves the upper bound for the function $f$ to a power tower of height 22.
  Our proof is inspired by the breakthrough result of Chekuri and Chuzhoy, who proved a polynomial bound for the excluded grid theorem for undirected graphs. We translate a key concept of their proof to directed graphs by introducing \emph{cycles of well-linked sets (CWS)}, and show that any digraph of high directed tree-width contains a large CWS, which in turn contains a large cylindrical grid, improving the result due to Kawarabayashi and Kreutzer from an non-elementary to an elementary function.
  An immediate application of our result is an improvement of the bound for Younger's conjecture proved by Reed, Robertson, Seymour and Thomas (1996) from a non-elementary to an elementary function. The same improvement applies to other types of Erd\H{o}s-P\'osa style problems on directed graphs. To the best of our knowledge this is the first significant improvement on the bound for Younger's conjecture since it was proved in 1996.
  We believe that the theoretical tools we developed may find applications beyond the directed grid theorem, in a similar way as the path-of-sets-system framework due to Chekuri and Chuzhoy (2016) did (see for example Hatzel, Komosa, Pilipczuk and Sorge (2022); Chekuri and Chuzhoy (2015); Chuzhoy and Nimavat (2019)).</description>

      <title>Alternative paths computation for congestion mitigation in segment-routing networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In backbone networks, it is fundamental to quickly protect traffic against any unexpected event, such as failures or congestions, which may impact Quality of Service (QoS). Standard solutions based on Segment Routing (SR), such as Topology-Independent Loop-Free Alternate (TI-LFA), are used in practice to handle failures, but no distributed solutions exist for distributed and tactical congestion mitigation. A promising approach leveraging SR has been recently proposed to quickly steer traffic away from congested links over alternative paths. As the pre-computation of alternative paths plays a paramount role to efficiently mitigating congestions, we investigate the associated path computation problem aiming at maximizing the amount of traffic that can be rerouted as well as the resilience against any 1-link failure. In particular, we focus on two variants of this problem. First, we maximize the residual flow after all possible failures. We show that the problem is NP-Hard, and we solve it via a Benders decomposition algorithm. Then, to provide a practical and scalable solution, we solve a relaxed variant problem, that maximizes, instead of flow, the number of surviving alternative paths after all possible failures. We provide a polynomial algorithm. Through numerical experiments, we compare the two variants and show that they allow to increase the amount of rerouted traffic and the resiliency of the network after any 1-link failure.</description>

      <title>Structural Parameters for Dense Temporal Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temporal graphs provide a useful model for many real-world networks. Unfortunately the majority of algorithmic problems we might consider on such graphs are intractable. There has been recent progress in defining structural parameters which describe tractable cases by simultaneously restricting the underlying structure and the times at which edges appear in the graph. These all rely on the temporal graph being sparse in some sense. We introduce temporal analogues of three increasingly restrictive static graph parameters -- cliquewidth, modular-width and neighbourhood diversity -- which take small values for highly structured temporal graphs, even if a large number of edges are active at each timestep. The computational problems solvable efficiently when the temporal cliquewidth of the input graph is bounded form a subset of those solvable efficiently when the temporal modular-width is bounded, which is in turn a subset of problems efficiently solvable when the temporal neighbourhood diversity is bounded. By considering specific temporal graph problems, we demonstrate that (up to standard complexity theoretic assumptions) these inclusions are strict.</description>

      <title>Reachability in temporal graphs under perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reachability and other path-based measures on temporal graphs can be used to understand spread of infection, information, and people in modelled systems. Due to delays and errors in reporting, temporal graphs derived from data are unlikely to perfectly reflect reality, especially with respect to the precise times at which edges appear. To reflect this uncertainty, we consider a model in which some number $\zeta$ of edge appearances may have their timestamps perturbed by $\pm\delta$ for some $\delta$. Within this model, we investigate temporal reachability and consider the problem of determining the maximum number of vertices any vertex can reach under these perturbations. We show that this problem is intractable in general but is efficiently solvable when $\zeta$ is sufficiently large. We also give algorithms which solve this problem in several restricted settings. We complement this with some contrasting results concerning the complexity of related temporal eccentricity problems under perturbation.</description>

      <title>A logarithmic approximation of linearly-ordered colourings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A linearly ordered (LO) $k$-colouring of a hypergraph assigns to each vertex a colour from the set $\{0,1,\ldots,k-1\}$ in such a way that each hyperedge has a unique maximum element. Barto, Batistelli, and Berg conjectured that it is NP-hard to find an LO $k$-colouring of an LO 2-colourable 3-uniform hypergraph for any constant $k\geq 2$ [STACS'21] but even the case $k=3$ is still open. Nakajima and \v{Z}ivn\'{y} gave polynomial-time algorithms for finding, given an LO 2-colourable 3-uniform hypergraph, an LO colouring with $O^*(\sqrt{n})$ colours [ICALP'22] and an LO colouring with $O^*(\sqrt[3]{n})$ colours [ACM ToCT'23]. We present a simple polynomial-time algorithm that finds an LO colouring with $\log_2(n)$ colours, which is an exponential improvement.</description>

      <title>Time, Travel, and Energy in the Uniform Dispersion Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the algorithmic problem of uniformly dispersing a swarm of robots in an unknown, gridlike environment. In this setting, our goal is to comprehensively study the relationships between performance metrics and robot capabilities. We introduce a formal model comparing dispersion algorithms based on makespan, traveled distance, energy consumption, sensing, communication, and memory. Using this framework, we classify several uniform dispersion algorithms according to their capability requirements and performance. We prove that while makespan and travel can be minimized in all environments, energy cannot, as long as the swarm's sensing range is bounded. In contrast, we show that energy can be minimized even by simple, ``ant-like" robots in synchronous settings and asymptotically minimized in asynchronous settings, provided the environment is topologically simply connected. Our findings offer insights into fundamental limitations that arise when designing swarm robotics systems for exploring unknown environments, highlighting the impact of environment's topology on the feasibility of energy-efficient dispersion.</description>

      <title>Problems in NP can Admit Double-Exponential Lower Bounds when Parameterized by Treewidth or Vertex Cover</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.08149v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Treewidth (tw) is an important parameter that, when bounded, yields tractability for many problems. For example, graph problems expressible in Monadic Second Order (MSO) logic and QUANTIFIED SAT or, more generally, QUANTIFIED CSP, are FPT parameterized by the tw of the input's (primal) graph plus the length of the MSO-formula [Courcelle, Information &amp; Computation 1990] and the quantifier rank [Chen, ECAI 2004], resp. The algorithms from these (meta-)results have running times whose dependence on tw is a tower of exponents. A conditional lower bound by Fichte et al. [LICS 2020] shows that, for QUANTIFIED SAT, the height of this tower is equal to the number of quantifier alternations. Lower bounds showing that at least double-exponential factors in the running time are necessary are rare: there are very few (for tw and vertex cover vc parameterizations) and they are for problems that are complete for #NP, $\Sigma_2^p$, $\Pi_2^p$, or higher levels of the polynomial hierarchy.
  We show, for the first time, that it is not necessary to go higher up in the polynomial hierarchy to obtain such lower bounds. We design a novel, yet simple versatile technique based on Sperner families to obtain such lower bounds and apply it to 3 problems: METRIC DIMENSION, STRONG METRIC DIMENSION, and GEODETIC SET. We prove that they do not admit $2^{2^{o(tw)}} \cdot n^{O(1)}$-time algorithms, even on bounded diameter graphs, unless the ETH fails. For STRONG METRIC DIMENSION, the lower bound holds even for vc. We complement our lower bounds with matching upper bounds.</description>
