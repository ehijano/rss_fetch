      <title>Finite-scale geometric invariants for chaotic and weakly chaotic dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a finite scale geometric observable that quantifies the growth rate of localized sets under time evolution in dissipative dynamical systems. Defined at finite time and resolution without reference to symbolic dynamics or Markov partitions this observable converges, in uniformly hyperbolic systems, to a resolution dependent plateau whose logarithmic scaling coefficient equals the Kolmogorov Sinai entropy. In merely hyperbolic systems, it decays to zero, reflecting the absence of entropy production, while remaining well defined at finite scales. Numerical results for the Henon map and Feigenbaum point illustrate these behaviors. Our findings yield a finite scale geometric characterization of chaotic dynamics, consistent with classical entropy theory where applicable. We further demonstrate that the observable remains well defined in open intermittent systems, where trajectories escape and classical asymptotic invariants fail, revealing finite scale signatures of transient weak chaos.</description>

      <title>Metasurface-assisted balanced-injection synchronization for turbulence-resilient long-haul chaotic free-space link</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical chaotic synchronization between coupled nonlinear lasers underpins most chaos-based applications, including complex laser network dynamics, secure communication, key distribution, and reinforcement learning. In free-space links, however, chaotic synchronization is highly vulnerable to stochastic fluctuation induced by atmospheric turbulence, which results in temporal injection imbalances at symmetric receivers and triggers intermittent desynchronization. Here, we introduce a full Poincar\'e vector beam-enabled balanced-injection synchronization (BIS) mechanism, which passively mitigates coupling fluctuations and preserves injection symmetry through a complementary metasurface pair, without requiring any channel estimation or active control. Over a 3.2 km urban link under moderately strong turbulence, BIS suppresses coupling power fluctuations by a factor of 4.6 (from 0.4511 to 0.0975). It eliminates desynchronization events and increases the high-quality synchronization probability from 58.6% to 91.0%. This enables a record-high bit rate-distance product of 720 Gbps \cdot km, reducing communication interruption probability by up to 77% compared to Gaussian beam transmission. Our innovative strategy bridges the gap between nanophotonics and engineering optics, offering a new insight into advancing next-generation LiDAR, secure communication, and integrated sensing and communication systems in turbulent environments.</description>

      <title>The global attractor of the Toner-Tu-Swift-Hohenberg equations of active turbulence and its properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Toner-Tu-Swift-Hohenberg (TTSH) equations are one of the basic equations that are used to model turbulent behaviour in active matter, specifically the swarming of bacteria in suspension. They combine features of the incompressible Navier-Stokes, the Toner-Tu and Swift-Hohenberg equations, together with the important properties that they are linearly driven, and that the Laplacian diffusion is taken to be negative in combination with hyper-dissipation. We prove that the TTSH equations possess a finite-dimensional compact global attractor on the periodic domain $\mathbb{T}^d$ ($d=2,3$) and we establish explicit estimates for its Lyapunov dimension which agree with the heuristic prediction based on the Swift-Hohenberg length scale. The predominance of this length scale (as a vortex length scale) has been observed in both numerical and experimental studies of bacterial turbulence, so our methods and results provide a rigorous theoretical foundation for this phenomenon. We also carry out pseudospectral direct numerical simulations of these PDEs in dimension $d=2$ through which we obtain Lyapunov spectra for representative parameter values. We show that our numerical results are consistent with the analytically derived rigorous bounds.</description>

      <title>Score-Based Modeling of Effective Langevin Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01895v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a constructive framework to learn effective Langevin equations from stationary time series. Unlike conventional approaches that require iterative calibration to match target statistics, our construction guarantees the observed steady-state density by design and enforces temporal correlations directly from data -- so that the surrogate satisfies the targeted invariant measure and correlation constraints from the outset, without trial-and-error tuning. The drift is parameterized in terms of the score function -- the gradient of the logarithm of the steady-state distribution -- and a constant mobility matrix whose symmetric part controls dissipation and diffusion and whose antisymmetric part encodes mean nonequilibrium circulation. The score is learned from samples using denoising score matching, while the mobility coefficients are inferred from short-lag correlation identities estimated via a clustering-based finite-volume discretization on a data-adaptive state-space partition. We validate the approach on low-dimensional stochastic benchmarks and on partially observed Kuramoto--Sivashinsky dynamics, where the resulting Markovian surrogate captures the marginal invariant measure and temporal correlations of the resolved modes. The resulting Langevin models define explicit reduced generators that enable efficient sampling and generation of synthetic trajectories with correct temporal statistics, without direct simulation of the underlying full dynamics.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Robustness Guarantees for Quantum Classifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10360v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite their ever more widespread deployment throughout society, machine learning algorithms remain critically vulnerable to being spoofed by subtle adversarial tampering with their input data. The prospect of near-term quantum computers being capable of running {quantum machine learning} (QML) algorithms has therefore generated intense interest in their adversarial vulnerability. Here we show that quantum properties of QML algorithms can confer fundamental protections against such attacks, in certain scenarios guaranteeing robustness against classically-armed adversaries. We leverage tools from many-body physics to identify the quantum sources of this protection. Our results offer a theoretical underpinning of recent evidence which suggest quantum advantages in the search for adversarial robustness. In particular, we prove that quantum classifiers are: (i) protected against weak perturbations of data drawn from the trained distribution, (ii) protected against local attacks if they are insufficiently scrambling, and (iii) show evidence that they are protected against universal adversarial attacks if they are sufficiently chaotic. Our analytic results are supported by numerical evidence demonstrating the applicability of our theorems and the resulting robustness of a quantum classifier in practice. This line of inquiry constitutes a concrete pathway to advantage in QML, orthogonal to the usually sought improvements in model speed or accuracy.</description>

      <title>Global population crisis scenarios predicted by the most general dynamic model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19063v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that a simple nonlinear differential equation (originally studied in the physics of disordered systems) is able to mathematically describe the global population growth over the past 12000 years. Different regimes of population growth since the early Neolithic until today are shown to be all solutions to the same nonlinear differential equation in its various limits. These also include the well-known Malthus (exponential) and Verhulst (logistic) growth regimes, as well as von Foerster's ``doomsday'' formula. All these limits correspond to neglecting higher-order terms in a more general nonlinear dynamic model described by the proposed nonlinear differential equation. While the older models may provide valid fittings to limited time intervals in the global population growth curve in time, their clearly approximate nature prevents them from being predictive over longer periods of time. The proposed comprehensive solution of the proposed model is instead well suited to provide predictions for future scenarios. These include halving of the global population as early as 2064 due to resource depletion, if the effect of the Earth's limited carrying capacity were to set in today.</description>

      <title>Emulating the logistic map with totalistic cellular automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04140v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the conditions under which the mean-field formulation of a probabilistic, totalistic cellular automaton can approximate the logistic equation. We obtain that this goal can be obtained only for infinite-range neighborhood. We then performed simulations of the resulting one-dimensional probabilistic cellular automata, showing that this mean-field approximation is clearly obtained by shuffling the configuration, but also rewiring a fraction of links, either at each time or using the same randomization once and for all, in the spirit of the "small-world" mechanism. We show that it is possible to obtain a good approximation of the logistic behavior with a fraction of rewired links of 50% or more. We also show that there is a bifurcation cascade as a function of the rewired link, and this scenario also holds for a deterministic, totalistic CA with the same basic symmetries of the probabilistic one.</description>
