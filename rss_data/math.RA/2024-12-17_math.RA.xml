      <title>Spectral Properties of Positive Definite Matrices over Symmetrized Tropical Algebras and Valued Ordered fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the properties of positive definite and positive semi-definite symmetric matrices within the framework of symmetrized tropical algebra, an extension of tropical algebra adapted to ordered valued fields.
  We focus on the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of these matrices. We prove that the eigenvalues of a positive (semi)-definite matrix in the tropical symmetrized setting coincide with its diagonal entries. Then, we show that the images by the valuation of the eigenvalues of a positive definite matrix over a valued nonarchimedean ordered field coincide with the eigenvalues of an associated matrix in the symmetrized tropical algebra. Moreover, under a genericity condition, we characterize the images of the eigenvectors under the map keeping track both of the nonarchimedean valuation and sign, showing that they coincide with tropical eigenvectors in the symmetrized algebra.
  These results offer new insights into the spectral theory of matrices over tropical semirings, and provide combinatorial formulas for log-limits of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of parametric families of real positive definite matrices.</description>

      <title>The structure of rough sets defined by reflexive relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For several types of information relations, the induced rough sets system RS does not form a lattice but only a partially ordered set. However, by studying its Dedekind-MacNeille completion DM(RS), one may reveal new important properties of rough set structures. Building upon D. Umadevi's work on describing joins and meets in DM(RS), we previously investigated pseudo-Kleene algebras defined on DM(RS) for reflexive relations. This paper delves deeper into the order-theoretic properties of DM(RS) in the context of reflexive relations. We describe the completely join-irreducible elements of DM(RS) and characterize when DM(RS) is a spatial completely distributive lattice. We show that even in the case of a non-transitive reflexive relation, DM(RS) can form a Nelson algebra, a property generally associated with quasiorders. We introduce a novel concept, the core of a relational neighborhood, and use it to provide a necessary and sufficient condition for DM(RS) to determine a Nelson algebra.</description>

      <title>On deformation theory of associative algebras in monoidal categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the classical concept of deformation of an associative algebra, as introduced by Gerstenhaber, by using monoidal linear categories and cocommutative coalgebras as foundational tools. To achieve this goal, we associate to each cocommutative coalgebra $C$ and each linear monoidal category $\M$, a $\Bbbk$-linear monoidal category $\M_{C}$. This construction is functorial: any coalgebra morphism $\iota:C\to\widetilde{C}$
  induces a strict monoidal functor $\iota^{*}:\M_{\widetilde{C}}\to\M_{C}$. An $\iota$-deformation of an algebra $(A,m)$ is defined as an algebra $(A,\widetilde{m})$ in the fiber of $\iota^{*}$ over $(A,m)$. Within this framework, the deformations of $(A,m)$ are organized into a presheaf, which is shown to be representable. In other words, there exists a universal deformation satisfying a specific universal property.
  It is well established that classical deformation theory is deeply connected to Hochschild cohomology. We identify and analyze the cohomology theory that governs $\iota$-deformations in the second part of the paper. Additionally, several particular cases and applications of these results are examined in detail.</description>

      <title>An explicit formula for Larmour's decomposition of hermitian forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $K$ be a complete discretely valued field whose residue field has characteristic different from $2$. Let $(D,\sigma)$ be a $K-$division algebra with involution of the first kind, and $h$ be a $K-$anisotropic $\epsilon$-hermitian form over $(D,\sigma)$. By a theorem due to Larmour, there is a decomposition $h=h_0 \perp h_1$ such that the elements in a diagonalization of $h_0$ are units, the elements in a diagonalization of $h_1$ are uniformizers, and $h_0$, $h_1$ are determined uniquely up to $K-$isometry. In this paper, we give an explicit description of the elements in the diagonalization of $h_0$ and $h_1$ in the case of quaternion algebras. Then we will derive explicit formulas for Larmour's isomorphism of Witt groups.</description>

      <title>Strings in abstract root systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Phi$ be a subset of the simple roots of a (possibly non-reduced) abstract root system $\Sigma$, and let $\lambda \in \Sigma$. We define the $\Phi$-string of $\lambda$ as the set of elements in $\Sigma \cup \{0\}$ of the form $\lambda + \sum_{\alpha \in \Phi} n_\alpha \alpha$, where $n_\alpha$ is an integer for each $\alpha \in \Phi$. This notion can be regarded as some sort of generalization of the classical notion of $\alpha$-string, where $\alpha \in \Sigma$.</description>

      <title>Cyclic polytopes through the lens of iterated integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The volume of a cyclic polytope can be obtained by forming an iterated integral, known as the path signature, along a suitable piecewise linear path running through its edges. Different choices of such a path are related by the action of a subgroup of the combinatorial automorphisms of the polytope. Motivated by this observation, we look for other polynomials in the vertices of a cyclic polytope that arise as path signatures and are invariant under the subgroup action. We prove that there are infinitely many such invariants which are algebraically independent in the shuffle algebra.</description>

      <title>On the borderline of fields and hyperfields, part II -- Enumeration and classification of the hyperfields of order 7</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quotient hyperfield is a landmark on the borderline of fields and hyperfields. In this paper, which is the second part of our previously published paper, all the hyperfields of order 7 are constructed, enumerated and presented, in the course of which an important family of 7-element canonical hypergroups is revealed. The study of these hyperfields proved the existence of both quotient and non-quotient ones among them. Their construction became feasible because it is based on a new definition of the hyperfield with fewer axioms, which is introduced in this paper following our proof that the axiom of reversibility can derive from the other axioms of the hyperfield. Hence, the processing power needed for a computer to test whether a structure is a hyperfield or not is much less. This paper also proves properties and contains examples of skew hyperfields, strongly canonical hyperfields/hyperrings and superiorly canonical hyperfields/hyperrings that wrap up and complete the previously published conclusions and results of its first part.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rota-Baxter operators on groups were studied quite recently. Motivated mainly by the fact that weight zero Rota-Baxter operators and averaging operators are Koszul dual to each other, we propose the concept of averaging group and prove that the differentiation of a smooth averaging operator on a Lie group gives an averaging operator on the corresponding Lie algebra. As the free object is one of the most significant objects in a category, we also construct explicitly the free averaging group on a set.</description>

      <title>$F$-birestriction monoids in enriched signature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by recent interest to $F$-inverse monoids, on the one hand, and to restriction and birestriction monoids, on the other hand, we initiate the study of $F$-birestriction monoids as algebraic structures in the enriched signature $(\cdot, \, ^*, \,^+, \,m,1)$ where the unary operation $m$ maps each element to the maximum element of its $\sigma$-class.
  We find a presentation of the free $F$-birestriction monoid ${\mathsf{FFBR}}(X)$ as a birestriction monoid ${\mathcal F}$ over the extended set of generators $X\cup\overline{X^+}$ where $\overline{X^+}$ is a set in a bijection with the free semigroup $X^+$ and encodes the maximum elements of (non-projection) $\sigma$-classes. This enables us to show that ${\mathsf{FFBR}}(X)$ decomposes as the partial action product \mbox{$E({\mathcal I})\rtimes X^*$} of the idempotent semilattice of the universal inverse monoid ${\mathcal I}$ of ${\mathcal F}$ partially acted upon by the free monoid $X^*$. Invoking Sch\"utzenberger graphs, we prove that the word problem for ${\mathsf{FFBR}}(X)$ and its strong and perfect analogues is decidable. Furthermore, we show that ${\mathsf{FFBR}}(X)$ does not admit a geometric model based on a quotient of the Margolis-Meakin expansion $M({\mathsf{FG}}(X), X\cup \overline{X^+})$ over the free group ${\mathsf{FG}}(X)$, but the free perfect $X$-generated $F$-birestriction monoid admits such a model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of radical preservation and prove that a homological radical-preserving homomorphism of Artin algebras reflects the finiteness of the little finitistic, the big finitistic and the global dimension. As an application, we prove that every bound quiver algebra with quasi-uniform Loewy length, a class of algebras introduced in this paper, has finite (big) finitistic dimension. Moreover, we construct an explicit family of such finite dimensional algebras where the finiteness of their big finitistic dimension does not follow from the existing results in the literature.</description>

Abstract: A new combinatorial object, called generalised nice set, is classified up to collineations of the Fano plane. This classification is necessary to find the graded contractions of all the exceptional complex Lie algebras of dimension at least 52, endowed with $\mathbb Z_2^3$-gradings coming from the octonions. Our classification is of purely combinatorial nature.</description>

      <title>The $2\times 2$ upper triangular matrix algebra and its generalized polynomial identities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02838v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $UT_2$ be the algebra of $2\times 2$ upper triangular matrices over a field $F$ of characteristic zero. Here we study the generalized polynomial identities of $UT_2$, i.e., identical relations holding for $UT_2$ regarded as $UT_2$-algebra. We determine a set of two generators of the $T_{UT_2}$-ideal of generalized polynomial identities of $UT_2$ and compute the exact values of the corresponding sequence of generalized codimensions. Moreover, we give a complete description of the space of multilinear generalized identities in $n$ variables in the language of Young diagrams through the representation theory of the symmetric group $S_n$. Finally, we prove that, unlike in the ordinary case, the generalized variety of $UT_2$-algebras generated by $UT_2$ has no almost polynomial growth; nevertheless, we exhibit two distinct generalized varieties of almost polynomial growth.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.08326v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe the upper seminormal crystal structure for the $\mu$-supported $\delta$-vectors for any quiver with potential with reachable frozen vertices, or equivalently for the tropical points of the corresponding cluster $\mc{X}$-variety. We show that the crystal structure can be algebraically lifted to the generic basis of the upper cluster algebra. This can be viewed as an additive categorification of the crystal structure arising from cluster algebras. We introduce the biperfect bases in the cluster algebra setting and give a description of all biperfect bases, which are parametrized by lattice points in a product of polyhedral sets. We illustrate this theory from classical examples and new examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.04401v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We say that a chessboard filled with integer entries satisfies the neighbour-sum property if the number appearing on each cell is the sum of entries in its neighbouring cells, where neighbours are cells sharing a common edge or vertex. We show that an $n\times n$ chessboard satisfies this property if and only if $n\equiv 5\pmod 6$. Existence of solutions is further investigated of rectangular, toroidal boards, as well as on Neumann neighbourhoods, including a nice connection to discrete harmonic functions. Construction of solutions on infinite boards are also presented. Finally, answers to three dimensional analogues of these boards are explored using properties of cyclotomic polynomials and relevant ideas conjectured.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17784v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider two problems relating to the representation theory of Lie algebras ${\mathfrak g}$ of reductive algebraic groups $G$ over algebraically closed fields ${\mathbb K}$ of positive characteristic $p&gt;0$. First, we consider the tensor product of two baby Verma modules $Z_{\chi}(\lambda)\otimes Z_{\chi'}(\mu)$ and show that it has a filtration of baby Verma modules of a particular form. Secondly, we consider the minimal-dimension representations of a reduced enveloping algebra $U_\chi({\mathfrak g})$ for a nilpotent $\chi\in{\mathfrak g}^{*}$. We show that under certain assumptions in type $A$ we can obtain the minimal-dimensional modules as quotients of certain modules obtained by base change from simple highest weight modules over ${\mathbb C}$.</description>

Abstract: For each simple Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ of simply-laced type, Hernandez and Leclerc introduced a certain category $\mathcal{C}_{\mathbb{Z}}$ of finite-dimensional representations of the quantum affine algebra of $\mathfrak{g}$, as well as certain subcategories $\mathcal{C}_{\mathbb{Z}}^{\leq \xi}$ depending on a choice of height function adapted to an orientation of the Dynkin graph of $\mathfrak{g}$. In our previous work we constructed an algebra homomorphism $\widetilde{D}_{\xi}$ whose domain contains the image of the Grothendieck ring of $\mathcal{C}_{\mathbb{Z}}^{\leq \xi}$ under the truncated $q$-character morphism $\widetilde{\chi}_q$ corresponding to $\xi$. We exhibited a close relationship between the composition of $\widetilde{D}_{\xi}$ with $\widetilde{\chi}_q$ and the morphism $\overline{D}$ recently introduced by Baumann, Kamnitzer and Knutson in their study of the equivariant homology of Mirkovi\'c-Vilonen cycles. In this paper, we extend $\widetilde{D}_{\xi}$ in order to investigate its composition with Frenkel-Reshetikhin's original $q$-character morphism. Our main result consists in proving that the $q$-characters of all standard modules in $\mathcal{C}_{\mathbb{Z}}$ lie in the kernel of $\widetilde{D}_{\xi}$. This provides a large family of new non-trivial rational identities suggesting possible geometric interpretations.</description>

      <title>BMS-like algebras: canonical realisations and BRST quantisation</title>

Abstract: We generalise BMS algebras in three dimensions by the introduction of an arbitrary real parameter $\lambda$, recovering the standard algebras (BMS, extended BMS and Weyl-BMS) for $\lambda=-1$. We exhibit a realisation of the (centreless) Weyl $\lambda$-BMS algebra in terms of the symplectic structure on the space of solutions of the massless Klein-Gordon equation in $2+1$, using the eigenstates of the spacetime momentum operator. The quadratic Casimir of the Lorentz algebra plays an essential r\^ole in the construction. The Weyl $\lambda$-BMS algebra admits a three-parameter family of central extensions, resulting in the (centrally extended) Weyl-BMS algebra, which we reformulate in terms of operator product expansions. We construct the BRST complex of a putative Weyl-BMS string and show that the BRST cohomology is isomorphic to the chiral ring of a topologically twisted $N=2$ superconformal field theory. We also comment on the obstructions to obtaining a conformal BMS Lie algebra -- that is, one that includes in addition the special-conformal generators -- and the need to consider a W-algebra. We then construct the quantum version of this W-algebra in terms of operator product expansions. We show that this W-algebra does not admit a BRST complex.</description>
