      <title>Classification of ancient noncollapsed flows in $\mathbb{R}^4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we classify all noncollapsed singularities of the mean curvature flow in $\mathbb{R}^4$. Specifically, we prove that any ancient noncollapsed solution either is one of the classical historical examples (namely $\mathbb{R}^j\times S^{3-j}$, $\mathbb{R}\times $2d-bowl, $\mathbb{R}\times $2d-oval, the rotationally symmetric 3d-bowl, or a cohomogeneity-one 3d-oval), or belongs to the 1-parameter family of $\mathbb{Z}_2\times \mathrm{O}_2$-symmetric 3d-translators constructed by Hoffman-Ilmanen-Martin-White, or belongs to the 1-parameter family of $\mathbb{Z}_2^2\times \mathrm{O}_2$-symmetric ancient 3d-ovals constructed by Du-Haslhofer.
  In light of the five prior papers on the classification program in $\mathbb{R}^4$ from our collaborations with Du, Hershkovits, and Choi-Daskalopoulos-Sesum, the major remaining challenge is the case of mixed behaviour, where the convergence to the round bubble-sheet is fast in $x_1$-direction, but logarithmically slow in $x_2$-direction. To address this, we prove a differential neck theorem, which allows us to capture the (dauntingly small) slope in $x_1$-direction. To establish the differential neck theorem, we introduce a slew of new ideas of independent interest, including switch and differential Merle-Zaag dynamics, anisotropic barriers, and propagation of smallness estimates. Applying our differential neck theorem, we show that every noncompact strictly convex solution is selfsimilarly translating, and also rule out exotic ovals.</description>

      <title>Bertrand lightcone framed curves in the Lorentz-Minkowski 3-space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider mixed types of not only regular curves but also curves with singular points in the Lorentz-Minkowski 3-space. In order to consider mixed type of curves with singular points, we consider the lightcone frame and lightcone framed curves. By using lightcone frame, we can consider Bertrand types for lightcone framed curves, so-called Bertrand lightcone framed curves. We clarify that the existence conditions of Bertrand lightcone framed curves in all cases. As a consequence, we find pseudo-circular involutes and evolutes of mixed type curves which appear as Bertrand lightcone framed curves.</description>

      <title>Isotropy invariant graphical mean curvature flows in warped products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the graphical mean curvature flow in a warped product $_r G/K \times I$, where $G/K$ is a symmetric space of compact type, $I$ is an open interval, and $r$ is a smooth positive function on $I$. If the initial hypersurface is $K$-equivariant, then the $K$-equivariance is preserved along the mean curvature flow. Here, we note that isotropy group $K$ acts naturally on both $G/K$ and $_r G/K \times I$. If the flow is graphical, then it follows from the $K$-equivariance of the flow that it can be described by using $K$-invariant functions on $G/K$. We derive the flow equation which these functions satisfy. By using the flow equation, we prove that the mean curvature flow exists for infinite time under the conditions that $G/K$ is a rank one symmetric space of compact type and the warping function $r$ satisfies certain additional properties. The proof is carried out by estimating the gradient of the $K$-invariant functions satisfying the flow equation.</description>

      <title>Heat kernel and local index theorem for open complex manifolds with $\mathbb{C}^{\ast }$-action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a complex manifold $\Sigma $ with $\mathbb{C}^{\ast }$-action, we define the $m$-th $\mathbb{C}^{\ast }$ Fourier-Dolbeault cohomology group and consider the $m$-index on $\Sigma $. By applying the method of transversal heat kernel asymptotics, we obtain a local index formula for the $m$-index. We can reinterpret Kawasaki's Hirzebruch-Riemann-Roch formula for a compact complex orbifold with an orbifold holomorphic line bundle by our integral formulas over a (smooth) complex manifold and finitely many complex submanifolds arising from singular strata. We generalize $\mathbb{C}^{\ast }$-action to complex reductive Lie group $G$-action on a compact or noncompact complex manifold. Among others, we study the nonextendability of open group action and the space of all $G$-invariant holomorphic $p$-forms. Finally, in the case of two compatible holomorphic $\mathbb{C}^{\ast }$-actions, a mirror-type isomorphism is found between two linear spaces of holomorphic forms, and the Euler characteristic associated with these spaces can be computed by our $\mathbb{C}^{\ast }$ local index formula on the total space. In the perspective of the equivariant algebraic cobordism theory $\Omega _{\ast }^{\mathbb{C}^{\ast }}(\Sigma ),$ a speculative connection is remarked. Possible relevance to the recent development in physics and number theory is briefly mentioned.</description>

      <title>Gauss maps of M\"obius surfaces in the $n$-dimensional sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note we discuss Gauss maps for M\"obius surfaces in the $n$-sphere, and their applications in the study of Willmore surfaces. One such ``Gauss map'', naturally associated to a Willmore surface that has a dual Willmore surface, is the Lorentzian $2$-plane bundle given by a lift of the suface and its dual. More generally, we define the concept of a Lorentzian $2$-plane lift for an arbitrary M\"obius surface, and show that the conformal harmonicity of this lift is equivalent to the Willmore condition for the surface. This clarifies some previous work of F. H\'elein, Q. Xia-Y Shen, X. Ma and others, and, for instance, allows for the treatment of the Bj\"orling problem for Willmore surfaces in the presence of umbilics.</description>

      <title>Torsion-free $H$-structures on almost Abelian solvmanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we provide a general set-up for arbitrary linear Lie groups $H\leq \mathrm{GL}(n,\mathbb{R})$ which allows to characterise the almost Abelian Lie algebras admitting a torsion-free $H$-structure. In more concrete terms, using that an $n$-dimensional almost Abelian Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}=\mathfrak{g}_f$ is fully determined by an endomorphism $f$ of $\mathbb{R}^{n-1}$, we describe the subspace $\mathcal{F}_{\mathfrak{h}}$ of those elements in $\mathrm{End}(\mathbb{R}^{n-1})$ for which $\mathfrak{g}_f$ admits a special torsion-free $H$-structure as the image of a certain linear map. For large classes of linear Lie groups $H$, we are able to explicitly compute this image $\mathcal{F}_{\mathfrak{h}}$ and so give characterisations of the almost Abelian Lie algebras admitting a torsion-free $H$-structure.
  Our results reprove all the known characterisations of the almost Abelian Lie algebras admitting a torsion-free $H$-structure for different single linear Lie groups $H$ and extends them to much bigger classes of linear Lie groups $H$. For example, we are able to provide characterisations in the case $n=2m$, $H\leq \mathrm{GL}(m,\mathbb{C})$ and $H$ either being a complex Lie group or being totally real, or in the case that $H$ preserves a pseudo-Riemannian metric. In many cases, we show that the space $\mathcal{F}_{\mathfrak{h}}$ coincides with what we call the characteristic subalgebra $\tilde{\mathfrak{k}}_{\mathfrak{h}}$ associated to $\mathfrak{h}$, and that then the torsion-free condition is equivalent to the left-invariant flatness condition. In particular, we prove this to be the case if $H$ is a complex linear Lie group or if $\mathfrak{h}$ does not contain any elements of rank one or two and is either metric or totally real.</description>

      <title>Generic properties of minimal surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $M$ be an open Riemann surface and $n\ge 3$ be an integer. In this paper we establish some generic properties (in Baire category sense) in the space of all conformal minimal immersions $M\to\mathbb{R}^n$ endowed with the compact-open topology, pointing out that a generic such immersion is chaotic in many ways. For instance, we show that a generic conformal minimal immersion $u\colon M\to \mathbb{R}^n$ is non-proper, almost proper, and $g$-complete with respect to any given Riemannian metric $g$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$. Further, its image $u(M)$ is dense in $\mathbb{R}^n$ and disjoint from $\mathbb{Q}^3\times \mathbb{R}^{n-3}$, and has infinite area, infinite total curvature, and unbounded curvature on every open set in $\mathbb{R}^n$. In case $n=3$, we also prove that a generic conformal minimal immersion $M\to\mathbb{R}^3$ has infinite index of stability on every open set in $\mathbb{R}^3$.</description>

      <title>Triviality, Rotational Symmetry, and Classification of Complete Expanding Gradient Yamabe Solitons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we rigorously analyze the scalar curvature of complete expanding gradient Yamabe solitons. We show that if the scalar curvature is less than the soliton constant by an arbitrarily small positive amount, then the soliton is trivial. Additionally, we show that if the scalar curvature is greater than the soliton constant by an arbitrarily small positive amount, then the soliton is rotationally symmetric. Furthermore, we completely classify nontrivial complete expanding gradient Yamabe solitons in both cases: when the scalar curvature is greater than the soliton constant and when it is less than the soliton constant.</description>

      <title>Witten instanton complex and Morse-Bott inequalities on stratified pseudomanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we construct Witten instanton complexes on stratified pseudomanifolds with wedge metrics, for all choices of mezzo-perversities which classify the self-adjoint extensions of the Hodge Dirac operator. In this singular setting we introduce a generalization of the Morse-Bott condition and in so doing can consider a class of functions with certain non-isolated critical point sets which arise naturally in many examples. This construction of the instanton complex extends the Morse polynomial to this setting from which we prove the corresponding Morse inequalities.
  This work proceeds by constructing Hilbert complexes and normal cohomology complexes, including those corresponding to the Witten deformed complexes for such critical point sets and all mezzo-perversities; these in turn are used to express local Morse polynomials as polynomial trace formulas over their cohomology groups. Under a technical assumption of `flatness' on our Morse-Bott functions we then construct the instanton complex by extending the local harmonic forms to global quasimodes. We also study the Poincar\'e dual complexes and in the case of self-dual complexes extract refined Morse inequalities generalizing those in the smooth setting. We end with a guide for computing local cohomology groups and Morse polynomials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the classical Otal-Peign\'e's Theorem to the class of proper, Gromov-hyperbolic spaces that are line-convex. Namely, we prove that when a group acts discretely and virtually freely by isometries on a metric space in this class then its critical exponent equals the topological entropy of the geodesic flow of the quotient metric space. We also show examples of proper, Gromov-hyperbolic spaces that are not line-convex and for which the statement fails.</description>

      <title>On the Last Kervaire Invariant Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the element $h_6^2$ is a permanent cycle in the Adams spectral sequence. As a result, we establish the existence of smooth framed manifolds with Kervaire invariant one in dimension 126, thereby resolving the final case of the Kervaire invariant problem.
  Combining this result with the theorems of Browder, Mahowald--Tangora, Barratt--Jones--Mahowald, and Hill--Hopkins--Ravenel, we conclude that smooth framed manifolds with Kervaire invariant one exist in and only in dimensions $2, 6, 14, 30, 62$, and $126$.</description>

Abstract: Let $\Phi$ be a subset of the simple roots of a (possibly non-reduced) abstract root system $\Sigma$, and let $\lambda \in \Sigma$. We define the $\Phi$-string of $\lambda$ as the set of elements in $\Sigma \cup \{0\}$ of the form $\lambda + \sum_{\alpha \in \Phi} n_\alpha \alpha$, where $n_\alpha$ is an integer for each $\alpha \in \Phi$. This notion can be regarded as some sort of generalization of the classical notion of $\alpha$-string, where $\alpha \in \Sigma$.</description>

      <title>Symplectization of certain Hamiltonian systems in fibered almost-symplectic manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is an important difference between Hamiltonian-like vector fields in an almost-symplectic manifold $(M,\sigma)$, compared to the standard case of a symplectic manifold: in the almost-symplectic case, a vector field such that the contraction iX{\sigma} is closed need not be a symmetry of $\sigma$. We thus call partially-Hamiltonian those vector fields which have the former property and fully-Hamiltonian those which have both properties. We consider 2n-dimensional almost symplectic manifolds with a fibration $\pi : M \longrightarrow B$ by Lagrangian tori. Trivially, all vertical partially-Hamiltonian vector fields are fully-Hamiltonian. We investigate the existence and the properties of non-vertical fully-Hamiltonian vector fields. We show that this class is non-empty, but under certain genericity conditions that involve the Fourier spectrum of their Hamiltonian, these vector fields reduce, under a (possibly only semi-globally defined, if $n \ge 4$) torus action, to families of standard symplectic-Hamiltonian vector fields.</description>

      <title>Left-Invariant Riemannian Distances on Higher-Rank Sol-Type Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we generalize the results of ($\textit{Groups, Geom. Dyn.}$, forthcoming) to describe the split left-invariant Riemannian distances on higher-rank Sol-type groups $G=\mathbf{N}\rtimes \mathbb{R}^k$. We show that the rough isometry type of such a distance is determined by a specific restriction of the metric to $\mathbb{R}^k$, and therefore the space of rough similarity types of distances is parameterized by the symmetric space $SL_k(\mathbb{R})/SO_k(\mathbb{R})$. In order to prove this result, we describe a family of uniformly roughly geodesic paths, which arise by way of the new technique of $\textit{Euclidean curve surgery}$.</description>

      <title>Dynamic constructions of hyperbolisms of plane curves: an automated exploration of geometric loci</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hyperbolism of a given curve with respect to a point and a line is an interesting construct, a special kind of geometric locus, not frequent in the literature. While networking between two different kinds of mathematical software, we explore various cases, involving quartics, among them the so-called Kuelp quartic and topologically equivalent curves, and also an example with a sextic and a curve of degree 12. By a similar but different way, we derive a new construction of a lemniscate of Gerono. First, parametric equations are derived for the curve, then we perform implicitization Groebner bases packages and using elimination. The polynomial equation which is obtained enables to check irreducibility of the constructed curve.</description>

      <title>On the second coefficient in the semi-classical expansion of Toeplitz Operators on CR manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a compact strictly pseudoconvex embeddable CR manifold and let $A$ be the Toeplitz operator on $X$ associated with a Reeb vector field $\mathcal{T}\in\mathscr{C}^\infty(X,TX)$. Consider the operator $\chi_k(A)$ defined by functional calculus of $A$, where $\chi$ is a smooth function with compact support in the positive real line and $\chi_k(\lambda):=\chi(k^{-1}\lambda)$. It was established recently that $\chi_k(A)(x,y)$ admits a full asymptotic expansion in $k$. The second coefficient of the expansion plays an important role in the further study of CR geometry. In this work, we calculate the second coefficient of the expansion.</description>

      <title>A solution of the problem of standard compact Clifford-Klein forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10539v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We solve the long standing problem of classification of standard compact Clifford-Klein forms of homogeneous spaces of simple non-compact real Lie groups under the extra assumption that $G$, $H$, $L$ are simple and absolutely simple. Then the result is that standard compact Clifford-Klein forms always arise from triples $(\mathfrak{g},\mathfrak{h},\mathfrak{l})$ of real Lie algebras such that $\mathfrak{h}\subset\mathfrak{g},\mathfrak{l}\subset\mathfrak{g}$, $\mathfrak{g}$ is simple and absolutely simple, $\mathfrak{h},\mathfrak{l}$ are (non-compact) reductive, $\mathfrak{g}=\mathfrak{h}+\mathfrak{l}$, and the intersection $\mathfrak{h}\cap\mathfrak{l}$ is compact. The consequence of this is the following characterization of proper co-compact actions of reductive Lie subgroups $L\subset G$ on a homogeneous spaces $G/H$ determined by absolutely simple real Lie group $G$ and a closed reductive subgroup $H$: $L$ acts on $G/H$ properly and co-compactly if and only if $G=H\cdot L$ and $H\cap L$ is compact.</description>

      <title>On the covariant coefficients of geodesic sprays on Finsler manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07995v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a Finsler metric $F$, we introduce the notion of $F$-covariant coefficients $H_i$ of the geodesic spray of $F$ (Def. 3.1). We study some geometric consequences concerning the objects $H_i$. If the $F$-covariant coefficients $H_i$ are written in the form $H_i={\dot{\partial}}_iH$, for some smooth function $H$ on ${\mathcal T\hspace{-1pt}M}$, positively 3-homogeneous in y, then $H$ is called spray scalar or simply $S$-scalar. We prove that if the $S$-scalar exists, then it is of the form $H=\frac{1}{12}\,y^i\partial_iF^2$ and this expression is unique up to a function of position only. We prove also that on a Finsler maifold $(M,F)$, the $S$-scalar $H$ exists if and only if $(M,F)$ is dually flat. Generally, the $n^3$ functions $H^h_{ij}$ resulting from the $F$-covariant coefficients do not form a linear connection. We find out that in the case of projectively flat metrics, the $n^3$ functions $H^h_{ij}$ are coefficients of a linear connection. We introduce two new special Finsler spaces, namely, the $H$-Berwald and the $H$-Landsberg spaces and show that every $H$-Berwald metric is $H$-Landsbergian but the converse is not necessarily true. Also, we study the $F$-covariant coefficients $H_i$ of projectivly flat and dually flat spherically symmetric Finsler metrics and provide a solution of the "$H$-unicorn" Landsberg problem. Finally, we give some examples of $H$-Berwald and $H$-Landsberg metrics and an example of $H$-Landsberg metric which is not $H$-Berwaldian.</description>

      <title>Remark on Laplacians and Riemannian Submersions with Totally Geodesic Fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17078v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a Riemannian submersion $(M,g) \to (B,j)$ each of whose fibers is connected and totally geodesic, we consider a certain 1-parameter family of Riemannian metrics $(g_{t})_{t &gt; 0}$ on $M$, which is called the canonical variation. Let $\lambda_{1}(g_{t})$ be the first positive eigenvalue of the Laplace--Beltrami operator $\Delta^{M}_{g_{t}}$ and $\mbox{Vol}(M,g_{t})$ the volume of $(M, g_{t})$. In 1982, B\'{e}rard-Bergery and Bourguignon showed that the scale-invariant quantity $\lambda_{1}(g_{t})\mbox{Vol}(M,g_{t})^{2/\mbox{dim}M}$ goes to $0$ with $t$. In this paper, we prove that if each fiber is Einstein and $(M,g)$ satisfies a certain condition about its Ricci curvature, then $\lambda_{1}(g_{t})\mbox{Vol}(M,g_{t})^{2/\mbox{dim}M}$ goes to $\infty$ with $t$. We consider many examples. In particular, we consider Riemannian submersions from compact rank one symmetric spaces and the twistor fibration of a quaternionic K\"{a}hler manifold of positive scalar curvature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2109.01062v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce higher analogs for cleavages in the context of (Kan) simplicial fibrations. We apply them to obtain geometric models for representations up to homotopy of (higher) Lie groupoids. Concretely, we set an equivalence between representations up to homotopy and simplicial vector bundles endowed with a cleavage. Our result is an incarnation of the Higher Grothendieck Correspondence, it can be seen as a relative Dold-Kan Theorem and extends earlier work of Gracia-Saz and Mehta on VB-groupoids.</description>

Abstract: Pseudospherical surfaces determined by Cauchy problems involving the Camassa-Holm equation are considered herein. We study how global solutions influence the corresponding surface, as well as we investigate two sorts of singularities of the metric: the first one is just when the co-frame of dual form is not linearly independent. The second sort of singularity is that arising from solutions blowing up. In particular, it is shown that the metric blows up if and only if the solution breaks in finite time.</description>

      <title>Random Systems of Holomorphic Sections of a Sequence of Line bundles on Compact K\"{a}hler Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08243v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper primarily establishes a novel asymptotic variance estimate for smooth linear statistics associated with zero sets of systems of random holomorphic sections in a sequence of positive Hermitian holomorphic line bundles on a compact K\"ahler manifold $(X, \omega)$. Using this variance estimate and the expected distribution, we derive an equidistribution result for zeros of these random systems, which, in terms of approximation theory, proves that the smooth positive closed form $\omega^{k}$ can be approximated by currents of integration along analytic subsets of $X$ of codimension $k$, $k \in \{1, \ldots, n\}$. The probability measures taken into consideration in this paper are sufficiently general to include a wide range of the measures commonly encountered in the literature, for which we give equidistribution results at the end, such as the standard Gaussian measure, Fubini-Study measure, the area measure of spheres, probability measures whose distributions have bounded densities with logarithmically decaying tails and locally moderate measures among others.</description>

      <title>K-stability of special Gushel-Mukai manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10797v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gushel-Mukai manifolds are specific families of $n$-dimensional Fano manifolds of Picard rank $1$ and index $n-2$ where $3\leq n \leq 6$. A Gushel-Mukai $n$-fold is either ordinary, i.e. a hyperquadric section of a quintic Del Pezzo $(n+1)$-fold, or special, i.e. it admits a double cover over the quintic Del Pezzo $n$-fold branched along an ordinary Gushel-Mukai $(n-1)$-fold. In this paper, we prove that a general special Gushel-Mukai $n$-fold is K-stable for every $3\leq n\leq 6$. Furthermore, we give a description of the first and last walls of the K-moduli of the pair $(M,cQ)$, where $M$ is the quintic Del Pezzo fourfold (or fivefold) and $Q$ is an ordinary Gushel-Mukai threefold (or fourfold). Besides, we compute $\delta$-invariants of quintic Del Pezzo fourfolds and fivefolds which were shown to be K-unstable by K. Fujita, and show that they admit K\"ahler-Ricci solitons.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic $\bf{\partial\bar\partial}$-lemma and several geometric applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09447v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove a $\partial\bar{\partial}$-type lemma on compact K\"ahler manifolds for logarithmic differential forms valued in the dual of a certain pseudo-effective line bundle, thereby confirming a conjecture proposed by X. Wan.
  We then derive several applications, including strengthened results by H. Esnault-E. Viehweg on the degeneracy of the spectral sequence at the $E_1$-stage for projective manifolds associated with the logarithmic de Rham complex, as well as by L. Katzarkov-M. Kontsevich-T. Pantev on the unobstructed locally trivial deformations of a projective generalized log Calabi-Yau pair with some weights, both of which are extended to the broader context of compact K\"ahler manifolds.
  Furthermore, we establish the K\"ahler version of an injectivity theorem originally formulated by F. Ambro in the algebraic setting. Notably, while O. Fujino previously addressed the K\"ahler case, our proof takes a different approach by avoiding the reliance on mixed Hodge structures for cohomology with compact support.</description>
