      <title>A note on logarithmic mean equicontinuity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the set of harmonic limits of empirical measures in topological dynamical systems. We obtain a characterization of unique ergodicity based of logarithmic (harmonic) mean convergence in place of Ces\`aro convergence. We introduce logarithmic mean equicontinuity and show that a topological dynamical system is logarithmically mean equicontinuous if and only if it is mean equicontinuous.</description>

      <title>Meromorphic degeneration of rational functions over snc models of the projective line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For an analytic family $\{f_t\}_{t\in\mathbb{D}^*}$ on the unit punctured disk that meromorphically degenerates at the origin, we show that its limiting measure on an snc model is given by the push forward of the canonical measure attached to the non-archimedean rational function naturally induced from the family, which is a generalization of the results by DeMarco-Faber and Okuyama.</description>

      <title>Numerical action for endomorphisms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $f: X\to X$ be a surjective endomorphism of a projective variety of dimension $d$. The aim of this paper is to study the action of $f$ on the numerical group of divisors. For exmaple, I proved that $f$ is cohomologically hyperbolic if and only if it is quasi-amplified; and it is amplified if and only if every subsystem of $(X,f)$ is cohomologically hyperbolic. For the proofs, I introduced a notion of spectrum in linear algebra for an open and saliant invariant cone. I also introduce a notion of generated (positive) cycles as an algebraic analogy of (positive) closed current.</description>

      <title>The shadowing property for piecewise monotone interval maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The property of shadowing has been shown to be fundamental in both the theory of symbolic dynamics as well as continuous dynamical systems. A quintessential class of discontinuous dynamical systems are those driven by transitive piecewise monotone interval maps and in particular $\beta$-transformations, namely transformations of the form $T_{\beta, \alpha} : x \mapsto \beta x + \alpha \; (\operatorname{mod} \, 1)$ acting on $[0,1]$. We provide a short elegant proof showing that this class of dynamical systems does not possess the property of shadowing, complementing and extending the work of Chen and Portela.</description>

      <title>Mass-Optimal Low-Thrust Forced Periodic Trajectories in the Earth-Moon CR3BP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Cislunar space, spacecraft are able to exploit naturally periodic orbits, which provide operational reliability. However, these periodic orbits only exist in a limited volume. Enabled by low-thrust propulsion, spacecraft can produce a greater number of periodic trajectories in Cislunar space. We describe a methodology for producing mass-optimal trajectories that enforce periodic structure in the circular-restricted three body problem and study the thrust-limited reachable set around a reference trajectory. In this study, we find that the thrust-limited mass-optimal reachable set is a superset of the energy-limited energy-optimal reachable set in the xy-plane.</description>

      <title>Stability of Jordan Recurrent Neural Network Estimator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: State estimation involves finding the states of a noisy dynamical system with a noisy initial condition using noisy measurements, given a model of the system. Many methods exist for state estimation of dynamical systems. For linear dynamical systems with white Gaussian noises of known mean and variance, Kalman filtering is an optimal state estimation algorithm. While several extensions of the Kalman filter to nonlinear systems exist, either the method is not optimal or calculation is not feasible. Several approaches using neural networks have been developed in recent years. While these approaches seem to work numerically, stability and convergence guarantees do not exist. In this paper, we propose to use a Jordan recurrent neural network (JRN) for state estimation. An input-to-state stability (ISS) analysis of the error dynamics is used. Our results are compared to the Kalman filter for the linear case and the extended Kalman filter for the nonlinear case.</description>

      <title>Harnessing omnipresent oscillator networks as computational resource</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nature is pervaded with oscillatory behavior. In networks of coupled oscillators patterns can arise when the system synchronizes to an external input. Hence, these networks provide processing and memory of input. We present a universal framework for harnessing oscillator networks as computational resource. This reservoir computing framework is introduced by the ubiquitous model for phase-locking, the Kuramoto model. We force the Kuramoto model by a nonlinear target-system, then after substituting the target-system with a trained feedback-loop it emulates the target-system. Our results are two-fold. Firstly, the trained network inherits performance properties of the Kuramoto model, where all-to-all coupling is performed in linear time with respect to the number of nodes and parameters for synchronization are abundant. Secondly, the learning capabilities of the oscillator network can be explained using Kuramoto model's order parameter. This work provides the foundation for utilizing nature's oscillator networks as a new class of information processing systems.</description>

      <title>Multifractal analysis of intermingled basins and blowout bifurcations in a parametetric family of skew product maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study a two-parameter family of planar maps characterized by two distinct invariant subspaces. The model reveals the existence of two chaotic attractors within these subspaces. We identify parameter values at which these attractors either exhibits a locally riddled basin of attraction or transitions into a chaotic saddle. In particular, we demonstrate that, for an open region in the parameter plane, their basins are intermingled. It is shown that a fractal boundary curve separates the basins of attraction of these two chaotic attractors, providing a detailed characterization of the riddled basin structure. Additionally, we show that the model undergoes a blowout bifurcation. An estimation of the stability index is examined using thermodynamic formalism. We also perform a multifractal analysis of the level sets of the stability index.</description>

      <title>A Recurrence-type Strong Borel--Cantelli Lemma for Axiom A Diffeomorphisms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.12928v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $(X,\mu,T,d)$ be a metric measure-preserving dynamical system such that $3$-fold correlations decay exponentially for Lipschitz continuous observables. Given a sequence $(M_k)$ that converges to $0$ slowly enough, we obtain a strong dynamical Borel--Cantelli result for recurrence, i.e., for $\mu$-a.e. $x\in X$ \[ \lim_{n \to \infty}\frac{\sum_{k=1}^{n} \mathbf{1}_{B_k(x)}(T^{k}x)} {\sum_{k=1}^{n} \mu(B_k(x))} = 1, \] where $\mu(B_k(x)) = M_k$. In particular, we show that this result holds for Axiom A diffeomorphisms and equilibrium states under certain assumptions.</description>

      <title>Algebraic billiards in the Fermat hyperbola</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16172v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove two results on the algebraic dynamics of billiards in generic algebraic curves of degree $d \geq 2$. First, the dynamical degree grows quadratically in $d$; second, the set of complex periodic points has measure 0, implying the Ivrii Conjecture for the classical billiard map in generic algebraic domains. To prove these results, we specialize to a new billiard table, the Fermat hyperbola, on which the indeterminacy points satisfy an exceptionality property. Over $\mathbb{C}$, we construct an algebraically stable model for this billiard via an iterated blowup. Over more general fields, we prove essential stability, i.e. algebraic stability for a particular big and nef divisor.</description>

      <title>On the dynamics of non-autonomous systems in a~neighborhood of a~homoclinic trajectory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01181v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article is devoted to the study of a $2$-dimensional piecewise smooth (but possibly) discontinuous dynamical system, subject to a non-autonomous perturbation; we assume that the unperturbed system admits a homoclinic trajectory $\vec{\gamma}(t)$. Our aim is to analyze the dynamics in a neighborhood of $\vec{\gamma}(t)$ as the perturbation is turned on, by defining a Poincar\'e map and evaluating fly time and space displacement of trajectories performing a loop close to $\vec{\gamma}(t)$.
  Besides their intrinsic mathematical interest, these results can be thought of as a first step in the analysis of several interesting problems, such as the stability of a homoclinic trajectory of a non-autonomous ODE and a possible extension of Melnikov chaos to a discontinuous setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18802v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conditional symmetries were introduced by Levi and Winternitz in their 1989 seminal paper to deal with nonlinear PDEs. Here we discuss their application in the framework of ODEs, and more specifically Dynamical Systems; it turns out they are closely related to two established -- albeit maybe less widely known -- concepts, i.e. orbital symmetries and configurational invariants. The paper is devoted to studying the interplay of these notions, and their application in the study of Dynamical Systems, with special attention to invariant manifolds of these.</description>

      <title>Universal projection theorems with applications to multifractal analysis and the dimension of every ergodic measure on self-conformal sets simultaneously</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03529v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a universal projection theorem, giving conditions on a parametrized family of maps $\Pi_\lambda : X \to \mathbb{R}^d$ and a collection $M$ of measures on $X$ under which for almost every $\lambda$ equality $\mathrm{dim}_H \Pi_\lambda \mu = \min\{d, \mathrm{dim}_H \mu\}$ holds for all measures $\mu \in M$ simultaneously (i.e. on a full-measure set of $\lambda$'s independent of $\mu$). We require $\Pi_\lambda$ to satisfy a transversality condition and $M$ to satisfy a new condition called relative dimension separability. We also prove that if the Assouad dimension of $X$ is smaller than d, then for almost every $\lambda$, projection $\Pi_\lambda$ is nearly bi-Lipschitz at $\mu$-a.e. $x$, for all measures $\mu \in M$ simultaneously. Our setting can include families of orthogonal projections, natural projections for conformal, non-autonomous or random iterated functions systems.
  As an application, we prove that for a parametrized family of contracting conformal IFS with natural projections $\Pi_\lambda$ satisfying the transversality condition, for almost every parameter $\lambda$ one has $\mathrm{dim}_H \Pi_\lambda \mu = \min\{ d, \frac{h(\mu)}{\chi(\lambda, \mu)} \}$ for all ergodic shift-invariant measures simultaneously.
  We also prove that for self-similar systems on the line with similarity dimension smaller than one, for Lebesgue almost every choice of translations the multifractal formalism holds simultaneously on the full spectrum interval $\left[\min \frac{\log p_i}{\log|\lambda_i|},\max \frac{\log p_i}{\log|\lambda_i|}\right]$ for every self-similar measure.
  We prove that the dimension part of the Marstrand-Mattila projection theorem holds simultaneously for the collection of all ergodic measures on a self-conformal set with the strong separation condition and without any separation for the collection of all Gibbs measures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10838v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the relative SU(2,1)-character varieties of the one-holed torus, and the action of the mapping class group on them. We use an explicit description of the character variety of the free group of rank two in SU(2,1) in terms of traces, which allow us to describe the topology of the character variety. We then combine this description with a generalization of the Farey graph adapted to this new combinatorial setting, using ideas introduced by Bowditch. Using these tools, we can describe an open domain of discontinuity for the action of the mapping class group which strictly contains the set of convex cocompact characters, and we give several characterizations of representations in this domain.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06115v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a differential or $q$-difference equation $P$ of order $n$, we prove that the set of exponents of a generalized power series solution has its rational rank bounded by the rational rank of the support of $P$ plus $n$. We also prove that when the support of the solution has maximum rational rank, it is convergent. Using the Newton polygon technique, we show also that in the maximum rational rank case, an initial segment can always be completed to a true solution. The techniques are the same for the differential and the $q$-difference case.</description>

      <title>Accuracy of the Ensemble Kalman Filter in the Near-Linear Setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09800v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The filtering distribution captures the statistics of the state of a dynamical system from partial and noisy observations. Classical particle filters provably approximate this distribution in quite general settings; however they behave poorly for high dimensional problems, suffering weight collapse. This issue is circumvented by the ensemble Kalman filter which is an equal-weight interacting particle system. However, this finite particle system is only proven to approximate the true filter in the linear Gaussian case. In practice, however, it is applied in much broader settings; as a result, establishing its approximation properties more generally is important. There has been recent progress in the theoretical analysis of the algorithm, establishing stability and error estimates in non-Gaussian settings, but the assumptions on the dynamics and observation models rule out the unbounded vector fields that arise in practice and the analysis applies only to the mean field limit of the ensemble Kalman filter. The present work establishes error bounds between the filtering distribution and the finite particle ensemble Kalman filter when the dynamics and observation vector fields may be unbounded, allowing linear growth.</description>

      <title>A kinetic derivation of spatial distributed models for tumor-immune system interactions</title>

Abstract: We propose a mathematical kinetic framework to investigate interactions between tumor cells and the immune system, focusing on the spatial dynamics of tumor progression and immune responses. We develop two kinetic models: one describes a conservative scenario where immune cells switch between active and passive states without proliferation, while the other incorporates immune cell proliferation and apoptosis. By considering specific assumptions about the microscopic processes, we derive macroscopic systems featuring linear diffusion, nonlinear cross-diffusion, and nonlinear self-diffusion. Our analysis provides insights into equilibrium configurations and stability, revealing clear correspondences among the macroscopic models derived from the same kinetic framework. Using dynamical systems theory, we examine the stability of equilibrium states and conduct numerical simulations to validate our findings. These results highlight the significance of spatial interactions in tumor-immune dynamics, paving the way for a structured exploration of therapeutic strategies and further investigations into immune responses in various pathological contexts.</description>

      <title>Strongly sofic monoids, sofic topological entropy, and surjunctivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17688v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the class of strongly sofic monoids. This class of monoids strictly contains the class of sofic groups and is a proper subclass of the class of sofic monoids. We define and investigate sofic topological entropy for actions of strongly sofic monoids on compact spaces. We show that sofic topological entropy is a topological conjugacy invariant for such actions and use this fact to prove that every strongly sofic monoid is surjunctive. This means that if $M$ is a strongly sofic monoid and $A$ is a finite alphabet set, then every injective cellular automaton $\tau \colon A^M \to A^M$ is surjective. As an application, we prove that the monoid algebra of a strongly sofic monoid with coefficients in an arbitrary field is always stably finite. Our results are extensions to strongly sofic monoids of two previously known properties of sofic groups. The first one is the celebrated Gromov-Weiss theorem asserting that every sofic group is surjunctive. The second is the Elek-Szab\'o theorem which says that group algebras of sofic groups satisfy Kaplansky's stable finiteness conjecture.</description>
