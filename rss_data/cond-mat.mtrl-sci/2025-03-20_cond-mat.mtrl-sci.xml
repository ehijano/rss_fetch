      <title>Structural, electronic, vibrational, optical, piezoelectric, thermal and thermoelectric properties of double perovskite BCZT from first-principles calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Double perovskite material such as BCZT (Ba$_{0.875}$Ca$_{0.125}$(Zr$_{0.125}$Ti$_{0.875}$)O$_{3}$) is well known for its high value of piezoceramic properties and Curie temperature which has potential applications in sensors, actuators, optoelectronic and thermoelectric devices. Based on its composition and physical parameters such as pressure and temperature, experimentally, BCZT shows different crystal structures (rhombohedral, tetragonal and orthorhombic) with multiferroic properties. Here, we have designed these materials by comparing experimental stoichiometry and evaluated their stability by calculating the tolerance factor, formation energy, and cohesive energy. The structural, electronic and vibrational properties of BCZT are explored using generalized gradient approximation (GGA) within the framework of density functional theory. We have also shown variation of piezoelectric and optical properties through multiple phases using time dependent density functional theory. The electronic band gap, optical response in the visible light range, as well as piezoelectric, electrical, thermal, and thermoelectric properties, demonstrate excellent characteristics, making this material a promising lead-free ferroelectric candidate for various energy harvesting applications. Boltzmann transport theory is used for the calculation of Seebeck coefficient, electron thermal conductivity, and electrical conductivity to estimate the power factor and figure of merit which represents the efficiency of the material. The high values at the Fermi level suggest that these materials are well-suited for future device applications.</description>

      <title>Teaching Artificial Intelligence to Perform Rapid, Resolution-Invariant Grain Growth Modeling via Fourier Neural Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microstructural evolution, particularly grain growth, plays a critical role in shaping the physical, optical, and electronic properties of materials. Traditional phase-field modeling accurately simulates these phenomena but is computationally intensive, especially for large systems and fine spatial resolutions. While machine learning approaches have been employed to accelerate simulations, they often struggle with resolution dependence and generalization across different grain scales. This study introduces a novel approach utilizing Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) to achieve resolution-invariant modeling of microstructure evolution in multi-grain systems. FNO operates in the Fourier space and can inherently handle varying resolutions by learning mappings between function spaces. By integrating FNO with the phase field method, we developed a surrogate model that significantly reduces computational costs while maintaining high accuracy across different spatial scales. We generated a comprehensive dataset from phase-field simulations using the Fan Chen model, capturing grain evolution over time. Data preparation involved creating input-output pairs with a time shift, allowing the model to predict future microstructures based on current and past states. The FNO-based neural network was trained using sequences of microstructures and demonstrated remarkable accuracy in predicting long-term evolution, even for unseen configurations and higher-resolution grids not encountered during training.</description>

      <title>Dislocations in the elastic fields of randomly distributed defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the behavior of dislocations in random solid solutions has received renewed interest, and several models have been discussed where random alloys are treated as effective media containing random distributions of dilatation and compression centers. More generally speaking, the arrangement of defects in metals and alloys is always characterized by statistical disorder, and the same is true for the fluctuating fields that arise from the superposition of the stress and strain fields of many defects. In order to develop models for the dynamics of dislocations interacting with such fields, a statistical description of the dislocation energy landscape and the associated configurational forces is needed, as well as methods for coarse graining these forces over dislocation segments of varying length and shape. In this context the problem arises how to regularize the highly singular stress fields associated with dislocations and other defects. Here we formulate an approach which is based upon evaluating the interaction energies and interaction forces between singular dislocations and other defects including solutes, modelled as point-like dilatation centers, and other dislocations. We characterize the interactions in terms of the probability densities of interaction energies and interaction forces, and the corresponding spatial correlation functions. We also consider the effects of dislocation core regularization, either in terms of continuously distributed Burgers vectors or by using the formalism of gradient elasticity of Helmholtz type to formulate a regularized energy functional.</description>

      <title>Magnetoelasticity in MnPt $L1_{0}$ system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic materials play an important role in the industry. Except for common material parameters such as magnetocrystalline anisotropy, magnetoelastic behavior can be significant for application serving in various devices, e.g. in acoustic actuators, transducers, or sensors providing desirable fast response and high efficiency. Magnetoelasticit properties have been studied for the cubic system. However, their magnetoelastic behavior is weak. Therefore, we focus on Pt-based tetragonal binary compounds bearing engaging magnetic behavior. We evaluate MnPt magnetoelastic behavior using the finite displacement method, discussing the influence of the magnetic structure, and focusing on the origin. While, the theoretically obtained results are compared to our performed experiments.</description>

      <title>Steric Engineering of Exciton Fine Structure in 2D Perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A comprehensive study of excitonic properties of 2D layered perovskites is provided, with an emphasis on understanding and controlling the exciton fine structure. First, an overview of the optical properties is presented, discussing the challenges in determining the bandgap and exciton binding energies. Through magneto-optical spectroscopic measurements (up to B = 140 T), scaling laws are established for exciton binding energy as a function of the band gap and the diamagnetic coefficient. Using an in-plane magnetic field, the exciton fine structure for various 2D perovskites is examined to measure the energy splitting between the excitonic levels. The exciton fine structure and exchange interaction are correlated with structural parameters, employing an effective mass model, to highlight the role of steric effect on the exchange interaction. These findings reveal that lattice distortions, introduced by organic spacers, significantly influence the exchange interaction, driving a tunable energy spacing between dark and bright excitons. This unique feature of 2D perovskites, not present in other semiconductors, offers a novel tuning mechanism for exciton control, making these materials highly promising for efficient light emitters and advanced quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Ferromagnetism and structural phase transition in rhombohedral PrIr3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The synthesis, structural, magnetic, thermal and transport properties are reported for polycrystalline PrIr3. At room temperature PrIr3 displays the rhombohedral space group R-3m and a PuNi3- type structure. At around 70 K a phase transition to a monoclinic C2/m structure is observed and continued cooling reveals temperature independent behavior of the unit cell volume. Further, PrIr3 undergoes a paramagnetic to ferromagnetic transition with T_C = 7.5 K. The temperature dependent magnetic susceptibility follows the Curie Weiss law with a positive Curie-Weiss temperature, and an effective moment that is close to the theoretical effective moment for a free Pr+3 ion. This introduces further complexity into the behavior of PuNi3 - type materials and highlights the importance of temperature-dependent structural studies to complement physical property measurements in intermetallic compounds.</description>

      <title>Exciton Annihilation by Lanthanide Dopants: An Atomic Probe of Sub-Diffraction Exciton Diffusion in Ferromagnetic CrI3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Excitons in two-dimensional (2D) magnetic van der Waals (vdW) materials offer unique windows into the properties of strongly correlated electrons. Their generation can be used to drive magnetic phase transitions, manipulate spins coherently, or access novel non-equilibrium regimes. Despite extensive investigation into the spin physics of CrI3, exciton dynamics in this archetypal magnetic 2D material remain underexplored. Here, we report the use of Yb3+ impurity point defects as exciton annihilators to probe exciton diffusion in CrI3. Variable-temperature photoluminescence (PL) measurements for a series of x% Yb3+:CrI3 samples reveal thermally activated Dexter-type site-to-site hopping of excitons, with low exciton diffusivity associated with strong electron-nuclear coupling. Using Monte Carlo modeling calibrated by the experimental data, diffusivities are found to be orders of magnitudes lower than in 2D vdW semiconductors. Exciton diffusion lengths (LD) are below ~3 nm at all temperatures, and thus well below the optical diffraction limit. These results have basic implications for the use of excitons to probe and manipulate their surroundings in this and related magnetic CrX3 materials.</description>

      <title>Degradation of 2.4-kV $Ga_{2}O_{3}$ Schottky Barrier Diode at High Temperatures up to 500 {\deg}C</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ga2O3 Schottky barrier diodes featuring a field plate and a composite SiO2/SiNx dielectric layer beneath the field plate were fabricated, achieving a breakdown voltage of 2.4 kV at room temperature. Electrical performance and degradation were analyzed via I-V and C-V measurements from 25 {\deg}C to 500 {\deg}C, revealing temperature-dependent transport, interface stability, and device stability. Upon returning to room temperature, the diodes exhibited nearly unchanged forward characteristics, while the breakdown voltage declined significantly from 2.4 kV to 700 V. This behavior indicates a temperature-induced reduction in the barrier height. Detailed analysis revealed that variable range hopping (VRH) dominated the leakage mechanism at moderate temperatures, while thermal emission (TE) became increasingly significant at temperatures exceeding 400 {\deg}C.</description>

      <title>Electric-field-induced fully-compensated ferrimagnetism in experimentally synthesized monolayer MnSe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Owing to their inherent characteristics of zero stray field and terahertz dynamics, two-dimensional (2D) zero-net-magnetization magnets demonstrate the potential for miniaturization, ultradensity and ultrafast performance. Recently, fully-compensated ferrimagnet of 2D zero-net-magnetization magnets has already attracted attention, as it can exhibit global spin-splitting, magneto-optical response and anomalous Hall effect [\textcolor[rgb]{0.00,0.00,1.00}{Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 116703 (2025)}]. Therefore, it is very important to provide experimentally feasible strategies and materials to achieve fully-compensated ferrimagnets. Here, we use the experimentally synthesized A-type $PT$-antiferromagnet (the joint symmetry ($PT$) of space inversion symmetry ($P$) and time-reversal symmetry ($T$)) MnSe as the parent material to induce fully-compensated ferrimagnetism through an out-of-plane electric field. This electric field can remove the $P$ symmetry of the lattice, thereby breaking the $PT$ symmetry and inducing spin-splitting. When considering spin-orbital coupling (SOC), MnSe with an out-of-plane magnetization can achieve the anomalous valley Hall effect (AVHE). In addition, we also discuss inducing fully-compensated ferromagnetism via Se vacancies and Janus engineering. Our works can promote the further development of 2D fully-compensated ferrimagnets both theoretically and experimentally.</description>

      <title>SALMON VR: Visualizing Light-Matter Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents SALMON VR, a visualization program designed to visualize the time evolution of electronic density changes and vector potentials in virtual reality (VR) space. The time-series electronic density data computed by SALMON are stored in CUBE format. SALMON VR processes these data to construct isosurfaces of electronic density variations and two-dimensional representations of vector potentials. Equipped with a user-friendly interface using VR technology, the program is available in two versions: one for the Meta Quest 3 head-mount display (Meta Platforms Inc., California) and one for PCs. Atoms are displayed as spheres of different sizes and colors according to their elemental properties. This visual representation facilitates a deeper understanding of the complex interactions between light and electrons. Users can easily manipulate the isosurface values, speed of animation, and color map of the vector potential. SALMON VR will enable researchers and educators to enhance their understanding of physical phenomena and improve engagement in learning environments.</description>

      <title>Chemical Foundation Model Guided Design of High Ionic Conductivity Electrolyte Formulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing optimal formulations is a major challenge in developing electrolytes for the next generation of rechargeable batteries due to the vast combinatorial design space and complex interplay between multiple constituents. Machine learning (ML) offers a powerful tool to uncover underlying chemical design rules and accelerate the process of formulation discovery. In this work, we present an approach to design new formulations that can achieve target performance, using a generalizable chemical foundation model. The chemical foundation model is fine-tuned on an experimental dataset of 13,666 ionic conductivity values curated from the lithium-ion battery literature. The fine-tuned model is used to discover 7 novel high conductivity electrolyte formulations through generative screening, improving the conductivity of LiFSI and LiDFOB based electrolytes by 82% and 172%, respectively. These findings highlight a generalizable workflow that is highly adaptable to the discovery of chemical mixtures with tailored properties to address challenges in energy storage and beyond.</description>

      <title>Cooperative atomic motion during shear deformation in metallic glass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Elucidating mechanical deformation in glassy materials at the atomic level is challenging due to their disordered atomic structure. Using our novel "frozen atom analysis," we reveal that anelastic deformation in CuZr metallic glasses is fundamentally driven by cooperative atomic motions of approximately 40 elastically linked atoms, forming trigger groups. They initiate localized rearrangements, which can cascade into plastic flow. Notably, these groups show no distinct structural or physical features, challenging the idea that deformation occurs in defective regions. Instead, deformation events are highly stochastic and transient, driven by collective atomic motion. This finding not only reshapes our understanding of glassy material deformation mechanisms but also highlights cooperative motion as a key factor in avalanche-like phenomena governing the behavior of disordered systems across multiple scales.</description>

      <title>Intumescent Polymer-Particle Hydrogels Expand the Retardancy Window for Wildfire Defense</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 2025 Los Angeles wildfires caused widespread urban destruction and displacement, and severe economic losses, highlighting the urgent need for better fire retardants. Current fire suppression strategies rely heavily on water, chemical fire retardants, and water-enhancing gels, which use superabsorbent polymers to retain water and adhere to substrates, offering extended fire protection compared to water alone. However, their effectiveness is limited by evaporation and degradation under extreme heat and wind conditions. This study investigates the thermal properties, evaporation dynamics, and fire retardancy mechanisms of a novel polymer-particle (PP) hydrogel with aerogel-forming capabilities. Using a combination of retardancy tests, thermal analysis and modeling, rheological characterization, porosity analysis, and electron microscopy, we analyze how the gelation mechanism, polymer network integrity, and physical interactions of cellulose chains with colloidal silica particles influence fire retardancy and intumescent response. The boiling-induced water vapor expansion and bubble nucleation drive the transformation of the hydrogel into a highly porous, large-volume fire-retardant dome upon rapid heat desiccation, enhancing thermal insulation. By evaluating the retardancy window across different evaporation stages under high heat and wind conditions, this study aims to determine the duration, effectiveness, and governing physical mechanisms of this unique retardant system. These findings provide a framework for designing the next generation of fire retardants with optimized thermal stability and extended protection for wildfire mitigation.</description>

      <title>Effect of substitution La by Mg on electrochemical and electronic properties in La$_{2-x}$Mg$_x$Ni$_7$ alloys: a combined experimental and ab initio studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: La-Mg-Ni-based alloys are promising negative electrode materials for 3rd generation of Ni-MH$_x$ batteries. In this work, we investigate the effect of Mg substitution on the electrochemical and electronic properties of La$_{2-x}$Mg$_x$Ni$_7$ materials. The mechanical alloying technique is used to produce a series of La$_{2-x}$Mg$_x$Ni$_7$ alloys ($x$ = 0.00, 0.25, 0.50 and 0.75). The X-ray diffraction measurements indicate multiphase character of the samples with majority (La,Mg)$_2$Ni$_7$ phases of hexagonal Ce$_2$Ni$_7$-type and rhombohedral Gd$_2$Co$_7$-type. Electrochemical measurements show how the maximum discharge capacity ($C_{max}$) increases with Mg concentration and that reach the highest value of 304 mAh/g for La$_{1.5}$Mg$_{0.5}$Ni$_7$ ($x$ = 0.5). The experimental efforts are followed by the density functional theory (DFT) calculations performed with the full-potential local-orbital minimum-basis scheme (FPLO). To simulate chemical disorder, we use the coherent potential approximation (CPA). The calculations are focused on the La$_{1.5}$Mg$_{0.5}$Ni$_7$ composition with the highest measured value of $C_{max}$. Additionally, several other structures are considered as reference points. We find that hexagonal and rhombohedral structures of La$_2$Ni$_7$ have almost identical total energies, which is in a good agreement with a coexistence of both phases in the samples. The calculated site preferences of Mg in both Ce$_2$Ni$_7$-type and Gd$_2$Co$_7$-type La$_{1.5}$Mg$_{0.5}$Ni$_7$ phases are consistent with the previous experimental data. Furthermore, the valence band of the nanocrystalline La$_{1.5}$Mg$_{0.5}$Ni$_7$ sample is investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The experimental XPS are interpreted based on the corresponding spectra calculated with DFT.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ScN is an emerging transition metal nitride with unique physical properties arising from the d-electrons of Sc. In this work we present the results of optical characterization techniques spectroscopic ellipsometry, Raman spectroscopy, and photoluminescence measurements of a 40 $\mu$m thick, fully relaxed, and only weakly n-type doped ($n = 1.2 \times 10^{18}$ cm$^{-3}$) ScN film deposited by halide vapor phase epitaxy (HVPE) on r-sapphire substrate. Spectroscopic ellipsometry yields an indirect bandgap of 1.1 eV while the lowest direct interband transition is observed at $E_\mathrm{g,opt} = $ 2.16 eV in the dielectric function. A broad luminescence feature at 2.15 eV is observed, matching this transition. We derive an estimate for the exciton binding energy ($E_{bX}\approx $14 meV) as well as the Born effective charges $Z_\mathrm{Sc}^* = -Z_\mathrm{N}^* = 3.78$. In the infrared spectral region we observe a strong phonon and a weak plasmon absorption. We precisely determine the transverse optical phonon eigenfrequency ($\omega_\mathrm{TO} = $340.7 cm$^{-1}$), the high frequency dielectric constant ($\varepsilon_\infty = 8.3$) and the static dielectric constant ($\varepsilon_\mathrm{stat} = 29.5$). Raman measurements using various excitation energies show resonant multi-phonon scattering up to 6LO (6th order overtone for longitudinal optical (LO) phonons) for excitation above the optical band gap ($E_\mathrm{Laser} &gt; E_\mathrm{g,opt}$), where the allowed 2LO scattering is the dominant scattering mechanism for all excitation energies. Their characteristic parameters determined from Lorentzian line shape fitting yield $\omega_\mathrm{LO} = $681 cm$^{-1}$ and an increased broadening and reduced asymmetry for higher LO scattering order $n$.</description>

      <title>Effect of Gd and Co content on electrochemical and electronic properties of La$_{1.5}$Mg$_{0.5}$Ni$_7$ alloys: a combined experimental and first-principles study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the effect of Gd and Co substitutions on the electrochemical and electronic properties of La$_{1.5}$Mg$_{0.5}$Ni$_7$ alloy. Two series of La$_{1.5-x}$Gd$_x$Mg$_{0.5}$Ni$_7$ ($x$ = 0.0, 0.25, 1.0) and La$_{1.5}$Mg$_{0.5}$Ni$_{7-y}$Co$_y$ ($y$ = 0.0, 0.5, 1.5) alloys are produced using mechanical alloying technique. The X-ray diffraction indicates multiphase character of the samples, with the majority of hexagonal Ce$_2$Ni$_7$-type and rhombohedral Gd$_2$Co$_7$-type structures of (La,Mg)$_2$Ni$_7$ phase. Partial substitutions of La by Gd or Ni by Co in La$_{1.5}$Mg$_{0.5}$Ni$_7$ phase result in increase of cycle stability of the metal hydride (MH$_x$) electrodes. All considered alloys reach the maximum discharge capacity after three charging-discharging cycles. Two optimal compositions, in respect of electrochemical properties, are subsequently investigated by the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The experimental analysis of the valence band is further extended by the density functional theory (DFT) calculations. We also discuss the effects of alloying and site preference of dopants on the position of the van Hove-type singularity, as observed in the electronic densities of states (DOS) in proximity of the Fermi level.</description>

      <title>Ideal Weyl fermions and double Kagome bands in a series of distorted armchair-type all-$\emph{sp}^{2}$ carbon networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of the Weyl fermions and Kagome bands has recently attracted significant attention in condensed matter physics. However, realizing of perfect Weyl semimetals and double Kagome bands remains challenging. Here, we report a new class of distorted armchair-type fully sp2-hybridized carbon networks, termed DACN-n. The DACN-n family is characterized by only six pairs of Weyl points on the $k_z=0$ plane near the Fermi level. We calculated the chirality of these Weyl points and found that each carries a topological charge of $\pm$1. Notably, DACN-5 exhibits a double Kagome band, where the Weyl points arise from the intersection between Dirac-type bands in the two sets of Kagome bands. The structural stability of DACN-n is confirmed by phonon spectra, ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, and elastic constant calculations. Additionally, we investigated the surface states of the (001) surface and found that its nontrivial topological properties are attributed to the Fermi arcs connecting a pair of Weyl points with opposite chirality. We also simulated x-ray diffraction patterns to guide experimental synthesis. Our findings not only present a new family of three-dimensional carbon allotropes, but also provide a unique opportunity for exploring ideal Weyl fermions and double Kagome bands.</description>

Abstract: High-pressure induced structural transition from zircon-type phase into scheelite-type phase in YVO$_4$ is studied using ab initio calculations. Several structures with compressed volumes are evaluated, where for every considered volume the c/a ratio and atomic positions are optimised. The transition pressure and transition volume change are calculated. The reports on YVO$_4$ electronic structure and electronic band gap behaviour are followed by results of X-Ray photoemission spectra XPS calculations. Most of our theoretical predictions are compared with experimental results taken from literature.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this research, we examine the electronic, magnetic, and lattice properties of the Fe$_4$(P$_2$O$_7$)$_3$ compound using the first principles calculations based on the density functional theory. The crystal lattice has a monoclinic structure, belonging to the P$2_1/n$ space group. The optimized lattice parameters are a=7.406 \AA, b=21.425 \AA, c=9.529 \AA, and agree very well with the experimental data, thanks to the local Coulomb interactions and van der Waals forces included in the calculations. The investigation considers several magnetic orderings. The lowest total energy was found for the antiferromagnetic configuration with the magnetic moment of $\sim4.6~\mu_{\text{B}}$ per Fe atom. The electronic structure calculation shows the Mott insulating state with the energy gap $E_g=2.87$~eV. For the relaxed crystal structure, the elastic properties were obtained and analyzed. The phonon dispersion relations and density of states were calculated within the temperature-dependent effective potential methodusing atomic multidisplacements obtained by high efficiency configuration space sampling.</description>

      <title>Electrically switchable non-relativistic Zeeman spin splittings in collinear antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic or electrical manipulation of electronic spin is elementary for spin-based logic, computing, and memory, where the latter is a low-power manipulation scheme. Rashba-like spin splittings stemming from spin-orbit interaction (SOI) enable electric-field manipulation of spin, but the relativistic SOI causes spin relaxations and yields dissipative transport of spin-encoded information. Recent works suggest the occurrence of electric-field switchable non-relativistic Zeeman spin splittings (NRZSSs) in collinear antiferromagnets -- allowing for electrical manipulation of spin in the non-relativistic regime; yet, a theory elucidating the mechanisms for these NRZSSs and guiding the materials discovery remains missing. Here, we develop such a theory by analyzing the symmetries of spin point groups. We highlight the linear magnetoelectric and bilinear piezomagnetoelectric mechanisms for NRZSSs that depend linearly on electric field and are electrically switchable. First-principles calculations further confirm that LiMnPO$_4$ and NaMnP showcase such NRZSSs. Our theory provides guidelines for discovering light-element collinear antiferromagnets with electrically switchable NRZSSs, which are promising for the design of high-performance spin-based devices.</description>

      <title>Determination of Electron Extraction in Semiconductor Photoanodes: Steady-state and Small-perturbation Response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work develops an analytical model to consistently interpret the steady-state and small-perturbation response (both in the time and frequency domain) of photoanodes for solar water-splitting. In addition to accounting for the fundamental mechanisms of charge-carrier generation, recombination and slow hole transfer at the photoanode/electrolyte interface, the model overcomes the key shortcomings of existing models in the literature. These include consistency across measurements/bias conditions and the non-consideration of imperfect electron extraction at the collecting contact and its corresponding effect on the recombination rate in the bulk. We applied the model to analyse the time constants obtained from intensity-modulated photocurrent (IMPS) and photovoltage (IMVS) measurements of a hematite photoanode, obtaining an electron extraction velocity of 100 cm/s close to the 1 sun open-circuit potential, that corresponds to an electron mobility of 0.022 cm2V-1s-1. The model further predicts a linear dependence of the photocurrent versus anodic voltage, an observation whose origin has been strongly debated in the literature in the case of hematite photoanodes. The generality of the model allows its extension to other photoanodes and photovoltaic systems, by the addition or removal of specific physical mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Magneto-Raman effect in van der Waals layered two-dimensional CrSBr antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magneto-Raman spectroscopy is applied to study spin-phonon coupling in the layered two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals antiferromagnet CrSBr. We report on the effects of temperature and external magnetic field on Raman-active phonons of $A_g$ symmetry in bulk and one-to-six-layer forms of CrSBr that are reflected by the Raman spectral patterns measured at different configurations of circularly polarized laser beam. The results of experimental investigations reveal that spin-spin and spin-phonon interactions play a significant role below the N\'{e}el temperature and are notably stronger in CrSBr monolayer than in bulk material. Spin-phonon coupling leads to the emergence of \textit{ new} phonon peaks at very low temperatures. Such effect is solely observed in one-to-six-layer CrSBr and is absent in its bulk form. Our experimental research is accompanied by \textit{ab initio} simulations of the Raman spectra of bulk and monolayer CrSBr that uncover correlations between intensities of Raman-active phonons and the arrangement of spin magnetic moments on Cr atoms. Comparative analysis of simulated and experimental Raman spectra suggests the most favored spin orientation in the CrSBr antiferromagnetic system.</description>

      <title>Halide Perovskites as Spin-1 Dirac Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Halide perovskites are a promising class of materials for optoelectronic and photovoltaic applications, exhibiting high power conversion efficiency due to strong light absorption and long carrier diffusion lengths. While various aspects of their crystal and electronic structure have been studied, we identify a fundamental property previously overlooked that may significantly impact their efficiency. We demonstrate that halide perovskites realize a three-dimensional (3D) Lieb lattice, giving rise to a gapped 3D Dirac cone of spin-1 fermions. This leads to a fivefold reduction in effective mass compared to a conventional cubic structure and suppressed carrier backscattering due to Klein tunneling. Our conclusions are supported by band structure calculations and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy from CsPbBr$_3$ and CsSnBr$_3$. In particular, we reveal the transformation of the flat band of the Lieb lattice and the emergence of a dark corridor effect in photoemission from the Dirac cone, which increases as the band gap is decreased from CsPbBr$_3$ to CsSnBr$_3$.</description>

      <title>Revealing the proton slingshot mechanism in solid acid electrolytes through machine learning molecular dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In solid acid solid electrolytes CsH$_2$PO$_4$ and CsHSO$_4$, mechanisms of fast proton conduction have long been debated and attributed to either local proton hopping or polyanion rotation. However, the precise role of polyanion rotation and its interplay with proton hopping remained unclear. Nanosecond-scale molecular dynamics simulations, driven by equivariant neural network force fields, reveal a nuanced proton slingshot mechanism: protons are initially carried by rotating polyanions, followed by O$-$H bond reorientation, and the combined motion enables long-range jumps. This challenges the conventional revolving paddlewheel model and reveals significant independent proton motion that is assisted by limited rotations. Despite structural similarities, we identify qualitative differences in transport mechanisms between CsH$_2$PO$_4$ and CsHSO$_4$, caused by different proton concentrations. CsH$_2$PO$_4$ exhibits two distinct rates of rotational motions with different activation energies, contrasting with CsHSO$_4$'s single-rate behavior. The higher proton concentration in CsH$_2$PO$_4$ correlates with frustrated PO$_4$ polyanion orientations and slower rotations compared to SO$_4$ in CsHSO$_4$. Additionally, we reveal a correlation between O-sharing and proton transport in CsH$_2$PO$_4$, a unique feature due to extra proton per polyanion compared to CsHSO$_4$. Our findings suggest that reducing proton concentration could accelerate rotations and enhance conductivity. This work provides a unified framework for understanding and optimizing ionic mobility in solid-acid compounds, offering new insights into the interplay between proton hopping and disordered dynamics in polyanion rotation.</description>

      <title>Modeling crystal defects using defect-informed neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning has revolutionized the study of crystalline materials for enabling rapid predictions and discovery. However, most AI-for-Materials research to date has focused on ideal crystals, whereas real-world materials inevitably contain defects that play a critical role in modern functional technologies. The defects and dopants break geometric symmetry and increase interaction complexity, posing particular challenges for traditional ML models. Addressing these challenges requires models that are able to capture sparse defect-driven effects in crystals while maintaining adaptability and precision. Here, we introduce Defect-Informed Equivariant Graph Neural Network (DefiNet), a model specifically designed to accurately capture defect-related interactions and geometric configurations in point-defect structures. Trained on 14,866 defect structures, DefiNet achieves highly accurate structural predictions in a single step, avoiding the time-consuming iterative processes in modern ML relaxation models and possible error accumulation from iteration. We further validates DefiNet's accuracy by using density functional theory (DFT) relaxation on DefiNet-predicted structures. For most defect structures, regardless of defect complexity or system size, only 3 ionic steps are required to reach the DFT-level ground state. Finally, comparisons with scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) images confirm DefiNet's scalability and extrapolation beyond point defects, positioning it as a groundbreaking tool for defect-focused materials research.</description>

      <title>Accurate, transferable, and verifiable machine-learned interatomic potentials for layered materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twisted layered van-der-Waals materials often exhibit unique electronic and optical properties absent in their non-twisted counterparts. Unfortunately, predicting such properties is hindered by the difficulty in determining the atomic structure in materials displaying large moir\'e domains. Here, we introduce a split machine-learned interatomic potential and dataset curation approach that separates intralayer and interlayer interactions and significantly improves model accuracy -- with a tenfold increase in energy and force prediction accuracy relative to conventional models. We further demonstrate that traditional MLIP validation metrics -- force and energy errors -- are inadequate for moir\'e structures and develop a more holistic, physically-motivated metric based on the distribution of stacking configurations. This metric effectively compares the entirety of large-scale moir\'e domains between two structures instead of relying on conventional measures evaluated on smaller commensurate cells. Finally, we establish that one-dimensional instead of two-dimensional moir\'e structures can serve as efficient surrogate systems for validating MLIPs, allowing for a practical model validation protocol against explicit DFT calculations. Applying our framework to HfS2/GaS bilayers reveals that accurate structural predictions directly translate into reliable electronic properties. Our model-agnostic approach integrates seamlessly with various intralayer and interlayer interaction models, enabling computationally tractable relaxation of moir\'e materials, from bilayer to complex multilayers, with rigorously validated accuracy.</description>

      <title>Unified Micromechanics Theory of Composites</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the matrix composite materials (CM) of either random (statistically homogeneous or inhomogeneous), periodic, or deterministic (neither random nor periodic) structures. CMs exhibit linear or nonlinear behavior, coupled or uncoupled multi-physical phenomena, locally elastic, weakly nonlocal (strain gradient and stress gradient), or strongly nonlocal (strain-type and displacement-type, peridynamics) phase properties. A modified Computational Analytical Micromechanics (CAM) approach introduces an exact Additive General Integral Equation (AGIE) for CMs of any structure and phase properties mentioned above. The unified iteration solution of static AGIEs is adapted to the body force with compact support serving as a fundamentally new universal training parameter. The approach also establishes a critical threshold for filtering out unsuitable sub-datasets of effective parameters through a novel Representative Volume Element (RVE) concept, which extends Hill's classical framework. This RVE concept eliminates sample size, boundary layer, and edge effects, making it applicable to CMs of any structure and phase properties, regardless of local or nonlocal, linear or nonlinear. Incorporating this new RVE concept into machine learning and neural network techniques enables the construction of any unpredefined surrogate nonlocal operators. The methodology is structured as a modular, block-based framework, allowing independent development and refinement of software components. This flexible, robust AGIE-CAM framework integrates data-driven, multi-scale, and multi-physics modeling, accelerating research in CM of any microtopology and phase properties considered. The AGIE-CAM framework represents a groundbreaking paradigm shift in the micromechanics of composites, redefining the very philosophy that underpins our understanding of their behavior at the microscopic level.</description>

      <title>AI-driven Uncertainty Quantification &amp; Multi-Physics Approach to Evaluate Cladding Materials in a Microreactor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The pursuit of enhanced nuclear safety has spurred the development of accident-tolerant cladding (ATC) materials for light water reactors (LWRs). This study investigates the potential of repurposing these ATCs in advanced reactor designs, aiming to expedite material development and reduce costs. The research employs a multi-physics approach, encompassing neutronics, heat transfer, thermodynamics, and structural mechanics, to evaluate four candidate materials (Haynes 230, Zircaloy-4, FeCrAl, and SiC-SiC) within the context of a high-temperature, sodium-cooled microreactor, exemplified by the Kilopower design. While neutronic simulations revealed negligible power profile variations among the materials, finite element analyses highlighted the superior thermal stability of SiC-SiC and the favorable stress resistance of Haynes 230. The high-temperature environment significantly impacted material performance, particularly for Zircaloy-4 and FeCrAl, while SiC-SiC's inherent properties limited its ability to withstand stress loads. Additionally, AI-driven uncertainty quantification and sensitivity analysis were conducted to assess the influence of material property variations on maximum hoop stress. The findings underscore the need for further research into high-temperature material properties to facilitate broader applicability of existing materials to advanced reactors. Haynes 230 is identified as the most promising candidate based on the evaluated criteria.</description>

      <title>Cyclic Voltammetry of Ion-Coupled Electron Transfer Reactions for Diagnosing Energy Storage Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The methods of Nicholson and Shain and Randles-Sevcik are the paradigms of voltammetry of redox species. However, as they were originally developed for aqueous redox couples, they cannot be directly applied to solid redox films such as those of battery materials. Herein, for the first time, we present a cyclic voltammetry model based on semi-infinite linear diffusion for ion-coupled electron transfer reactions. The simulated CVs contain parameters such as capacity, ion activity, formal potential of proton-coupled electron transfer, and scan rate that are physically more meaningful than those of the current models in characterizing energy storage materials. We apply this model to the MnO2 cathode material as a proof of concept and discuss the significance of the simulation parameters for determining the energetics of the underlying phase transitions and the charge storage mechanisms. According to the present model, two linear regression lines can be established from relatively simple voltammetry experiments for characterizing energy storage materials: 1) The regression line of the CV mid-peak potential vs. Log of ion activity (or pH), in which the slope and the intercept provide information on the type of charge-carrier ions and their solvation state, respectively. 2) The regression line of the capacity vs. the inverse of the square root of scan rate, where the slope and intercept indicate the contributions of bulk and surface charges in thin redox films, respectively.</description>

      <title>Perfectly harmonic spin cycloid and multi-$Q$ textures in the Weyl semimetal GdAlSi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A fundamental question concerns how topological electronic states are influenced by many-body correlations, and magnetic Weyl semimetals represent an important material platform to address this problem. However, the magnetic structures realized in these materials are limited, and in particular, no clear example of an undistorted helimagnetic state has been definitively identified. Here, we report clear evidence of a harmonic helimagnetic cycloid with an incommensurate magnetic propagation vector in the Weyl semimetal GdAlSi via resonant elastic X-ray scattering, including rigorous polarization analysis. This cycloidal structure is consistent with the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction prescribed by the polar crystal structure of GdAlSi. Upon applying a magnetic field, the cycloid undergoes a transition to a novel multi-$Q$ state. This field-induced, noncoplanar texture is consistent with our numerical spin model, which incorporates the DM interaction and, crucially, anisotropic exchange. The perfectly harmonic Weyl helimagnet GdAlSi serves as a prototypical platform to study electronic correlation effects in periodically modulated Weyl semimetals.</description>

      <title>2D transmons with lifetimes and coherence times exceeding 1 millisecond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Materials improvements are a powerful approach to reducing loss and decoherence in superconducting qubits because such improvements can be readily translated to large scale processors. Recent work improved transmon coherence by utilizing tantalum (Ta) as a base layer and sapphire as a substrate. The losses in these devices are dominated by two-level systems (TLSs) with comparable contributions from both the surface and bulk dielectrics, indicating that both must be tackled to achieve major improvements in the state of the art. Here we show that replacing the substrate with high-resistivity silicon (Si) dramatically decreases the bulk substrate loss, enabling 2D transmons with time-averaged quality factors (Q) exceeding 1.5 x 10^7, reaching a maximum Q of 2.5 x 10^7, corresponding to a lifetime (T_1) of up to 1.68 ms. This low loss allows us to observe decoherence effects related to the Josephson junction, and we use improved, low-contamination junction deposition to achieve Hahn echo coherence times (T_2E) exceeding T_1. We achieve these material improvements without any modifications to the qubit architecture, allowing us to readily incorporate standard quantum control gates. We demonstrate single qubit gates with 99.994% fidelity. The Ta-on-Si platform comprises a simple material stack that can potentially be fabricated at wafer scale, and therefore can be readily translated to large-scale quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Observation of thermally activated coherent magnon-magnon coupling in a magnonic hybrid system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate strong magnon-magnon coupling by thermal spin excitations in yttrium iron garnet/permalloy (YIG/Py) hybrid structures using microfocused Brillouin light scattering - an optical technique that enables the detection of zero-wavevector and higher-order wavevector spin waves in a broad frequency range. The thermally activated magnons in the bilayer lead to a hybrid excitation between magnon modes in the conductive Py layer with a wide wavevector range and the first perpendicular standing magnon modes in the insulating YIG layer, facilitated by strong interfacial exchange coupling. To further investigate this coupling, we compare the thermal magnon spectra with the results obtained from electrical excitation and detection methods, which primarily detect the uniform Py mode. The realization of coherent coupling between incoherent (thermal) magnons is important for advancing energy-efficient magnonic devices, particularly in classical as well as quantum spin-wave computing technologies.</description>

      <title>Evolving transport properties of dynamic hydrogels enable self-tuning of short- and long-term cargo delivery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hydrogels are crosslinked polymer networks with high water content widely utilized in biomedical applications. Injectable depot-forming hydrogels for drug delivery offer sustained release of biomolecular cargo, leveraging controlled macromolecular diffusion within dynamic networks to promote extended immunity and favorable immunological responses. However, mitigating burst release while maintaining sustained-release properties remains a challenge due to network disruption during needle extrusion, leading to excessive short-term cargo release and local toxicity. While controlling both short- and long-term release profiles would mitigate this issue, it remains a persistent challenge. Here, we present a hydrogel formulation strategy for self-regulating, post-injection network evolution enabled by exchange of functional molecules with physiological environment, achieving controlled cargo release over both short and long durations. By tuning network viscoelasticity, we optimized rheological properties to minimize burst release while preserving sustained-release profiles. Using model protein cargo, in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated reduced burst release and comparable sustained-release to unmodified control formulations. These findings highlight a novel strategy for precise cargo delivery in biomedical applications.</description>

      <title>The crucial role of substrate in FeSe/STO: new insights to interface-driven superconductivity from first-principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the superconducting properties of monolayer FeSe, both freestanding (ML FeSe) and on SrTiO$_3$ (STO), by simultaneously solving the Kohn-Sham Density Functional Theory and Bogoliubov--de Gennes equations. Our results demonstrate that the substrate profoundly alters both the normal-state and superconducting properties of FeSe. We identify proximity-induced superconductivity in the interfacial TiO$_2$ layer of STO, due to hybridization between Fe $d$ and O $p$ orbitals. This hybridization results in a fivefold increase in the superconducting gap width and confines superconducting states to the $M$ point in the Brillouin Zone. This is in contrast to ML FeSe, where superconductivity emerges at both the $\Gamma$ and $M$ points. Furthermore, the substrate modifies the orbital character of the states responsible for superconductivity, which change from Fe $d_{z^2}$ in ML FeSe to Fe $d_{xz}/d_{yz}$ in FeSe/STO. In both systems, we demonstrate an anisotropic superconducting gap with multiple coherence peaks, originating at different k-points in the Brillouin Zone. Additionally, in FeSe/STO, we identify emerging states unique to the superconducting phase arising from electron-hole hybridization at $M$, in agreement with experiments. Our findings highlight the decisive impact of substrate (hybridization, strain, charge transfer, magnetic order) on the superconducting properties of FeSe. We suggest potential pathways for engineering novel high-temperature FeSe-based superconductors by leveraging interfacial interactions in substrates with high electron affinity.</description>

      <title>Transition from $s_{\pm}$-wave to $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$-wave superconductivity driven by interlayer interaction in the bilayer two-orbital model of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We utilize the fluctuation-exchange approximation on a bilayer two-orbital model, incorporating $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and $d_{z^2}$ orbitals, to explore potential pairing symmetries in the bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. Our study particularly examines the impact of interlayer Coulomb interactions. In the absence of these interactions, the superconducting gap exhibits $s_{\pm}$-wave symmetry, with predominant intraorbital pairing in the $d_{z^2}$ orbital. As interlayer interactions increase, $s_{\pm}$-wave superconductivity is suppressed, while the superconductivity with a $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave gap is enhanced, resulting in a transition at a critical interaction strength. This $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave superconductivity is distinct not only from the $s_{\pm}$-wave superconductivity but also from the intraorbital $d$-wave pairing in cuprate superconductors, as it is dominated by the interlayer pairing between the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and $d_{z^2}$ orbitals. Additionally, charge fluctuations play a crucial role in driving the transition from $s_{\pm}$ wave to $d_{x^2-y^2}$ wave superconductivity. Our findings indicate that interlayer Coulomb interactions are crucial for understanding the pairing mechanism in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reflection High-Energy Electron Diffraction (RHEED) is a powerful tool to probe the surface reconstruction during MBE growth. However, raw RHEED patterns are difficult to interpret, especially when the wafer is rotating. A more accessible representation of the information is therefore the so-called Azimuthal RHEED (ARHEED), an angularly resolved plot of the electron diffraction pattern during a full wafer rotation. However, ARHEED requires precise information about the rotation angle as well as of the position of the specular spot of the electron beam. We present a Deep Learning technique to automatically construct the Azimuthal RHEED from bare RHEED images, requiring no further measurement equipment. We use two artificial neural networks: an image segmentation model to track the center of the specular spot and a regression model to determine the orientation of the crystal with respect to the incident electron beam of the RHEED system. Our technique enables accurate and real-time ARHEED construction on any growth chamber equipped with a RHEED system.</description>

Abstract: Time-resolved pump-probe soft X-ray ptychography and Scanning Transmission X-ray Microscopy (STXM) were employed to study the magnetic domain wall dynamics in microstructures of permalloy (Ni$_{81}$Fe$_{19}$; Py) with a weak growth-induced perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. The X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) images of a micrometer-sized Py square (160 nm thickness) and an elliptical disk (80 nm thickness) show flux-closure patterns with domain walls that fall into alternating out-of-plane (OOP) magnetization states precipitated by the perpendicular anisotropy, which is a precursor of the nucleation of stripe domains at higher thicknesses. An oscillating magnetic field at frequencies from tens of MHz to GHz and up to 4 mT magnitude excited dynamic modes in the domain walls along with the vortex core gyration. The domain wall dynamics include the translation of inversion points of the OOP magnetization and nucleation of one-dimensional spin waves.</description>

      <title>Quantum Monte Carlo and density functional theory study of strain and magnetism in 2D 1T-VSe$_2$ with charge density wave states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19082v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) 1T-VSe$_2$ has prompted significant interest due to the discrepancies regarding alleged ferromagnetism (FM) at room temperature, charge density wave (CDW) states and the interplay between the two. We employed a combined Diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) and density functional theory (DFT) approach to accurately investigate the magnetic properties, CDW states, and their response to strain in monolayer 1T-VSe$_2$. Our calculations show the delicate competition between various phases, revealing critical insights into the relationship between their energetic and structural properties. We performed classical Monte Carlo simulations informed by our DMC and DFT results, and found the magnetic transition temperature ($T_c$) of the undistorted (non-CDW) FM phase to be 228 K and the distorted (CDW) phase to be 68 K. Additionally, we studied the response of biaxial strain on the energetic stability and magnetic properties of various phases of 2D 1T-VSe$_2$ and found that small amounts of strain can increase the $T_c$, suggesting a promising route for engineering and enhancing magnetic behavior. Finally, we synthesized 1T-VSe$_2$ and performed Raman spectroscopy measurements, which were in close agreement with our calculated results, validating our computational approach. Our work emphasizes the role of highly accurate DMC methods in advancing the understanding of monolayer 1T-VSe$_2$ and provides a robust framework for future studies of 2D magnetic materials.</description>

Abstract: Exchange coupling parameters $J_{ij}$ within the Heisenberg model and its extensions are crucial for understanding magnetic behavior at the atomic level. To calculate $J_{ij}$ from first principles, perturbative methods based on the magnetic force theorem (MFT), commonly referred to as Liechtenstein's method, have been widely employed. However, the quantitative accuracy of $J_{ij}$ obtained through this perturbative technique remains uncertain. In this paper, we nonperturbatively calculate $J_{ij}$ for several systems of both fundamental and applied significance, including perovskite SrMnO$_3$, neodymium-magnet compounds, and elemental 3$d$ transition metals, and compare these results with those obtained using the conventional MFT-based method. The nonperturbative approach provides consistent results for magnetic configurations exhibiting a certain degree of magnetic disorder. In contrast, due to its inherent theoretical limitations, the MFT-based method struggles to accurately evaluate the magnetic energy in such configurations. As discussed later in this paper, these discrepancies arise from neglected contributions within MFT-based methods. Our nonperturbative scheme is highly versatile and holds strong prospects as a new platform for analyzing and designing spintronic materials, where developing accurate spin models is essential.</description>

      <title>Lattice thermal conductivity in the anharmonic overdamped regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13485v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In crystalline materials, low lattice thermal conductivity is often associated with strong anharmonicity, which can cause significant deviations from the expected Lorentzian lineshape of phonon spectral functions. These deviations, occurring in an overdamped regime, raise questions about the applicability of the Boltzmann transport equation. Furthermore, strong anharmonicity can trigger structural phase transitions with temperature, which cannot be adequately described by the standard harmonic approximation. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach for computing the lattice thermal conductivity. Our method combines the Green-Kubo linear response theory with the stochastic self-consistent harmonic approximation. The latter allows us to describe the temperature-dependent evolution of the crystal structure, including first- and second-order phase transitions, as well as the vibrational properties in highly anharmonic materials. The Green-Kubo method considers the entire lineshapes of phonon spectral functions in the calculation of the lattice thermal conductivity, thus eliminating the questionable use of phonon lifetimes in the overdamped regime, as well as naturally including coherent transport effects. Additionally, we extend our theory to model complex dynamical lattice thermal conductivity, enhancing our understanding of time-dependent thermoreflectance experiments. As a practical application, we employ this approach to calculate the lattice thermal conductivity of CsPbBr$_3$, a complex crystal known for its anomalous thermal transport behavior with a complex phase diagram. Our method is able to determine the thermal conductivity across different phases in good agreement with experiments.</description>

      <title>Weak Ferromagnetism in Altermagnets from Alternating $g$-Tensor Anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17386v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Altermagnets are magnetic materials with antiferromagnetic spin ordering but exhibit ferromagnetic properties. Understanding the microscopic origin of the latter is a central problem. Ferromagnet-like properties such as the anomalous Hall effect are linked with weak ferromagnetism, whose microscopic origin in altermagnets remains unclear however. We show theoretically that the alternating $g$-tensor anisotropy in altermagnets can induce weak ferromagnetism even when the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction is forbidden. We demonstrate this mechanism to explain weak ferromagnetism for both collinear and noncollinear spin altermagnets. Our findings provide new insights into the origin of weak ferromagnetism and suggest orbital-based ways for manipulating magnetic configurations in altermagnets.</description>

Abstract: Ferroelectric (Fe) materials-based devices show great promise for non-volatile memory applications, yet few demonstrate reliable operation at elevated temperatures. In this work, we demonstrate Ni/Al0.68Sc0.32N/4H-SiC metal-ferroelectric-semiconductor capacitors for high-temperature non-volatile memory applications. Our 30-nm thick ferroelectric Al0.68Sc0.32N film grown on SiC exhibits stable and robust ferroelectric switching up to 1000{\deg}C. The coercive field decreases linearly from -6.4/+11.9 MV cm-1 at room temperature to -3.1/+7.8 MV cm-1 at 800{\deg}C, further reducing to -2.5 MV cm-1 at 1000{\deg}C. At 600{\deg}C, the devices achieve remarkable reliability with ~2000 endurance cycles and over at least 100 hours of retention with negligible polarization loss. At 800{\deg}C, the devices retain data for at least 10,000 seconds and exceed 400 write cycles. Our results further highlight the potential for ferroelectric AlScN thin-films particularly when paired with SiC semiconductor substrates for high-temperature non-volatile memory.</description>

      <title>A Generator of Neural Network Potential for Molecular Dynamics: Constructing Robust and Accurate Potentials with Active Learning for Nanosecond-scale Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17191v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural network potentials (NNPs) enable large-scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of systems containing &gt;10,000 atoms with the accuracy comparable to ab initio methods and play a crucial role in material studies. Although NNPs are valuable for short-duration MD simulations, maintaining the stability of long-duration MD simulations remains challenging due to the uncharted regions of the potential energy surface (PES). Currently, there is no effective methodology to address this issue. To overcome this challenge, we developed an automatic generator of robust and accurate NNPs based on an active learning (AL) framework. This generator provides a fully integrated solution encompassing initial dataset creation, NNP training, evaluation, sampling of additional structures, screening, and labeling. Crucially, our approach uses a sampling strategy that focuses on generating unstable structures with short interatomic distances, combined with a screening strategy that efficiently samples these configurations based on interatomic distances and structural features. This approach greatly enhances the MD simulation stability, enabling nanosecond-scale simulations. We evaluated the performance of our NNP generator in terms of its MD simulation stability and physical properties by applying it to liquid propylene glycol (PG) and polyethylene glycol (PEG). The generated NNPs enable stable MD simulations of systems with &gt;10,000 atoms for 20 ns. The predicted physical properties, such as the density and self-diffusion coefficient, show excellent agreement with the experimental values. This work represents a remarkable advance in the generation of robust and accurate NNPs for organic materials, paving the way for long-duration MD simulations of complex systems.</description>

      <title>CHIPS-FF: Evaluating Universal Machine Learning Force Fields for Material Properties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10516v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce CHIPS-FF (Computational High-Performance Infrastructure for Predictive Simulation-based Force Fields), a universal, open-source benchmarking platform for machine learning force fields (MLFFs). This platform provides robust evaluation beyond conventional metrics such as energy, focusing on complex properties including elastic constants, phonon spectra, defect formation energies, surface energies, and interfacial and amorphous phase properties. Utilizing 16 graph-based MLFF models including ALIGNN-FF, CHGNet, MatGL, MACE, SevenNet, ORB, MatterSim and OMat24, the CHIPS-FF workflow integrates the Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE) with JARVIS-Tools to facilitate automated high-throughput simulations. Our framework is tested on a set of 104 materials, including metals, semiconductors and insulators representative of those used in semiconductor components, with each MLFF evaluated for convergence, accuracy, and computational cost. Additionally, we evaluate the force-prediction accuracy of these models for close to 2 million atomic structures. By offering a streamlined, flexible benchmarking infrastructure, CHIPS-FF aims to guide the development and deployment of MLFFs for real-world semiconductor applications, bridging the gap between quantum mechanical simulations and large-scale device modeling.</description>

      <title>An empirical formulation of accelerated molecular dynamics for simulating and predicting microstructure evolution in materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14294v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite its widespread use in materials science, conventional molecular dynamics simulations are severely constrained by timescale limitations. To address this shortcoming, we propose an empirical formulation of accelerated molecular dynamics method, adapted from a collective-variable-based extended system dynamics framework. While this framework is originally developed for efficient free energy sampling and reaction pathway determination of specific rare events in condensed matter, we have modified it to enable accelerated molecular dynamics simulation and prediction of microstructure evolution of materials across a broad range of scenarios. In essence, the nearest neighbor off-centering absolute displacement (NNOAD), which quantifies the deviation of an atom from the geometric center of its nearest neighbors in materials, is introduced. We propose that the collection of NNOADs of all atoms can serve as a generalized reaction coordinate for various structural transitions in materials. The NNOAD of each atom, represented by its three components, is coupled with three additional dynamic variables assigned to the atom. Time evolution of the additional dynamic variables follows Langevin equation, while Nos\'e-Hoover dynamics is employed to thermostat the system. Through careful analysis and benchmark simulations, we established appropriate parameter ranges for the equations in our method. Application of this method to several test cases demonstrates its effectiveness and consistency in accelerating molecular dynamics simulations and predicting various microstructure evolutions of materials over much longer timescale. We also provide a preliminary theoretical analysis and qualitative justification of the method, offering insights into its underlying principles.</description>

      <title>High-purity and stable single-photon emission in bilayer WSe$_2$ via phonon-assisted excitation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07097v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The excitation scheme is essential for single-photon sources, as it governs exciton preparation, decay dynamics, and the spectral diffusion of emitted photons. While phonon-assisted excitation has shown promise in other quantum emitter platforms, its proper implementation and systematic comparison with alternative excitation schemes have not yet been demonstrated in transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) quantum emitters. Here, we investigate the impact of various optical excitation strategies on the single-photon emission properties of bilayer WSe$_2$ quantum emitters. Based on our theoretical predictions for the exciton preparation fidelity, we compare excitation via the longitudinal acoustic and breathing phonon modes to conventional above-band and near-resonance excitations. Under acoustic phonon-assisted excitation, we achieve narrow single-photon emission with a reduced spectral diffusion of 0.0129 nm, a 1.8-fold improvement over above-band excitation. Additionally, excitation through breathing-phonon mode yields a high purity of $ 0.947\pm 0.079\,$ and reduces the decay time by over an order of magnitude, reaching $(1.33 \pm 0.04)\,$ns. Our comprehensive study demonstrates the crucial role of phonon-assisted excitation in optimizing the performance of WSe$_2$-based quantum emitters, providing valuable insights for the development of single-photon sources for quantum photonics applications.</description>

      <title>MOFFlow: Flow Matching for Structure Prediction of Metal-Organic Frameworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17270v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are a class of crystalline materials with promising applications in many areas such as carbon capture and drug delivery. In this work, we introduce MOFFlow, the first deep generative model tailored for MOF structure prediction. Existing approaches, including ab initio calculations and even deep generative models, struggle with the complexity of MOF structures due to the large number of atoms in the unit cells. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Riemannian flow matching framework that reduces the dimensionality of the problem by treating the metal nodes and organic linkers as rigid bodies, capitalizing on the inherent modularity of MOFs. By operating in the $SE(3)$ space, MOFFlow effectively captures the roto-translational dynamics of these rigid components in a scalable way. Our experiment demonstrates that MOFFlow accurately predicts MOF structures containing several hundred atoms, significantly outperforming conventional methods and state-of-the-art machine learning baselines while being much faster.</description>

      <title>Tensor Completion for Surrogate Modeling of Material Property Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18137v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When designing materials to optimize certain properties, there are often many possible configurations of designs that need to be explored. For example, the materials' composition of elements will affect properties such as strength or conductivity, which are necessary to know when developing new materials. Exploring all combinations of elements to find optimal materials becomes very time consuming, especially when there are more design variables. For this reason, there is growing interest in using machine learning (ML) to predict a material's properties. In this work, we model the optimization of certain material properties as a tensor completion problem, to leverage the structure of our datasets and navigate the vast number of combinations of material configurations. Across a variety of material property prediction tasks, our experiments show tensor completion methods achieving 10-20% decreased error compared with baseline ML models such as GradientBoosting and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), while maintaining similar training speed.</description>

      <title>Quantized Magneto-Terahertz Effects in the Antiferromagnetic Topological Insulator MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ Thin Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13651v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ (MBT) is an ideal platform for studying the interplay between magnetism and topology. Many exotic topological phenomena, such as the quantum anomalous Hall effect and the axion insulator, have been observed in few-layer MBT. A key feature in MBT is the emergence of the surface exchange gap, which lies in the milli-electron-volt range (1 THz corresponds to 4.14 meV). This makes THz spectroscopy a powerful tool to probe the associated topological physics. In this study, we report the THz spectra of Faraday and Kerr rotations in MBT thin films grown by molecular beam epitaxy. By varying the external magnetic field, we observe three magnetic states: the antiferromagnetic state, the canted antiferromagnetic state, and the ferromagnetic state. Our terahertz results show a quantized Hall state under 6 T in both 6 SL and 7 SL samples without gate voltage. These findings provide new insights into the magneto-terahertz properties of MBT and its potential for topological spintronic applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14124v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate quantum transport in a two-dimensional electron system coupled to a chiral molecular potential, demonstrating how molecular chirality and orientation affect charge and spin transport properties. We propose a minimal model for realizing true chiral symmetry breaking on a magnetized surface, with a crucial role played by the tilt angle of the molecular dipole with respect to the surface. For non-zero tilting, we show that the Hall response exhibits clear signatures of chirality-induced effects, both in charge and spin-resolved observables. Concerning the former, tilted enantiomers produce asymmetric Hall conductances and, even more remarkably, the persistence of this feature in the absence of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) signals how the enantiospecific charge response results from electron scattering off the molecular potential. Concerning spin-resolved observables where SOC plays a relevant role, we reveal that chiral symmetry breaking is crucial in enabling spin-flipping processes.</description>
