      <title>Gamma-ray burst prompt emission spectra at high energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite more than fifty years of gamma-ray burst (GRB) observations, several questions regarding the origin of the prompt emission, particularly at high energies, remain unresolved. We present a comprehensive analysis of 35 GRBs observed by \textit{Fermi}/GBM and \textit{Fermi}/LAT over the past 15 years, focusing on the nature of high-energy (HE, E$&gt;$100 MeV) emission during the prompt emission phase. Our study combines temporal and spectral analyses to investigate the synchrotron origin of the observed emission spanning the energy range from 10 keV to 100 GeV and explore the possible contribution of additional spectral components. Temporal modeling of \textit{Fermi}/LAT light curves for 12 GRBs in our sample reveals deviations from standard afterglow scenarios during the early phases, suggesting a significant contamination from prompt emission. We find that most GRB spectra align with synchrotron emission extending to GeV energies, with the slope $p$ of the non-thermal electron distribution clustering around $p\sim2.7$, consistently with theoretical predictions. For three GRBs, an additional power law component is required to explain the high-energy emission, but the nature and temporal evolution of this component remain unclear due to the limited quality of \textit{Fermi}/LAT data. When the power law component is needed, the synchrotron spectrum shows a sharp MeV suppression. It could be explained by the pair loading effects in the early afterglow. These findings emphasize the importance of multi-wavelength observations in unveiling the mechanisms driving early HE prompt emission in GRBs. We briefly discuss the implications of our findings for future very-high-energy (VHE, E$&gt;$100 GeV) gamma-ray observatories, such as the Cherenkov Telescope Array, and address the detection prospects of additional non-thermal components in GRB spectra.</description>

      <title>Stellar Stripping and Disruption in Disks around Supermassive Black Hole Binaries: Repeating nuclear transients prior to LISA events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) are driven together by gas disks in galactic nuclei, then a surrounding nuclear star cluster or in-situ star-formation should deliver stars to the disk plane. Migration through the circumbinary disk will quickly bring stars to the edge of a low-density cavity cleared by the binary, where the stellar orbit becomes trapped and locked with the binary decay. Here we explore the scenario where the trapped stellar orbit decays with the binary until the binary tidally strips the star in a runaway process. For Sun-like stars, this occurs preferentially for $10^4-10^6 M_{\odot}$ SMBHBs, as the SMBHB enters the LISA band. We estimate that the runaway stripping process will generate Eddington-level X-ray flares repeating on hours-to-days timescales and lasting for decades. The flaring timescales and energetics of these circumbinary disk tidal disruption events (CBD-TDEs) match well with the recently discovered Quasi-Periodic Eruptions. However, the inferred rates of the two phenomena are in tension, unless low-mass SMBHB mergers are more common than expected. For less-dense stars, stripping begins earlier in the SMBHB inspiral, has longer repetition times, lasts longer, is dimmer, and can occur for more massive SMBHBs. Wether CBD-TDEs are a known or a yet-undiscovered class of repeating nuclear transients, they could provide a new probe of the elusive SMBH mergers in low mass / dwarf galaxies, which lie in the sweet-spot of the LISA sensitivity.</description>

      <title>A highly magnetized long-period radio transient exhibiting unusual emission features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-period radio transients are a new class of astrophysical objects that exhibit periodic radio emission on timescales of tens of minutes. Their true nature remains unknown; possibilities include magnetic white dwarfs, binary systems, or long-period magnetars; the latter class is predicted to produce fast radio bursts (FRBs). Using the MeerKAT radio telescope, we conducted follow-up observations of the long-period radio transient GPM J1839-10. Here we report that the source exhibits a wide range of unusual emission properties, including polarization characteristics indicative of magnetospheric origin, linear-to-circular polarization conversion, and drifting substructures closely resembling those observed in repeating FRBs. These radio characteristics provide evidence in support of the long-period magnetar model and suggest a possible connection between long-period radio transients, magnetars, and FRBs.</description>

      <title>The bolometric light curve modeling of 98 Type I superluminous supernovae using the magnetar- and the circumstellar interaction models reveals surprisingly high ejecta masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the bolometric light curve modeling of 98 hydrogen-poor superluminous supernovae (SLSNe-I) using three types of power inputs: the magnetar model and two kinds of circumstellar interaction models, applying the constant density and the steady wind scenario. The quasi-bolometric luminosities of the objects were calculated from the ZTF g- and r-band data using the methodology of \citet{chen23b}, and then they were modeled with the Minim code. It was found that the light curves of 45 SLSNe-I can be fitted equally well with both the magnetar and the CSM models, 14 objects prefer the magnetar model and 39 SLSNe-I favor the CSM model. The magnetar modeling yielded a mean spin period of $P~=~4.1 \pm 0.20$ ms and a magnetic field of $B~=~5.65 \pm 0.43 \cdot 10^{14}$ G, consistently with the literature. However, the ejected mass was estimated to be significantly larger compared to previous studies presenting either multi-color light curve modeling with MOSFiT or bolometric light curve modeling: we obtained a mean value and standard error of 34.26 and 4.67 $M_\odot$, respectively. The circumstellar interaction models resulted in even larger ejecta masses with a mean and standard error of 116.82 and 5.97 $M_\odot$ for the constant density model, and 105.99 and 4.50 $M_\odot$ for the steady wind model. Although the ejected mass depends strongly on the electron scattering opacity (assumed to be $\kappa~=~$0.2 in this work) and the ejecta velocity, which were estimated to be globally larger compared to earlier studies, our results suggest that SLSNe-I are indeed the explosions of the most massive stars.</description>

      <title>Simulation of Binary-Single Interactions in AGN Disk I: Gas-Enhanced Binary Orbital Hardening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar-mass binary black hole\,(BBH) mergers within the accretion disks of active galactic nuclei may contribute to gravitational wave\,(GW) events detected by grounded-based GW detectors. In particular, the interaction between a BBH and a single stellar-mass black hole\,(sBH), known as the binary-single interaction\,(BSI) process, can potentially lead to GW events with detectable non-zero eccentricity. Previous studies of the BSI process, which neglected the effects of gas, showed that BSIs contribute non-negligibly to GW events in a coplanar disk environment. In this work, we conduct a series of 2-dimensional hydrodynamical and N-body simulations to explore the BSI in a gas environment by coupling REBOUND with Athena++. We perform 360 simulation runs, spanning parameters in disk surface density \(\Sigma_0\) and impact parameter \(b\). We find that the gas-induced energy dissipation within the three-body system becomes significant if the encounter velocity between the sBHs is sufficiently large\,($\gg c_s$). Our simulation results indicate that approximately half of the end states of the BSI are changed by gas. Furthermore, at higher gas density, the number of encounters during the BSI process will increase and the end-state BBHs tend to be more compact. Consequently, the presence of gas may shorten the GW merger timescale for end-state BBHs and increase the three-body merger rate.</description>

      <title>Solar modulation of AMS-02 daily proton and Helium fluxes with modified force field approximation models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As galactic cosmic rays propagate through the turbulent plasma environment within the heliosphere, they undergo a process of diffusion, drift and energy loss, leading to a notable reduction in their flux. This is the solar modulation impact. Recently, the cosmic-ray experiment AMS-02 published daily fluxes of proton and Helium for the period from May 20, 2011 to October 29, 2019 in the rigidity interval from about 1 to 100 GV, exhibiting fine time structures that correlate with solar wind properties on daily basis. In this work, we employ three different modified force field approximation models to fit the data. By fitting to the daily proton and Helium fluxes, we get the time series of solar modulation potential. We find good agreement of data and model predictions for both proton and Helium with the same parameters in two modified force field approximation models. The results in this study verify that the modified FFA model is a valid parametrization of the GCR spectrum also at daily time scales.</description>

      <title>Probing muonic force with periastron advance in binary pulsar systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pulsars, highly magnetized, rotating neutron stars, can have significant muon abundances in their dense cores, making them promising environments to probe ultralight mediators coupled to muons. The precise measurement of periastron advance in binary pulsar systems provides a sensitive probe of such long-range forces. In this work, we study the periastron advance constraints from binary pulsar systems on the ultralight muonic mediators. We compute the muon number fraction in neutron stars, by properly taking into account the suppression effect of the long-range muonic force. We find that the periastron advance constraints impose the most stringent constraints on ultralight muonic mediators in the mass range of $\simeq(10^{-17},\,2\times10^{-15})$ eV, probing muonic couplings as small as $\mathcal{O}(10^{-21})$, which surpass the limits from LIGO/Virgo gravitational wave measurements, by about an order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>A new X-ray census of rotation powered pulsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To date, over 4,000 pulsars have been detected. In this study, we identify 231 X-ray counterparts of {\it ATNF} pulsars by performing a spatial cross-match across the {\it Chandra}, {\it XMM-Newton} observational catalogs. This dataset represents the largest sample of X-ray counterparts ever compiled, including 98 normal pulsars (NPs) and 133 millisecond pulsars (MSPs). Based on this significantly expanded sample, we re-establish the correlation between X-ray luminosity and spin-down power, given by $L_{\rm X} \propto \dot{E}^{0.85\pm0.05}$ across the whole X-ray band. The strong correlation is also observed in hard X-ray band, while in soft X-ray band there is no significant correlation. Furthermore, $L_{\rm X}$ shows a strong correlation with spin period and characteristic age for NPs. For the first time, we observe a strongly positive correlation between $L_{\rm X}$ and the light cylinder magnetic field ($B_{\rm lc}$) for MSPs, with both NPs and MSPs following the relationship $L_{\rm X} \propto B_{\rm lc}^{1.14}$, consistent with the outer-gap model of pulsars that explains the mechanism of X-ray emission. Additionally, we investigate potential X-ray counterparts for GPPS pulsars, finding a lower likelihood of detection compared to {\it ATNF} pulsars.</description>

      <title>X-ray timing and spectral characteristics of compact symmetric objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compact Symmetric Objects (CSOs) are a distinct category of jetted active galactic nuclei whose high-energy emission is not well understood. We examined the X-ray characteristics of 17 bona fide CSOs using observations from Chandra, XMM-Newton and NuSTAR. Among the sources with XMM-Newton observations, we found two sources, J0713+4349 and J1326+3154 to show clear evidence of variations in the soft (0.3$-$2 keV), the hard (2$-$10 keV) and the total energy (0.3$-$10 keV) bands with the normalised excess variance (F$_{var}$) as large as 1.17$\pm$0.27. Also, the F$_{var}$ is found to be larger in the hard band relative to the soft band for J1326+3154. From the analysis of the hardness ratio (HR) with count rate, we found both sources to show a harder when brighter (HWB) trend. Similarly, in the Chandra observations, we found one source, J0131+5545, to show flux variations in the total energy band (0.5$-$7 keV). We discuss possible reasons for about 82 per cent of the CSOs being non-variable. From spectral analysis, carried out in a homogeneous manner, we found the existence of obscured as well as unobscured CSOs. Three CSOs, J0111+3906, J1407+2827 and J2022+6136, were found to have the intrinsic neutral hydrogen column density N$_{\rm H,z} &gt; 10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$, consistent with earlier analyses. For the majority of the CSOs, the observed hard X-ray emission is expected to be dominated by their mildly relativistic jet emission. For the sources, J0713+4349, J1347+1217, J1407+2827, J1511+0518 and J2022+6136, the confirmed detection of Fe K$\alpha$ emission line suggests a significant contribution from the disk/corona. Our results point to diverse X-ray characteristics of CSOs.</description>

      <title>Impact of the returning radiation on X-ray reflection spectroscopy measurements: the case of Galactic black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effect of the returning radiation has long been ignored in the analysis of the reflection spectra of Galactic black holes and active galactic nuclei and only recently has been implemented in the relxill package. Here we present a study on the impact of the returning radiation on the estimate of the parameters of Galactic black holes. We consider high-quality NuSTAR spectra of three Galactic black holes (GX 339-4, Swift J1658.2-4242, and MAXI J1535-571) and we fit the data with the lamppost model in the latest version of relxill, first without including the returning radiation and then including the returning radiation. We do not find any significant difference in the estimate of the parameters of these systems between the two cases, even if all three sources are fast-rotating black holes and for two sources the estimate of the height of the corona is very low, two ingredients that should maximize the effect of the returning radiation. We discuss our results and the approximations in relxill.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Fundamental Planes of Black Hole Activity for Strong Jet Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Whether the X-ray emissions of strong jet sources originate from disk+coronas or jets is still controversial. In this work, we constructed a strong jet sample containing 50 flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs), 51 low-synchrotron-peaked BL BLacs (LBLs) and 18 intermediate-synchrotron-peaked BL BLacs (IBLs) to explore the origin of X-ray emissions. Generally, blazars are the typical radio-loud active galactic nucleus (RL-AGNs) with a powerful jet towards the observer, causing their broadband emissions to be boosted. By considering the Doppler boosting effect, we obtain the intrinsic radio--X-ray correlation and the Fundamental Plane of black hole activity (FP) for the strong jet sources: the intrinsic radio--X-ray correlation is $L_{\rm{R,int}}\propto L_{\rm{X,int}}^{1.04}$, which favor the jet-dominate mode, the intrinsic FP is $\log L_{\rm{R,int}}=(1.07\pm0.06)\log L_{\rm{X,int}}-(0.22\pm0.10)\log M_{\rm{BH}}-(3.77\pm2.11)$, which can be interpreted by the hybrid mode of Jet+SSD. Our results suggest that the X-ray emissions of strong jet sources are dominated by the jets, but there may also be a small contribution from the disk. In addition, the radio--X-ray correlation and FP of strong jet sources have not a significant dependence on the Eddington-ratio.</description>

      <title>Phenomenological gravitational waveforms for core-collapse supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galactic core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) are a target for current generation gravitational wave detectors with an expected rate of 1-3 per century. The development of data analysis methods used for their detection relies deeply on the availability of waveform templates. However, realistic numerical simulations producing such waveforms are computationally expensive (millions of CPU hours and $10^2-10^3$~GB of memory), and only a few tens of them are available nowadays in the literature. We have developed a novel parametrized phenomenological waveform generator for CCSNe, ccphen v4, that reproduces the morphology of numerical simulation waveforms with low computational cost ($\sim 10$~ms CPU time and a few MB of memory use). For the first time, the phenomenological waveforms include polarization and the effect of several oscillation modes in the proto-neutron star. This is sufficient to describe the case of non-rotating progenitor cores, representing the vast majority of possible events. The waveforms include a stochastic component and are calibrated using numerical simulation data. The code is publicly available. Their main application is the training of neural networks used in detection pipelines, but other applications in this context are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter Effects on the Curvature of Neutron Stars within the new Quarkyonic Model Coupled with Relativistic Mean Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the first time, we analyze the impact of dark matter (DM) on the curvature properties of quarkyonic neutron stars (NS) using a hybrid model based on quarkyonic-effective field theory within the relativistic mean-field (E-RMF) framework. This study examines the radial variation of curvature components, including the Ricci scalar ($\cal{R}$), Ricci tensor ($\cal{J}$), Kretschmann scalar ($\cal{K}$), and Weyl tensor ($\cal{W}$), under different DM admixtures. These components offer critical insights into the spacetime geometry and gravitational field strength within the star. The analysis spans canonical mass (1.4 $M_{\odot}$) and maximum mass configurations, varying key parameters such as the transition density ($n_t$) and QCD confinement scale ($\Lambda_{\rm cs}$), which influence matter transitions and quark confinement. Our results reveal that DM and quarkyonic matter (QM) significantly affect the star's curvature. Central curvature values, particularly $\cal{R}$, $\cal{J}$, and $\cal{K}$, increase with DM due to higher central densities but decrease with stronger QM effects. Stiffer EOSs yield smoother curvature profiles, while softer EOSs influenced by DM redistribute curvature more dynamically. DM softens the EOS, reducing central pressure and compactness, whereas higher $n_t$ values enhance compactness and central pressures. These findings show that dark matter plays a key role in shaping the curvature of quarkyonic neutron stars, offering new insights into compact objects with exotic matter.</description>

      <title>Long-term evolution of Sco X-1: implications for the current spin frequency and ellipticity of the neutron star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sco X-1 is the brightest observed extra-solar X-ray source, which is a neutron star (NS) low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB), and is thought to have a strong potential for continuous gravitational waves (CW) detection due to its high accretion rate and relative proximity. Here, we compute the long-term evolution of its parameters, particularly the NS spin frequency ($\nu$) and the surface magnetic field ($B$), to probe its nature and its potential for CW detection. We find that Sco X-1 is an unusually young ($\sim7\times10^6$ yr) LMXB and constrain the current NS mass to $\sim 1.4-1.6~{\rm M}_\odot$. Our computations reveal a rapid $B$ decay, with the maximum current value of $\sim 1.8\times10^8$ G, which can be useful to constrain the decay models. Note that the maximum current $\nu$ value is $\sim 550$ Hz, implying that, unlike what is generally believed, a CW emission is not required to explain the current source properties. However, $\nu$ will exceed an observed cut-off frequency of $\sim 730$ Hz, and perhaps even the NS break-up frequency, in the future, without a CW emission. The minimum NS mass quadrupole moment ($Q$) to avoid this is $\sim (2-3)\times10^{37}$ g cm$^2$, corresponding to a CW strain of $\sim 10^{-26}$. Our estimation of current $\nu$ values can improve the CW search sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Investigating the complex absorbers of Mrk 766 with XMM-Newton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aims. We examine the high energy resolution X-ray spectrum of the narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy Mrk 766 using 4 observations taken with XMM-Newton in 2005, to investigate the properties of the complex ionised absorber / emitter along the line of sight, as well as absorption by dust intrinsic to the source.
  Methods. We make use of the high-energy resolution RGS spectrum to infer the properties of the intervening matter. We also use the spectrum obtained by EPIC-pn and the photometric measurements of OM to obtain the spectral energy distribution of the source, necessary for the photoionisation modelling of the ionised outflow.
  Results. The warm absorber in Mrk 766 consists of two phases of photoionisation. In addition to these two warm absorber components with $\log\xi\sim 2.15$ and $\log\xi\sim -0.58$, we find evidence of absorption by a collisionally ionised component ($T\sim51$ eV). We discuss the implication of this additional component in light of theoretical predictions. Moreover, we detect signs of absorption by a dusty medium with $N_\text{dust}\sim 7.29\times 10^{16}$ cm$^{-2}$. Finally the relatively weak emission features in the spectrum seem to be unrelated to the absorbers and probably originated by an out-of sight-line ionised plasma.</description>

      <title>Gamma ray emission from embedded young massive star clusters unveiled by Fermi-LAT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive star clusters (SCs) have been proposed as additional contributors to Galactic Cosmic rays (CRs), to overcome the limitations of supernova remnants (SNR) to reach the highest energy end of the Galactic CR spectrum. Thanks to fast mass losses through collective stellar winds, the environment around SCs is potentially suitable for particle acceleration up to PeV energies. A handful of star clusters has been detected in gamma-rays confirming the idea that particle acceleration is taking place in these environments. Here we present a new analysis of Fermi-LAT data collected towards a few massive young star clusters and estimate the contribution of these types of sources to the bulk of CRs. We then briefly discuss the observational prospects for ASTRI and CTAO.</description>

      <title>Bridging the Gap: OPTICAM Reveals the Hidden Spin of the WZ Sge Star GOTO 065054.49+593624.51</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: WZ Sge stars are highly evolved accreting white dwarf systems (AWDs) exhibiting remarkably large amplitude outbursts (a.k.a. super-outbursts), typically followed by short rebrightenings/echo outbursts. These systems have some of the lowest mass transfer rates among AWDs, making even low magnetic fields dynamically important. Such magnetic fields are often invoked to explain the phenomenology observed in these systems, such as their X-ray luminosity and long periods of quiescence (30+ years). However, the detection of these is very elusive given the quenching of the accretion columns during outburst and the low luminosity of these systems during quiescence. Here we present high-cadence multi-band observations with {\it OPTICAM} of the recent outburst of the recently discovered WZ Sge star GOTO065054.49+593624.51, during the end of the main outburst and the dip in-between rebrightenings, covering 2 orders of magnitude in brightness. Our observations reveal the presence of a statistically significant signal with $P_{\omega}\simeq148$ seconds in the bluer ($g$) band which is detected only during the dip between the main outburst and the rebrigthenings. We interpret this signal as the spin period of the AWD. If confirmed, GOTO 0650 would bridge the gap between intermediate- and fast-rotating intermediate polars (IPs) below the period gap.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Decoupling in Retrograde Circumbinary Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a study of the late-time interaction between supermassive black hole binaries and retrograde circumbinary disks during the period of gravitational wave-driven inspiral. While mergers in prograde disks have received extensive study, retrograde disks offer distinct dynamics that could promote mergers and produce unique observational signatures. Through numerical simulations, we explore the process of binary-disk decoupling, where the binary's orbital decay rate is faster than the disk's viscous response rate. We find the point of decoupling to be comparable in prograde and retrograde disks, suggesting that any associated electromagnetic (EM) signatures will be produced at comparable times preceding merger. However, we find smaller central cavities for retrograde disks, likely leading to higher-frequency EM emissions and shorter post-merger rebrightening timescales compared to their prograde counterparts. Additionally, we identify quasi-periodic flaring due to instabilities unique to low-viscosity retrograde disks, which may produce distinctive EM signatures.</description>

      <title>Probing axion-like particles through the gamma-ray production from cosmic-ray scattering in the Milky Way dark matter halo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11691v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Axion-like particles (ALP) are promising candidates to comprise all the dark matter in the universe. We investigate the ALP couplings to photons and electrons via astrophysical measurements through the search for very-high-energy gamma rays arising from high-energy cosmic-ray scattering off ALP populating the halo of the Milky Way. We show that gamma-ray signals from ALP couplings to photons and electrons via inverse Primakoff and Compton processes respectively, can be probed by very-high-energy ($\gtrsim$100 GeV) gamma-ray ground-based observatories, providing an alternative and complementary avenue to probe ALP couplings in the eV mass range. Sensitivities of current and near-future ground-based gamma-ray observatories improves upon one order of magnitude the current constraints from gamma-ray satellite experiments for the ALP-photon couplings in the region of masses below 10$^{-9}$ GeV. Their sensitivities reached on the ALP-electron couplings allow probing masses below 10$^{-8}$ GeV, which are lower than the masses probed in gamma-ray satellite experiments.</description>

      <title>A multi-frequency census of 100 pulsars below 100 MHz with LWA: a systematic study of flux density, spectra, timing, dispersion, polarization, and its variation from a decade of observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11862v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a census of 100 pulsars, the largest below 100 MHz, including 94 normal pulsars and six millisecond pulsars, with the Long Wavelength Array (LWA). Pulse profiles are detected across a range of frequencies from 26 to 88 MHz, including new narrow-band profiles facilitating profile evolution studies and breaks in pulsar spectra at low frequencies. We report mean flux density, spectral index, curvature, and low-frequency turnover frequency measurements for 97 pulsars, including new measurements for 61 sources. Multi-frequency profile widths are presented for all pulsars, including component spacing for 27 pulsars with two components. Polarized emission is detected from 27 of the sources (the largest sample at these frequencies) in multiple frequency bands, with one new detection. We also provide new timing solutions for five recently-discovered pulsars. Low-frequency observations with the LWA are especially sensitive to propagation effects arising in the interstellar medium. We have made the most sensitive measurements of pulsar dispersion measures (DMs) and rotation measures (RMs), with median uncertainties of 2.9x10^-4 pc cm^-3 and 0.01 rad m^-2, respectively, and can track their variations over almost a decade, along with other frequency-dependent effects. This allows stringent limits on average magnetic fields, with no variations detected above ~20 nG. Finally, the census yields some interesting phenomena in individual sources, including the detection of frequency and time-dependent DM variations in B2217+47, and the detection of highly circularly polarized emission from J0051+0423.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the Nature of HAWC J1844-034 with Fermi-LAT Data Analysis and Multi-wavelength modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The extended ultra-high-energy gamma-ray source HAWC J1844-034 is closely associated with two other sources, HAWC J1843-032 and HWC J1846-025. Moreover, other gamma-ray observatories like H.E.S.S., LHAASO, and Tibet AS$_{\gamma}$ have detected ultra-high-energy gamma-ray sources whose spatial positions coincide with the position of HAWC J1844-034. The ultra-high-energy gamma-ray data from several observatories help analyse the spectral features of this source in detail at TeV energies. Of the four pulsars near HAWC J1844-034, PSR J1844-0346 is closest to it and possibly supplies the cosmic-ray leptons to power this source. We have analysed the Fermi-LAT data to explore this source's morphology and identify its spectral feature in the Fermi-LAT energy band. After removing the contribution of the pulsar to the gamma-ray spectral energy distribution by pulsar phased analysis, we have obtained upper limits on the photon flux and identified the GeV counterpart PS J1844.2-0342 in the Fermi-LAT energy band with more than 5$\sigma$ significance, which may be a pulsar wind nebula. Finally, the multi-wavelength spectral energy distribution has been modelled, assuming HAWC J1844-034 is a pulsar wind nebula.</description>

      <title>X-ray emission from isolated neutron stars: latest results from XMM-Newton, NICER and eROSITA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The X-ray spectra of isolated neutron stars (INSs) typically include a thermal component, that comes from the cooling surface, and a non-thermal component, produced by highly-relativistic particles accelerated in the stellar magnetosphere. Hot spots from returning currents can also be detected.
  Middle-aged pulsars exhibit a mixture of these components, but other flavours of INSs, that show a large variety of physical parameters (such as spin period, magnetic field and age) emit only thermal X-rays. Typically, these stars are detected either in large serendipitous datasets from pointed X-ray observations or from searches in the data of all-sky surveys.
  The connection between these thermally-emitting INSs, the ordinary pulsars, and the new emergent class of pulsars characterized by a long period, that do not show X-ray emission despite their high magnetic field, is one of the current challenges in the study of neutron stars.
  In this contribution I will review the latest results on several objects belonging to various INS classes, such as the XDINS RX J1308.6+2127, the enigmatic Calvera, the long period PSR J0250+5854 and the new thermal INS candidates, obtained with the X-ray observatories XMM-Newton, NICER and eROSITA.</description>

      <title>Investigating launching of black hole jets with the combined power of the EVN and the EHT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AGN-launched jets are a crucial element in the study of supermassive black holes (SMBH) and their closest surroundings. The formation of such jets, whether they are launched by magnetic field lines anchored to the accretion disc or directly connected to the black hole's (BH) ergosphere, is the subject of ongoing, extensive research. 3C84, the compact radio source in the central galaxy NGC1275 of the Perseus super-cluster, is a prime laboratory for testing such jet launching scenarios, as well as studying the innermost, sub-parsec AGN structure and jet origin. Very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) offers a unique view into the physical processes in action, in the immediate vicinity of BHs, unparalleled by other observational techniques. With VLBI at short wavelengths particular high angular resolutions are obtained. Utilising such cm and mm-VLBI observations of 3C84 with the European VLBI Network and the Event Horizon Telescope, we study the magnetic field strength and associated accretion flow around its central SMBH. This is possible, as higher frequency VLBI measurements are capable of peering through the accretion flow surrounding the central engine of 3C84, which is known to block the line of sight to the sub-parsec counter-jet via free-free absorption. Furthermore, we study the magnetic field's signature in the core region, as manifested in polarised light. As part of this analysis we compare our observations to relativistic magneto-hydrodynamic simulations. Finally, we investigate the effect of instabilities on the shape of the jet's parsec-scale funnel and try to connect them to its historical evolution.</description>

      <title>Modelling polarized X-ray pulses from accreting millisecond pulsars with X-PSI, using different surface patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analysis of polarized X-ray pulses based on simulated data for accreting millisecond pulsars (AMPs). We used the open-source X-ray Pulse Simulation and Inference code (previously applied to NICER observations), that we upgraded to allow polarization analysis. We predicted neutron star parameter constraints for the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) and found that strong limits on the hot region geometries can be hard to obtain if the emitting hot region is large and the number of polarized photons relatively small. However, if the star is bright enough and the hot regions are small and located so that polarization degree is higher, the observer inclination and hotspot colatitude can be constrained to a precision of within a few degrees. We also found that the shape of the hot region, whether a circle or a ring, cannot be distinguished in our most optimistic scenario. Nevertheless, future X-ray polarization missions are expected to improve the constraints, and already the recent AMP polarization detections by IXPE should help to infer the neutron star mass and radius when combined with modelling of X-ray pulse data sets that do not contain polarization information.</description>

      <title>Detection of very-high-energy gamma-ray emission from Eta Carinae during its 2020 periastron passage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The colliding-wind binary system $\eta$ Carinae has been identified as a source of high-energy (HE, below $\sim$100\,GeV) and very-high-energy (VHE, above $\sim$100\,GeV) gamma rays in the last decade, making it unique among these systems. With its eccentric 5.5-year-long orbit, the periastron passage, during which the stars are separated by only $1-2$\,au, is an intriguing time interval to probe particle acceleration processes within the system. In this work, we report on an extensive VHE observation campaign that for the first time covers the full periastron passage carried out with the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) in its 5-telescope configuration with upgraded cameras. VHE gamma-ray emission from $\eta$ Carinae was detected during the periastron passage with a steep spectrum with spectral index $\Gamma= 3.3 \pm 0.2_{\mathrm{stat}} \, \pm 0.1_{\mathrm{syst}}$. Together with previous and follow-up observations, we derive a long-term light curve sampling one full orbit, showing hints of an increase of the VHE flux towards periastron, but no hint of variability during the passage itself. An analysis of contemporaneous Fermi-LAT data shows that the VHE spectrum represents a smooth continuation of the HE spectrum. From modelling the combined spectrum we conclude that the gamma-ray emission region is located at distances of ${\sim}10 - 20$\,au from the centre of mass of the system and that protons are accelerated up to energies of at least several TeV inside the system in this phase.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Pulsar Parameter Estimation Using Convolutional Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate models of neutron stars are essential for constraining the dense matter equation of state. However, realistic models incorporating magnetic fields structures are exceedingly computationally intensive. In this work, we develop a neural network (NN) emulator to generate model thermal bolometric X-ray light curves of millisecond pulsars with multipolar magnetic fields. We assess the NN's predictive and computational performance across a broad parameter space. We find that for a static vacuum field (SVF) model, the NN provides a &gt;400 times speedup. We integrate this NN emulator into a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) framework to replace the computationally expensive physical model during parameter exploration. Applied to PSR J0030+0451, this approach allows the MCMC to reach equilibrium, which is infeasible to obtain with the original physical model alone. We compare posterior distributions by running equivalent MCMC iterations with both the NN and the physical model and evaluate differences in distributions when continuing the physical model MCMC from the NN MCMC equilibrium state. Our NN architecture is agnostic to the underlying physics of the physical model and can be trained for any other physical model. The NN speed remains the same regardless of the complexity of the physical model it was trained to emulate, allowing for greater speedups compared to physical models that are more complex than the SVF model.</description>

      <title>(H)ALPing the 511 keV line: A thermal DM interpretation of the 511 keV emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel framework where MeV-scale Dirac Dark Matter annihilates into axion-like particles, providing a natural explanation for the 511 keV gamma-ray line observed in the Galactic Center. The relic abundance is determined by p-wave annihilation into two axion-like particles, while s-wave annihilation into three axion-like particles, decaying into $e^+ e^-$ pairs, accounts for the line intensity. Remarkably, this model, assuming a standard Navarro-Frenk-White profile, reproduces the observed emission morphology, satisfies in-flight annihilation and cosmological bounds, and achieves the correct relic density, offering a compelling resolution to this longstanding anomaly.</description>

      <title>High-Significance Detection of Correlation Between the Unresolved Gamma-Ray Background and the Large Scale Cosmic Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our understanding of the $\gamma$-ray sky has improved dramatically in the past decade, however, the unresolved $\gamma$-ray background (UGRB) still has a potential wealth of information about the faintest $\gamma$-ray sources pervading the Universe. Statistical cross-correlations with tracers of cosmic structure can indirectly identify the populations that most characterize the $\gamma$-ray background. In this study, we analyze the angular correlation between the $\gamma$-ray background and the matter distribution in the Universe as traced by gravitational lensing, leveraging more than a decade of observations from the Fermi-Large Area Telescope (LAT) and 3 years of data from the Dark Energy Survey (DES). We detect a correlation at signal-to-noise ratio of 8.9. Most of the statistical significance comes from large scales, demonstrating, for the first time, that a substantial portion of the UGRB aligns with the mass clustering of the Universe as traced by weak lensing. Blazars provide a plausible explanation for this signal, especially if those contributing to the correlation reside in halos of large mass ($\sim 10^{14} M_{\odot}$) and account for approximately 30-40 % of the UGRB above 10 GeV. Additionally, we observe a preference for a curved $\gamma$-ray energy spectrum, with a log-parabolic shape being favored over a power-law. We also discuss the possibility of modifications to the blazar model and the inclusion of additional $gamma$-ray sources, such as star-forming galaxies or particle dark matter.</description>

      <title>A Large Systematic Search for Close Supermassive Binary and Rapidly Recoiling Black Holes -- IV. Ultraviolet spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Hubble Space Telescope ultraviolet (UV) of 13 quasars at z&lt;0.7, along with contemporaneous optical spectra from ground-based telescopes. The targets were selected to have broad H-beta emission lines with substantial velocity offsets relative to the rest frame of their host galaxy. By analogy to single-line spectroscopic binary stars, these objects have been regarded as supermassive black hole binary (SBHB) candidates where the offset emission lines may be caused by bulk orbital motion. The best alternative explanation is that the H-beta line profile is the result of non-axisymmetric emission from a disk-like broad-line region associated with a single supermassive black hole. We use the broad UV line profiles to discriminate between these two scenarios. We describe our methodology for isolating the broad optical and UV line profiles and the criteria we apply for comparing them. Of the 13 SBHB candidates, three have strong evidence in support of the SBHB hypothesis, five have tentative support, one is disfavored, and four have such severely absorbed UV line profiles that the results are inconclusive.</description>

      <title>Classical waves and instabilities using the minimalist approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The minimalist approach in the study of perturbations in fluid dynamics and magnetohydrodynamics involves describing their evolution in the linear regime using a single first-order ordinary differential equation, dubbed principal equation. The dispersion relation is determined by requiring that the solution of the principal equation be continuous and satisfy specific boundary conditions for each problem. The formalism is presented for flows in cartesian geometry and applied to classical cases such as the magnetosonic and gravity waves, the Rayleigh-Taylor instability, and the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. For the latter, we discuss the influence of compressibility and the magnetic field, and also derive analytical expressions for the growth rates and the range of instability in the case of two fluids with the same characteristics.</description>

      <title>Modeling the Spectral Energy Distribution of Active Galactic Nuclei: Implications for Cosmological Simulations of Galaxy Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling the spectral energy distribution (SED) of active galactic nuclei (AGN) plays a very important role in constraining modern cosmological simulations of galaxy formation. Here, we utilize an advanced supermassive black hole (SMBH) accretion disk model to compute the accretion flow structure and AGN SED across a wide range of black hole mass ($M_{\rm SMBH}$) and dimensionless accretion rates $\dot{m}(\equiv \dot{M}_{\rm acc}/\dot{M}_\mathrm{Edd})$, where $\dot{M}_{\rm acc}$ is the mass flow rate through the disk and $\dot{M}_\mathrm{Edd}$ is the Eddington mass accretion rate. We find that the radiative efficiency is mainly influenced by $\dot m$, while contributions of $M_{\rm SMBH}$ and $\dot{m}$ to the bolometric luminosity are comparably important. We have developed new scaling relationships that relate the bolometric luminosity of an AGN to its luminosities in the hard X-ray, soft X-ray, and optical bands. Our results align with existing literature at high luminosities but suggest lower luminosities in the hard and soft X-ray bands for AGNs with low bolometric luminosities than commonly reported values. Combining with the semi-analytical model of galaxy formation \textsc{L-Galaxies} and Millennium dark matter simulation for the distribution of ($M_{\rm SMBH}, \dot{m}$) at different redshift, we find the model predictions align well with observational data at redshifts below 1 but deviates for higher redshifts regarding AGN detection fraction and luminosity functions. This deviation may arise from improper treatment of SMBH growth at high redshifts in the model or bias from limited observational data. This AGN SED calculation can be readily applied in other cosmological simulations.</description>

      <title>A Non-Stop Aurora? The Intriguing Radio Emission from the Rapidly Rotating Magnetic Massive Star HR 5907</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: HR 5907 (HD 142184) stands out among magnetic OB stars for its rapid rotation, exceptionally hard X-ray emission, and strong magnetic field. High-frequency (&gt;5 GHz) radio emission from the star exhibits an approximately flat spectrum that can be attributed to gyrosynchrotron emission from a dense centrifugal magnetosphere. In a survey of radio emission from massive stars at sub-GHz frequencies, we noticed remarkable low-frequency radio emission from this star, characterized by high circular polarization and brightness temperature, which is inconsistent with the gyrosynchrotron model. We present a follow-up low-frequency radio study of this star with the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) in search of emission mechanisms that can go undiagnosed at higher frequencies. We detect variable radio emission characterized by varying degrees of circular polarization (15-45%) throughout the rotation cycle. The broad-band spectral fitting also suggests additional emission components at lower frequencies. We show that the observed emission is likely auroral emission via electron cyclotron maser emission (ECME), and identify this star as a Main-sequence Radio Pulse emitter (MRP). For MRPs, ECME is usually observed as short polarized enhancements near the magnetic nulls of the star. The detection of a high degree of circular polarization (&gt;15%) at all times makes HR 5907 unique among MRPs. This is only the second MRP after $\rho$ Oph C (detected polarization fraction: 0-60%) that exhibits persistent coherent radio emission attributed to the nearly aligned stellar magnetic and rotational axes.</description>

      <title>Black holes immersed in polytropic scalar field gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By implementing the concept of polytropic structures as a scalar field gas with a dark energy-like behavior, we obtain a static spherically symmetric black hole solution in the framework of general relativity. In this paper, we study the quasinormal modes, the greybody bound process, the shadow behaviors, and the sparsity of black holes with a surrounding polytropic scalar field gas. Using the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin approach, we evaluate the impact of a particular set of polytropic parameters $(\xi, A)$ with a fixed setting of the polytropic index $n$ on the oscillation frequency and damping rate of gravitational waves. The results show that the effect of the parameter $\xi$ is much less significant than that of the parameter $A$ on the gravitational waves oscillation frequency and damping rate. Furthermore, the analysis of the greybody factor bounds reveals special insight into the effect of certain parameters where the multipole moments $l$ and the polytropic index $n$ have similar effects, in contrast to the pair of polytropic parameters ($\xi,A$). On the other hand, exploring the sparsity of Hawking radiation is another task that provides a better understanding of the behaviour of the black hole solution. In this respect, the results show that the black hole behaves like blackbody radiation for a sufficiently large entropy. And for $\xi=A=0$, the relevant sparsity acts exactly like the Schwarzschild sparsity. These results provide an insight into the dynamics of black holes with a surrounding polytropic scalar field gas from the analysis of their quasinormal modes, greybody factors, shadow behaviors, energy emission rate and sparsity process. Constraints on the associated BH parameters, derived from the Event Horizon Telescope observations of M87* and Sgr A*, indicate that this black hole model stands as a compelling candidate for representing astrophysical black holes.</description>

      <title>Below the Schwinger critical magnetic field value, quantum vacuum and gamma-ray bursts delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A magnetic field above the Schwinger critical value $B_{\rm crit} = 10^9$ Tesla is much higher than any magnetic field known by now in the interstellar bulk except in the vicinity of observed magnetars with magnetic fields between $10^9$ and $10^{11}~$Tesla. Above the critical magnetic field, calculated by Schwinger in the lowest order perturbation in quantum electrodynamics (QED), one reaches the threshold for electron-positron pair creation, which has interesting consequences. Therefore, finding out whether one could encounter some consequences of interest also for the values of the magnetic field below the Schwinger critical point, we invoke the next higher-order effect in QED, which is emerging from the Quantum Vacuum Effect. The latter is equivalent to the use of the Euler-Heisenberg effective theory in nonlinear electrodynamics, where the Lagrangian has a term with a higher power, $B^4$. In this case, in the region $B&lt;B_{\rm crit}$, we show that interesting effects appear, among them the Cherenkov radiation and the reduction in the speed of light. The latter effects appear because of the quantum vacuum mimicking a medium. We also present quantitative arguments for such a close analogy. As a rough estimate, we show that the time delay $\tau$ of gamma-ray bursts (GRB) having traveled through the entire cosmological distances in an average strong magnetic field such as $10^6~$Tesla, reaches an experimentally considerable value of $\tau = 2.4$ hours. In the vicinity of magnetars, the magnetic field is much stronger, of the order of $10^9-10^{11}$ Tesla. However, in this case the linear scale of GRB trajectory through such regions would be much smaller. For the latter, we give an estimate for the number of the magnetars along the trajectory and also for the delay. Finally, we shall dwell on the recently raised issue in the literature, namely the Lorentz invariance violation (LIV).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dwarf novae are a crucial astrophysical laboratory for probing the nature of accretion, binary mass transfer, and binary evolution -- yet their diverse observational characteristics continue to challenge our theoretical understanding. We here present the discovery of, and subsequent observing campaign on GOTO065054+593624 (hereafter GOTO0650), a dwarf nova of the WZ Sge type, discovered in real-time by citizen scientists via the Kilonova Seekers citizen science project. An extensive dataset charts the photometric and spectroscopic evolution of this object, covering the first two months of its 2024 superoutburst. GOTO0650 shows a complete absence of visible emission lines during the high state, strong H and barely-detected He~II emission, and high-amplitude echo outbursts with a rapidly decreasing timescale that together do not neatly fit in with our current view of cataclysmic variables. The comprehensive dataset presented here not only underscores the uniqueness of this dwarf nova and marks it as a candidate period bouncer, but also highlights the important contribution that citizen scientists can make to the study of Galactic transients.</description>

      <title>Black holes in thermal bath live shorter: implications for primordial black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hawking radiation from a non-extremal black hole is known to be approximately Planckian. The thermal spectrum receives multiple corrections including greybody factors and due to kinematical restrictions on the infrared and ultraviolet frequencies. We show that another significant correction to the spectrum arises if the black hole is assumed to live in a thermal bath and the emitted radiation gets thermalised at the bath temperature. This modification reshapes the thermal spectrum, and leads to appreciable deviation from standard results including modification in the decay rate of black holes. We argue that this altered decay rate has significance for cosmology and, in a realistic setting, show that it alters the life time of primordial black holes (PBHs) in the early universe. In particular, the very light PBHs formed right after the end of inflation decay faster which may have interesting phenomenological implications.</description>

      <title>Light clusters as a possible source of crustal impurities: a quasi-particle approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The presence of impurities in the neutron star crust is known to affect in an important way the thermal and electrical conductivity of the star. In this work, we explore the possibility that such impurities might arise from the simultaneous presence of heavy ions together with Hydrogen and Helium isotopes formed during the cooling process of the star. We consider an equilibrium population of such light particles at temperatures close to the crystallization of the crust within an effective quasi-particle approach including in-medium binding energy shifts, and using different versions of the relativistic mean field approach for the crustal modeling. Thermal effects are consistently included also in the dominant ion species present in each crustal layer described in the compressible liquid drop approximation. We find that the impurity factor associated to light clusters is comparatively very small and can be neglected in transport calculations, even if a strong model dependence is observed.</description>

      <title>Supernova constraints on lepton flavor violating ALPs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supernovae are extreme astrophysical objects that provide unique hot and dense environment to probe new physics beyond the Standard Model. We study supernova cooling constraints on lepton-flavor-violating (LFV) axion-like particles (ALPs) with an electron-muon coupling. We consider three ALP production channels in the SN core: muon decay, axion bremsstrahlung, and electron-muon coalescence. We find that the electron-muon coalescence channel, which was not considered in previous studies on LFV-ALPs, provides the most stringent constraints on the LFV coupling in the mass range of $\sim (115,280)$ MeV.</description>

      <title>The Luminous, Slow-Rising Orphan Afterglow AT2019pim as a Candidate Moderately Relativistic Outflow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16470v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classical gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) have two distinct emission episodes: prompt emission from ultrarelativistic ejecta and afterglow from shocked circumstellar material. While both components are extremely luminous in known GRBs, a variety of scenarios predict the existence of luminous afterglow emission with little or no associated high-energy prompt emission. We present AT2019pim, the first spectroscopically confirmed afterglow with no observed high-energy emission to be identified. Serendipitously discovered during follow-up observations of a gravitational-wave trigger and located in a contemporaneous TESS sector, it is hallmarked by a fast-rising (t ~ 2 hr), luminous (M_UV,peak ~ -24.4 mag) optical transient with accompanying luminous X-ray and radio emission. No gamma-ray emission consistent with the time and location of the transient was detected by Fermi-GBM or by Konus, placing constraining limits on an accompanying GRB. We investigate several independent observational aspects of the afterglow in the context of constraints on relativistic motion and find all of them are consistent with an initial Lorentz factor of Gamma_0 ~ 10-30 for the on-axis material, significantly lower than in any well-observed GRB and consistent with the theoretically predicted "dirty fireball" scenario in which the high-energy prompt emission is stifled by pair production. However, we cannot rule out a structured jet model in which only the line-of-sight material was ejected at low-Gamma, off-axis from a classical high-Gamma jet core, and an on-axis GRB with below-average gamma-ray efficiency also remains a possibility. This event represents a milestone in orphan afterglow searches, demonstrating that luminous optical afterglows lacking detected GRB counterparts can be identified and spectroscopically confirmed in real time.</description>

      <title>Contribution of young massive star clusters to Galactic diffuse $\gamma$-ray emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04087v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context: Young massive stellar clusters (YMSCs) have emerged as potential $\gamma$-ray sources, after the recent association of a dozen YMSCs with extended $\gamma$-ray emission. The large size of the detected halos, comparable to that of the wind-blown bubble expected around YMSCs, makes the $\gamma$-ray detection of individual YMSCs rather challenging. As a result, the emission from most of the Galactic YMSCs could be unresolved, thus contributing to the diffuse $\gamma$-ray radiation observed along the Galactic Plane.
  Aims: In this study, we estimate the possible contribution to the Galactic diffuse $\gamma$-ray emission from a synthetic population of YMSCs, and we compare it with observations obtained with different experiments, from 1 GeV to hundreds of TeV, in two regions of the Galactic Plane.
  Methods: As the population of galactic YMSCs is only known locally, we evaluate the contribution of $\gamma$-ray emission relying on the simulation of synthetic populations of YMSCs based on the observed properties of local clusters. We compute the $\gamma$-ray emission from each cluster assuming that the radiation is purely hadronic in nature and produced by cosmic rays accelerated at the cluster's collective wind termination shock.
  Results: We find that the $\gamma$-ray emission from unresolved YMSCs can significantly contribute to the observed Galactic diffuse flux, especially in the inner part of the Galaxy, and that an important role is played by the power injected by Wolf-Rayet stellar winds. The predicted $\gamma$-ray flux should be considered as a lower limit, given that our calculation neglects the contribution of supernovae exploding in YMSCs.</description>

      <title>Exploring non-radial oscillation modes in dark matter admixed neutron stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07470v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Because of their extreme densities and consequently, gravitational potential, compact objects such as neutron stars can prove to be excellent captors of dark matter particles. Considering purely gravitational interactions between dark and hadronic matter, we construct dark matter admixed stars composed of two-fluid matter subject to current astrophysical constraints of maximum mass and tidal deformability. We choose a wide range of parameters to construct the dark matter equation of state, and the DDME2 parameterization for the hadronic equation of state. We then examine the effect of dark matter on the stellar structure, tidal deformability and non-radial modes considering the relativistic Cowling approximation. We find the effect on p-modes is substantial, with frequencies decreasing up to the typical $f-$mode frequency range for most stars with a dark matter halo. The effects on the f-mode frequency are less extreme. Finally, we find the most probable and $1\sigma$ values of the dark matter parameters used in this study.</description>

      <title>Investigating the effect of hadronic models on IACT images</title>

Abstract: The predictions of hadronic interaction models for cosmic-ray induced air showers contain inherent uncertainties due to limitations of available accelerator data. This leads to differences in shower simulations using each of those models. Many studies have been carried out to track those differences by investigating the shower development or the particle content. In this work, we propose a new approach to search for discrepancies and similarities between the models, via the IACT images resulting from the observations of hadronic air showers. We use simulations of H.E.S.S. as a show-case scenario and, by investigating variables of the camera images, we find potential indicators to highlight differences between models. Number of pixels, Hillas image size, and density showed the largest difference between the models. We then further explore the (in)compatibility of the models by combining all the variables and using Boosted Decision Trees. For protons, a significant difference in the classifier output is found for EPOS-LHC when compared to both QGSJET-II04 and Sybill 2.3d. For helium and nitrogen, QGSJET-II04 is shown to be the outlier case. No significant differences are found for silicon and iron. The distribution of (in)compatibility between the models in the phase space of reconstructed shower parameters shows that a targeted search can be fruitful, with showers with reconstructed energies of a few TeV and reconstructed core closer to the large telescope presenting the largest power of separation. An investigation of the distribution of first interaction parameters has shown that EPOS-LHC and QGSJET-II04 result in significantly different distributions of multiplicity and height of first interaction for protons and elasticity and fraction of energy carried by neutral pions for helium and nitrogen.</description>

      <title>Constraining the Generalized Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (GTOV) equation with Bayesian analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10425v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we constrain the values of the parameters of the Generalized Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (GTOV) equation through Bayesian inference. We use the mass and radius data from the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) for PSR J0740$+$6620 and PSR J0030$+$0451, as well as the mass, radius, and dimensionless tidal deformability from the gravitational wave (GW) events GW190814 and GW170817. We use two distinct parameterizations of the extended non-linear Walecka model (eNLW) with and without hyperons. The GTOV employed for the study contains additional free parameters with different physical motivations. Two possible scenarios are considered in our analysis: conservative and speculative. In the first case, we take into account the most reliable neutron star (NS) data from NICER and the GW170817 event. In the second case, we consider the possibility that the compact object with a mass of $2.54 M_{\odot}$ in the GW190814 event is an NS. Our findings show significant improvements in the physical quantities analyzed, leading to better agreement with the observational data compared to the results obtained using the TOV equation.</description>

      <title>Dynamical confirmation of a black hole in the X-ray transient Swift J1727.8-1613</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13310v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The X-ray transient Swift J1727.8-1613 ended its 10-month discovery outburst on June of 2024, when it reached an optical brightness comparable to pre-discovery magnitudes. With the aim of performing a dynamical study, we launched an optical spectroscopy campaign with the GTC telescope. We detect the companion star and construct its radial velocity curve, yielding a binary orbital period of Porb = 10.8038 +- 0.0010 h and a radial velocity semi-amplitude of K2 = 390 +- 4 km/s. This results in a mass function of f(M1)=2.77 +- 0.09 Msun. Combined with constraints on the binary inclination, it sets a lower limit to the compact object mass of M1 &gt; 3.12 +- 0.10 Msun, dynamically confirming the black hole nature of the accretor. Comparison of the average spectrum in the rest frame of the companion with synthetic stellar templates supports a K4V donor partially veiled (74%) by the accretion disc. A refined distance measurement of 3.7+- 0.3 kpc, together with the astrometric proper motion and the systemic velocity derived from the radial velocity curve (181 +-4 km/s), supports a natal kick velocity of 220 +40 -50 km/s, at the upper end of the observed distribution.</description>

      <title>The size of accretion disks from self-consistent X-ray spectra and UV/optical/NIR photometry fitting: applications to ASASSN-14li and HLX-1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17296v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We implement a standard thin disk model with the outer disk radius ($R_{\rm out}$) as a free parameter, integrating it into standard X-ray fitting package to enable self-consistent and simultaneous fitting of X-ray spectra and UV/optical/NIR photometry. We apply the model to the late-time data ($\Delta t \approx 350-1300$ days) of the tidal disruption event (TDE) ASASSN-14li. We show that at these late-times the multi-wavelength emission of the source can be fully described by a bare compact accretion disk. We obtain a black hole mass ($M_{\rm BH}$) of $7^{+3}_{-2}\times10^{6} M_{\odot}$, consistent with host-galaxy scaling relations; and an $R_{\rm out}$ of $45 \pm 13 \, R_{\rm g}$, consistent with the circularization radius, with possible expansion at the latest epoch. We discuss how simplistic models, such as a single-temperature blackbody fitted to either X-ray spectra or UV/optical photometry, lead to erroneous interpretations on the scale/energetics of TDE emission. We also apply the model to the soft/high state of the intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) candidate HLX-1. The model fits the full spectral energy distribution (from X-rays to NIR) without needing an additional stellar population component. We investigate how relativistic effects improve our results by implementing a version of the model with full ray tracing calculations in the Kerr metric. For HLX-1, we find $M_{\rm BH} = 4^{+3}_{-1} \times 10^{4} M_{\odot}$ and $R_{\rm out} \approx {\rm few} \times 10^{3} \, R_{\rm g}$, in agreement with previous findings. The relativistic model can constrain the inclination ($i$) of HLX-1 to be $10^o \leq i \leq 70^o$.</description>

      <title>Strange stars admixed with mirror dark matter: confronting observations of XTE J1814-338</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15969v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore a novel framework for explaining the mass and radius relationships of observed neutron stars by considering strange stars (SSs) admixed with mirror dark matter (MDM). We develop a theoretical model that incorporates non-commutative algebra to describe the interactions between ordinary strange quark matter (SQM) and MDM, which are predicted to form compact objects that could explain recent astrophysical data, including observations of PSR J0740+6620, PSR J0030+0451, PSR J0437-4715, and the central compact object in HESS J1731-347. Notably, we demonstrate that the exotic mass-radius measurement of XTE J1814-338 can be explained by the presence of a mirror SS with an ordinary SQM core. In contrast to other explanations based on boson stars, our SS+MDM model offers a natural explanation for this system. We provide detailed mass-radius comparisons with observational data and discuss future observations that could test the predictions of our model, offering new insights into neutron star structure and the role of dark matter in compact objects.</description>

      <title>A sample study on the Fermi-LAT spectral variation behavior of blazars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17537v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we analyze the $\sim 16$ yr Fermi-LAT data of 160 blazars consisting of 92 flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs), 64 BL Lacertae type objects (BL Lacs), and 4 blazar candidates of unknown type objects (BCU), and exhibit their spectral variation. By fitting a linear model ($y = kx + b$) to the monthly binned flux-index plots, we find that most of the FSRQs ($\sim 89\%$) display a harder-when-brighter (HWB) trend ($k&gt;0$), while the majority of BL Lacs ($\sim 64\%$) exhibit a softer-when-brighter (SWB) trend ($k&lt;0$). By plotting their slope ($k$) versus their variability index and inverse Compton (IC) peak frequency, we find a moderate positive correlation between $k$ and the variability index, and we find a moderate negative correlation between $k$ and the IC peak frequency, which we name as the gamma-ray variability sequence of blazars. Additionally, 7 blazars may not follow the linear variation trend, particularly in PKS 0537-441, AP Librae, and PKS 1510-089. Additional very-high-energy gamma-ray emission components may be the cause of the break in the variation trend.</description>

      <title>Predicting the rate of fast radio bursts in globular clusters from binary black hole observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20564v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The repeating fast radio burst (FRB) source in an old globular cluster (GC) in M81 proves that FRBs, which are typically associated with young magnetars, can also occur in old stellar populations. A potential explanation is super-Chandrasekhar binary white dwarf (BWD) coalescences, which may produce FRB-emitting neutron stars. GCs can also give rise to binary black hole (BBH) mergers detectable with gravitational waves, and the BWD coalescence rate from GCs is correlated with their BBH merger rate. For the first time, we combine independent observations of gravitational waves and FRBs to infer the origins of FRB sources. We use GC formation histories inferred from BBH observations to predict the rate of super-Chandrasekhar BWD coalescences originating from GCs as a function of redshift. We explore mass-loss and mass-conserved scenarios for BWD coalescences and find that the coalescence rates evolve differently across redshift in these two cases. In the mass-loss scenario, the BWD coalescence rates decrease with increasing redshift, similar to some recent measurements of the FRB rate as a function of redshift. We show that GCs could contribute $\lesssim 1\%$ to the total FRB source formation rates in the local Universe. Our multi-messenger approach also offers a novel method to better constrain the GC population using both FRB and gravitational wave observations.</description>

Abstract: We study a flaring activity of the HSP Mrk421 that was characterized from radio to very-high-energy (VHE; E $&gt;0.1$TeV) gamma rays with MAGIC, Fermi-LAT, Swift, XMM-Newton and several optical and radio telescopes. These observations included, for the first time for a gamma-ray flare of a blazar, simultaneous X-ray polarization measurements with IXPE. We find substantial variability in both X-rays and VHE gamma rays throughout the campaign, with the highest VHE flux above 0.2 TeV occurring during the IXPE observing window, and exceeding twice the flux of the Crab Nebula. However, the VHE and X-ray spectra are on average softer, and the correlation between these two bands weaker that those reported in previous flares of Mrk421. IXPE reveals an X-ray polarization degree significantly higher than that at radio and optical frequencies. The X-ray polarization angle varies by $\sim$100$^\circ$ on timescales of days, and the polarization degree changes by more than a factor 4. The highest X-ray polarization degree reaches 26%, around which a X-ray counter-clockwise hysteresis loop is measured with XMM-Newton. It suggests that the X-ray emission comes from particles close to the high-energy cutoff, hence possibly probing an extreme case of the Turbulent Extreme Multi-Zone model. We model the broadband emission with a simplified stratified jet model throughout the flare. The polarization measurements imply an electron distribution in the X-ray emitting region with a very high minimum Lorentz factor, which is expected in electron-ion plasma, as well as a variation of the emitting region size up to a factor of three during the flaring activity. We find no correlation between the fluxes and the evolution of the model parameters, which indicates a stochastic nature of the underlying physical mechanism. Such behaviour would be expected in a highly turbulent electron-ion plasma crossing a shock front.</description>

      <title>NinjaSat monitoring of Type-I X-ray bursts from the clocked burster SRGA J144459.2$-$604207</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10992v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The CubeSat X-ray observatory NinjaSat was launched on 2023 November 11 and has provided opportunities for agile and flexible monitoring of bright X-ray sources. On 2024 February 23, the NinjaSat team started long-term observation of the new X-ray source SRGA J144459.2$-$604207 as the first scientific target, which was discovered on 2024 February 21 and recognized as the sixth clocked X-ray burster. Our 25-day observation covered almost the entire decay of this outburst from two days after the peak at $\sim$100 mCrab on February 23 until March 18 at a few mCrab level. The Gas Multiplier Counter onboard NinjaSat successfully detected 12 Type-I X-ray bursts with a typical burst duration of $\sim$20 s, shorter than other clocked burster systems. As the persistent X-ray emission declined by a factor of five, X-ray bursts showed a notable change in its morphology: the rise time became shorter from 4.4(7) s to 0.3(3) s (1$\sigma$ errors), and the peak amplitude increased by 44%. The burst recurrence time $\Delta t_{\rm rec}$ also became longer from 2 hr to 10 hr, following the relation of $\Delta t_{\rm rec} \propto F_{\rm per}^{-0.84}$, where $F_{\rm per}$ is the persistent X-ray flux, by applying a Markov chain Monte Carlo method. The short duration of bursts is explained by the He-enhanced composition of accretion matter and the relation between $\Delta t_{\textrm{rec}}$ and $F_{\rm per}$ by a massive neutron star. This study demonstrated that CubeSat pointing observations can provide valuable astronomical X-ray data.</description>

      <title>Dimming GRS 1915+105 observed with NICER and Insight--HXMT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03804</link>

Abstract: The black hole X-ray binary GRS 1915+105 was bright for 26 years since its discovery and is well-known for its disk instabilities, quasi-periodic oscillations, and disk wind signatures. We report a long-term spectral-timing tracing of this source from mid-2017 until the onset of the "obscured state", based on the complete data from the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) and the Insight--Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope (HXMT), whose hard coverage decisively informs the modeling at lower energies. In the soft state predating 2018, we observed highly ionized winds. However, in the hard state shortly before transitioning into the "obscured state" on May 14, 2019 (MJD 58617), the winds exhibited a discernible reduction in ionization degree ($\log \xi$), decreasing from above 4 to approximately 3. Our analysis involves the measurement of the frequencies of the quasi-periodic oscillations and the estimation of the properties of the ionized winds and the intensities of different spectral components through spectroscopy during the decay phase. We delve into the origin of these infrequently observed warm outflows in the hard state. It is found that the launching radius of the winds in the hard decay phase is similar to that in the soft state, indicating the launching mechanism of those winds in both states is likely the same. The presence of the ionized winds is preferentially dependent on the periphery of the accretion disk, but not directly related to the corona activities in the center of the binary system.</description>

      <title>Signatures of electromagnetic and sound radiation produced by gravitational waves in core-collapse supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.08312</link>
      <description>arXiv:1907.08312v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the scenario that gravitational waves, generated in core-collapse of a pre-supernova star, can produce both electromagnetic radiation and sound radiation as gravitational waves propagate outward from the collapsing core. While the energy of this co-produced electromagnetic and sound radiation is orders of magnitude smaller than the initiating gravitational radiation, the power may be sufficient to re-ignite fusion outside the collapsing core. The non-equilibrium re-ignition of fusion, in roughly the same time frame as the strongest neutrino emissions, would change the configuration of the pre-supernova star and subsequently the ejecta and the evolution of the stellar expansion of the supernova remnant. Although the co-produced electromagnetic or sound radiation could not contribute directly to the supernova explosion, the associated non-equilibrium re-ignition of fusion would alter the state outside the core leaving an observable signature in the ejecta of the supernova remnant. The aim of this paper is to argue that including this hypothesized co-produced radiation in computational models of core collapse supernovae would contribute to the evolution of the stellar expansion and consequently should be observable in the supernovae remnant, providing a confirmation of the conversion processes for gravitational radiation to electromagnetic and sound radiation.</description>

      <title>White Paper and Roadmap for Quantum Gravity Phenomenology in the Multi-Messenger Era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00409v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The unification of quantum mechanics and general relativity has long been elusive. Only recently have empirical predictions of various possible theories of quantum gravity been put to test, where a clear signal of quantum properties of gravity is still missing. The dawn of multi-messenger high-energy astrophysics has been tremendously beneficial, as it allows us to study particles with much higher energies and travelling much longer distances than possible in terrestrial experiments, but more progress is needed on several fronts.
  A thorough appraisal of current strategies and experimental frameworks, regarding quantum gravity phenomenology, is provided here. Our aim is twofold: a description of tentative multimessenger explorations, plus a focus on future detection experiments.
  As the outlook of the network of researchers that formed through the COST Action CA18108 ``Quantum gravity phenomenology in the multi-messenger approach (QG-MM)'', in this work we give an overview of the desiderata that future theoretical frameworks, observational facilities, and data-sharing policies should satisfy in order to advance the cause of quantum gravity phenomenology.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic study of the Quiescent Stages in between the 2006 and 2021 outbursts of RS Ophiuchi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03234v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive spectroscopic analysis of the quiescent stage of the recurrent nova RS Ophiuchi between its 2006 and 2021 outbursts. The spectra shows prominent low-ionization emission features, including hydrogen, helium, iron emissions, and TiO absorption features. The \ion{H}{$\alpha$} and \ion{H}{$\beta$} lines showed double-peaked emission profiles, indicating that both originate from the accretion disc. The central peaks of the \ion{H}{$\alpha$} and \ion{H}{$\beta$} emission profiles exhibited subtle shifts towards the blue or red side, attributed to orbital motion and fluctuations in the accretion rate. Using the double-peak features observed in the \ion{H}{$\alpha$} and \ion{H}{$\beta$} lines, we have estimated the accretion disc size to be \( R_{AD} = 3.10 \pm 0.04 \times 10^{12} \, \text{cm} \). The \textsc{cloudy} photoionization code is employed to model the quiescent phase spectra, allowing us to study the evolution of various physical parameters such as temperature, luminosity, hydrogen density, elemental abundances, accreted mass, and accretion rate. The central ionizing sources exhibit temperatures in the range of $1.05 - 1.80~\times 10^4$ K and luminosities between $0.10 - 7.94~\times 10^{30}$ \ergs. The mean accretion rate, calculated from the model, is $\sim$ $1.25 \times 10^{-8} M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. The model results reveal that the accretion rate rose substantially in the later phase. The accreted mass in the 16 months, preceding the 2021 outburst exceeds 47\% of the critical mass, and more than 88\% of the critical mass was accreted in the last three years.</description>

      <title>The conceptual design of the 50-meter Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18645v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The (sub)millimeter sky contains a vast wealth of information that is both complementary and inaccessible to other wavelengths. Over half the light we receive is observable at (sub)millimeter wavelengths, yet we have mapped only a small portion of the sky at sufficient spatial resolution and sensitivity to detect and resolve distant galaxies or star forming cores within their large-scale environments. For decades the astronomical community has highlighted the need for a large, high-throughput (sub-)mm ($\lambda\sim 0.35-10$ mm) single dish. The Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST), with its 50-m aperture and $2^\circ$ maximal field of view, aims to be such a facility. We present here the preliminary design concept for AtLAST, developed through an EU Horizon 2020-funded design study. Our design approach begins with a long lineage of (sub)millimeter telescopes, relies on calculations and simulations to realize the optics, and uses finite element analysis to optimize the designs for the mechanical structure and subsystems. The demanding technical requirements for AtLAST, set by transformative science goals, have motivated the design effort to combine novel concepts with lessons learned from the past experience of previous efforts. The result is an innovative rocking chair design with six instrument bays, two of which are mounted on Nasmyth platforms, inside a large receiver cabin. Ultimately, AtLAST aims to achieve a surface accuracy of $\leq 20~\mu$m root mean square half wavefront error, corresponding a Ruze efficiency $&gt;50\%$ at 950~GHz. We conclude that closed-loop metrology of the active primary surface will likely be required to achieve our surface accuracy goal. In the next phase of the project, we will prototype and test such metrology on existing platforms, with a goal of delivering a mature, construction-ready design by the end of this decade.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal Modes and Universality of the Penrose Limit of Black Hole Photon Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10605v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the physics of photon rings in a wide range of axisymmetric black holes admitting a separable Hamilton-Jacobi equation for the geodesics. Utilizing the Killing-Yano tensor, we derive the Penrose limit of the black holes, which describes the physics near the photon ring. The obtained plane wave geometry is directly linked to the frequency matrix of the massless wave equation, as well as the instabilities and Lyapunov exponents of the null geodesics. Consequently, the Lyapunov exponents and frequencies of the photon geodesics, along with the quasinormal modes, can be all extracted from a Hamiltonian in the Penrose limit plane wave metric. Additionally, we explore potential bounds on the Lyapunov exponent, the orbital and precession frequencies, in connection with the corresponding inverted harmonic oscillators and we discuss the possibility of photon rings serving as holographic horizons in a holographic duality framework for astrophysical black holes. Our formalism is applicable to spacetimes encompassing various types of black holes, including stationary ones like Kerr, Kerr-Newman, as well as static black holes such as Schwarzschild, Reissner-Nordstr\"om, among others.</description>

      <title>Impact of the nuclear equation of state on the formation of twin stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07396v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Twin stars-two stable neutron stars (NSs) with the same mass but different radii have long been proposed to appear as a consequence of a possible first-order phase transition in NS matter. Within a meta-model for the EOS of hybrid stars, we revisit the viability of twin stars and its dependence on numerous parameters characterizing the EOS of nuclear matter, quark matter, and the phase transition between them. While essentially no experimental constraint exists for the last two, parameters characterizing the EOS of neutron-rich nucleonic matter have been constrained within various ranges by terrestrial experiments and astrophysical observations. Within these ranges, the impact of nuclear EOS and crust-core transition density on the formation of twin stars is studied. It is found that the symmetry energy of neutron-rich nucleonic matter notably influences the formation of twin stars, particularly through its slope $L$ and curvature $K_{\rm sym}$. Conversely, varying the EOS of symmetric nuclear matter within their currently known uncertainty ranges shows minimal influence on the formation of twin stars.</description>

      <title>Indirect Searches for Ultraheavy Dark Matter in the Time Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06262v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dark matter may exist today in the form of ultraheavy composite bound states. Collisions between such dark matter states can release intense bursts of radiation that includes gamma-rays among the final products. Thus, indirect-detection signals of dark matter may include unconventional gamma-ray bursts. Such bursts may have been missed not necessarily because of their low arriving gamma-ray fluxes, but rather their briefness and rareness. We point out that intense bursts whose non-detection thus far are due to the latter can be detected in the near future with existing and planned facilities. In particular, we propose that, with slight experimental adjustments and suitable data analyses, imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs) and Pulsed All-sky Near-infrared and Optical Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence (PANOSETI) are promising tools for detecting such rare, brief, but intense bursts. We also show that if we assume these bursts originate from collisions of dark matter states, IACTs and PANOSETI can probe a large dark matter parameter space beyond existing limits. Additionally, we present a concrete model of dark matter that produces bursts potentially detectable in these instruments.</description>

      <title>A physically modelled selection function for compact binary mergers in the LIGO-Virgo O3 run and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13383v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the observation of nearly 100 compact binary coalescence (CBC) events up to the end of the Advanced gravitational-wave (GW) detectors' third observing run (O3), there remain fundamental open questions regarding their astrophysical formation mechanisms and environments. Population analysis should yield insights into these questions, but requires careful control of uncertainties and biases. GW observations have a strong selection bias: this is due first to the dependence of the signal amplitude on the source's (intrinsic and extrinsic) parameters, and second to the complicated nature of detector noise and of current detection methods. In this work, we introduce a new physically-motivated model of the sensitivity of GW searches for CBC events, aimed at enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of population reconstructions. In contrast to current methods which rely on re-weighting simulated signals (injections) via importance sampling, we model the probability of detection of binary black hole (BBH) mergers as a smooth, analytic function of source masses, orbit-aligned spins, and distance, fitted to accurately match injection results. The estimate can thus be used for population models whose signal distribution over parameter space differs significantly from the injection distribution. Our method has already been used in population studies such as reconstructing the BBH merger rate dependence on redshift.</description>

      <title>Gravitational and electromagnetic Cherenkov radiation constraints in modified dispersion relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18544v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by different approaches to quantum gravity, one could consider that Lorentz invariance is not an exact symmetry of nature at all energy scales. Following this spirit, modified dispersion relations have been used to encapsulate quantum gravity phenomenology. In the present work, we propose a class of Lorentz invariance violating phenomenological dispersion relations, which could be different for each particle species, to study the generalized vacuum Cherenkov radiation process. We identify the kinematic regions where the process is allowed and then compute the energy loss rate due to the emission of vacuum electromagnetic and gravitational Cherenkov radiation. Furthermore, we estimate constraints for the Lorentz invariance breaking parameters of protons and gravitons taking into account the existence (or absence) of vacuum gravitational Cherenkov radiation using ultra high energy cosmic ray detections.</description>

      <title>The formation and stability of a cold disc made out of stellar winds in the Galactic Centre</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00100v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The reported discovery of a cold (~10$^4$ K) disc-like structure within 0.005 pc around the super-massive black hole at the centre of the Milky Way, Sgr A*, has challenged our understanding of the gas dynamics and thermodynamic state of the plasma in its immediate vicinity. State-of-the-art simulations do not agree on whether or not such a disc can be a product of the multiple stellar wind interactions of the mass-losing stars in the region. This study aims to constrain the conditions for the formation of a cold disc as a natural outcome of the system of the mass-losing stars orbiting around Sgr A*, to investigate whether the disc is a transient or long-lasting structure, and to assess the validity of the model through direct comparisons with observations. We performed a set of hydrodynamic simulations of the observed Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars feeding Sgr A* using the finite-volume adaptive mesh refinement code Ramses. We focus, for the first time, on the impact of the chemical composition of the plasma emanating from the WR stars. The simulations show that the chemical composition of the plasma affects the radiative cooling enough to impact the properties of the medium, such as density and temperature, and, as a consequence, the rate at which the material inflows onto Sgr A*. We demonstrate that the formation of a cold disc from the stellar winds is possible for certain chemical compositions that are consistent with the current observational constraints. However, even in such cases, it is not possible to reproduce the reported properties of the observed disc-like structure, namely its inclination and the fluxes of its hydrogen recombination lines. We conclude that the stellar winds alone are not sufficient to form the cold disc around Sgr A* inferred from observations. Either relevant ingredients are still missing in the model, or the interpretation of the observed data needs to be revised.</description>

      <title>Cosmology with Binary Neutron Stars: Does Mass-Redshift Correlation Matter?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02494v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Next-generation gravitational wave detectors are expected to detect millions of compact binary mergers across cosmological distances. The features of the mass distribution of these mergers, combined with gravitational wave distance measurements, will enable precise cosmological inferences, even without the need for electromagnetic counterparts. However, achieving accurate results requires modeling the mass spectrum, particularly considering possible redshift evolution. Binary neutron star (BNS) mergers are thought to be less influenced by changes in metallicity compared to binary black holes (BBH) or neutron star-black hole (NSBH) mergers. This stability in their mass spectrum over cosmic time reduces the chances of introducing biases in cosmological parameters caused by redshift evolution. In this study, we use the population synthesis code COMPAS to generate astrophysically motivated catalogs of BNS mergers and explore whether assuming a non-evolving BNS mass distribution with redshift could introduce biases in cosmological parameter inference. Our findings show that despite significant variations in the BNS mass distribution across binary physics assumptions and initial conditions in COMPAS, the joint mass-redshift population can be expressed as the product of the mass distribution marginalized over redshift and the redshift distribution marginalized over masses. This enables a 2% unbiased constraint on the Hubble constant - sufficient to address the Hubble tension. Additionally, we show that in the fiducial COMPAS setup, the bias from a non-evolving BNS mass model is less than 0.5% for the Hubble parameter measured at redshift 0.4. These results establish BNS mergers as strong candidates for spectral siren cosmology in the era of next-generation gravitational wave detectors.</description>

      <title>How neutron star properties disfavor a nuclear chiral density wave</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08023v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cold and dense matter may break rotational symmetry spontaneously and thus form an anisotropic phase in the interior of neutron stars. We consider the concrete example of an anisotropic chiral condensate in the form of a chiral density wave. Employing a nucleon-meson model and taking into account fermionic vacuum fluctuations, we improve and extend previous results by imposing the conditions of electric charge neutrality and electroweak equilibrium, by allowing for a more general form of the vector meson self-interactions, and by including properties of pure neutron matter into the fit of the model parameters. We find that the conditions inside neutron stars postpone the onset of the chiral density wave to larger densities compared to isospin-symmetric nuclear matter. While this still allows for the construction of stars with an anisotropic core, we find that the chiral density wave is energetically preferred only in a corner of the parameter space where matter is too soft to generate stars with realistic masses. Therefore, taking into account constraints from astrophysical data, our calculation predicts an isotropic neutron star core.</description>

      <title>Impacts of UV Radiation from an AGN on Planetary Atmospheres and Consequences for Galactic Habitability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15341v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a study of the effects of ultraviolet (UV) emission from active galactic nuclei (AGN) on the atmospheric composition of planets and potential impact on life. It is expected that all supermassive black holes, which reside at galactic centers, have gone through periods of high AGN activity in order to reach their current masses. We examine potential damaging effects on lifeforms on planets with different atmosphere types and receiving different levels of AGN flux, using data on the sensitivity of various species' cells to UV radiation to determine when radiation becomes "dangerous". We also consider potential chemical changes to planetary atmospheres as a result of UV radiation from AGN, using the PALEO photochemical model. We find the presence of sufficient initial oxygen (surface mixing ratio $\geq 10^{-3} \rm\, mol/mol$) in the planet's atmosphere allows a thicker ozone layer to form in response to AGN radiation, which reduces the level of dangerous UV radiation incident on the planetary surface from what it was in absence of an AGN. We estimate the fraction of solar systems in galaxies that would be affected by AGN UV radiation, and find that the impact is most pronounced in compact galaxies such as "red nugget relics", as compared to typical present-day ellipticals and spirals (using M87 and the Milky Way as examples).</description>

      <title>X-ray/Radio Quasi-periodic Pulsations Associated with Plasmoids in Solar Flare Current Sheets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05193v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Plasmoids (or magnetic islands) are believed to play an important role in the onset of fast magnetic reconnection and particle acceleration during solar flares and eruptions. Direct imaging of flare current sheets and formation/ejection of multiple plasmoids in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) images, along with simultaneous X-ray and radio observations, offers significant insights into the mechanisms driving particle acceleration in solar flares. Here we present direct imaging of the formation and ejection of multiple plasmoids in flare plasma/current sheets and associated quasi-periodic pulsations (QPPs) observed in X-ray and radio wavelengths, using observations from SDO/AIA, RHESSI, and Fermi GBM. These plasmoids propagate bidirectionally upward and downward along the flare current sheet beneath the erupting flux rope during two successive flares associated with confined/failed eruptions. The flux rope exhibits evidence of helical kink instability with formation and ejection of multiple plasmoids in the flare current sheet, as predicted in an MHD simulation of a kink-unstable flux rope. RHESSI X-ray images show double coronal sources (``loop-top" and higher coronal sources) located at both ends of the flare current/plasma sheet. Moreover, we detected an additional transient faint X-ray source (6-12 keV) located between the double coronal sources, which was co-spatial with multiple plasmoids in the flare current sheet. X-ray (soft and hard) and radio (decimetric) observations unveil QPPs (periods$\approx$10-s and 100-s) associated with the ejection and coalescence of plasmoids. These observations suggest that energetic electrons are accelerated during the ejection and coalescence of multiple plasmoids in the flare current sheet.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Mechanisms of Electron Energy Spectrum Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09016v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The electron spectrum exhibits a complex structure and has controversially proposed origins. This work reproduce the evolution of the electron spectrum based on a spatially dependent propagation (SDP) model. The key point is that our SPD model features two diffusion regions leading to two diffusion timescales, competing with the cooling timescale. This results in a three-segment power-law electron spectrum: (1) The spectrum below tens of GeV is primarily influenced by cooling effects from distant sources. (2) The spectrum dominated by diffusion effects from nearby sources from tens of GeV to TeV. (3) The spectrum above TeV, which is predominantly governed by cooling effects from nearby sources. This evolution is unique to the SDP model, and we offer a comprehensive and clear depiction of electron evolution under a single propagation scenario for the first time.</description>
