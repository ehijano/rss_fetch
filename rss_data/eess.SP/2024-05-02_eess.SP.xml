      <title>Low-cost modular devices for on-road vehicle detection and characterisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting and characterising vehicles is one of the purposes of embedded systems used in intelligent environments. An analysis of a vehicle characteristics can reveal inappropriate or dangerous behaviour. This detection makes it possible to sanction or notify emergency services to take early and practical actions. Vehicle detection and characterisation systems employ complex sensors such as video cameras, especially in urban environments. These sensors provide high precision and performance, although the price and computational requirements are proportional to their accuracy. These sensors offer high accuracy, but the price and computational requirements are directly proportional to their performance. This article introduces a system based on modular devices that is economical and has a low computational cost. These devices use ultrasonic sensors to detect the speed and length of vehicles. The measurement accuracy is improved through the collaboration of the device modules. The experiments were performed using multiple modules oriented to different angles. This module is coupled with another specifically designed to detect distance using previous modules speed and length data. The collaboration between different modules reduces the speed relative error ranges from 1 to 5, depending on the angle configuration used in the modules.</description>

      <title>Delay and Overhead Efficient Transmission Scheduling for Federated Learning in UAV Swarms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the wireless scheduling design to coordinate the transmissions of (local) model parameters of federated learning (FL) for a swarm of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The overall goal of the proposed design is to realize the FL training and aggregation processes with a central aggregator exploiting the sensory data collected by the UAVs but it considers the multi-hop wireless network formed by the UAVs. Such transmissions of model parameters over the UAV-based wireless network potentially cause large transmission delays and overhead. Our proposed framework smartly aggregates local model parameters trained by the UAVs while efficiently transmitting the underlying parameters to the central aggregator in each FL global round. We theoretically show that the proposed scheme achieves minimal delay and communication overhead. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed scheme compared to other baselines.</description>

      <title>SynthBrainGrow: Synthetic Diffusion Brain Aging for Longitudinal MRI Data Generation in Young People</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synthetic longitudinal brain MRI simulates brain aging and would enable more efficient research on neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative conditions. Synthetically generated, age-adjusted brain images could serve as valuable alternatives to costly longitudinal imaging acquisitions, serve as internal controls for studies looking at the effects of environmental or therapeutic modifiers on brain development, and allow data augmentation for diverse populations. In this paper, we present a diffusion-based approach called SynthBrainGrow for synthetic brain aging with a two-year step. To validate the feasibility of using synthetically-generated data on downstream tasks, we compared structural volumetrics of two-year-aged brains against synthetically-aged brain MRI. Results show that SynthBrainGrow can accurately capture substructure volumetrics and simulate structural changes such as ventricle enlargement and cortical thinning. Our approach provides a novel way to generate longitudinal brain datasets from cross-sectional data to enable augmented training and benchmarking of computational tools for analyzing lifespan trajectories. This work signifies an important advance in generative modeling to synthesize realistic longitudinal data with limited lifelong MRI scans. The code is available at XXX.</description>

      <title>SoK: Behind the Accuracy of Complex Human Activity Recognition Using Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is a well-studied field with research dating back to the 1980s. Over time, HAR technologies have evolved significantly from manual feature extraction, rule-based algorithms, and simple machine learning models to powerful deep learning models, from one sensor type to a diverse array of sensing modalities. The scope has also expanded from recognising a limited set of activities to encompassing a larger variety of both simple and complex activities. However, there still exist many challenges that hinder advancement in complex activity recognition using modern deep learning methods. In this paper, we comprehensively systematise factors leading to inaccuracy in complex HAR, such as data variety and model capacity. Among many sensor types, we give more attention to wearable and camera due to their prevalence. Through this Systematisation of Knowledge (SoK) paper, readers can gain a solid understanding of the development history and existing challenges of HAR, different categorisations of activities, obstacles in deep learning-based complex HAR that impact accuracy, and potential research directions.</description>

      <title>Multi-Band mm-Wave Measurement Platform Towards Environment-Aware Beam Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Agile beam management is key for providing seamless millimeter wave (mm-wave) connectivity given the site-specific spatio-temporal variations of the mm-wave channel. Leveraging non radio frequency (RF) sensor inputs for environment awareness, e.g. via machine learning (ML) techniques, can greatly enhance RF-based beam steering. To overcome the lack of diverse publicly available multi-modal mm-wave datasets for the design and evaluation of such novel beam steering approaches, we demonstrate our software-defined radio multi-band mm-wave measurement platform which integrates multi-modal sensors towards environment-aware beam management.</description>

      <title>EEG-Deformer: A Dense Convolutional Transformer for Brain-computer Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effectively learning the temporal dynamics in electroencephalogram (EEG) signals is challenging yet essential for decoding brain activities using brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). Although Transformers are popular for their long-term sequential learning ability in the BCI field, most methods combining Transformers with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) fail to capture the coarse-to-fine temporal dynamics of EEG signals. To overcome this limitation, we introduce EEG-Deformer, which incorporates two main novel components into a CNN-Transformer: (1) a Hierarchical Coarse-to-Fine Transformer (HCT) block that integrates a Fine-grained Temporal Learning (FTL) branch into Transformers, effectively discerning coarse-to-fine temporal patterns; and (2) a Dense Information Purification (DIP) module, which utilizes multi-level, purified temporal information to enhance decoding accuracy. Comprehensive experiments on three representative cognitive tasks consistently verify the generalizability of our proposed EEG-Deformer, demonstrating that it either outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods or is comparable to them. Visualization results show that EEG-Deformer learns from neurophysiologically meaningful brain regions for the corresponding cognitive tasks.

      <title>Optimizing Brain-Computer Interface Performance: Advancing EEG Signals Channel Selection through Regularized CSP and SPEA II Multi-Objective Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brain-computer interface systems and the recording of brain activity has garnered significant attention across a diverse spectrum of applications. EEG signals have emerged as a modality for recording neural electrical activity. Among the methodologies designed for feature extraction from EEG data, the method of RCSP has proven to be an approach, particularly in the context of MI tasks. RCSP exhibits efficacy in the discrimination and classification of EEG signals. In optimizing the performance of this method, our research extends to a comparative analysis with conventional CSP techniques, as well as optimized methodologies designed for similar applications. Notably, we employ the meta-heuristic multi-objective Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm II (SPEA-II) as a pivotal component of our research paradigm. This is a state-of-the-art approach in the selection of an subset of channels from a multichannel EEG signal with MI tasks. Our main objective is to formulate an optimum channel selection strategy aimed at identifying the most pertinent subset of channels from the multi-dimensional electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. One of the primary objectives inherent to channel selection in the EEG signal analysis pertains to the reduction of the channel count, an approach that enhances user comfort when utilizing gel-based EEG electrodes. Additionally, within this research, we took benefit of ensemble learning models as a component of our decision-making. This technique serves to mitigate the challenges associated with overfitting, especially when confronted with an extensive array of potentially redundant EEG channels and data noise. Our findings not only affirm the performance of RCSP in MI-based BCI systems, but also underscore the significance of channel selection strategies and ensemble learning techniques in optimizing the performance of EEG signal classification.</description>

      <title>EEG_RL-Net: Enhancing EEG MI Classification through Reinforcement Learning-Optimised Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) rely on accurately decoding electroencephalography (EEG) motor imagery (MI) signals for effective device control. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) outperform Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in this regard, by leveraging the spatial relationships between EEG electrodes through adjacency matrices. The EEG_GLT-Net framework, featuring the state-of-the-art EEG_GLT adjacency matrix method, has notably enhanced EEG MI signal classification, evidenced by an average accuracy of 83.95% across 20 subjects on the PhysioNet dataset. This significantly exceeds the 76.10% accuracy rate achieved using the Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) method within the same framework.
  In this research, we advance the field by applying a Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach to the classification of EEG MI signals. Our innovative method empowers the RL agent, enabling not only the classification of EEG MI data points with higher accuracy, but effective identification of EEG MI data points that are less distinct. We present the EEG_RL-Net, an enhancement of the EEG_GLT-Net framework, which incorporates the trained EEG GCN Block from EEG_GLT-Net at an adjacency matrix density of 13.39% alongside the RL-centric Dueling Deep Q Network (Dueling DQN) block. The EEG_RL-Net model showcases exceptional classification performance, achieving an unprecedented average accuracy of 96.40% across 20 subjects within 25 milliseconds. This model illustrates the transformative effect of the RL in EEG MI time point classification.</description>

      <title>Baseline Drift Tolerant Signal Encoding for ECG Classification with Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Common artefacts such as baseline drift, rescaling, and noise critically limit the performance of machine learningbased automated ECG analysis and interpretation. This study proposes Derived Peak (DP) encoding, a non-parametric method that generates signed spikes corresponding to zero crossings of the signals first and second-order time derivatives. Notably, DP encoding is invariant to shift and scaling artefacts, and its implementation is further simplified by the absence of userdefined parameters. DP encoding was used to encode the 12-lead ECG data from the PTB-XL dataset (n=18,869 participants) and was fed to 1D-ResNet-18 models trained to identify myocardial infarction, conductive deficits and ST-segment abnormalities. Robustness to artefacts was assessed by corrupting ECG data with sinusoidal baseline drift, shift, rescaling and noise, before encoding. The addition of these artefacts resulted in a significant drop in accuracy for seven other methods from prior art, while DP encoding maintained a baseline AUC of 0.88 under drift, shift and rescaling. DP achieved superior performance to unencoded inputs in the presence of shift (AUC under 1mV shift: 0.91 vs 0.62), and rescaling artefacts (AUC 0.91 vs 0.79). Thus, DP encoding is a simple method by which robustness to common ECG artefacts may be improved for automated ECG analysis and interpretation.</description>

      <title>Federated Learning and Differential Privacy Techniques on Multi-hospital Population-scale Electrocardiogram Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research paper explores ways to apply Federated Learning (FL) and Differential Privacy (DP) techniques to population-scale Electrocardiogram (ECG) data. The study learns a multi-label ECG classification model using FL and DP based on 1,565,849 ECG tracings from 7 hospitals in Alberta, Canada. The FL approach allowed collaborative model training without sharing raw data between hospitals while building robust ECG classification models for diagnosing various cardiac conditions. These accurate ECG classification models can facilitate the diagnoses while preserving patient confidentiality using FL and DP techniques. Our results show that the performance achieved using our implementation of the FL approach is comparable to that of the pooled approach, where the model is trained over the aggregating data from all hospitals. Furthermore, our findings suggest that hospitals with limited ECGs for training can benefit from adopting the FL model compared to single-site training. In addition, this study showcases the trade-off between model performance and data privacy by employing DP during model training. Our code is available at https://github.com/vikhyatt/Hospital-FL-DP.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The conversion of brain activity into text using electroencephalography (EEG) has gained significant traction in recent years. Many researchers are working to develop new models to decode EEG signals into text form. Although this area has shown promising developments, it still faces numerous challenges that necessitate further improvement. It's important to outline this area's recent developments and future research directions. In this review article, we thoroughly summarize the progress in EEG-to-text conversion. Firstly, we talk about how EEG-to-text technology has grown and what problems we still face. Secondly, we discuss existing techniques used in this field. This includes methods for collecting EEG data, the steps to process these signals, and the development of systems capable of translating these signals into coherent text. We conclude with potential future research directions, emphasizing the need for enhanced accuracy, reduced system constraints, and the exploration of novel applications across varied sectors. By addressing these aspects, this review aims to contribute to developing more accessible and effective Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) technology for a broader user base.</description>

      <title>Generalised envelope spectrum-based signal-to-noise objectives: Formulation, optimisation and application for gear fault detection under time-varying speed conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In vibration-based condition monitoring, optimal filter design improves fault detection by enhancing weak fault signatures within vibration signals. This process involves optimising a derived objective function from a defined objective. The objectives are often based on proxy health indicators to determine the filter's parameters. However, these indicators can be compromised by irrelevant extraneous signal components and fluctuating operational conditions, affecting the filter's efficacy. Fault detection primarily uses the fault component's prominence in the squared envelope spectrum, quantified by a squared envelope spectrum-based signal-to-noise ratio. New optimal filter objective functions are derived from the proposed generalised envelope spectrum-based signal-to-noise objective for machines operating under variable speed conditions. Instead of optimising proxy health indicators, the optimal filter coefficients of the formulation directly maximise the squared envelope spectrum-based signal-to-noise ratio over targeted frequency bands using standard gradient-based optimisers. Four derived objective functions from the proposed objective effectively outperform five prominent methods in tests on three experimental datasets.</description>

      <title>Joint ADS-B in 5G for Hierarchical Aerial Networks: Performance Analysis and Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are widely applied in multiple fields, which emphasizes the challenge of obtaining UAV flight information to ensure the airspace safety. UAVs equipped with automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B) devices are capable of sending flight information to nearby aircrafts and ground stations (GSs). However, the saturation of limited frequency bands of ADS-B leads to interferences among UAVs and impairs the monitoring performance of GS to civil planes. To address this issue, the integration of the 5th generation mobile communication technology (5G) with ADS-B is proposed for UAV operations in this paper. Specifically, a hierarchical structure is proposed, in which the high-altitude central UAV is equipped with ADS-B and the low-altitude central UAV utilizes 5G modules to transmit flight information. Meanwhile, based on the mobile edge computing technique, the flight information of sub-UAVs is offloaded to the central UAV for further processing, and then transmitted to GS. We present the deterministic model and stochastic geometry based model to build the air-to-ground channel and air-to-air channel, respectively. The effectiveness of the proposed monitoring system is verified via simulations and experiments. This research contributes to improving the airspace safety and advancing the air traffic flow management.</description>

      <title>EEG-MACS: Manifold Attention and Confidence Stratification for EEG-based Cross-Center Brain Disease Diagnosis under Unreliable Annotations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cross-center data heterogeneity and annotation unreliability significantly challenge the intelligent diagnosis of diseases using brain signals. A notable example is the EEG-based diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases, which features subtler abnormal neural dynamics typically observed in small-group settings. To advance this area, in this work, we introduce a transferable framework employing Manifold Attention and Confidence Stratification (MACS) to diagnose neurodegenerative disorders based on EEG signals sourced from four centers with unreliable annotations. The MACS framework's effectiveness stems from these features: 1) The Augmentor generates various EEG-represented brain variants to enrich the data space; 2) The Switcher enhances the feature space for trusted samples and reduces overfitting on incorrectly labeled samples; 3) The Encoder uses the Riemannian manifold and Euclidean metrics to capture spatiotemporal variations and dynamic synchronization in EEG; 4) The Projector, equipped with dual heads, monitors consistency across multiple brain variants and ensures diagnostic accuracy; 5) The Stratifier adaptively stratifies learned samples by confidence levels throughout the training process; 6) Forward and backpropagation in MACS are constrained by confidence stratification to stabilize the learning system amid unreliable annotations. Our subject-independent experiments, conducted on both neurocognitive and movement disorders using cross-center corpora, have demonstrated superior performance compared to existing related algorithms. This work not only improves EEG-based diagnostics for cross-center and small-setting brain diseases but also offers insights into extending MACS techniques to other data analyses, tackling data heterogeneity and annotation unreliability in multimedia and multimodal content understanding.</description>

      <title>Joint Signal Detection and Automatic Modulation Classification via Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Signal detection and modulation classification are two crucial tasks in various wireless communication systems. Different from prior works that investigate them independently, this paper studies the joint signal detection and automatic modulation classification (AMC) by considering a realistic and complex scenario, in which multiple signals with different modulation schemes coexist at different carrier frequencies. We first generate a coexisting RADIOML dataset (CRML23) to facilitate the joint design. Different from the publicly available AMC dataset ignoring the signal detection step and containing only one signal, our synthetic dataset covers the more realistic multiple-signal coexisting scenario. Then, we present a joint framework for detection and classification (JDM) for such a multiple-signal coexisting environment, which consists of two modules for signal detection and AMC, respectively. In particular, these two modules are interconnected using a designated data structure called "proposal". Finally, we conduct extensive simulations over the newly developed dataset, which demonstrate the effectiveness of our designs. Our code and dataset are now available as open-source (https://github.com/Singingkettle/ChangShuoRadioData).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parkinson's disease is a widespread neurodegenerative condition necessitating early diagnosis for effective intervention. This paper introduces an innovative method for diagnosing Parkinson's disease through the analysis of human EEG signals, employing a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification model. this research presents novel contributions to enhance diagnostic accuracy and reliability. Our approach incorporates a comprehensive review of EEG signal analysis techniques and machine learning methods. Drawing from recent studies, we have engineered an advanced SVM-based model optimized for Parkinson's disease diagnosis. Utilizing cutting-edge feature engineering, extensive hyperparameter tuning, and kernel selection, our method achieves not only heightened diagnostic accuracy but also emphasizes model interpretability, catering to both clinicians and researchers. Moreover, ethical concerns in healthcare machine learning, such as data privacy and biases, are conscientiously addressed. We assess our method's performance through experiments on a diverse dataset comprising EEG recordings from Parkinson's disease patients and healthy controls, demonstrating significantly improved diagnostic accuracy compared to conventional techniques. In conclusion, this paper introduces an innovative SVM-based approach for diagnosing Parkinson's disease from human EEG signals. Building upon the IEEE framework and previous research, its novelty lies in the capacity to enhance diagnostic accuracy while upholding interpretability and ethical considerations for practical healthcare applications.

      <title>Modelling the nanopore sequencing process with Helicase HMMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in nanopore sequencing technology, particularly the R10 nanopore from Oxford Nanopore Technology, have necessitated the development of improved data processing methods to utilize their potential for more than 9-mer resolution fully. The processing of the ion currents predominantly utilizes neural network-based methods known for their high basecalling accuracy but face developmental bottlenecks at higher resolutions. In light of this, we introduce the Helicase Hidden Markov Model (HHMM), a novel framework designed to incorporate the dynamics of the helicase motor protein alongside the nucleotide sequence during nanopore sequencing. This model supports the analysis of millions of distinct states, enhancing our understanding of raw ion currents and their alignment with nucleotide sequences. Our findings demonstrate the utility of HHMM not only as a potent visualization tool but also as an effective base for developing advanced basecalling algorithms. This approach offers a promising avenue for leveraging the full capabilities of emerging high-resolution nanopore sequencing technologies.</description>

      <title>On the Role of Reflectarrays for Interplanetary Links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interplanetary links (IPL) serve as crucial enablers for space exploration, facilitating secure and adaptable space missions. An integrated IPL with inter-satellite communication (IP-ISL) establishes a unified deep space network, expanding coverage and reducing atmospheric losses. The challenges, including irregularities in charged density, hardware impairments, and hidden celestial body brightness are analyzed with a reflectarray-based IP-ISL between Earth and Moon orbiters. It is observed that $10^{-8}$ order severe hardware impairments with intense solar plasma density drops an ideal system's spectral efficiency (SE) from $\sim\!38~\textrm{(bit/s)/Hz}$ down to $0~\textrm{(bit/s)/Hz}$. An ideal full angle of arrival fluctuation recovery with full steering range achieves $\sim\!20~\textrm{(bit/s)/Hz}$ gain and a limited beamsteering with a numerical reflectarray design achieves at least $\sim\!1~\textrm{(bit/s)/Hz}$ gain in severe hardware impairment cases.</description>

      <title>Experimental Evaluation of Moving Target Compensation in High Time-Bandwidth Noise Radar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, the effect a moving target has on the signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) for high time-bandwidth noise radars is investigated. To compensate for cell migration we apply a computationally efficient stretch processing algorithm that is tailored for batched processing and suitable for implementation onto a real-time radar processor. The performance of the algorithm is studied using experimental data. In the experiment, pseudorandom noise, with a bandwidth of 100 MHz, is generated and transmitted in real-time. An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), flown at a speed of 11 m/s, is acting as a target. For an integration time of 1 s, the algorithm is shown to yield an increase in SINR of roughly 13 dB, compared to no compensation. It is also shown that coherent integration times of 2.5 s can be achieved.</description>

      <title>Exponentially Consistent Outlier Hypothesis Testing for Continuous Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In outlier hypothesis testing, one aims to detect outlying sequences among a given set of sequences, where most sequences are generated i.i.d. from a nominal distribution while outlying sequences (outliers) are generated i.i.d. from a different anomalous distribution. Most existing studies focus on discrete-valued sequences, where each data sample takes values in a finite set. To account for practical scenarios where data sequences usually take real values, we study outlier hypothesis testing for continuous sequences when both the nominal and anomalous distributions are \emph{unknown}. Specifically, we propose distribution free tests and prove that the probabilities of misclassification error, false reject and false alarm decay exponentially fast for three different test designs: fixed-length test, sequential test, and two-phase test. In a fixed-length test, one fixes the sample size of each observed sequence; in a sequential test, one takes a sample sequentially from each sequence per unit time until a reliable decision can be made; in a two-phase test, one adapts the sample size from two different fixed values. Remarkably, the two-phase test achieves a good balance between test design complexity and theoretical performance. We first consider the case of at most one outlier, and then generalize our results to the case with multiple outliers where the number of outliers is unknown.</description>

      <title>Optimal Beamforming for Bistatic MIMO Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers the beamforming optimization for sensing a point-like scatterer using a bistatic multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) radar, which could be part of a joint communication and sensing system. The goal is to minimize the Cram\'er-Rao bound on the target position's estimation error, where the radar already knows an approximate position that is taken into account in the optimization. The optimization allows for beamforming with more than one beam per subcarrier. Optimal solutions for the beamforming are discussed for known and unknown channel gain. Numerical results show that beamforming with at most one beam per subcarrier is optimal for certain parameters, but for other parameters, optimal solutions need two beams on some subcarriers. In addition, the degree of freedom in selecting which end of the bistatic radar should transmit and receive is considered.</description>

      <title>Misspecification of Multiple Scattering in Scalar Wave Fields and its Impact in Ultrasound Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the localization of targets in the presence of multiple scattering. We focus on the often omitted scenario in which measurement data is affected by multiple scattering, and a simpler model is employed in the estimation. We study the impact of such model mismatch by means of the Misspecified Cram\'er-Rao Bound (MCRB). In numerical simulations inspired by tomographic inspection in ultrasound nondestructive testing, the MCRB is shown to correctly describe the estimation variance of localization parameters under misspecification of the wave propagation model. We provide extensive discussion on the utility of the MCRB in the practical task of verifying whether a chosen misspecified model is suitable for localization based on the properties of the maximum likelihood estimator and the nuanced distinction between bias and parameter space differences. Finally, we highlight that careful interpretation is needed whenever employing the classical CRB in the presence of mismatch through numerical examples based on the Born approximation and other simplified propagation models stemming from it.</description>

      <title>Joint Sequential Fronthaul Quantization and Hardware Complexity Reduction in Uplink Cell-Free Massive MIMO Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fronthaul quantization causes a significant distortion in cell-free massive MIMO networks. Due to the limited capacity of fronthaul links, information exchange among access points (APs) must be quantized significantly. Furthermore, the complexity of the multiplication operation in the base-band processing unit increases with the number of bits of the operands. Thus, quantizing the APs' signal vector reduces the complexity of signal estimation in the base-band processing unit. Most recent works consider the direct quantization of the received signal vectors at each AP without any pre-processing. However, the signal vectors received at different APs are correlated mutually (inter-AP correlation) and also have correlated dimensions (intra-AP correlation). Hence, cooperative quantization of APs fronthaul can help to efficiently use the quantization bits at each AP and further reduce the distortion imposed on the quantized vector at the APs. This paper considers a daisy chain fronthaul and three different processing sequences at each AP. We show that 1) de-correlating the received signal vector at each AP from the corresponding vectors of the previous APs (inter-AP de-correlation) and 2) de-correlating the dimensions of the received signal vector at each AP (intra-AP de-correlation) before quantization helps to use the quantization bits at each AP more efficiently than directly quantizing the received signal vector without any pre-processing and consequently, improves the bit error rate (BER) and normalized mean square error (NMSE) of users signal estimation.</description>

      <title>Propagation measurements and channel models in Indoor Environment at 6.75 GHz FR1(C) and 16.95 GHz FR3 Upper-mid band Spectrum for 5G and 6G</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: New spectrum allocations in the 4--8 GHz FR1(C) and 7--24 GHz FR3 mid-band frequency spectrum are being considered for 5G/6G cellular deployments. This paper presents results from the world's first comprehensive indoor hotspot (InH) propagation measurement campaign at 6.75 GHz and 16.95 GHz in the NYU WIRELESS Research Center using a 1 GHz wideband channel sounder system over distances from 11 to 97 m in line-of-sight (LOS) and non-LOS (NLOS). Analysis of directional and omnidirectional path loss (PL) using the close-in free space 1 m reference distance model shows a familiar waveguiding effect in LOS with an omnidirectional path loss exponent (PLE) of 1.40 at 6.75 GHz and 1.32 at 16.95 GHz. Compared to mmWave frequencies, the directional NLOS PLEs are lower at FR3 and FR1(C), while omnidirectional NLOS PLEs are similar, suggesting better propagation distances at lower frequencies for links with omnidirectional antennas at both ends of the links, but also, importantly, showing that higher gain antennas will offer better coverage at higher frequencies when antenna apertures are kept same over all frequencies. Comparison of the omnidirectional and directional RMS delay spread (DS) at FR1(C) and FR3 with mmWave frequencies indicates a clear decrease with increasing frequency. The mean spatial lobe and omnidirectional RMS angular spread (AS) is found to be wider at 6.75 GHz compared to 16.95 GHz indicating more multipath components are found in the azimuthal spatial domain at lower frequencies.</description>

      <title>Wideband Penetration Loss through Building Materials and Partitions at 6.75 GHz in FR1(C) and 16.95 GHz in the FR3 Upper Mid-band spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 4--8 GHz FR1(C) and 7--24 GHz upper mid-band FR3 spectrum are promising new 6G spectrum allocations being considered by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) and major governments around the world. There is an urgent need to understand the propagation behavior and radio coverage, outage, and material penetration for the global mobile wireless industry in both indoor and outdoor environments in these emerging frequency bands. This work presents measurements and models that describe the penetration loss in co-polarized and cross-polarized antenna configurations, exhibited by common materials found inside buildings and on building perimeters, including concrete, low-emissivity glass, wood, doors, drywall, and whiteboard at 6.75 GHz and 16.95 GHz. Measurement results show consistent lower penetration loss at 6.75 GHz compared to 16.95 GHz for all ten materials measured for co and cross-polarized antennas at incidence. For instance, the low-emissivity glass wall presents 33.7 dB loss at 6.75 GHz, while presenting 42.3 dB loss at 16.95 GHz. Penetration loss at these frequencies is contrasted with measurements at sub-6 GHz, mmWave and sub-THz frequencies along with 3GPP material penetration loss models. The results provide critical knowledge for future 5G and 6G cellular system deployments as well as refinements for the 3GPP material penetration models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Digital phased arrays have often been disregarded for millimeter-wave communications since the analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) are power-hungry. In this paper, we provide a different perspective on this matter by demonstrating analytically and numerically how the ADC resolution can be reduced when using digital phased arrays. We perform a theoretical analysis of the quantization noise characteristics for an OFDM signal received and processed by a digital phased array, using Gaussian approximation of the OFDM signal. In particular, we quantify the quantization noise suppression factor analytically and numerically. This factor describes how much the coherent combining reduces the quantization noise as a function of the number of antennas, which allows for reducing the ADC bit resolution. For instance in a 8-16 antenna digital phased array the ADC resolution can be reduced with 1-2 bits compared to the ADC required for an analog phased array.</description>

      <title>Locality Regularized Reconstruction: Structured Sparsity and Delaunay Triangulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Linear representation learning is widely studied due to its conceptual simplicity and empirical utility in tasks such as compression, classification, and feature extraction. Given a set of points $[\mathbf{x}_1, \mathbf{x}_2, \ldots, \mathbf{x}_n] = \mathbf{X} \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times n}$ and a vector $\mathbf{y} \in \mathbb{R}^d$, the goal is to find coefficients $\mathbf{w} \in \mathbb{R}^n$ so that $\mathbf{X} \mathbf{w} \approx \mathbf{y}$, subject to some desired structure on $\mathbf{w}$. In this work we seek $\mathbf{w}$ that forms a local reconstruction of $\mathbf{y}$ by solving a regularized least squares regression problem. We obtain local solutions through a locality function that promotes the use of columns of $\mathbf{X}$ that are close to $\mathbf{y}$ when used as a regularization term. We prove that, for all levels of regularization and under a mild condition that the columns of $\mathbf{X}$ have a unique Delaunay triangulation, the optimal coefficients' number of non-zero entries is upper bounded by $d+1$, thereby providing local sparse solutions when $d \ll n$. Under the same condition we also show that for any $\mathbf{y}$ contained in the convex hull of $\mathbf{X}$ there exists a regime of regularization parameter such that the optimal coefficients are supported on the vertices of the Delaunay simplex containing $\mathbf{y}$. This provides an interpretation of the sparsity as having structure obtained implicitly from the Delaunay triangulation of $\mathbf{X}$. We demonstrate that our locality regularized problem can be solved in comparable time to other methods that identify the containing Delaunay simplex.</description>

      <title>Quickest Change Detection with Confusing Change</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the problem of quickest change detection (QCD), a change occurs at some unknown time in the distribution of a sequence of independent observations. This work studies a QCD problem where the change is either a bad change, which we aim to detect, or a confusing change, which is not of our interest. Our objective is to detect a bad change as quickly as possible while avoiding raising a false alarm for pre-change or a confusing change. We identify a specific set of pre-change, bad change, and confusing change distributions that pose challenges beyond the capabilities of standard Cumulative Sum (CuSum) procedures. Proposing novel CuSum-based detection procedures, S-CuSum and J-CuSum, leveraging two CuSum statistics, we offer solutions applicable across all kinds of pre-change, bad change, and confusing change distributions. For both S-CuSum and J-CuSum, we provide analytical performance guarantees and validate them by numerical results. Furthermore, both procedures are computationally efficient as they only require simple recursive updates.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the ideal peak-to-average-power ratio and radar sensing capability of traditional frequency-coded radar waveforms, this paper considers the frequency shift keying (FSK) based waveform for joint communications and radar (JCR). An analysis of the probability distributions of its ambiguity function (AF) sidelobe levels (SLs) and peak sidelobe level (PSL) is conducted to study the radar sensing capability of random FSK. Numerical results show that the independent frequency modulation introduces uncontrollable AF PSLs. In order to address this problem, the initial phases of waveform sub-pulses are designed by solving a min-max optimisation problem. Numerical results indicate that the optimisation-based phase design can effectively reduce the AF PSL to a level close to well-designed radar waveforms while having no impact on the data rate and the receiver complexity. For large numbers of waveform sub-pulses and modulation orders, the impact on the error probability is also insignificant.</description>

      <title>Splitting Messages in the Dark- Rate-Splitting Multiple Access for FDD Massive MIMO Without CSI Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A critical hindrance to realize frequency division duplex (FDD) massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems is overhead associated with downlink channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT) acquisition. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework that achieves robust performances while completely eliminating downlink CSIT training and feedback. Specifically, by exploiting partial frequency invariance of channel parameters between the uplink (UL) and downlink (DL), we adopt the 2D-Newtonized orthogonal matching pursuit (2D-NOMP) algorithm to reconstruct DL CSIT from UL training. Due to inherent discrepancies arising from a carrier frequency difference between two disjoint bands, however, the multi-user interference is inevitable. To overcome this, we propose a precoding method that employs rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) and also develop an error covariance matrix (ECM) estimation method by using the observed Fisher information matrix (O-FIM). We find that this ECM estimation is crucial for our precoding design in maximizing the sum spectral efficiency (SE). Simulation results show that our method significantly improves the sum SE compared to other state-of-the-art approaches, underscoring the importance of our ECM estimation.</description>

      <title>Low-Complexity Near-Field Localization with XL-MIMO Sectored Uniform Circular Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rapid advancement of antenna technology catalyses the popularization of extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) antenna arrays, which pose unique challenges for localization with the inescapable near-field effect. In this paper, we propose an efficient near-field localization algorithm by leveraging a sectored uniform circular array (sUCA). In particular, we first customize a backprojection algorithm in the polar coordinate for sUCA-enabled near-field localization, which facilitates the target detection procedure. We then analyze the resolutions in both angular and distance domains via deriving the interval of zero-crossing points, and further unravel the minimum required number of antennas to eliminate grating lobes. The proposed localization method is finally implemented using fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computational complexity. Simulation results verify the resolution analysis and demonstrate that the proposed method remarkably outperforms conventional localization algorithms in terms of localization accuracy. Moreover, the low-complexity FFT implementation achieves an average runtime that is hundreds of times faster when large numbers of antenna elements are employed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates a Stacked Intelligent Metasurfaces (SIM)-assisted Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC) system. An extended target model is considered, where the BS aims to estimate the complete target response matrix relative to the SIM. Under the constraints of minimum Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) for the communication users (CUs) and maximum transmit power, we jointly optimize the transmit beamforming at the base station (BS) and the end-to-end transmission matrix of the SIM, to minimize the Cram\'er-Rao Bound (CRB) for target estimation. Effective algorithms such as the alternating optimization (AO) and semidefinite relaxation (SDR) are employed to solve the non-convex SINR-constrained CRB minimization problem. Finally, we design and build an experimental platform for SIM, and evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms for communication and sensing tasks.</description>

Abstract: An intelligent omni-surface (IOS) assisted holographic multiple-input and multiple-output architecture is conceived for $360^\circ$ full-space coverage at a low energy consumption. The theoretical ergodic rate lower bound of our non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) scheme is derived based on the moment matching approximation method, while considering the signal distortion at transceivers imposed by hardware impairments (HWIs). Furthermore, the asymptotically ergodic rate lower bound is derived both for an infinite number of IOS elements and for continuous aperture surfaces. Both the theoretical analysis and the simulation results show that the achievable rate of the NOMA scheme is higher than that of its orthogonal multiple access counterpart. Furthermore, owing to the HWIs at the transceivers, the achievable rate saturates at high signal-to-noise ratio region, instead of reaching its theoretical maximum.</description>

      <title>Energy-Efficient Reconfigurable Holographic Surfaces Operating in the Presence of Realistic Hardware Impairments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconfigurable holographic surfaces (RHSs) constitute a promising technique of supporting energy-efficient communications. In this paper, we formulate the energy efficiency maximization problem of the switch-controlled RHS-aided beamforming architecture by alternately optimizing the holographic beamformer at the RHS, the digital beamformer, the total transmit power and the power sharing ratio of each user. Specifically, to deal with this challenging non-convex optimization problem, we decouple it into three sub-problems. Firstly, the coefficients of RHS elements responsible for the holographic beamformer are optimized to maximize the sum of the eigen-channel gains of all users by our proposed low-complexity eigen-decomposition (ED) method. Then, the digital beamformer is designed by the singular value decomposition (SVD) method to support multi-user information transfer. Finally, the total transmit power and the power sharing ratio are alternately optimized, while considering the effect of transceiver hardware impairments (HWI). We theoretically derive the spectral efficiency and energy efficiency performance upper bound for the RHS-based beamforming architectures in the presence of HWIs. Our simulation results show that the switch-controlled RHS-aided beamforming architecture achieves higher energy efficiency than the conventional fully digital beamformer and the hybrid beamformer based on phase shift arrays (PSA). Moreover, considering the effect of HWI in the beamforming design can bring about further energy efficiency enhancements.</description>

      <title>Ergodic Spectral Efficiency Analysis of Intelligent Omni-Surface Aided Systems Suffering From Imperfect CSI and Hardware Impairments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In contrast to the conventional reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS), intelligent omni-surfaces (IOS) are capable of full-space coverage of smart radio environments by simultaneously transmitting and reflecting the incident signals. In this paper, we investigate the ergodic spectral efficiency of IOS-aided systems for transmission over random channel links, while considering both realistic imperfect channel state information (CSI) and transceiver hardware impairments (HWIs). Firstly, we formulate the linear minimum mean square error estimator of the equivalent channel spanning from the user equipments (UEs) to the access point (AP), where the transceiver HWIs are also considered. Then, we apply a two-timescale protocol for designing the beamformer of the IOS-aided system. Specifically, for the active AP beamformer, the minimum mean square error combining method is employed, which relies on the estimated equivalent channels, on the statistical information of the channel estimation error, on the inter-user interference as well as on the HWIs at the AP and UEs. By contrast, the passive IOS beamformer is designed based on the statistical CSI for maximizing the upper bound of the ergodic spectral efficiency. The theoretical analysis and simulation results show that the transceiver HWIs have a significant effect on the ergodic spectral efficiency, especially in the high transmit power region. Furthermore, we show that the HWIs at the AP can be effectively compensated by deploying more AP antennas.</description>

      <title>Frame Codes for the Block-Erasure Channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analog codes add redundancy by expanding the dimension using real/complex-valued operations. Frame theory provides a mathematical basis for constructing such codes, with diverse applications in non-orthogonal code-division multiple access (NOMA-CDMA), distributed computation, multiple description source coding, space-time coding (STC), and more. The channel model corresponding to these applications is a combination of noise and erasures. Recent analyses showed a useful connection between spectral random-matrix theory and large equiangular tight frames (ETFs) under random uniform erasures. In this work we generalize this model to a channel where the erasures come in blocks. This particularly fits NOMA-CDMA with multiple transmit antennas for each user and STC with known spatial grouping. We present a method to adjust ETF codes to suit block erasures, and find minimum intra-block-correlation frames which outperform ETFs in this setting.</description>

      <title>Movable Antenna Enhanced Wireless Sensing Via Antenna Position Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new wireless sensing system equipped with the movable-antenna (MA) array, which can flexibly adjust the positions of antenna elements for improving the sensing performance over conventional antenna arrays with fixed-position antennas (FPAs). First, we show that the angle estimation performance in wireless sensing is fundamentally determined by the array geometry, where the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) of the mean square error (MSE) for angle of arrival (AoA) estimation is derived as a function of the antennas' positions for both one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) MA arrays. Then, for the case of 1D MA array, we obtain a globally optimal solution for the MAs' positions in closed form to minimize the CRB of AoA estimation MSE. While in the case of 2D MA array, we aim to achieve the minimum of maximum (min-max) CRBs of estimation MSE for the two AoAs with respect to the horizontal and vertical axes, respectively. In particular, for the special case of circular antenna movement region, an optimal solution for the MAs' positions is derived under certain numbers of MAs and circle radii. Thereby, both the lower- and upper-bounds of the min-max CRB are obtained for the antenna movement region with arbitrary shapes. Moreover, we develop an efficient alternating optimization algorithm to obtain a locally optimal solution for MAs' positions by iteratively optimizing one between their horizontal and vertical coordinates with the other being fixed. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed 1D/2D MA arrays can significantly decrease the CRB of AoA estimation MSE as well as the actual MSE compared to conventional uniform linear arrays (ULAs)/uniform planar arrays (UPAs) with different values of uniform inter-antenna spacing.</description>

Abstract: Video-based remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) has emerged as a promising technology for non-contact vital sign monitoring, especially under controlled conditions. However, the accurate measurement of vital signs in real-world scenarios faces several challenges, including artifacts induced by videocodecs, low-light noise, degradation, low dynamic range, occlusions, and hardware and network constraints. In this article, we systematically investigate comprehensive investigate these issues, measuring their detrimental effects on the quality of rPPG measurements. Additionally, we propose practical strategies for mitigating these challenges to improve the dependability and resilience of video-based rPPG systems. We detail methods for effective biosignal recovery in the presence of network limitations and present denoising and inpainting techniques aimed at preserving video frame integrity. Through extensive evaluations and direct comparisons, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the approaches in enhancing rPPG measurements under challenging environments, contributing to the development of more reliable and effective remote vital sign monitoring technologies.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we consider a setting where heterogeneous agents with connectivity are performing inference using unlabeled streaming data. Observed data are only partially informative about the target variable of interest. In order to overcome the uncertainty, agents cooperate with each other by exchanging their local inferences with and through a fusion center. To evaluate how each agent influences the overall decision, we adopt a causal framework in order to distinguish the actual influence of agents from mere correlations within the decision-making process. Various scenarios reflecting different agent participation patterns and fusion center policies are investigated. We derive expressions to quantify the causal impact of each agent on the joint decision, which could be beneficial for anticipating and addressing atypical scenarios, such as adversarial attacks or system malfunctions. We validate our theoretical results with numerical simulations and a real-world application of multi-camera crowd counting.</description>

Abstract: Practical Bayesian learning often requires (1) online inference, (2) dynamic models, and (3) ensembling over multiple different models. Recent advances have shown how to use random feature approximations to achieve scalable, online ensembling of Gaussian processes with desirable theoretical properties and fruitful applications. One key to these methods' success is the inclusion of a random walk on the model parameters, which makes models dynamic. We show that these methods can be generalized easily to any basis expansion model and that using alternative basis expansions, such as Hilbert space Gaussian processes, often results in better performance. To simplify the process of choosing a specific basis expansion, our method's generality also allows the ensembling of several entirely different models, for example, a Gaussian process and polynomial regression. Finally, we propose a novel method to ensemble static and dynamic models together.</description>

      <title>Model-based Deep Learning for Rate Split Multiple Access in Vehicular Communications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rate split multiple access (RSMA) has been proven as an effective communication scheme for 5G and beyond, especially in vehicular scenarios. However, RSMA requires complicated iterative algorithms for proper resource allocation, which cannot fulfill the stringent latency requirement in resource constrained vehicles. Although data driven approaches can alleviate this issue, they suffer from poor generalizability and scarce training data. In this paper, we propose a fractional programming (FP) based deep unfolding (DU) approach to address resource allocation problem for a weighted sum rate optimization in RSMA. By carefully designing the penalty function, we couple the variable update with projected gradient descent algorithm (PGD). Following the structure of PGD, we embed few learnable parameters in each layer of the DU network. Through extensive simulation, we have shown that the proposed model-based neural networks has similar performance as optimal results given by traditional algorithm but with much lower computational complexity, less training data, and higher resilience to test set data and out-of-distribution (OOD) data.</description>

Abstract: The transformer structure employed in large language models (LLMs), as a specialized category of deep neural networks (DNNs) featuring attention mechanisms, stands out for their ability to identify and highlight the most relevant aspects of input data. Such a capability is particularly beneficial in addressing a variety of communication challenges, notably in the realm of semantic communication where proper encoding of the relevant data is critical especially in systems with limited bandwidth. In this work, we employ vision transformers specifically for the purpose of compression and compact representation of the input image, with the goal of preserving semantic information throughout the transmission process. Through the use of the attention mechanism inherent in transformers, we create an attention mask. This mask effectively prioritizes critical segments of images for transmission, ensuring that the reconstruction phase focuses on key objects highlighted by the mask. Our methodology significantly improves the quality of semantic communication and optimizes bandwidth usage by encoding different parts of the data in accordance with their semantic information content, thus enhancing overall efficiency. We evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed framework using the TinyImageNet dataset, focusing on both reconstruction quality and accuracy. Our evaluation results demonstrate that our framework successfully preserves semantic information, even when only a fraction of the encoded data is transmitted, according to the intended compression rates.</description>

Abstract: Epilepsy is a prevalent neurological disorder that affects approximately 1% of the global population. Around 30-40% of patients do not respond to pharmacological treatment, leading to a significant negative impact on their quality of life. Closed-loop deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a promising treatment for individuals who do not respond to medical therapy. To achieve effective seizure control, algorithms play an important role in identifying relevant electrographic biomarkers from local field potentials (LFPs) to determine the optimal stimulation timing. In this regard, the detection and classification of events from ongoing brain activity, while achieving low power through computationally unexpensive implementations, represents a major challenge in the field. To address this challenge, we here present two lightweight algorithms, the ZdensityRODE and the AMPDE, for identifying relevant events from LFPs by utilizing semantic segmentation, which involves extracting different levels of information from the LFP and relevant events from it. The algorithms performance was validated against epileptiform activity induced by 4-minopyridine in mouse hippocampus-cortex (CTX) slices and recorded via microelectrode array, as a case study. The ZdensityRODE algorithm showcased a precision and recall of 93% for ictal event detection and 42% precision for interictal event detection, while the AMPDE algorithm attained a precision of 96% and recall of 90% for ictal event detection and 54% precision for interictal event detection. While initially trained specifically for detection of ictal activity, these algorithms can be fine-tuned for improved interictal detection, aiming at seizure prediction. Our results suggest that these algorithms can effectively capture epileptiform activity; their light weight opens new possibilities for real-time seizure detection and seizure prediction and control.</description>

      <title>Few-Shot Learning with Uncertainty-based Quadruplet Selection for Interference Classification in GNSS Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09466v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Jamming devices pose a significant threat by disrupting signals from the global navigation satellite system (GNSS), compromising the robustness of accurate positioning. Detecting anomalies in frequency snapshots is crucial to counteract these interferences effectively. The ability to adapt to diverse, unseen interference characteristics is essential for ensuring the reliability of GNSS in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a few-shot learning (FSL) approach to adapt to new interference classes. Our method employs quadruplet selection for the model to learn representations using various positive and negative interference classes. Furthermore, our quadruplet variant selects pairs based on the aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty to differentiate between similar classes. We recorded a dataset at a motorway with eight interference classes on which our FSL method with quadruplet loss outperforms other FSL techniques in jammer classification accuracy with 97.66%.

      <title>On the Statistical Analysis of the Multipath Propagation Model Parameters for Power Line Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18129v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a fitting procedure that aims to identify the statistical properties of the parameters that describe the most widely known multipath propagation model (MPM) used in power line communication (PLC). Firstly, the MPM parameters are computed by fitting the theoretical model to a large database of single-input-single-output (SISO) experimental measurements, carried out in typical home premises. Secondly, the determined parameters are substituted back into the MPM formulation with the aim to prove their faithfulness, thus validating the proposed computation procedure. Then, the MPM parameters properties have been evaluated. In particular, the statistical behavior is established identifying the best fitting distribution by comparing the most common distributions through the use of the likelihood function. Moreover, the relationship among the different paths is highlighted in terms of statistical correlation. The identified statistical behavior for the MPM parameters confirms the assumptions of the previous works that, however, were mostly established in an heuristic way.</description>

      <title>Time Encoding Quantization of Bandlimited and Finite-Rate-of-Innovation Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.01928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.01928v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the impact of quantization in integrate-and-fire time encoding machine (IF-TEM) sampler used for bandlimited (BL) and finite-rate-of-innovation (FRI) signals. An upper bound is derived for the mean squared error (MSE) of IF-TEM sampler and is compared against that of classical analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) with uniform sampling and quantization. The interplay between a signal's energy, bandwidth, and peak amplitude is used to identify how the MSE of IF-TEM sampler with quantization is influenced by these parameters. More precisely, the quantization step size of the IF-TEM sampler can be reduced when the maximum frequency of a bandlimited signal or the number of pulses of an FRI signal is increased. Leveraging this insight, specific parameter settings are identified for which the quantized IF-TEM sampler achieves an MSE bound that is roughly 8 dB lower than that of a classical ADC with the same number of bits. Experimental results validate the theoretical conclusions.</description>

      <title>Denoiser-based projections for 2-D super-resolution multi-reference alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.04754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.04754v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the 2-D super-resolution multi-reference alignment (SR-MRA) problem: estimating an image from its down-sampled, circularly-translated, and noisy copies. The SR-MRA problem serves as a mathematical abstraction of the structure determination problem for biological molecules. Since the SR-MRA problem is ill-posed without prior knowledge, accurate image estimation relies on designing priors that well-describe the statistics of the images of interest. In this work, we build on recent advances in image processing, and harness the power of denoisers as priors of images. In particular, we suggest to use denoisers as projections, and design two computational frameworks to estimate the image: projected expectation-maximization and projected method of moments. We provide an efficient GPU implementation, and demonstrate the effectiveness of these algorithms by extensive numerical experiments on a wide range of parameters and images.</description>

      <title>Open RAN-empowered V2X Architecture: Challenges, Opportunities, and Research Directions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.06938v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Advances in the automotive industry and the ever-increasing demand for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) are pushing for a new epoch of networked wireless systems. Vehicular communications, or Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X), are expected to be among the main actors of the future beyond 5G and 6G networks. However, the challenging application requirements, the fast variability of the vehicular environment, and the harsh propagation conditions of high frequencies call for sophisticated control mechanisms to ensure the success of such a disruptive technology. While traditional Radio Access Networks (RAN) lack the flexibility to support the required control primitives, the emergent concept of Open RAN (O-RAN) appears as an ideal enabler of V2X communication orchestration. However, effectively integrating the two ecosystems is still an open issue. This paper discusses possible integration strategies, highlighting the challenges and opportunities of leveraging O-RAN to enable real-time V2X control. Additionally, we enrich our discussion with potential research directions stemming from the current state-of-the-art, and we provide preliminary simulation results that validate the effectiveness of the proposed integration.</description>

      <title>Distributed Rate-Splitting Multiple Access for Multilayer Satellite Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.07382v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Future wireless networks, in particular, 5G and beyond, are anticipated to deploy dense Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites to provide global coverage and broadband connectivity. However, the limited frequency band and the coexistence of multiple constellations bring new challenges for interference management. In this paper, we propose a robust multilayer interference management scheme for spectrum sharing in heterogeneous satellite networks with statistical channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter (CSIT) and receivers (CSIR). In the proposed scheme, Rate-Splitting Multiple Access (RSMA), as a general and powerful framework for interference management and multiple access strategies, is implemented distributedly at GEO and LEO satellites, coined Distributed-RSMA (D-RSMA). By doing so, D-RSMA aims to mitigate the interference and boost the user fairness of the overall multilayer satellite system. Specifically, we study the problem of jointly optimizing the GEO/LEO precoders and message splits to maximize the minimum rate among User Terminals (UTs) subject to a transmit power constraint at all satellites. A robust algorithm is proposed to solve the original non-convex optimization problem. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness towards network load and CSI uncertainty of our proposed D-RSMA scheme. Benefiting from the interference management capability, D-RSMA provides significant max-min fairness performance gains compared to several benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>The Perception-Robustness Tradeoff in Deterministic Image Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09253v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the behavior of deterministic methods for solving inverse problems in imaging. These methods are commonly designed to achieve two goals: (1) attaining high perceptual quality, and (2) generating reconstructions that are consistent with the measurements. We provide a rigorous proof that the better a predictor satisfies these two requirements, the larger its Lipschitz constant must be, regardless of the nature of the degradation involved. In particular, to approach perfect perceptual quality and perfect consistency, the Lipschitz constant of the model must grow to infinity. This implies that such methods are necessarily more susceptible to adversarial attacks. We demonstrate our theory on single image super-resolution algorithms, addressing both noisy and noiseless settings. We also show how this undesired behavior can be leveraged to explore the posterior distribution, thereby allowing the deterministic model to imitate stochastic methods.</description>

      <title>Distributed Massive MIMO System with Dynamic Clustering in LEO Satellite Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06024v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Distributed massive multiple-input multiple output (mMIMO) system for low earth orbit (LEO) satellite networks is introduced as a promising technique to provide broadband connectivity. Nevertheless, several challenges persist in implementing distributed mMIMO systems for LEO satellite networks. These challenges include providing scalable massive access implementation as the system complexity increases with network size. Another challenging issue is the asynchronous arrival of signals at the user terminals due to the different propagation delays among distributed antennas in space, which destroys the coherent transmission, and consequently degrades the system performance. In this paper, we propose a scalable distributed mMIMO system for LEO satellite networks based on dynamic user-centric clustering. Aiming to obtain scalable implementation, new algorithms for initial cooperative access, cluster selection, and cluster handover are provided. In addition, phase shift-aware precoding is implemented to compensate for the propagation delay phase shifts. The performance of the proposed user-centric distributed mMIMO is compared with two baseline configurations: the non-cooperative transmission systems, where each user connects to only a single satellite, and the full-cooperative distributed mMIMO systems, where all satellites contribute serving each user. The numerical results show the potential of the proposed distributed mMIMO system to enhance system spectral efficiency when compared to noncooperative transmission systems. Additionally, it demonstrates the ability to minimize the serving cluster size for each user, thereby reducing the overall system complexity in comparison to the full-cooperative distributed mMIMO systems.</description>

      <title>On the Potential of Re-configurable Intelligent Surface (RIS)-assisted Physical Layer Authentication (PLA)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00426v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Re-configurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) technology is increasingly becoming a potential component for next-generation wireless networks, offering enhanced performance in terms of throughput, spectral, and energy efficiency. However, the broadcast nature of RIS-assisted wireless communication makes it vulnerable to malicious attacks at the physical layer. At the same time, physical layer authentication is gaining popularity as a solution to secure wireless networks, thwarting different attacks such as cloning, spoofing, and impersonation by using the random features of the physical layer.
  In this paper, we investigate RIS-assisted wireless communication systems to unlock the potential of using RIS for physical layer authentication (PLA). In particular, we exploit two distinct features of the physical layer: pathloss and channel impulse response (CIR) for PLA in RIS-assisted wireless communication. We construct hypothesis tests for the estimated features and derive closed-form error expressions. Further, we consider the critical error, i.e., missed detection, as our objective function to minimize by optimizing the phase shift of the RIS pannel. We compare the performance of our proposed mechanisms with PLA schemes using the same features but with no RIS. Furthermore, we thoroughly evaluate our proposed schemes using performance metrics such as the probability of false alarm (PFA), the probability of missed detection (PMD), and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The results demonstrate a clear positive impact of RIS on PLA, as it effectively reduces PMD values to zero when determining the optimal phase shift.</description>
