      <description>arXiv:2412.16338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we employ the Renormalization Group (RG) method to study higher order corrections to the long-time asymptotics of a class of nonlinear integral equations with a generalized heat kernel and with time-dependent coefficients. This is a follow up of the papers \cite{bib:souz-brag-more-art,bib:souz-brag-more-marginal,bib:brag-more-silv}.</description>

      <title>Renormalisation group theory applied to $\ddot{x}+\dot{x}+x^2=0$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The titular ordinary differential equation (ODE) is encountered in the theory of on-axis inertial particle capture by a blunt stationary collector at a viscous-flow stagnation point. Phase space for the ODE divides into two attractor basins, representing particle trajectories which do or do not collide with the collector in a finite time. Written as $\ddot{x} + \dot{x} + \epsilon x^2 = 0$, we formulate the renormalisation group (RG) amplitude equations for this problem and argue that the critical trajectory which separates the attractor basins corresponds to a trivial but exact solution of these, and can therefore be extracted as a power series in $\epsilon$. We show how this can be used to find the cross-over between capture and non-capture as a function of distance from the stagnation point, for a particle released into the flow with no initial acceleration. This cross-over, previously only computable by numerical integration of the ODE, can therefore be expressed as a (numerically) convergent series with rational terms.</description>

      <title>Local Conservation Laws and Entropy Inequality for Kinetic Models with Delocalized Collision Integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents a common setting for the collision integrals $\mathrm{St}$ appearing in the kinetic theory of dense gases. It includes the collision integrals of the Enskog equation, of (a variant of) the Povzner equation, and of a model for soft sphere collisions proposed by Cercignani [Comm. Pure Appl. Math. 36 (1983), 479-494]. All these collision integrals are delocalized, in the sense that they involve products of the distribution functions of gas molecules evaluated at positions whose distance is of the order of the molecular radius. Our first main result is to express these collision integrals as the divergence in $v$ of some mass current, where $v$ is the velocity variable, while $v_i\mathrm{St}$ and $|v|^2\mathrm{St}$ are expressed as the phase space divergence (i.e divergence in both position and velocity) of appropriate momentum and energy currents. This extends to the case of dense gases an earlier result by Villani [Math. Modelling Numer. Anal. M2AN 33 (1999), 209-227] in the case of the classical Boltzmann equation (where the collision integral is involves products of the distribution function of gas molecules evaluated at different velocities, but at the same position. Applications of this conservative formulation of delocalized collision integrals include the possibility of obtaining the local conservation laws of momentum and energy starting from this kinetic theory of denses gases. Similarly a local variant of the Boltzmann H Theorem, involving some kind of free energy instead of Boltzmann's H function, can be obtained in the form of an expression for the entropy production in terms of the phase space divergence of some phase space current, and of a nonpositive term.</description>

      <title>Long-Time Behavior of Typical Pure States from Thermal Equilibrium Ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an isolated macroscopic quantum system in a pure state $\psi_t\in\mathcal{H}$ evolving unitarily in a separable Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$. Following von Neumann [46], we assume that different macro states $\nu$ correspond to mutually orthogonal subspaces $\mathcal{H}_\nu\subset\mathcal{H}$. Let $P_\nu$ be the projection to $\mathcal{H}_\nu$. ''Normal typicality'' is the statement (true for some Hamiltonians) that for all initial states $\psi_0\in\mathcal{H}$ and most $t\geq 0$, $\|P_\nu\psi_t\|^2$ is close to $d_\nu/D$, where $d_\nu=\dim\mathcal{H}_\nu$ and $D=\dim\mathcal{H}&lt;\infty$. It can be shown [42] that the statement becomes valid for all Hamiltonians if ''all $\psi_0\in\mathcal{H}$'' is replaced by ''most $\psi_0\in\mathcal{H}_\mu$'' (most w.r.t. the uniform distribution on the sphere of $\mathcal{H}_\mu$) with an arbitrary macro state $\mu$ and $d_\nu/D$ by a $t$- and $\psi_0$-independent quantity $M_{\mu\nu}$. In the present work, we generalize this result from the uniform distribution to a much more general class of measures, so-called GAP measures. Let $\rho$ be a density matrix on $\mathcal{H}$. Then GAP$(\rho)$ is the most spread out distribution on the sphere of $\mathcal{H}$ with density matrix $\rho$. If $\rho$ is a canonical density matrix, GAP$(\rho)$ arises as the thermal equilibrium distribution of wave functions and can be viewed as a quantum analog of the canonical ensemble. We show that also for GAP$(\rho)$-most $\psi_0\in\mathcal{H}$, the superposition weight $\|P_\nu\psi_t\|^2$ is close to a fixed value $M_{\rho P_\nu}$ for most $t\geq0$. Moreover, we prove a similar result for arbitrary bounded operators $B$ instead of $P_\nu$ and for finite times. The main ingredient of the proof is an improvement of bounds on the variance of $\langle\psi|B|\psi\rangle$ w.r.t. GAP$(\rho)$ which were first obtained by Reimann [29] and slightly generalized in [44].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The factorizations using the general Riccati solution constructed from a given particular solution by means of the Bernoulli ansatz initiated in 1984 by Mielnik and Fernandez C. for the cases of the quantum harmonic oscillator and the radial Hydrogen equation, respectively, are briefy reviewed. The issue of the eigenfunction normalization of the obtained one-parameter Darboux-deformed Hamiltonians is addressed here.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review the construction by Bouch [1] of trees on the square lattice that can be grown from its root in $L!/C^L$ distinct ways, where $L$ is the number of bonds constituting the tree, and $C&gt;1$ is a constant. As discussed, e.g., in Appendix A.3 of [2], this result has an implication on the operator growth in quantum spin systems in two or higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Superoscillations in the hypercomplex setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superoscillatory functions represent a counterintuitive phenomenon in physics but also in mathematics, where a band-limited function oscillates faster than its highest Fourier component. They appear in various contexts, including quantum mechanics, as a result of a weak measurement introduced by Y. Aharonov and collaborators. These functions can be extended to the complex variable and are a specific instance of the more general notion of supershift. The aim of this paper is to extend the notion of superoscillatory functions to the hypercomplex setting. This extension is richer than the complex case since the Fueter-Sce extension theorem for Clifford-valued functions provides two notions of hyperholomorphic functions. We will explore these notions and address the corresponding superoscillating theories.</description>

      <title>Localization for random operators on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ with the long-range hopping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate random operators on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ with H\"older continuously distributed potentials and the long-range hopping. The hopping amplitude decays with the inter-particle distance $\|\bm x\|$ as $e^{-\log^{\rho}(\|\bm x\|+1)}$ with $\rho&gt;1,\bm x\in\Z^d$. By employing the multi-scale analysis (MSA) technique, we prove that for large disorder, the random operators have pure point spectrum with localized eigenfunctions whose decay rate is the same as the hopping term. This gives a partial answer to a conjecture of Yeung and Oono [{\it Europhys. Lett.} 4(9), (1987): 1061-1065].</description>

      <title>The Hydrodynamic Limit of Neural Networks with Balanced Excitation and Inhibition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theory of `Balanced Neural Networks' is a very popular explanation for the high degree of variability and stochasticity in the brain's activity. We determine equations for the hydrodynamic limit of a balanced all-to-all network of 2n neurons for asymptotically large n. The neurons are divided into two classes (excitatory and inhibitory). Each excitatory neuron excites every other neuron, and each inhibitory neuron inhibits all of the other neurons. The model is of a stochastic hybrid nature, such that the synaptic response of each neuron is governed by an ordinary differential equation. The effect of neuron j on neuron k is dictated by a spiking Poisson Process, with intensity given by a sigmoidal function of the synaptic potentiation of neuron j. The interactions are scaled by n^{-1/2} , which is much stronger than the n^{-1} scaling of classical interacting particle systems. We demonstrate that, under suitable conditions, the system does not blow up as n asymptotes to infinity because the network activity is balanced between excitatory and inhibitory inputs. The limiting population dynamics is proved to be Gaussian: with the mean determined by the balanced between excitation and inhibition, and the variance determined by the Central Limit Theorem for inhomogeneous Poisson Processes. The limiting equations can thus be expressed as autonomous Ordinary Differential Equations for the means and variances.</description>

      <title>Local Boundary Conditions for Dirac-type operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider Dirac-type operators on manifolds with boundary, and set out to determine all local smooth boundary conditions that give rise to (strongly) regular self-adjoint operators. By combining the general theory of boundary value problems for Dirac operators as in [BB12] and pointwise considerations, for local smooth boundary conditions the question of being self-adjoint resp. regular is fully translated into linear-algebraic language at each boundary point. We analyse these conditions and classify them in low dimensions and ranks. In particular, we classify all local self-adjoint regular boundary conditions for Dirac spinors (four spinor components) in dimensions $3$ and $4$. With the same techniques we can also treat transmission boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Large scale regularity and correlation length for almost length-minimizing random curves in the plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a model of random curves in the plane related to the large-scale behavior of the Random Field Ising Model (RFIM) at temperature zero in two space dimensions. Our work is motivated by attempts to quantify the Imry--Ma phenomenon concerning the rounding of the phase transition by quenched disorder, and connects to recent advances regarding the decay of correlations in the RFIM.
  We study a continuum model of minimal surfaces in two space dimensions subject to an external, quenched random field, and restrict ourselves to isotropic surface integrands. The random fields we consider behave like white noise on large scales with an ultra-violet regularization reminiscent of the lattice structure of the RFIM.
  We give a finer description of the minimizer below the length scale starting from which the influence of boundary conditions is suppressed with a given probability, which has recently been shown to be of order $\exp(\varepsilon^{-\frac{4}{3}})$ in the amplitude $\varepsilon&gt;0$ of the noise. More precisely, we prove flatness of the phase boundaries on scales up to order $\exp(\varepsilon^{-\frac{4}{13}})$.</description>

      <title>Non-rigidly rotating stationary cylindrical dust spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11695v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider stationary rotating cylindrically symmetric dust spacetimes. We first show that the Maitra spacetime is the unique non-rigidly (non null shear scalar) rotating solution with a regular axis and that is the most general one of the field equations. We are also able to demonstrate what Maitra's paper does not show, where the solution is merely stated without any demonstration. Then we find that the non-rigidly rotating spacetimes, not necessarily regular, can be matched, across timelike cylindrical hypersurfaces, to a one-parameter family of stationary vacuum exteriors given by the Weyl class but not to the Lewis class, generalizing a result by Bonnor and Steidman. Among other properties, it is shown that the amount of rotating dust packed inside a cylinder is bigger if it is rigidly rotating than non-rigidly rotating. Finally, we show that in the non-rigidly rotating cases the fluid necessarily has vorticity and the spacetimes are not silent, where the magnetic part of the Weyl tensor is non-zero.</description>

      <title>Generalizing symplectic topology from 1 to 2 dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In symplectic topology one uses elliptic methods to prove rigidity results about symplectic manifolds and solutions of Hamiltonian equations on them, where the most basic example is given by geodesics on Riemannian manifolds. Harmonic maps from surfaces are the natural 2-dimensional generalizations of geodesics. In this paper, we give the corresponding generalization of symplectic manifolds and Hamiltonian equations, leading to a class of partial differential equations that share properties similar to Hamiltonian (ordinary) differential equations. Two rigidity results are discussed: a non-squeezing theorem and a version of the cuplength result for quadratic Hamiltonians on cotangent bundles. The proof of the latter uses a generalization of Floer curves, for which the necessary Fredholm and compactness results will be proven.</description>

      <title>Classification of kink clusters for scalar fields in dimension 1+1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a real scalar field equation in dimension 1+1 with an even, positive self-interaction potential having two non-degenerate zeros (vacua) 1 and -1. Such a model admits non-trivial static solutions called kinks and antikinks. We define a kink n-cluster to be a solution approaching, for large positive times, a superposition of n alternating kinks and antikinks whose velocities converge to $0$. They can be equivalently characterized as the solutions of minimal possible energy containing n transitions between the vacua, or as the solutions whose kinetic energy decays to 0 in large time.
  Our first main result is a determination of the main-order asymptotic behavior of any kink n-cluster. The proof relies on a reduction,using appropriately chosen modulation parameters, to an n-body problem with attractive exponential interactions. We then construct a kink n-cluster for any prescribed initial positions of the kinks and antikinks, provided that their mutual distances are sufficiently large. Next, we prove that the set of all the kink n-clusters is an n-dimensional topological manifold, and we show how it can be parametrized by the positions of the kinks in the configuration. The proof relies on energy estimates and the contraction mapping principle, using the Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction technique. Finally, we show that kink clusters are universal profiles for the formation/collapse of multikink configurations. In this sense, they can be interpreted as forming the stable/unstable manifold of the multikink state given by a superposition of n infinitely separated alternating kinks and antikinks.</description>

      <title>On the spectral flow theorem of Robbin-Salamon for finite intervals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we consider operators of the form $\partial_s\xi+A(s)\xi$ where $s$ lies in an interval $[-T,T]$ and $s\mapsto A(s)$ is continuous. Without boundary conditions these operators are not Fredholm. However, using interpolation theory one can define suitable boundary conditions for these operators so that they become Fredholm. We show that in this case the Fredholm index is given by the spectral flow of the operator path $A$.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal Polynomials and Perfect State Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of this review paper is to discuss some applications of orthogonal polynomials in quantum information processing. The hope is to keep the paper self contained so that someone wanting a brief introduction to the theory of orthogonal polynomials and continuous time quantum walks on graphs may find it in one place. In particular, we focus on the associated Jacobi operators and discuss how these can be used to detect perfect state transfer. We also discuss how orthogonal polynomials have been used to give results which are analogous to those given by Karlin and McGregor when studying classical birth and death processes. Finally, we show how these ideas have been extended to quantum walks with more than nearest neighbor interactions using exceptional orthogonal polynomials. We also provide a (non-exhaustive) list of related open questions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a simple PDE construction of the sine-Gordon measure below the first threshold ($\be^2 &lt; 4\pi$), in both the finite and infinite volume settings, by studying the corresponding parabolic sine-Gordon model. We also establish pathwise global well-posedness of the hyperbolic sine-Gordon model in finite volume for $\be^2 &lt; 2\pi$.</description>

      <title>Non-uniqueness of Leray--Hopf solutions for the $3D$ fractional Navier--Stokes equations perturbed by transport noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For the $3D$ fractional Navier--Stokes equations perturbed by transport noise, we prove the existence of infinitely many H\"older continuous analytically weak, probabilistically strong Leray--Hopf solutions starting from the same deterministic initial velocity field. Our solutions are global in time and satisfy the energy inequality pathwise on a non-empty random interval $[0,\tau]$. In contrast to recent related results, we do not consider an additional deterministic suitably chosen force $f$ in the equation. In this unforced regime, we prove the first result of Leray--Hopf nonuniqueness for fractional Navier--Stokes equations with any kind of stochastic perturbation. Our proof relies on convex integration techniques and a flow transformation by which we reformulate the SPDE as a PDE with random coefficients.</description>

      <title>Selection rules for RG flows of minimal models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Minimal d=2 CFTs are usually classified through modular invariant partition functions. There is a finer classification of ``non complete'' models when S-duality is not imposed. We approach this classification by starting with the local chiral algebra and adding primaries sequentially. At each step, we only impose locality (T-duality) and closure of the operator algebra. For each chiral algebra, this produces a tree-like graph. Each tree node corresponds to a local d=2 CFT, with an intrinsic Jones index measuring the size of Haag duality violation. This index can be computed with the partition function and is related to the total quantum dimension of the category of superselection sectors of the node, and to the relative size between the node and a modular invariant completion. In this way, we find in a very explicit manner a classification of local minimal (c&lt;1) d=2 CFTs. When appropriate, this matches Kawahigashi-Longo's previous results. We use this finer classification to constrain RG flows. For a relevant perturbation, the flow can be restricted to the subalgebra associated with it, typically corresponding to a non-modular invariant node in the tree. The structure of the graph above such node needs to be preserved by the RG flow. In particular, the superselection sector category for the node must be preserved. This gives selection rules that recover in a unified fashion several known facts while unraveling new ones.</description>

      <title>A localized construction of Kasner-like singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct local, in spacetime, singular solutions to the Einstein vacuum equations that exhibit Kasner-like behavior in their past boundary. Our result can be viewed as a localization (in space) of the construction in \cite{FL}. We also prove a refined uniqueness statement and give a simple argument that generates general asymptotic data for Kasner-like singularities, enjoying all expected degrees of freedom, albeit only locally in space. The key difference of the present work with \cite{FL} is our use of a first order symmetric hyperbolic formulation of the Einstein vacuum equations, relative to the connection coefficients of a parallelly propagated orthonormal frame which is adapted to the Gaussian time foliation. This makes it easier to localize the construction, since elliptic estimates are no longer required to complete the energy argument.</description>

      <title>Shielding of breathers for the focusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a deterministic gas of breathers for the Focusing Nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation. The gas of breathers is obtained from a $N$-breather solution in the limit $N\to \infty$.\\ The limit is performed at the level of scattering data by letting the $N$-breather spectrum to fill uniformly a suitable compact domain of the complex plane in the limit $N\to\infty$. The corresponding norming constants are interpolated by a smooth function and scaled as $1/N$. For particular choices of the domain and the interpolating function, the gas of breathers behaves as finite breathers solution. This extends the shielding effect discovered in "M. Bertola, T. Grava, and G. Orsatti - Physical Review Letters, 130.12 (2023): 1" for a soliton gas also to a breather gas.</description>

      <title>Sasaki structures on general contact manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the concept of a Sasakian structure on a cooriented contact manifold, given by a compatibility between the contact form $\eta$ and a Riemannian metric $g_M$ on $M$, to the case of a general contact structure understood as a contact distribution. Traditionally, the compatibility can be expressed as the fact that the symplectic form $\omega=\mathrm{d}(s^2\eta)$ and the metric $g(x,s)=\mathrm{d} s\otimes\mathrm{d} s+s^2g_M(x)$ define on the cone $\mathcal{M}=M\times\mathbb{R}_+$ a K\"ahler structure. Since general contact structures can be realized as homogeneous symplectic structures $\omega$ on $\mathrm{GL}(1;\mathbb{R})$-principal bundles $P\to M$, it is natural to understand Sasakian structures in full generality as related to `homogeneous K\"ahler structures' on $P$. The difficulty is that, even locally, contact distributions do not provide any preferred contact form, so the standard approach cannot be directly applied. However, we succeeded in characterizing homogeneous K\"ahler structures on $(P,\omega)$ and discovering a canonical lift of Riemannian metrics from the contact manifold $M$ to $P$, which allowed us to define Sasakian structures for general contact manifolds. This approach is completely conceptual and avoids ad hoc choices. Moreover, it provides a natural concept of Sasakian manifold products which we develop in detail.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a simple quantitative method for studying the hydrodynamic limit of interacting particle systems on lattices. It is applied to the diffusive scaling of the symmetric Zero-Range Process (in dimensions one and two). The rate of convergence is estimated in a Monge-Kantorovich distance asymptotic to the L^1 stability estimate of Kruzkhov, as well as in relative entropy; and it is uniform in time. The method avoids the use of the so-called ``block estimates''. It is based on a modulated Monge-Kantorovich distance estimate and microscopic stability properties.</description>

Abstract: We construct and study the renormalised Amperean area of a Brownian motion. First studied by W.Werner, the Amperean area is related to L\'evy area and stochastic integrals in a way akin to the relation between self-intersection measure and occupation measure. As we explain, it plays a central role in the Symanzik's polymer representation of the continuous Abelian Yang--Mills--Higgs field in 2 dimensions and allows to study this field using classical stochastic calculus and martingale theory.</description>

Abstract: We introduce supersymmetric extensions of the Hom-Lie deformation of the Virasoro algebra (super Curtright-Zachos algebra), as realized in the GL(1,1) quantum superspace, for Bloch electron systems under Zeeman effects. By examining the duality inherent in quantum superspace scaling operators, we establish a correspondence between quantum superspace and its physical realization through a novel operator mixing mechanism. For the continuous case, we construct super Curtright-Zachos algebra using magnetic translations and spin matrix bases, demonstrating explicit realizations for both N=1 and N=2 supersymmetric algebras with a natural N=2 decomposition. For the discrete case, we establish cyclic matrix representations in tight-binding models. We organize these structures through the *-bracket formalism with Z2-grading, revealing how the quantum superspace structure manifests in physical systems while preserving essential algebraic properties.</description>

Abstract: We consider the half-form corrected geometric quantization of symplectic toric manifolds with respect to mixed toric polarizations $\mathcal{P}_{\infty}$. These polarizations are obtained at infinite geodesic time along Mabuchi rays of toric K\"ahler polarizations generated by the norm square of the moment map of a torus subgroup.
  The geodesic rays are lifted to the quantum bundle via generalized coherent state transforms (gCST) and define equivariant isomorphisms between Hilbert spaces for the K\"ahler polarizations and the Hilbert space for the mixed polarization.</description>

      <title>Local unitarty equivalence and entanglement by Bargmann invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of quantum states frequently examines the connection between non-local effects in quantum mechanics and quantities that remain unchanged under local unitary transformations. Among these concepts, local unitary equivalence, defined through local unitary transformations, holds significant importance in quantum state classification and resource theory. This paper focuses on the fundamental issue of local unitary equivalence for multipartite quantum states within quantum information theory, with the aim of identifying the comprehensive set of invariants that define their local unitary orbits. These invariants are crucial for deriving polynomial invariants and describing physical properties that remain invariant under local unitary transformations. Specifically, the research delves into the characterization of local unitary equivalence and the detection of entanglement using local unitary Bargmann invariants, utilizing the generalized Schur-Weyl duality to analyze tensor product symmetries. Taking the two-qubit system as an example, our study demonstrates the measurability of the invariants that determine local unitary equivalence and establishes a relationship between Makhlin's fundamental invariants (a complete set of 18 local unitary invariants for two-qubit states) and local unitary Bargmann invariants. These Bargmann invariants are related to the trace of density operator products with marginal states and can be measured through a cycle test, an extension of the SWAP test.These findings offer a practical criterion for entanglement detection based on local unitary Bargmann invariants, contributing to the advancement of quantum information theory and its applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Weil-Petersson volumes of the moduli space of curves are deeply related to the Kontsevich-Witten KdV tau function. They possess a Virasoro symmetry which comes out of recursion relations between the volumes due to Mirzakhani. Similarly, the super Weil-Petersson volumes of the moduli space of super curves with Neveu-Schwarz punctures are related to the Br\'ezin-Gross-Witten (BGW) tau function of the KdV hierarchy and satisfy a recursion due to Stanford and Witten, analogous to Mirzakhani's recursion. In this paper we prove that by also allowing Ramond punctures, the super Weil-Petersson volumes are related to the generalised BGW KdV tau function, which is a one parameter deformation of the BGW tau function. This allows us to prove that these new super volumes also satisfy the Stanford-Witten recursion.</description>

      <title>Abrupt changes in the spectra of the Laplacian with constant complex magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the spectrum of the Laplace operator, subject to homogeneous complex magnetic fields in the plane. For real magnetic fields, it is well-known that the spectrum consists of isolated eigenvalues of infinite multiplicities (Landau levels). We demonstrate that when the magnetic field has a nonzero imaginary component, the spectrum expands to cover the entire complex plane. Additionally, we show that the Landau levels (appropriately rotated and now embedded in the complex plane) persists, unless the magnetic field is purely imaginary in which case they disappear and the spectrum becomes purely continuous.</description>

      <title>$\mathfrak{b}$-Hurwitz numbers from refined topological recursion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that single $G$-weighted $\mathfrak{b}$-Hurwitz numbers with internal faces are computed by refined topological recursion on a rational spectral curve, for certain rational weights $G$. Consequently, the $\mathfrak{b}$-Hurwitz generating function analytically continues to a rational curve. In particular, our results cover the cases of $\mathfrak{b}$-monotone Hurwitz numbers, and the enumeration of maps and bipartite maps (with internal faces) on non-oriented surfaces. As an application, we prove that the correlators of the Gaussian, Jacobi and Laguerre $\beta$-ensembles are computed by refined topological recursion.</description>

      <title>Closed-string amplitude recursions from the Deligne associator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by earlier results on recursions for open-string tree-level amplitudes, and by a result of Brown and Dupont relating open- and closed-string tree-level amplitudes via single-valued periods, we identify a recursive relation for closed-string tree-level amplitudes. We achieve this by showing that closed-string analogues of Selberg integrals satisfy the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equation for a suitable matrix representation of the free Lie algebra on two generators, and by identifying the limits at z=1 and z=0, which are related by the Deligne associator, with N-point and (N-1)-point closed-string amplitudes, respectively.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a superspace analogue of combinatorial Hopf algebras (Aguiar-Bergeron-Sottile, 2006), and show that the Hopf superalgebra of quasi-symmetric (resp. symmetric) functions in superspace (Fishel-Lapointe-Pinto, 2019) is a terminal object in the category of all (resp. cocommutative) combinatorial Hopf superalgebras. We also introduce a superspace analogue of chromatic symmetric functions of graphs (Stanley, 1995) using the chromatic Hopf superalgebra of two-colored graphs.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the Schr\"odinger operator $H(\mu) = \nabla_{\bf A}^*\nabla_{\bf A} + \mu V$ on a Riemannian manifold $M$ of bounded geometry, where $\mu&gt;0$ is a coupling parameter, the magnetic field ${\bf B}=d{\bf A}$ and the electric potential $V$ are uniformly $C^\infty$-bounded, $V\geq 0$. We assume that, for some $E_0&gt;0$, each connected component of the sublevel set $\{V&lt;E_0\}$ of the potential $V$ is relatively compact. Under some assumptions on geometric and spectral properties of the connected components, we show that, for sufficiently large $\mu$, the spectrum of $H(\mu)$ in the interval $[0,E_0\mu]$ has a gap, the spectral projection of $H(\mu)$, corresponding to the interval $(-\infty,\lambda]$ with $\lambda$ in the gap, belongs to the Roe $C^*$-algebra $C^*(M)$ of the manifold $M$, and its class in the $K$ theory of $C^*(M)$ is trivial.</description>

      <title>Critical level set percolation for the GFF in $d&gt;6$: comparison principles and some consequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the intrinsic geometry of the critical percolation cluster induced by the level set of the metric Gaussian free field on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ above the critical dimension of six. (Lupu, 2016) established that the critical percolation cluster has the same law as that in a Poisson loop soup where the intensity is dictated by the Green's function of the usual random walk. A sharp Euclidean one arm exponent was proven recently in (Cai and Ding, 2023), and subsequently in (Ganguly and Nam, 2024) other results about the chemical one arm exponent, volume growth and the Alexander-Orbach conjecture were established for all $d&gt;20.$
  In this paper, we introduce new methods to obtain several sharp estimates about the intrinsic geometry which hold for all $d&gt;6$. We develop two primary comparison methods. The first involves a comparison of the extrinsic (Euclidean) and intrinsic metrics allowing estimates about the former to be transferrable to the latter. The second compares intrinsic geodesics to a class of modified paths which are non-backtracking in a certain loop sense. The latter is amenable to analysis using methods of bond percolation. We finally prove that such non-backtracking paths are not much longer than geodesics allowing us to establish comparable estimates for the geodesic. As applications of such methods, we establish, for all $d&gt;6,$ the chemical one-arm exponent, as well as an averaged version of a conjecture from (Werner, 2021) which asserts that deletion of loops with diameter larger than $r^{6/d}$ do not affect the connection probabilities between points at Euclidean distance $r.$ An important ingredient of independent interest is a local connectivity estimate which asserts that the connection probability between two points at distance $r$ remains, up to constants, unchanged even if the connecting path is confined to a ball of diameter comparable to $r.$</description>

      <title>Variational Quantum Simulation of Anyonic Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anyonic chains provide lattice realizations of a rich set of quantum field theories in two space-time dimensions. The latter play a central role in the investigation of generalized symmetries, renormalization group flows and numerous exotic phases of strongly-correlated systems. Here, a variational quantum simulation scheme is presented for the analysis of those anyonic chains which can be mapped to the restricted solid-on-solid~(RSOS) models of Andrews, Baxter and Forrester. An~$L_R$ site RSOS model associated with a Dynkin diagram containing~$p$ nodes is realized with~$L_R\lceil\ln_2 p\rceil$ qubits, where~$\lceil x\rceil$ is the smallest integer~$\geq x$. The scheme is benchmarked by realizing the ground states of RSOS Hamiltonians in the~$A_p$ family for~$4\leq p\leq8$ using a variational quantum-classical algorithm. The latter is based on the Euler-Cartan circuit ansatz. Topological symmetry operators are analyzed for the RSOS models at the quantum-critical points. Measurement of observables acting on~$\lceil\ln_2 p\rceil$ qubits is shown to capture the anyonic nature of the Hilbert space. The described quantum simulation scheme provides a systematic approach to give rise to a large family of quantum field theories which have largely eluded physical realizations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1308.0100v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new unified formulation of the current algebra theory in general dimensions in terms of supergeometry. We take a QP-manifold, i.e. a differential graded (dg) symplectic manifold, as a fundamental framework. A Poisson bracket in a current algebra is constructed by the so called derived bracket of the graded Poisson structure induced from the above QP-structure. By taking a canonical transformation on a QP-manifold, correct anomalous terms in physical theories are derived. A large class of current algebras with and without anomalous terms (central extensions) are constructed from the above structure. Moreover, using this formulation, a new class of current algebras related higher structures are systematically obtained.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we consider some Lie groups in complexified Clifford algebras. Using relations between operations of conjugation in Clifford algebras and matrix operations we prove isomorphisms between these groups and classical matrix groups (symplectic, orthogonal, linear, unitary) in the cases of arbitrary dimension and arbitrary signature. Also we obtain isomorphisms of corresponding Lie algebras which are direct sums of subspaces of quaternion types. Spin group is a subgroup of all considered groups and it coincides with one of them in the cases $n\leq 5$. We present classical matrix Lie groups that contain spin group in the case of arbitrary dimension.</description>

      <title>Topological phases of unitary dynamics: Classification in Clifford category</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.09141v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A quantum cellular automaton (QCA) or a causal unitary is by definition an automorphism of local operator algebra, by which local operators are mapped to local operators. Quantum circuits of small depth, local Hamiltonian evolutions for short time, and translations (shifts) are examples. A Clifford QCA is one that maps any Pauli operator to a finite tensor product of Pauli operators. Here, we obtain a complete table of groups $\mathfrak C(\mathsf d,p)$ of translation invariant Clifford QCA in any spatial dimension $\mathsf d \ge 0$ modulo Clifford quantum circuits and shifts over prime $p$-dimensional qudits, where the circuits and shifts are allowed to obey only coarser translation invariance. The group $\mathfrak C(\mathsf d,p)$ is nonzero only for $\mathsf d = 2k+3$ if $p=2$ and $\mathsf d = 4k+3$ if $p$ is odd where~$k \ge 0$ is any integer, in which case $\mathfrak C(\mathsf d,p) \cong \widetilde{\mathfrak W}(\mathbb F_p)$, the classical Witt group of nonsingular quadratic forms over the finite field $\mathbb F_p$. It is well known that $\widetilde{\mathfrak W}(\mathbb F_2) \cong \mathbb Z/2\mathbb Z$, $\widetilde{\mathfrak W}(\mathbb F_p) \cong \mathbb Z/4\mathbb Z$ if $p = 3 \bmod 4$, and $\widetilde{\mathfrak W}(\mathbb F_p)\cong \mathbb Z/2\mathbb Z \oplus \mathbb Z/2\mathbb Z$ if $p = 1 \bmod 4$. The classification is achieved by a dimensional descent, which is a reduction of Laurent extension theorems for algebraic $L$-groups of surgery theory in topology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.19371v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we revisit the Dobrushin uniqueness theorem for Gibbs measures of lattice systems of interacting particles at thermal equilibrium. In a nutshell, Dobrushin's uniqueness theorem provides a practical way to derive sufficient conditions on the inverse temperature and/or model parameters assuring uniqueness of Gibbs measures by reducing the uniqueness problem to a suitable estimate of the Wasserstein distance between pairs of 1-point Gibbs measures with different boundary conditions. After proving a general result of completeness for the Wasserstein distance, we reformulate the Dobrushin uniqueness theorem in a convenient form for lattice systems of interacting particles described by Hamiltonians that are not necessarily translation-invariant with possibly infinite-range pair-potentials and with general complete metric spaces as single-spin spaces. Our reformulation includes existence, and covers both classical and the Euclidean version of quantum lattice systems. Further, a generalization to the Dobrushin-Shlosman theorem for translation-invariant lattice systems is given. Subsequently, we give a series of applications of these uniqueness criteria to some high-temperature classical lattice systems including the Heisenberg, Potts and Ising models. An application to classical lattice systems for which the local Gibbs measures are convex perturbations of Gaussian measures is also given.</description>

Abstract: The lowest Landau level Hilbert space, or the Bargmann-Fock space, admits a quantized trace for the commutator of its position coordinate operators. We exploit the Carey-Pincus theory of principal functions of trace class commutators to probe this integer quantization result further, and uncover a hidden rational structure in the higher-order commutator-traces. This shows how exact fractional quantization can occur whenever exact integral quantization does.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04347v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explicitly solve a variational problem related to upper bounds on the optimal constants in the Cwikel--Lieb--Rozenblum (CLR) and Lieb--Thirring (LT) inequalities, which has recently been derived in [Invent. Math. 231 (2023), no.1, 111-167. https://doi.org/10.1007/s00222-022-01144-7 ] and [J. Eur. Math. Soc. (JEMS) 23 (2021), no.8, 2583-2600. https://doi.org/10.4171/jems/1062 ]. We achieve this through a variational characterization of the $L^1$ norm of the Fourier transform of a function and duality, from which we obtain a reformulation in terms of a variant of the Hadamard three lines lemma. By studying Hardy-like spaces of holomorphic functions in a strip in the complex plane, we are able to provide an analytic formula for the minimizers, and use it to get the best possible upper bounds for the optimal constants in the CLR and LT inequalities achievable by the method of [Invent. Math. 231 (2023), no.1, 111-167. https://doi.org/10.1007/s00222-022-01144-7 ] and [J. Eur. Math. Soc. (JEMS) 23 (2021), no.8, 2583-2600. https://doi.org/10.4171/jems/1062 ].</description>

Then we present a new class of patterns related to periodic analogs of Schrodinger operators from the ``even" bi-spectral family. We also show that patterns related to rational and soliton solutions of the KdV hierarchy constitute complete solution of the problem for certain classes of vortex systems.</description>

Abstract: In a 1979 paper, Ventevogel and Nijboer showed that classical point particles interacting via the pair potential $\phi(x)=\left(1+x^4\right)^{-1}$ are not equally spaced in their ground states in one dimension when the particle density is high, in contrast with many other potentials such as inverse power laws or Gaussians. In this paper, we explore a broad class of potentials for which this property holds; we prove that under the potentials $f_\alpha(x)=\left(1+x^\alpha\right)^{-1}$, when $\alpha&gt;2$ is an even integer, there is a corresponding $s_\alpha&gt;0$ such that under density $\rho={n}/{s_\alpha}$, the configuration that places $n$ particles at each point of $s_\alpha\mathbb{Z}$ minimises the average potential energy per particle and is therefore the exact ground state. In other words, the particles form clusters, while the clusters do not approach each other as the density increases; instead they maintain a fixed spacing. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first rigorous analysis of such a ground state for a naturally occurring class of potential functions.</description>

Abstract: The non-commutative harmonic oscillators (NcHO) and 2p-quantum Rabi models (2pQRM) are extensions of harmonic oscillators. The purpose of this paper is to give a relationship between NcHO and 2pQRM, and the fiber decomposition of NcHO by 2pQRM is shown. We also construct Feynman-Kac formulas of NcHO and 2pQRM. Then asymptotic behaviors of the spectral zeta function of 2pQRM is considered.</description>

      <title>Existence and Uniqueness of Solutions to the Generalized Hydrodynamics Equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04922v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The generalized hydrodynamics (GHD) equation is the equivalent of the Euler equations of hydrodynamics for integrable models. Systems of hyperbolic equations such as the Euler equations usually develop shocks and are plagued by problems of uniqueness. We establish for the first time the existence and uniqueness of solutions to the full GHD equation and the absence of shocks, from a large class of initial conditions with bounded occupation function. We assume only absolute integrability of the two-body scattering shift. In applications to quantum models of fermionic type, this includes all commonly used physical initial states, such as locally thermal states and zero-entropy states. We show in particular that differentiable initial conditions give differentiable solutions at all times and that weak initial conditions such as the Riemann problem have unique weak solutions which preserve entropy. For this purpose, we write the GHD equation as a new fixed-point problem (announced in a companion paper). We show that the fixed point exists, is unique, and is approached, under an iterative solution procedure, in the Banach topology on functions of momenta.</description>

      <title>Circulant graphs as an example of discrete quantum unique ergodicity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09028v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A discrete analog of quantum unique ergodicity was proved for Cayley graphs of quasirandom groups by Magee, Thomas and Zhao. They show that for large graphs there exist real orthonormal basis of eigenfunctions of the adjacency matrix such that quantum probability measures of the eigenfunctions put approximately the correct proportion of their mass on subsets of the vertices that are not too small. We investigate this property for Cayley graphs of cyclic groups (circulant graphs). We observe that there exist sequences of orthonormal eigenfunction bases which are perfectly equidistributed. However, for sequences of 4-regular circulant graphs of prime order, we show that there are no sequences of real orthonormal bases where all sequences of eigenfunctions equidistribute. To obtain this result, we also prove that, for large 4-regular circulant graphs of prime order, the maximum multiplicity of the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix is two.</description>

      <title>Application of the Direct Interaction Approximation to generalized stochastic models in the turbulence problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02820v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to consider the application of the direct interaction approximation (DIA) developed by Kraichnan to generalized stochastic models in the turbulence problem. Previous developments (Kraichnan, Shivamoggi et al., Shivamoggi and Tuovila) were based on the Boltzmann-Gibbs prescription for the underlying entropy measure, which exhibits the extensivity property and is suited for ergodic systems. Here, we consider the introduction of an influence bias discriminating rare and frequent events explicitly, as behooves non-ergodic systems. More specifically, we consider the application of the DIA to a linear damped stochastic oscillator system using a Tsallis type autocorrelation model with an underlying non-extensive entropy measure, and describe the resulting stochastic process. We also deduce some apparently novel mathematical properties of the stochastic models associated with the present investigation -- the gamma distribution and the Tsallis non-extensive entropy.</description>

Abstract: Lieb and Solovej proved that, for the symmetric $SU(N)$ representations, the corresponding Wehrl-type entropy is minimized by symmetric coherent states. However, the uniqueness of the minimizers remained an open problem when $N\geq 3$. In this note we complete the proof of the Wehrl entropy conjecture for such representations, by showing that symmetric coherent states are, in fact, the only minimizers. We also provide an application to the maximum concentration of holomorphic polynomials and deduce a corresponding Faber-Krahn inequality. A sharp quantitative form of the bound by Lieb and Solovej is also proved.</description>

      <title>Low-temperature Ising dynamics with random initializations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2106.11296v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is well known that Glauber dynamics on spin systems typically suffer exponential slowdowns at low temperatures. This is due to the emergence of multiple metastable phases in the state space, separated by narrow bottlenecks that are hard for the dynamics to cross. It is a folklore belief that if the dynamics is initialized from an appropriate random mixture of ground states, one for each phase, then convergence to the Gibbs distribution should be much faster. However, such phenomena have largely evaded rigorous analysis, as most tools in the study of Markov chain mixing times are tailored to worst-case initializations.
  In this paper we develop a general framework towards establishing this conjectured behavior for the Ising model. In the classical setting of the Ising model on an $N$-vertex torus in $\mathbb Z^d$, our framework implies that the mixing time for the Glauber dynamics, initialized from a $\frac 12$-$\frac 12$ mixture of the all-plus and all-minus configurations, is $N^{1+o(1)}$ in dimension $d=2$, and at most quasi-polynomial in all dimensions $d\ge 3$, at all temperatures below the critical one. The key innovation in our analysis is the introduction of the notion of "weak spatial mixing within a phase", a low-temperature adaptation of the classical concept of weak spatial mixing. We show both that this new notion is strong enough to control the mixing time from the above random initialization (by relating it to the mixing time with plus boundary condition at $O(\log N)$ scales), and that it holds at all low temperatures in all dimensions.
  This framework naturally extends to much more general families of graphs. To illustrate this, we also use the same approach to establish optimal $O(N\log N)$ mixing for the Ising Glauber dynamics on random regular graphs at sufficiently low temperatures, when initialized from the same random mixture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.04775v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a nonlinear recombination model from population genetics as a combinatorial version of the Kac-Boltzmann equation from kinetic theory. Following Kac's approach, the nonlinear model is approximated by a mean field linear evolution with a large number of particles. In our setting, the latter takes the form of a generalized random transposition dynamics. Our main results establish a uniform in time propagation of chaos with quantitative bounds, and a tight entropy production estimate for the generalized random transpositions, which holds uniformly in the number of particles. As a byproduct of our analysis we obtain sharp estimates on the speed of convergence to stationarity for the nonlinear equation, both in terms of relative entropy and total variation norm.</description>

      <title>Theory of Quantum Circuits with Abelian Symmetries</title>

Abstract: Quantum circuits with gates (local unitaries) respecting a global symmetry have broad applications in quantum information science and related fields, such as condensed matter theory and quantum thermodynamics. However, despite their widespread use, fundamental properties of such circuits are not well-understood. Recently, it was found that generic unitaries respecting a global symmetry cannot be realized, even approximately, using gates that respect the same symmetry. This observation raises important open questions: What unitary transformations can be realized with k-local gates that respect a global symmetry? In other words, in the presence of a global symmetry, how does the locality of interactions constrain the possible time evolution of a composite system? In this work, we address these questions for the case of Abelian (commutative) symmetries and develop constructive methods for synthesizing circuits with such symmetries. Remarkably, as a corollary, we find that, while the locality of interactions still imposes additional constraints on realizable unitaries, certain restrictions observed in the case of non-Abelian symmetries do not apply to circuits with Abelian symmetries. For instance, in circuits with a general non-Abelian symmetry such as SU($d$), the unitary realized in a subspace with one irreducible representation (charge) of the symmetry dictates the realized unitaries in multiple other sectors with inequivalent representations of the symmetry. Furthermore, in certain sectors, rather than all unitaries respecting the symmetry, the realizable unitaries are the symplectic or orthogonal subgroups of this group. We prove that none of these restrictions appears in the case of Abelian symmetries. This result suggests that global non-Abelian symmetries may affect the thermalization of quantum systems in ways not possible under Abelian symmetries.</description>

      <title>On the tractability of sampling from the Potts model at low temperatures via random-cluster dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.03182v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sampling from the $q$-state ferromagnetic Potts model is a fundamental question in statistical physics, probability theory, and theoretical computer science. On general graphs, this problem may be computationally hard, and this hardness holds at arbitrarily low temperatures. At the same time, in recent years, there has been significant progress showing the existence of low-temperature sampling algorithms in various specific families of graphs. Our aim in this paper is to understand the minimal structural properties of general graphs that enable polynomial-time sampling from the $q$-state ferromagnetic Potts model at low temperatures. We study this problem from the perspective of random-cluster dynamics. These are non-local Markov chains that have long been believed to converge rapidly to equilibrium at low temperatures in many graphs. However, the hardness of the sampling problem likely indicates that this is not even the case for all bounded degree graphs.
  Our results demonstrate that a key graph property behind fast or slow convergence time for these dynamics is whether the independent edge-percolation on the graph admits a strongly supercritical phase. By this, we mean that at large $p&lt;1$, it has a large linear-sized component, and the graph complement of that component is comprised of only small components. Specifically, we prove that such a condition implies fast mixing of the random-cluster Glauber and Swendsen--Wang dynamics on two general families of bounded-degree graphs: (a) graphs of at most stretched-exponential volume growth and (b) locally treelike graphs. In the other direction, we show that, even among graphs in those families, these Markov chains can converge exponentially slowly at arbitrarily low temperatures if the edge-percolation condition does not hold.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.14279v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the motion of a particle under a continuum random environment whose distribution is given by the Howitt-Warren flow. In the moderate deviation regime, we establish that the quenched density of the motion of the particle (after appropriate centering and scaling) converges weakly to the $(1+1)$ dimensional stochastic heat equation driven by multiplicative space-time white noise. Our result confirms physics predictions and computations in [LDT17, BLD20] and is the first rigorous instance of such weak convergence in the moderate deviation regime. Our proof relies on a certain Girsanov transform and works for all Howitt-Warren flows with finite and nonzero characteristic measures. Our results capture universality in the sense that the limiting distribution depends on the flow only via the total mass of the characteristic measure. As a corollary of our results, we prove that the fluctuations of the maximum of an $N$-point sticky Brownian motion are given by the KPZ equation plus an independent Gumbel on timescales of order $(\log N)^2.$</description>

Abstract: We study the degenerate linear Boltzmann equation inside a bounded domain with a generalized diffuse reflection at the boundary and variable temperature, including the Maxwell boundary conditions with the wall Maxwellian or heavy-tailed reflection kernel and the Cercignani-Lampis boundary condition. Our abstract collisional setting applies to the linear BGK model, the relaxation towards a space-dependent steady state, and collision kernels with fat tails. We prove for the first time the existence of a steady state and a rate of convergence towards it without assumptions on the temperature variations. Our results for the Cercignani-Lampis boundary condition make also no hypotheses on the accommodation coefficients. The proven rate is exponential when a control condition on the degeneracy of the collision operator is satisfied, and only polynomial when this assumption is not met, in line with our previous results regarding the free-transport equation. We also provide a precise description of the different convergence rates, including lower bounds, when the steady state is bounded. Our method yields constructive constants.</description>

Abstract: The continuous random energy model (CREM) was introduced by Bovier and Kurkova in 2004 which can be viewed as a generalization of Derrida's generalized random energy model. Among other things, their work indicates that there exists a critical point $\beta_c$ such that the partition function exhibits a phase transition. The present work focuses on the high temperature regime where $\beta&lt;\beta_c$. We show that for all $\beta&lt;\beta_c$ and for all $s&gt;0$, the negative $s$ moment of the CREM partition function is comparable with the expectation of the CREM partition function to the power of $-s$, up to constants that are independent of $N$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we fix the complex structure and explore the moduli space of the heterotic system by considering two different yet "dual" deformation paths starting from a K\"ahler solution. They correspond to deformation along the Bott-Chern cohomology class and the Aeppli cohomology class respectively. Using the implicit function theorem, we prove the local existence of heterotic solutions along these two paths and hence establish an initial step to construct local moduli coordinates around a K\"ahler solution.</description>

Abstract: We construct two families of orthogonal polynomials associated with the universal central extensions of the superelliptic Lie algebras. These polynomials satisfy certain fourth order linear differential equations, and one of the families is a particular collection of associated ultraspherical polynomials. We show that the generating functions of the polynomials satisfy fourth order linear PDEs. Since these generating function can be represented by superelliptic integrals, we have examples of linear PDEs of fourth order with explicit solutions without complete integrability.</description>

      <title>On the exact solution for the Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18499v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For almost 75 years, the general solution for the Schr\"odinger equation was assumed to be generated by an exponential or a time-ordered exponential known as the Dyson series. We study the unitarity of a solution in the case of a singular Hamiltonian and provide a new methodology that is not based on the assumption that the underlying space is $L^{2}(\mathbb{R})$. Then, an alternative operator for generating the time evolution that is manifestly unitary is suggested, regardless of the choice of Hamiltonian. The new construction involves an additional positive operator that normalizes the wave function locally and allows us to preserve unitarity, even when dealing with infinite dimensional or non-normed spaces. Our considerations show that Schr\"odinger and Liouville equations are, in fact, two sides of the same coin and together they provide a unified description for unbounded quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Solutions of Tetrahedron Equation from Quantum Cluster Algebra Associated with Symmetric Butterfly Quiver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08814v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a new solution to the tetrahedron equation by further pursuing the quantum cluster algebra approach in our previous works. The key ingredients include a symmetric butterfly quiver attached to the wiring diagrams for the longest element of type $A$ Weyl groups and the implementation of quantum $Y$-variables through the $q$-Weyl algebra. The solution consists of four products of quantum dilogarithms. By exploring both the coordinate and momentum representations, along with their modular double counterparts, our solution encompasses various known three-dimensional (3D) $R$-matrices. These include those obtained by Kapranov-Voevodsky (1994) utilizing the quantized coordinate ring, Bazhanov-Mangazeev-Sergeev (2010) from a quantum geometry perspective, Kuniba-Matsuike-Yoneyama (2023) linked with the quantized six-vertex model, and Inoue-Kuniba-Terashima (2023) associated with the Fock-Goncharov quiver. The 3D $R$-matrix presented in this paper offers a unified perspective on these existing solutions, coalescing them within the framework of quantum cluster algebra.</description>

      <title>Classical integrability in the presence of a cosmological constant: analytic and machine learning results</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18247v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the integrability of two-dimensional theories that are obtained by a dimensional reduction of certain four-dimensional gravitational theories describing the coupling of Maxwell fields and neutral scalar fields to gravity in the presence of a potential for the neutral scalar fields. For a certain solution subspace, we demonstrate partial integrability by showing that a subset of the equations of motion in two dimensions are the compatibility conditions for a linear system. Subsequently, we study the integrability of these two-dimensional models from a complementary one-dimensional point of view, framed in terms of Liouville integrability. In this endeavour, we employ various machine learning techniques to systematise our search for numerical Lax pair matrices for these models, as well as conserved currents expressed as functions of phase space variables.</description>

      <title>Relations in Twisted Quantum K-Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00916v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce twisted quantum $K$-rings, defined via twisted $K$-theoretic Gromov-Witten invariants. We develop a toolkit for computing relations by adapting some results about ordinary quantum K rings to our setting, and discuss some applications, including Ruan-Zhang's quantum $K$-theory with level structure, and complete intersections inside projective space, confirming some predictions coming from physics.
  In addition, we formulate a ring-theoretic abelian/non-abelian correspondence conjecture, relating the quantum K-ring of a GIT quotient $X//G$ to a certain twist of the quantum K-ring of $X//T$, the quotient by the maximal torus. We prove this conjecture for the case of Grassmanians, and use this to give another proof of the Whitney relations of Mihalcea-Gu-Sharpe-Zhou.</description>

      <title>Quantum Detection of Recurrent Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16055v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum dynamics that explore an unexpectedly small fraction of Hilbert space is inherently interesting. Integrable systems, quantum scars, MBL, hidden tensor structures, and systems with gauge symmetries are examples. Beyond dimension and volume, spectral features such as an $O(1)$-density of periodic eigenvalues, or other spectral features, can also imply observable recurrence. Low volume dynamics will recur near its initial state $| \psi_0\rangle$ more rapidly, i.e. $\lVert\mathrm{U}^k | \psi_0\rangle - | \psi_0\rangle \rVert &lt; \epsilon$, is more likely to occur for modest values of $k$, when the (forward) orbit $\operatorname{closure}(\{\mathrm{U}^k\}_{k=1,2,\dots})$ is of relatively low dimension $d$ and relatively small $d$-volume. We describe simple quantum algorithms to detect such approximate recurrence. Applications include detection of certain cases of hidden tensor factorizations $\mathrm{U} \cong V^\dagger(\mathrm{U}_1\otimes \cdots \otimes \mathrm{U}_n)V$. "Hidden" refers to an unknown conjugation, e.g. $\mathrm{U}_1 \otimes \cdots \otimes \mathrm{U}_v \rightarrow V^\dagger(\mathrm{U}_1 \otimes \cdots \otimes \mathrm{U}_n)V$, which will obscure the low-volume nature of the dynamics. Hidden tensor structures have been observed to emerge both in a high energy context of operator-level spontaneous symmetry breaking [FSZ21a, FSZ21b, FSZ21c, SZBF23], and at the opposite end of the intellectual world in linguistics [Smo09, MLDS19]. We collect some observations on the computational difficulty of locating these structures and detecting related spectral information. A technical result, Appendix A, is that the language describing unitary circuits with no spectral gap (NUSG) around 1 is QMA-complete. Appendix B connects the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem to hidden tensor structures.</description>

      <title>Extensions to the Navier-Stokes-Fourier Equations for Rarefied Transport: Variational Multiscale Moment Methods for the Boltzmann Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17334v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive a fourth order entropy stable extension of the Navier-Stokes-Fourier equations into the transition regime of rarefied gases. We do this through a novel reformulation of the closure of conservation equations derived from the Boltzmann equation that subsumes existing methods such as the Chapman-Enskog expansion. We apply the linearized version of this extension to the stationary heat problem and the Poiseuille channel and compare our analytical solutions to asymptotic and numerical solutions of the linearized Boltzmann equation. In both model problems, our solutions compare remarkably well in the transition regime. For some macroscopic variables, this agreement even extends far beyond the transition regime.</description>

      <title>Optimizing entanglement in two-qubit systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18474v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate entanglement in two-qubit systems using a geometric representation based on the minimum of essential parameters. The latter is achieved by requiring subsystems with the same entropy, regardless of whether the state of the entire system is pure or mixed. The geometric framework is provided by a convex set S that forms a right-triangle, whose points are linked to just two of the coherences of the system under study. As a result, we find that optimized states of two qubits are X-shaped and host pairs of identical populations while reducing the number of coherences involved. A geometric L-measure of entanglement is introduced as the distance between the points in S that represent entangled states and the closest point that defines separable states. It is shown that L reproduces the results of the Hill-Wootters concurrence C, so that C can be interpreted as a distance-like entanglement measure. However, unlike C, the measure L also distinguishes the rank of states. The universality of the two-qubit X-states ensures the utility of our geometric model for studying entanglement of two-qubit states in any configuration. To show the applicability of our approach far beyond time-independent cases, we construct a time-dependent two-qubit state, traced out over the complementary components of a pure tetra-partite system, and find that its one-qubit states share the same entropy. The entanglement measure results bounded from above by the envelope of the minima of such entropy.</description>

      <title>On moments of the derivative of CUE characteristic polynomials and the Riemann zeta function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03687v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the derivative of the characteristic polynomial of $N \times N$ Haar distributed unitary matrices. We obtain the first explicit formulae for complex-valued moments when the spectral variable is inside the unit disc, in the limit $N \to \infty$. These formulae are expressed in terms of the confluent hypergeometric function of the first kind. As an application, we provide an alternative method to re-obtain Mezzadri's result [J. Phys. A, 36(12):2945-2962, 2003] on the asymptotic density of zeros of the derivative as $N \to \infty$. We explore the connection between these moments and those of the derivative of the Riemann zeta function away from the critical line. Under the Lindel\"of hypothesis, we prove that all positive integer moments agree with our random matrix results up to an arithmetic factor. Inspired by this finding, we propose a conjecture on the asymptotics of non-integer moments of the derivative of the Riemann zeta function off the critical line. Within random matrix theory, we also investigate the microscopic regime where the spectral variable $z$ satisfies $|z|^{2}=1-\frac{c}{N}$ for a fixed constant $c$. We obtain an asymptotic formula for the moments in this regime as a determinant involving the finite temperature Bessel kernel, which reduces to the Bessel kernel when $c=0$. For finite matrix size, we provide an exact formula for the moments of the derivative inside the unit disc, expressed as polynomials of the inverse of the distance from the circle, with coefficients given by combinatorial sums.</description>

      <title>Algebraic classification of the gravitational field in general metric-affine geometries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07153v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the algebraic classification of the gravitational field in four-dimensional general metric-affine geometries, thus extending the current results of the literature in the particular framework of Weyl-Cartan geometry by the presence of the traceless nonmetricity tensor. This quantity switches on four of the eleven fundamental parts of the irreducible representation of the curvature tensor under the pseudo-orthogonal group, in such a way that three of them present similar algebraic types as the ones obtained in Weyl-Cartan geometry, whereas the remaining one includes thirty independent components and gives rise to a new algebraic classification. The latter is derived by means of its principal null directions and their levels of alignment, obtaining a total number of sixteen main algebraic types, which can be split into many subtypes. As an immediate application, we determine the algebraic types of the broadest family of static and spherically symmetric black hole solutions with spin, dilation and shear charges in Metric-Affine Gravity.</description>

Abstract: We consider optimal graphons associated with extreme and near-extreme constraints on the densities of edges and triangles. We prove that the optimizers for near-extreme constraints are unique and multipodal and are perturbations of the previously known unique optimzers for extreme constraints. This proves the existence of infinitely many phases. We determine the podal structures in these phases and prove the existence of phase transitions between them.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we study a large class of nonlinear stochastic wave equations that arise in laser generation models and models for propagation in random media in a unified mathematical framework. Continuous and pulse-wave propagation models, free electron laser generation models, as well as laser-plasma interaction models have been cast in a convenient and unified abstract framework as semilinear evolution equations in a Hilbert space to enable stochastic analysis. We formulate Ito calculus and white noise calculus methods of treating stochastic terms and prove existence and uniqueness of mild solutions.</description>

      <title>Global Well-Posedness and Soliton Resolution for the Half-Wave Maps Equation with Rational Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03351v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the energy-critical half-wave maps equation: \[ \partial_t \mathbf{u} = \mathbf{u} \times |D| \mathbf{u} \] for $\mathbf{u} : [0, T) \times \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{S}^2$. Our main result establishes the global existence and uniqueness of solutions for all rational initial data $\mathbf{u}_0 : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{S}^2$. This demonstrates global well-posedness for a dense subset within the scaling-critical energy space $\dot{H}^{1/2}(\mathbb{R}; \mathbb{S}^2)$. Furthermore, we prove soliton resolution for a dense subset of initial data in the energy space, with uniform bounds for all higher Sobolev norms $\dot{H}^s$ for $s &gt; 0$.
  Our analysis utilizes the Lax pair structure of the half-wave maps equation on Hardy spaces in combination with an explicit flow formula. Extending these results, we establish global well-posedness for rational initial data (along with a soliton resolution result) for a generalized class of matrix-valued half-wave maps equations with target spaces in the complex Grassmannians $\mathbf{Gr}_k(\mathbb{C}^d)$. Notably, this includes the complex projective spaces $ \mathbb{CP}^{d-1} \cong \mathbf{Gr}_1(\mathbb{C}^d)$ thereby extending the classical case of the target $\mathbb{S}^2 \cong \mathbb{CP}^1$.</description>

Abstract: In this note we give a criterion for the existence of a fractional-linear integral for a geodesic flow on a Riemannian surface and explain that modulo M\"obius transformations the moduli space of such local integrals (if nonempty) is either the two-dimensional projective plane or a finite number of points. We will also consider explicit examples and discuss a relation of such rational integrals to Killing vectors.</description>

Abstract: Based on the Newtonian mechanics, in this article, we present a heuristic derivation of the Friedmann equations, providing an intuitive foundation for these fundamental relations in cosmology. Additionally, using the first law of thermodynamics and Euler's equation, we derive a set of equations that, at linear order, coincide with those obtained from the conservation of the stress-energy tensor in General Relativity. This approach not only highlights the consistency between Newtonian and relativistic frameworks in certain limits but also serves as a pedagogical bridge, offering insights into the physical principles underlying the dynamics of the universe.</description>
