      <title>Matter Field, Dark Matter and Dark Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/0802.0052</link>
      <description>arXiv:0802.0052v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A model concerning particle theory and cosmology is proposed. Matter field, dark matter and dark energy are created by an energy flow from space to primordial matter fields at the phase transition in the early universe.</description>

      <title>The post-Newtonian metric of a self-gravitating and collapsing thin spherical shell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05134v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We calculate the metric for a self-gravitating and collapsing infinitely-thin spherical shell under the theory of post-Newtonian approximation, and successfully recover the shell's energy-momentum tensor from the achieved metric. The post-Newtonian dynamic equations of the test particles inside and outside the shell are achieved respectively. It is demonstrated that the radial motion of the spherically-symmetric system can contribute to the second gravitational potential and the gravitomagnetic field, inducing the time-dependent gravitational effects.</description>

      <title>Testing stimulated emission photon direction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15399v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While naively laser only allow to excite external target, for example STED microscopy demonstrates it can also cause its deexitation, however, under uncommon condition of being prepared as excited. These two causalities are governed by stimulated emission-absorption pair of equations, and swap places in perspective of CPT symmetry, however, it means stimulated emission photon direction opposite to usually assumed. This article discusses various arguments and proposes simple STED-like tests to experimentally determine stimulated emission photon direction once for all, to be performed in a near future, already having indirect experimental evidence, like lack of Rabi cycle for free electron laser, or recent "negative time evidence" experiment in the news. Depending on its result: it should lead to new applications like 2WQC more symmetric quantum computers, or macroscopic violation of CPT symmetry, so far probably tested only in microscopic settings. Also forward/backward/bidirectional photon sources are discussed.</description>

      <title>On the Main Factor That Causes the Instabilities of the Earth Rotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03244v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Earth rotation is one of astronomical phenomena without which it is impossible to think of human life. That is why the investigation on the Earth rotation is very important and it has a long history of study. Invention of quartz clocks in the 1930s and atomic time 1950s and introduction of modern technology into astronomic observation in recent years resulted in rapid development of the study in Earth's rotation. The theory of the Earth rotation, however, has not been up to the high level of astronomic observation due to limitation of the time such as impossibility of quantitative calculation of moment of external force for Euler's dynamical equation based on Newtoniam mechanics. As a typical example, we can take the problems that cover the instabilities of the Earth's rotation proved completely by the astronomic observations as well as polar motion, the precession and nutation of the Earth rotation axis which have not been described in a single equation in a quantitative way from the unique law of the Earth rotation. In particular, at present the problem of what the main factor causing the instabilities of the Earth rotation is has not been solved clearly in quantitative ways yet. Therefore, this paper addresses a quantitative proof that the main factor which causes the instabilities of the Earth rotation is the moment of external force rather than variations in the relative atmospheric angular momentum and in moment of inertia of the Earth's body due to the time limitation and under some assumptions. Then the future direction of research is proposed.</description>
