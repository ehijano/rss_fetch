      <title>Nonreflecting Boundary Condition for the free Schr\"{o}dinger equation for hyperrectangular computational domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we discuss the efficient ways of implementing the transparent boundary condition (TBC) and its various approximations for the free Schr\"{o}dinger equation on a hyperrectangular computational domain in $\field{R}^d$ with periodic boundary conditions along the $(d-1)$ unbounded directions. In particular, we consider Pad\'e approximant based rational approximation of the exact TBC and a spatially local form of the exact TBC obtained under its high-frequency approximation. For the spatial discretization, we use a Legendre-Galerkin spectral method with a boundary-adapted basis to ensure the bandedness of the resulting linear system. Temporal discretization is then addressed with two one-step methods, namely, the backward-differentiation formula of order 1 (BDF1) and the trapezoidal rule (TR). Finally, several numerical tests are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the methods where we study the stability and convergence behaviour empirically.</description>

      <title>Uniform Haar Wavelet Solutions for Fractional Regular $\beta$-Singular BVPs Modeling Human Head Heat Conduction under Febrifuge Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces nonlinear fractional Lane-Emden equations of the form, $$ D^{\alpha} y(x) + \frac{\lambda}{x^\beta}~ D^{\beta} y(x) + f(y) =0, ~ ~1 &lt; \alpha \leq 2, ~~ 0&lt; \beta \leq 1, ~~ 0 &lt; x &lt; 1,$$ subject to boundary conditions, $$ y'(0) =\mathbf{a} , ~~~ \mathbf{c}~ y'(1) + \mathbf{d}~ y(1) = \mathbf{b},$$ where, $D^\alpha, D^\beta$ represent Caputo fractional derivative, $\mathbf{a, b,c,d} \in \mathbb{R}$, $ \lambda = 1, 2$, and $f(y)$ is non linear function of $y.$ We have developed collocation method namely, uniform fractional Haar wavelet collocation method and used it to compute solutions. The proposed method combines the quasilinearization method with the Haar wavelet collocation method. In this approach, fractional Haar integrations is used to determine the linear system, which, upon solving, produces the required solution. Our findings suggest that as the values of $(\alpha, \beta)$ approach $(2,1),$ the solutions of the fractional and classical Lane-Emden become identical.</description>

      <title>Mono-cluster flocking and uniform-in-time stability of the discrete Motsch-Tadmor model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Motsch-Tadmor (MT) model is a variant of the Cucker-Smale model with a normalized communication weight function. The normalization poses technical challenges in analyzing the collective behavior due to the absence of conservation of momentum. We study three quantitative estimates for the discrete-time MT model considering the first-order Euler discretization. First, we provide a sufficient framework leading to the asymptotic mono-cluster flocking. The proposed framework is given in terms of coupling strength, communication weight function, and initial data. Second, we show that the continuous transition from the discrete MT model to the continuous MT model can be made uniformly in time using the finite-time convergence result and asymptotic flocking estimate. Third, we present uniform-in-time stability estimates for the discrete MT model. We also provide several numerical examples and compare them with analytical results.</description>

      <title>A Memory Reduction Compact Gas Kinetic Scheme on 3D Unstructured Meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a memory-reduction third-order compact gas-kinetic scheme (CGKS) for solving compressible Euler and Navier-Stokes equations on 3D unstructured meshes. The scheme utilizes a time-evolution gas distribution function to provide a time-evolution solution at cell interfaces, enabling the implementation of Hermite WENO techniques for high-order reconstruction. However, the HWENO method needs to store a coefficients matrix for the quadratic polynomial to achieve third-order accuracy, resulting in high memory usage. A novel reconstruction method, built upon HWENO reconstruction, has been designed to enhance computational efficiency and reduce memory usage compared to the original CGKS. The simple idea is that the first-order and second-order terms of the quadratic polynomials are determined in a two-step way. In the first step, the second-order terms are obtained from the reconstruction of a linear polynomial of the first-order derivatives by only using the cell-averaged slopes, since the second-order derivatives are nothing but the "derivatives of derivatives". Subsequently, the first-order terms left can be determined by the linear reconstruction only using cell-averaged values. Thus, we successfully split one quadratic least-square regression into several linear least-square regressions, which are commonly used in a second-order finite volume code. Since only a small matrix inversion is needed in a 3-D linear least-square regression, the computational cost for the new reconstruction is dramatically reduced and the storage of the reconstruction-coefficient matrix is no longer necessary. The proposed new reconstruction technique can reduce the overall computational cost by about 20 to 30 percent. The challenging large-scale unsteady numerical simulation is performed, which demonstrates that the current improvement brings the CGKS to a new level for industrial applications.</description>

      <title>Inference of Heterogeneous Material Properties via Infinite-Dimensional Integrated DIC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a scalable and efficient framework for the inference of spatially-varying parameters of continuum materials from image observations of their deformations. Our goal is the nondestructive identification of arbitrary damage, defects, anomalies and inclusions without knowledge of their morphology or strength. Since these effects cannot be directly observed, we pose their identification as an inverse problem. Our approach builds on integrated digital image correlation (IDIC, Besnard Hild, Roux, 2006), which poses the image registration and material inference as a monolithic inverse problem, thereby enforcing physical consistency of the image registration using the governing PDE. Existing work on IDIC has focused on low-dimensional parameterizations of materials. In order to accommodate the inference of heterogeneous material propertes that are formally infinite dimensional, we present $\infty$-IDIC, a general formulation of the PDE-constrained coupled image registration and inversion posed directly in the function space setting. This leads to several mathematical and algorithmic challenges arising from the ill-posedness and high dimensionality of the inverse problem. To address ill-posedness, we consider various regularization schemes, namely $H^1$ and total variation for the inference of smooth and sharp features, respectively. To address the computational costs associated with the discretized problem, we use an efficient inexact-Newton CG framework for solving the regularized inverse problem. In numerical experiments, we demonstrate the ability of $\infty$-IDIC to characterize complex, spatially varying Lam\'e parameter fields of linear elastic and hyperelastic materials. Our method exhibits (i) the ability to recover fine-scale and sharp material features, (ii) mesh-independent convergence performance and hyperparameter selection, (iii) robustness to observational noise.</description>

      <title>High order compact fully-discrete scheme for hyperbolic conversation laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the solution formula method, a series of one-step fully-discrete schemes, such as FWENO/Full-WENO has been proposed. Storing the by-products conservative variables at the half points (grid center) and using them as interpolation information to construct high-order schemes, we obtain a new class of one-step compact fully-discrete schemes. The new scheme can be associate with various non-oscillatory strategies. This paper takes state-of-the-art WENO-JS method as an example and proposes a family of compact fully-discrete WENO scheme. Detailed analysis is conducted on accuracy, errors, computational cost, efficiency and their connection with Hermite interpolation. Meanwhile, we design a new entropy flux linearization strategy for Euler equations to enhance its robustness, and also develop a multi-dimensional method for this compact fully-discrete framework. Due to the new scheme is one-step and utilizes stored by-products information for interpolation, it has a significant advantage in efficiency. For one-dimensional Euler equations, compared to the original FWENO, the computational cost only increases by 20-40%, while is approximately one-third of WENO+RK3. For two-dimensional case, a new special dimension-by-dimension strategy is applied. Although there is an additional computing cost, numerical experiments show that the new scheme only needs about 1/10 to 1/13 cost of that for WENO+RK3 when obtaining similar or even better resolution results, indicating that the new scheme is more efficient than semi-discrete schemes based on RK methods.</description>

      <title>A nonconforming P3 and discontinuous P2 mixed finite element on tetrahedral grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A nonconforming $P_3$ finite element is constructed by enriching the conforming $P_3$ finite element space with three $P_3$ nonconforming bubbles and six additional $P_4$ nonconforming bubbles, on each tetrahedron. Here the divergence of the $P_4$ bubble is not a $P_3$ polynomial, but a $P_2$ polynomial. This nonconforming $P_3$ finite element, combined with the discontinuous $P_2$ finite element, is inf-sup stable for solving the Stokes equations on general tetrahedral grids. Consequently such a mixed finite element method produces quasi-optimal solutions for solving the stationary Stokes equations. With these special $P_4$ bubbles, the discrete velocity remains locally pointwise divergence-free. Numerical tests confirm the theory.</description>

Abstract: A nonconforming $P_2$ finite element is constructed by enriching the conforming $P_2$ finite element space with seven $P_2$ nonconforming bubble functions (out of fifteen such bubble functions on each tetrahedron). This spacial nonconforming $P_2$ finite element, combined with the discontinuous $P_1$ finite element on general tetrahedral grids, is inf-sup stable for solving the Stokes equations. Consequently such a mixed finite element method produces optimal-order convergen solutions for solving the stationary Stokes equations. Numerical tests confirm the theory.</description>

      <title>General reconstruction of elastic strain fields from their Longitudinal Ray Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop an algorithm for reconstruction of elastic strain fields from their Longitudinal Ray Transform (LRT) in either two or three dimensions. In general, the LRT only determines the solenoidal part of a symmetric tensor field, but elastic strain fields additionally satisfy mechanical equilibrium, an extra condition that allows for full reconstruction in many cases. Our method provides full reconstruction for general elastic strain fields in connected objects whose boundary only contains one component, while previous results included other requirements such as no residual stress, or zero boundary traction. This allows for full reconstruction in energy resolved neutron transmission imaging for simple objects. Along the way, we prove that the LRT of a potential rank-2 tensor restricted to a bounded set determines the potential on the boundary of the set up to infinitesimal rigid motions on each component of the boundary. The method is demonstrated with numerical examples in two dimensions.</description>

      <title>Convergence analysis of Levenberg-Marquardt method with Singular Scaling for nonzero residue nonlinear least-squares problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the convergence analysis of a variant of the LevenbergMarquardt method (LMM) designed for nonlinear least-squares problems with non-zero residue. This variant, called LMM with Singular Scaling (LMMSS), allows the LMM scaling matrix to be singular, encompassing a broader class of regularizers, which has proven useful in certain applications. In order to establish local convergence results, a careful choice of the LMM parameter is made based on the gradient linearization error, dictated by the nonlinearity and size of the residual. Under completeness and local error bound assumptions we prove that the distance from an iterate to the set of stationary points goes to zero superlinearly and that the iterative sequence converges. Furthermore, we also study a globalized version of the method obtained using linesearch and prove that any limit point of the generated sequence is stationary. Some examples are provided to illustrate our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Distinct Numerical Solutions for Elliptic Cross-Interface Problems Using Finite Element and Finite Difference Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we discuss the second-order finite element method (FEM) and finite difference method (FDM) for numerically solving elliptic cross-interface problems characterized by vertical and horizontal straight lines, piecewise constant coefficients, two homogeneous jump conditions, continuous source terms, and Dirichlet boundary conditions. For brevity, we consider a 2D simplified version where the intersection points of the interface lines coincide with grid points in uniform Cartesian grids. Our findings reveal interesting and important results: (1) When the coefficient functions exhibit either high jumps with low-frequency oscillations or low jumps with high-frequency oscillations, the finite element method and finite difference method yield similar numerical solutions. (2) However, when the interface problems involve high-contrast and high-frequency coefficient functions, the numerical solutions obtained from the finite element and finite difference methods differ significantly. Given that the widely studied SPE10 benchmark problem (see https://www.spe.org/web/csp/datasets/set02.htm) typically involves high-contrast and high-frequency permeability due to varying geological layers in porous media, this phenomenon warrants attention. Furthermore, this observation is particularly important for developing multiscale methods, as reference solutions for these methods are usually obtained using the standard second-order finite element method with a fine mesh, and analytical solutions are not available. We provide sufficient details to enable replication of our numerical results, and the implementation is straightforward. This simplicity ensures that readers can easily confirm the validity of our findings.</description>

      <title>Tensor-Product Split-Simplex Summation-By-Parts Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an approach to construct efficient sparse summation-by-parts (SBP) operators on triangles and tetrahedra with a tensor-product structure. The operators are constructed by splitting the simplices into quadrilateral or hexahedral subdomains, mapping tensor-product SBP operators onto the subdomains, and assembling back using a continuous-Galerkin-type procedure. These tensor-product split-simplex operators do not have repeated degrees of freedom at the interior interfaces between the split subdomains. Furthermore, they satisfy the SBP property by construction, leading to stable discretizations. The accuracy and sparsity of the operators substantially enhance the efficiency of SBP discretizations on simplicial meshes. The sparsity is particularly important for entropy-stable discretizations based on two-point flux functions, as it reduces the number of two-point flux computations. We demonstrate through numerical experiments that the operators exhibit efficiency surpassing that of the existing dense multidimensional SBP operators by more than an order of magnitude in many cases. This superiority is evident in both accuracy per degree of freedom and computational time required to achieve a specified error threshold.</description>

      <title>Spectral Function Space Learning and Numerical Linear Algebra Networks for Solving Linear Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider solving a probably ill-conditioned linear operator equation, where the operator is not modeled by physical laws but is specified via training pairs (consisting of images and data) of the input-output relation of the operator. We derive a stable method for computing the operator, which consists of first a Gram-Schmidt orthonormalization of images and a principal component analysis of the data. This two-step algorithm provides a spectral decomposition of the linear operator. Moreover, we show that both Gram-Schmidt and principal component analysis can be written as a deep neural network, which relates this procedure to de-and encoder networks. Therefore, we call the two-step algorithm a linear algebra network. Finally, we provide numerical simulations showing the strategy is feasible for reconstructing spectral functions and for solving operator equations without explicitly exploiting the physical model.</description>

      <title>Framework for uncertainty quantification of wave-structure interaction in a flume</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10784v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we propose a numerical procedure for the quantification of uncertainties in wave-structure interaction. We utilise the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) scheme for modelling the wave mechanics, coupled one-way with a finite element method (FEM) for the structural response. Physical wave flumes are extensively used in the study of hydrodynamics especially in wave-structure interaction (WSI) and prediction of forces to near-shore structures in disaster mitigation and offshore structures in the oil and gas, and more recently renewable energy sector. Over the years, numerical wave flumes have been developed extensively to enable the modelling of complex wave-structure interaction. However, most of these studies are deterministic and limited to using either simple flexible beams or rigid monolithic structures to model the structural part in the WSI. Additionally, uncertainties are commonly observed in both wave and structural parameters and need to be accounted for. This work presents a numerical framework to enable uncertainty quantification for wave-structure interaction problems in terms of the forces experienced by the structure. A one-way coupling between SPH with the FEM and uncertainty quantification (UQ) is proposed. We employ the so-called Tokyo wave flume geometry, which has potential for future surrogate modelling in WSI. The developed model is validated using numerical and experimental results from the literature and is used to demonstrate the prediction of probabilistic responses of structures under breaking and non-breaking wave scenarios.</description>

      <title>The high resolution sampling methods for acoustic sources from multi-frequency far field patterns at sparse observation directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work is dedicated to novel uniqueness results and high resolution sampling methods for source support from multi-frequency sparse far field patterns. With a single pair of observation directions $\pm\hat{x}$, we prove that the lines $\{z\in\mathbb R^2|\, \hat{x}\cdot z = \hat{x}\cdot y, \,y\in A_{\hat{x}}\}$ can be determined by multi-frequency far field patterns at the directions $\pm\hat{x}$, where $A_{\hat{x}}$ denotes a set containing the corners of the boundary and points whose normal vector to the boundary is parallel to $\hat{x}$. Furthermore, if the source support is composed of polygons and annuluses, then we prove that the support can be determined by multi-frequency far field patterns at sparse directions. Precisely, the lowest number of the observation directions is given in terms of the number of the corners and the annuluses. Inspired by the uniqueness arguments, we introduce two novel indicators to determine the source support. Numerical examples in two dimensions are presented to show the validity and robustness of the two indicators for reconstructing the boundaries of the source support with a high resolution. The second indicator also shows its powerful ability to determine the unknown source function.</description>

      <title>Empirical risk minimization for risk-neutral composite optimal control with applications to bang-bang control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonsmooth composite optimization problems under uncertainty are prevalent in various scientific and engineering applications. We consider risk-neutral composite optimal control problems, where the objective function is the sum of a potentially nonconvex expectation function and a nonsmooth convex function. To approximate the risk-neutral optimization problems, we use a Monte Carlo sample-based approach, study its asymptotic consistency, and derive nonasymptotic sample size estimates. Our analyses leverage problem structure commonly encountered in PDE-constrained optimization problems, including compact embeddings and growth conditions. We apply our findings to bang-bang-type optimal control problems and propose the use of a conditional gradient method to solve them effectively. We present numerical illustrations.</description>

      <title>Multilevel CNNs for Parametric PDEs based on Adaptive Finite Elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A neural network architecture is presented that exploits the multilevel properties of high-dimensional parameter-dependent partial differential equations, enabling an efficient approximation of parameter-to-solution maps, rivaling best-in-class methods such as low-rank tensor regression in terms of accuracy and complexity. The neural network is trained with data on adaptively refined finite element meshes, thus reducing data complexity significantly. Error control is achieved by using a reliable finite element a posteriori error estimator, which is also provided as input to the neural network.
  The proposed U-Net architecture with CNN layers mimics a classical finite element multigrid algorithm. It can be shown that the CNN efficiently approximates all operations required by the solver, including the evaluation of the residual-based error estimator. In the CNN, a culling mask set-up according to the local corrections due to refinement on each mesh level reduces the overall complexity, allowing the network optimization with localized fine-scale finite element data.
  A complete convergence and complexity analysis is carried out for the adaptive multilevel scheme, which differs in several aspects from previous non-adaptive multilevel CNN. Moreover, numerical experiments with common benchmark problems from Uncertainty Quantification illustrate the practical performance of the architecture.</description>

      <title>Approximation Rates for Shallow ReLU$^k$ Neural Networks on Sobolev Spaces via the Radon Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^d$ be a bounded domain. We consider the problem of how efficiently shallow neural networks with the ReLU$^k$ activation function can approximate functions from Sobolev spaces $W^s(L_p(\Omega))$ with error measured in the $L_q(\Omega)$-norm. Utilizing the Radon transform and recent results from discrepancy theory, we provide a simple proof of nearly optimal approximation rates in a variety of cases, including when $q\leq p$, $p\geq 2$, and $s \leq k + (d+1)/2$. The rates we derive are optimal up to logarithmic factors, and significantly generalize existing results. An interesting consequence is that the adaptivity of shallow ReLU$^k$ neural networks enables them to obtain optimal approximation rates for smoothness up to order $s = k + (d+1)/2$, even though they represent piecewise polynomials of fixed degree $k$.</description>

      <title>An adaptive stabilized trace finite element method for surface PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03089v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper introduces an adaptive version of the stabilized Trace Finite Element Method (TraceFEM) designed to solve low-regularity elliptic problems on level-set surfaces using a shape-regular bulk mesh in the embedding space. Two stabilization variants, gradient-jump face and normal-gradient volume, are considered for continuous trace spaces of the first and second degrees, based on the polynomial families $Q_1$ and $Q_2$. We propose a practical error indicator that estimates the `jumps' of finite element solution derivatives across background mesh faces and it avoids integration of any quantities along implicitly defined curvilinear edges of the discrete surface elements. For the $Q_1$ family of piecewise trilinear polynomials on bulk cells, the solve-estimate-mark-refine strategy, combined with the suggested error indicator, achieves optimal convergence rates typical of two-dimensional problems. We also provide a posteriori error estimates, establishing the reliability of the error indicator for the $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ elements and for two types of stabilization. In numerical experiments, we assess the reliability and efficiency of the error indicator. While both stabilizations are found to deliver comparable performance,the lowest degree finite element space appears to be the more robust choice for the adaptive TraceFEM framework.</description>

      <title>Stable BDF time discretization of BGN-based parametric finite element methods for geometric flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03641v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel class of temporal high-order parametric finite element methods for solving a wide range of geometric flows of curves and surfaces. By incorporating the backward differentiation formulae (BDF) for time discretization into the BGN formulation, originally proposed by Barrett, Garcke, and N\"urnberg (J. Comput. Phys., 222 (2007), pp.~441--467), we successfully develop high-order BGN/BDF$k$ schemes. The proposed BGN/BDF$k$ schemes not only retain almost all the advantages of the classical first-order BGN scheme such as computational efficiency and good mesh quality, but also exhibit the desired $k$th-order temporal accuracy in terms of shape metrics, ranging from second-order to fourth-order accuracy. Furthermore, we validate the performance of our proposed BGN/BDF$k$ schemes through extensive numerical examples, demonstrating their high-order temporal accuracy for various types of geometric flows while maintaining good mesh quality throughout the evolution.</description>

      <title>Filtered Lie-Trotter splitting for the "good" Boussinesq equation: low regularity error estimates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11266v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a filtered Lie-Trotter splitting scheme for the ``good" Boussinesq equation and derive an error estimate for initial data with very low regularity. Through the use of discrete Bourgain spaces, our analysis extends to initial data in $H^{s}$ for $0&lt;s\leq 2$, overcoming the constraint of $s&gt;1/2$ imposed by the bilinear estimate in smooth Sobolev spaces. We establish convergence rates of order $\tau^{s/2}$ in $L^2$ for such levels of regularity. Our analytical findings are supported by numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Calibration-Based ALE Model Order Reduction for Hyperbolic Problems with Self-Similar Travelling Discontinuities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11664v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel Model Order Reduction framework that is able to handle solutions of hyperbolic problems characterized by multiple travelling discontinuities. By means of an optimization based approach, we introduce suitable calibration maps that allow us to transform the original solution manifold into a lower dimensional one. The novelty of the methodology is represented by the fact that the optimization process does not require the knowledge of the discontinuities location. The optimization can be carried out simply by choosing some reference control points, thus avoiding the use of some implicit shock tracking techniques, which would translate into an increased computational effort during the offline phase. In the online phase, we rely on a non-intrusive approach, where the coefficients of the projection of the reduced order solution onto the reduced space are recovered by means of an Artificial Neural Network. To validate the methodology, we present numerical results for the 1D Sod shock tube problem, for the 2D double Mach reflection problem, also in the parametric case, and for the triple point problem.</description>

      <title>A note on higher-order and nonlinear limiting approaches for continuously bounds-preserving discontinuous Galerkin methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12965v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In (Dzanic, J. Comp. Phys., 508:113010, 2024), a limiting approach for high-order discontinuous Galerkin schemes was introduced which allowed for imposing constraints on the solution continuously (i.e., everywhere within the element). While exact for linear constraint functionals, this approach only imposed a sufficient (but not the minimum necessary) amount of limiting for nonlinear constraint functionals. This short note shows how this limiting approach can be extended to allow exactness for general nonlinear quasiconcave constraint functionals through a nonlinear limiting procedure, reducing unnecessary numerical dissipation. Some examples are shown for nonlinear pressure and entropy constraints in the compressible gas dynamics equations, where both analytic and iterative approaches are used.</description>

      <title>Learning Stochastic Reduced Models from Data: A Nonintrusive Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05724v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A nonintrusive model order reduction method for bilinear stochastic differential equations with additive noise is proposed. A reduced order model (ROM) is designed in order to approximate the statistical properties of high-dimensional systems. The drift and diffusion coefficients of the ROM are inferred from state observations by solving appropriate least-squares problems. The closeness of the ROM obtained by the presented approach to the intrusive ROM obtained by the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) method is investigated. Two generalisations of the snapshot-based dominant subspace construction to the stochastic case are presented. Numerical experiments are provided to compare the developed approach to POD.</description>

      <title>Fredholm Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09484v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Within the family of explainable machine-learning, we present Fredholm neural networks (Fredholm NNs), deep neural networks (DNNs) which replicate fixed point iterations for the solution of linear and nonlinear Fredholm Integral Equations (FIE) of the second kind. Applications of FIEs include the solution of ordinary, as well as partial differential equations (ODEs, PDEs) and many more. We first prove that Fredholm NNs provide accurate solutions. We then provide insight into the values of the hyperparameters and trainable/explainable weights and biases of the DNN, by directly connecting their values to the underlying mathematical theory. For our illustrations, we use Fredholm NNs to solve both linear and nonlinear problems, including elliptic PDEs and boundary value problems. We show that the proposed scheme achieves significant numerical approximation accuracy across both the domain and boundary. The proposed methodology provides insight into the connection between neural networks and classical numerical methods, and we posit that it can have applications in fields such as Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). Thus, we believe that it will trigger further advances in the intersection between scientific machine learning and numerical analysis.</description>

      <title>A Correlation-induced Finite Difference Estimator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05638v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finite difference (FD) approximation is a classic approach to stochastic gradient estimation when only noisy function realizations are available. In this paper, we first provide a sample-driven method via the bootstrap technique to estimate the optimal perturbation, and then propose an efficient FD estimator based on correlated samples at the estimated optimal perturbation. Furthermore, theoretical analyses of both the perturbation estimator and the FD estimator reveal that, {\it surprisingly}, the correlation enables the proposed FD estimator to achieve a reduction in variance and, in some cases, a decrease in bias compared to the traditional optimal FD estimator. Numerical results confirm the efficiency of our estimators and align well with the theory presented, especially in scenarios with small sample sizes. Finally, we apply the estimator to solve derivative-free optimization (DFO) problems, and numerical studies show that DFO problems with 100 dimensions can be effectively solved.</description>
