      <title>Exceptional Points and Stability in Nonlinear Models of Population Dynamics having $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinearity and non-Hermiticity, for example due to environmental gain-loss processes, are a common occurrence throughout numerous areas of science and lie at the root of many remarkable phenomena. For the latter, parity-time-reflection ($\mathcal{PT}$) symmetry has played an eminent role in understanding exceptional-point structures and phase transitions in these systems. Yet their interplay has remained by-and-large unexplored. We analyze models governed by the replicator equation of evolutionary game theory and related Lotka-Volterra systems of population dynamics. These are foundational nonlinear models that find widespread application and offer a broad platform for non-Hermitian theory beyond physics. In this context we study the emergence of exceptional points in two cases: (a) when the governing symmetry properties are tied to global properties of the models, and, in contrast, (b) when these symmetries emerge locally around stationary states--in which case the connection between the linear non-Hermitian model and an underlying nonlinear system becomes tenuous. We outline further that when the relevant symmetries are related to global properties, the location of exceptional points in the linearization around coexistence equilibria coincides with abrupt global changes in the stability of the nonlinear dynamics. Exceptional points may thus offer a new local characteristic for the understanding of these systems. Tri-trophic models of population ecology serve as test cases for higher-dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum memory circuit for ion channel dynamics in the nervous system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The opening or closing mechanism of a voltage-gated ion channel is triggered by the potential difference crossing the cell membrane in the nervous system. Based on this picture, we model the ion channel as a nanoscale two-terminal ionic tunneling junction. External time-varying voltage exerting on the two-terminal ionic tunneling junction mimics the stimulation of neurons from the outside. By deriving the quantum Langevin equation from quantum mechanics, the ion channel current is obtained by the quantum tunneling of ions controlled by the time-varying voltage. The time-varying voltage induces an effective magnetic flux which causes quantum coherence in ion tunnelings and leads to sideband effects in the ion channel current dynamics. The sideband effects in the ionic current dynamics manifest a multi-crossing hysteresis in the I-V curve, which is the memory dynamics responding to the variation of the external voltage. Such memory dynamics is defined as the active quantum memory with respect to the time-varying stimuli. We can quantitatively describe how active quantum memory is generated and changed. We find that the number of the non-zero cross points in the I-V curve hysteresis and the oscillation of the differential conductance are the characteristics for quantitatively describing the active quantum memory. We also explore the temperature dependence of the active quantum memory in such a system. The discovery of this active quantum memory characteristics provides a new understanding about the underlying mechanism of ion channel dynamics.</description>

      <title>Light-Matter Interactions in Photosynthetic Protein Attached to solids and Nanostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction of light with photosynthetic proteins is an extremely efficient process and has been thoroughly investigated. However, exploring light-matter interactions in hybrid nano-solid-photosynthetic proteins is a relatively new and existing field of research. The properties of these hybrid materials significantly influence the energy levels, non-radiative energy transfer, absorption, and fluorescence of the photosynthetic proteins upon interaction with light. There is special interest in levering these light-matter interactions for applications such as photo-sensing and converting light energy to electricity. The development of efficient devices requires the formation of a junction for oriented attachment, facilitating efficient energy and electronic transfer between the solids and the proteins. This review will outline the major advancements in solid-state photosynthetic protein devices, elucidate the underlying mechanism, and assess electron transfer efficiency. Furthermore, it will explore and analyze the effect of plasmons on the enhancement of absorption, fluorescence, and photocurrent in hybrid devices.</description>

      <title>Multicellular simulations with shape and volume constraints using optimal transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17086v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many living and physical systems such as cell aggregates, tissues or bacterial colonies behave as unconventional systems of particles that are strongly constrained by volume exclusion and shape interactions. Understanding how these constraints lead to macroscopic self-organized structures is a fundamental question in e.g. developmental biology. To this end, various types of computational models have been developed. Here, we introduce a new framework based on optimal transport theory to model particle systems with arbitrary dynamical shapes and deformability properties. Our method builds upon the pioneering work of Brenier on incompressible fluids and its recent applications to materials science. It lets us specify the shapes and volumes of individual cells and supports a wide range of interaction mechanisms, while automatically taking care of the volume exclusion constraint at an affordable numerical cost. We showcase the versatility of this approach by reproducing several classical systems in computational biology.

      <title>Spectral Coarse-Graining and Rescaling for Preserving Structural and Dynamical Properties in Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a graph renormalization procedure based on the coarse-grained Laplacian, which generates reduced-complexity representations for characteristic scales identified through the spectral gap. This method retains both diffusion probabilities and large-scale topological structures, while reducing redundant information, facilitating the analysis of large graphs by decreasing the number of vertices. Applied to graphs derived from EEG recordings of human brain activity, our approach reveals macroscopic properties emerging from neuronal interactions, such as collective behavior in the form of coordinated neuronal activity. Additionally, it shows dynamic reorganization of brain activity across scales, with more generalized patterns during rest and more specialized and scale-invariant activity in the occipital lobe during attention-focused tasks.</description>

      <title>Transitions Between Cooperative and Crowding-Dominated Collective Motion in non-Jammed MDCK Monolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transitions between solid-like and fluid-like states in living tissues have been found in steps of embryonic development and in stages of disease progression. Our current understanding of these transitions has been guided by experimental and theoretical investigations focused on how motion becomes arrested with increased mechanical coupling between cells, typically as a function of packing density or cell cohesiveness. However, cells actively respond to externally applied forces by contracting after a time delay, so it is possible that at some packing densities or levels of cell cohesiveness, mechanical coupling stimulates cell motion instead of suppressing it. Here we report our findings that at low densities and within multiple ranges of cell cohesiveness, cell migration speeds increase with these measures of mechanical coupling. Our observations run counter to our intuition that cell motion will be suppressed by increasingly packing or sticking cells together and may provide new insight into biological processes involving motion in dense cell populations.</description>

      <title>Temporal instability of the frontier between mechanically regulated tissues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07569v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The stability of the boundary between regenerating tissues is essential to the maintenance of their integrity and biological function. Stress is known to play an important role in the regulation of cell division, cell growth and cell death, and it is thought that stress balance ensures the stability of tissue boundaries. Using a multicellular numerical model, we investigate the stability of the frontier between two confluent cell monolayers whose cell renewal is mechanically regulated. We show that even for two tissues having similar mechanical and biological properties, the location of their common frontier is subject to strong fluctuations until the complete disappearance of one of the tissues. Using a population dynamics model, we show that this temporal instability is inherent to the stochasticity of cell division and cell death events, and derive an analytical expression for the mean disappearance time of a tissue. These results call for a rethinking of the regulating mechanism of tissue renewal.</description>

      <title>Designing complex behaviors using transition-based allosteric self-assembly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17807v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Allosteric interactions occur when binding at one part of a complex affects the interactions at another part. Allostery offers a high degree of control in multi-species processes, and these interactions play a crucial role in many biological and synthetic contexts. Leveraging allosteric principles in synthetic systems holds great potential for designing materials and systems that can autonomously adapt, reconfigure, or replicate. In this work we establish a basic allosteric model and develop an intuitive design process, which we demonstrate by constructing systems to exhibit four different complex behaviors: controlled fiber growth, shape-shifting, sorting, and self-replication. In order to verify that the systems evolve according to the pathways we have developed, we also calculate and measure key length and time scales. Our findings demonstrate that with minimal interaction rules, allosteric systems can be engineered to achieve sophisticated emergent behaviors, opening new avenues for the design of responsive and adaptive materials.</description>
