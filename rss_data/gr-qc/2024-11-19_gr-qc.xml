      <title>Singularity resolution in spherically reduced 2D semiclassical gravity with negative central charge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the semiclassical Schwarzschild geometry in the Boulware quantum state in the framework of two-dimensional (2D) dilaton gravity. The classical model is defined by the spherical reduction of Einstein's gravity sourced with conformal scalar fields. The expectation value of the stress-energy tensor in the Boulware state is singular at the classical horizon of the Schwarzschild spacetime, but when backreaction effects are considered, previous results have shown that the 2D geometry is horizonless and described by a non-symmetric wormhole with a curvature singularity on the other side of the throat. In this work we show that reversing the sign of the central charge of the conformal matter removes the curvature singularity of the 2D backreacted geometry, which happens to be horizonless and asymptotically flat. This result is consistent with a similar analysis recently performed for the CGHS model. We also argue the physical significance of negative central charges in conformal anomalies from a four-dimensional perspective.</description>

      <title>Insights into Binary Neutron Star Merger Simulations: A Multi-Code Comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational Wave (GW) signals from Binary Neutron Star (BNS) mergers provide critical insights into the properties of matter under extreme conditions. Due to the scarcity of observational data, Numerical Relativity (NR) simulations are indispensable for exploring these phenomena. However, simulating BNS mergers is a formidable challenge, and ensuring the consistency, reliability or convergence, especially in the post-merger, remains a work in progress. In this paper we assess the performance of current BNS merger simulations by analyzing open-source GW waveforms from five leading NR codes - SACRA, BAM, THC, Whisky amd SpEC. We focus on the accuracy of these simulations and on the effect of the equation of state (EOS) on waveform predictions. We first check if different codes give similar results for similar initial data, then apply two methods to calculate convergence and quantify discretization errors. Lastly, we perform a thorough investigation into the effect of tidal interactions on key frequencies in the GW spectrum. We introduce a novel quasi-universal relation for the transient post-merger time, enhancing our understanding of remnant dynamics in this region. This detailed analysis clarifies agreements and discrepancies between these leading NR codes, and highlights necessary improvements for the advanced accuracy requirements of future GW detectors.</description>

      <title>Pilot-wave theory and the search for new physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show how pilot-wave theory points to new physics, beyond quantum mechanics, in three distinct ways. First, generalised cosmological initial conditions, departing from the Born rule, can lead to observable anomalies in the cosmic microwave background and in relic cosmological particles. Second, a breakdown of the Born rule in the deep quantum-gravity regime, with gravitational corrections that render the Born rule semiclassically unstable, can create anomalies in Hawking radiation from evaporating black holes. Third, a regularised equation of motion that remains finite at nodes of the wave function generates corrections to the Born rule at short distances, while a natural time-dependent generalisation implies an instability of quantum equilibrium at short times, effects which may be observable in high-energy collisions.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Lensing and Deflection Angle by generalised Ellis-Bronnikov wormhole Embedded in Warped Braneworld Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Null-trajectories, deflection angle, and gravitational lensing are studied in the background spacetime of the generalised Ellis-Bronnikov wormholes and it's five dimensional version embedded in a warped background. We show that these wormholes can be distinguished through the study of gravitational lensing. In particular, the difference in deflection angles, radius of the Einstein rings, and the image positions are quantified by the wormhole parameters -- the steepness constant ($m\geq 2$), the throat radius, and `$\delta$' that characterizes the warping in extra dimension. We demonstrate our results analytically with $m=2$ cases and graphically otherwise.</description>

      <title>Rips and regular future scenario with Holographic Dark Energy: A comprehensive look</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interest on the possible future scenarios the universe could have has grew substantially with breakthroughs on late-time acceleration. Holographic dark energy (HDE) presents a very interesting approach towards addressing late-time acceleration, presenting an intriguing interface of ideas from quantum gravity and cosmology. In this work we present an extensive discussion of possible late-time scenarios, focusing on rips and similar events, in a universe with holographic dark energy. We discuss these events in the realm of the generalized Nojiri-Odintsov cutoff and also for the more primitive holographic cutoffs like Hubble, particle and event horizon cutoffs. We also discuss the validity of the generalized second law of thermodynamics and various energy conditions in these regimes. Our work points towards the idea that it is not possible to have alternatives of the big rip consistently in the simpler HDE cutoffs, and shows the flexibility of the generalized HDE cutoff as well.</description>

      <title>Connection between gravity and quantum mechanics: an algebraic approach to cosmological issues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents an algebraic framework to explore the fundamental relationship between gravity and quantum mechanics, with particular emphasis on the role of primordial black holes (PBHs) in cosmology. Through the concept of self-gravitating condensed light, specifically in the form of a photon Bose-Einstein condensate, this work examines the quantum attributes of PBHs and their implications for early universe dynamics, baryogenesis, and the formation of large-scale structures. The model also investigates quantized characteristics of black holes, such as mass, entropy, and temperature, suggesting that quantum processes are fundamental to black hole mechanics. By addressing issues like the cosmological constant problem and the information loss paradox, this work provides insights into Planck-scale physics and proposes that PBHs may serve as a bridge between quantum theory and general relativity. This study ultimately posits that understanding black hole physics is essential to resolving major cosmological and astrophysical paradoxes for the ultimate unification of quantum mechanics with gravity.</description>

      <title>CRT gauge symmetry in two-sheet de Sitter universes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show how to understand CRT symmetry as gauge symmetry in holographic de Sitter universe involving a pair of mirror universes, in which frame there are two times going in two opposite temporal directions each. The CRT symmetry is global with respect to the big bang for these two-sheet universes. In this construction the presence of an observer is equivalent to taking a CRT gauge, thus breaks the global CRT symmetry. In de Sitter space the observer need not to carry a clock, as the clock is equivalent to a way telling the temporal order of events. The role of a clock can be replaced by redshift, like in FLRW cosmology, points to the adaptability of measurement in cosmological contexts. This concept drives us to write gauge invariant formulas, i.e. correlation function [O(t-w),O(-t-w)]=0 identically for w the time from the observer to big bang. In this spirit, the gauge invariant formula overlaps with the fact that the Hilbert space is real in holographic de Sitter universe. The observer is highly entangled with the rest of the universe in a thermofield double state, thus contributes to no extra degrees of freedom. We show that the time $w$ to the big bang is not real singularity, but an unavoidable focus point along the timelike geodesic congruence of the observer. Our result highlights the role of observer in understanding quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Continuous gravitational waves from thermal mountains on accreting neutron stars: effect of the nuclear pasta phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As density increases, the shape of nuclei transitions to non-spherical ``nuclear pasta" structures. The physical properties of the nuclear pasta, such as thermal conductivity and elasticity, have implications for detecting continuous gravitational waves from a rapidly rotating neutron star. In this work, we investigate the effect of the nuclear pasta on the quadruple moment, and find out that, compared with previous work, the quadrupole moment contributing to continuous gravitational-wave radiation can be up to two orders of magnitude larger. We also discuss the relationship between the quadruple moment and the maximum shear strain. Considering the properties of nuclear pasta, we study the detectability of known accreting neutron stars and compare predicted results to the detectable amplitude limits. These sources are well above the sensitivity curves for Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope detectors. Our work advances the understanding of the properties of nuclear pasta and a possible mechanism for continuous gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Quantization of Palatini Action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Palatini action is based on vector-valued one forms or frames and SL(2,C) connections on R^4. Using the spacetime split of R^4 as a direct sum of R^3 and R^1, the Gauss law in this paper is treated on a Hilbert space. This is achieved by noting that quantum operators act on a complex Hilbert space and SL(2,C) is just the complexification of the compact SU(2) in the self-dual (1/2,0) representation used for the Ashtekar variables. This observation enables a treatment of small and large gauge transformations and superselection sectors. An explicit representation of theta vacua and their attendant 'spin-isospin mixing' are also shown. It is argued that the Gauss law algebra replaces that of diffeomorphisms in the Palatini approach : operators implementing the latter with the correct algebraic relations do not seem available. (Those obtained by multiplying Gauss law operators with fields do not have the correct commutators.)</description>

      <title>Stability of the spacetime of a magnetized compact object</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the stability of scalar perturbations around a magnetized stationary compact object in General Relativity. The considered object is one of the simplest exact solutions of Einstein electrovacuum equations corresponding to a spheroidal body endowed with a dipole magnetic moment. It is effectively constructed by imposing a perfect reflection (mirror) boundary condition on a central region of the Gutsunaev-Manko spacetime. A time-domain analysis of the perturbations reveals a quasinormal phase followed by a power-law decaying tail. Our findings suggest that the exterior region of the magnetized compact object is stable in the entire parameter space. Moreover, the system tends to become generically more stable the stronger the magnetization of the central object is. Such findings can be useful for the qualitative understanding of more realistic astrophysical situations involving highly magnetized sources.</description>

      <title>Degrees of Freedom of New General Relativity 2: Type 4, Type 7, and Type 9</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the degrees of freedom of New General Relativity. This theory is a three-parameter theory and is classified into nine irreducible types according to the rotation symmetry of $SO(3)$ on each leaf of ADM-foliation. In the previous work~[{\it 2410.15056[gr-qc]}], we investigated the degrees of freedom in types of NGR that are interests for describing gravity: Type 2, Type 3, Type 5, and Type 8. In this work, we focus on unveiling those numbers in all other types to complete the analysis of NGR. After providing the Hamiltonian formulation of NGR, we perform the analysis on Type 4, Type 7, and Type 9 according to the method that is provided in the previous work~[{\it 2410.15056[gr-qc]}]. Then we unveil that the degrees of freedom of Type 4, Type 7, and Type 9 are five, null, and three, respectively. Type 4 and Type 9 have second-class constraint densities only. Type 7 has first-class constraint densities only, but which is over constraint. In every type, no bifurcation occurs unlikely to Type 8 in the previous work~[2410.15056[gr-qc]]. Finally, we summarize this work and give a concluding remark for this series of works.</description>

      <title>Comparing geometric and gravitational particle production in Jordan and Einstein frames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore cosmological particle production associated with inflationary fluctuations by comparing gravitational and geometric mechanisms, within a non-minimal Yukawa-like coupling between a inflaton and spacetime curvature. We show under which circumstances the number of geometric particles is comparable to the purely gravitational contribution by introducing the S-matrix formalism and approximating the inflationary potentials through power series. Despite the geometric production is a second-order effect, we show that it cannot be neglected \emph{a priori}, emphasizing that throughout inflation we do expect geometric particles to form as well as in the reheating phase. This result is investigated in both the Jordan and Einstein frames, selecting inflationary potentials supported by the Planck Satellite outcomes, \textit{i.e.}, the Starobinsky, hilltop, $\alpha$-attractor, and natural inflationary paradigms. We notice that, for large field approaches, the only feasible coupling may occur in case of extremely small field-curvature coupling constants, while the small field frameworks, namely the hilltop and $\alpha$-attractor models with quartic behavior, are essentially ruled out since they do not appear dynamically viable. We then point out that, while dynamically there exists a net equivalence between the Jordan and Einstein frames, the number of particles appears quite different passing from a representation to another one, thus pointing out the existence of a possible \emph{quantum frame issue}. In summary, while the classical inflationary dynamics is equivalently described in the Jordan and Einstein frames, a viable physical description of particle production valid in both the frames may be hindered by the absence of a complete quantum gravity. The latter could therefore be seen as missing puzzle to address the longstanding challenge of consistently passing between the two frames.</description>

      <title>Overtones and Nonlinearities in Binary Black Hole Ringdowns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using high-accuracy numerical relativity waveforms, we confirm the presence of numerous overtones of the $\ell=2$, $m=2$ quasinormal mode early in the ringdown of binary black hole mergers. We do this by demonstrating the stability of the mode amplitudes at different fit times, ruling out the possibility that a linear superposition of modes unphysically fits a highly nonlinear part of the waveform. We also find a number of previously unidentified subdominant second-order quasinormal modes in the $(2,2)$ mode. Even though these modes are mathematically nonlinear, they nevertheless confirm the validity of perturbation theory as a good approximation for describing much of the ringdown.</description>

      <title>The no-hair theorems at work in M87$^\ast$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, a perturbative calculation to the first post-Newtonian order has shown that the analytically worked out Lense-Thirring precession of the orbital angular momentum of a test particle following a circular path around a massive spinning primary is able to explain the measured features of the jet precession of the supermassive black hole at the centre of the giant elliptical galaxy M87. It is shown that also the hole's mass quadrupole moment $Q_2$, as given by the no-hair theorems, has a dynamical effect which cannot be neglected, as, instead, done so far in the literature. New allowed regions for the hole's dimensionless spin parameter $a^\ast$ and the effective radius $r_0$ of the accretion disk, assumed tightly coupled with the jet, are obtained by including both the Lense-Thirring and the quadrupole effects in the dynamics of the effective test particle modeling the accretion disk. One obtains that, by numerically integrating the resulting averaged equations for the rates of change of the angles $\eta$ and $\phi$ characterizing the orientation of the orbital angular momentum with $a^\ast = +0.98$ and $r_0=14.1$ gravitational radii, it is possible to reproduce, both quantitatively and qualitatively, the time series for them recently measured with the Very Long Baseline Interferometry technique. Instead, the resulting time series produced with $a^\ast = -0.95$ and $r_0=16$ gravitational radii turn out to be out of phase with respect to the observationally determined ones, while maintaining the same amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Perturbations with bulk viscosity in modified chaplygin gas cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work, we investigate cosmological perturbations of viscous modified chaplygin gas model. Using 1 + 3 covariant formalism, we define covariant and gauge invariant gradient variables, which after the application of scalar decomposition and harmonic decomposition techniques together with redshift transformation method, provide the energy overdensity perturbation equations in redshift space, responsible for large scale structure formation. In order to analyse the effect of the viscous modified chaplygin gas model on matter overdensity contrast, we numerically solve the perturbation equations in both long and short wavelength limits. The numerical results show that the energy overdensity contrast decays with redshift. However, the perturbations which include amplitude effects due to the viscous modified chaplygin model do differ remarkably from those in the {\Lambda}CDM. In the absence of viscous modified chaplygin model, the results reduce to those of {\Lambda}CDM.</description>

      <title>A coordinate-free approach to obtaining exact solutions in general relativity: The Newman-Unti-Tamburino solution revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Newman-Unti-Tamburino (NUT) solution is characterized as the unique Petrov Type $D$ vacuum metric such that the two double principal null directions form an integrable distribution. The uniqueness of the NUT is established by evaluating the integrability conditions of the Newman-Penrose equations up to $SL(2,C)$ transformations, resulting in a coordinate-free characterization of the solution.</description>

      <title>All symmetry groups of pp-waves in teleparallel gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We elaborate on and further develop an approach to determining the teleparallel analogue of spacetimes in General Relativity (GR) by studying the Teleparallel analogue of pp-Wave (TppW) spacetimes. This relies on using the fact that these solutions belong to the Vanishing Scalar Invariant (VSI) subclass for which the explicit forms of the frame and spin-connection are known. By identifying the pp-wave (ppW) metric within this class, we are able to use frame based symmetry methods and the Cartan-Karlhede (CK) algorithm to determine the necessary form for the frame. Through this analysis we find two overlooked solutions that are permitted in teleparallel gravity (TPG) and in GR.</description>

      <title>What happens to topological invariants (and black holes) in singularity-free theories?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Potentials arising in ultraviolet-completed field theories can be devoid of singularities, and hence render spacetimes simply connected. This challenges the notion of topological invariants considered in such scenarios. We explore the classical implications for (i) electrodynamics in flat spacetime, (ii) ultrarelativistic gyratonic solutions of weak-field gravity, and (iii) exact electro-vacuum black hole solutions in general relativity. In linear theories, regularity spoils the character of topological invariants and leads to radius-dependent Aharanov--Bohm phases, which are potentially observable for large winding numbers. In general relativity, the physics is richer: The electromagnetic field can be regular and maintain its usual topological invariants, and the resulting geometry is a Reissner--Nordstr\"om black hole with a spacetime region of coordinate radius $\sim q^2/(GM)$ cut out. This guarantees the regularity of linear and quadratic curvature invariants ($\mathcal{R}$ and $\mathcal{R}^2$), but does not resolve singularities in invariants such as $\mathcal{R}^p\Box^n \mathcal{R}^q$, reflected by conical or solid angle defects. This motivates that gravitational models beyond general relativity need to be considered. These connections between regularity (= UV properties of field theories) and topological invariants (= IR observables) may hence present an intriguing avenue to search for traces of new physics and identify promising modified gravity theories.</description>

      <title>Holographic bounce cosmological models induced by viscous dark fluid from a generalized non-singular entropy function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bounce cosmological models containing a dark viscous fluid in a spatially flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) universe are considered. The universe evolution is described in terms of generalized equation of state (EoS) parameters, in presence of the bulk viscosity. Entropic cosmology plays a key role in the discussion, and the matter bounce behavior is described based on a non-singular, generalized entropy function, recently proposed by Odintsov and Paul. Three different forms for the scale factor are investigated: an exponential, a power-law, and a double-exponential function, respectively. Appropriate bounce cosmological models are formulated, via the relevant parameters of the modified EoS, and analytical expressions for the corresponding infrared cut-off are obtained, via the particle horizon. Results are displayed in holographic form, making use of generalized holographic cut-offs first introduced by Nojiri and Odintsov. In addition, the viability of the corresponding bounce cosmological models is investigated, taking into account the actual thermodynamic properties of our universe, by means of a no-singular, generalized entropy function. In the asymptotic case, an expression for the generalized entropy is obtained, which remarkably has the additivity property.</description>

      <title>Kepler frequency and moment of inertia of rotating neutron stars with chaotic magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rotating neutron stars (NSs) are crucial objects of study, as our understanding of them relies significantly on observational data from these rotating stars. Observations suggest that the magnetic fields of NSs range from approximately $10^{8-15}$ G. In this work, we compute the Kepler frequency and moment of inertia for rotating NSs under the influence of a chaotic magnetic field. We utilize an equation of state (EOS) incorporating nuclei in the crust and hyperons in the core, with the Hartle-Thorne formalism applied to address the rotational aspects. A magnetic field ansatz is selected, in which the magnetic field is coupled to the energy density. To examine the impact of a chaotic magnetic field on the Kepler frequency and moment of inertia, we vary the magnetic field strength. Our results indicate that an increase in magnetic field strength enhances the Kepler frequency of rotating NSs. For the moment of inertia, the effect of magnetic field variation is minimal at lower masses but becomes more pronounced as the mass exceeds $M=0.5 M_\odot$, where moment of inertia increases with increasing magnetic field. Furthermore, our results for the moment of inertia comply with constraint derived from pulsar mass measurements, data from gravitational wave events GW170817 and GW190425, and X-ray observations of emission from hotspots on NS surfaces measured by NICER.</description>

      <title>The new higher-order generalized uncertainty principle and primordial big bang nucleosynthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As an important class of quantum gravity models, the generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) plays an important role in exploring the properties of cosmology and its related problems. In this paper, we explore the influence of the higher-order GUP on the primordial big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN). Firstly, based on a new higher-order GUP, we derived the Friedmann equations influenced by quantum gravity and the corresponding thermodynamic properties of the universe. Then, according to these modifications, we investigate BBN within the framework of GUP. Finally, combining the observational bounds of the primordial light element abundances, we constrain the bounds on deformation parameters of the new higher-order GUP. The results show that GUP has a significant effect on the BBN of the universe. Moreover, due to the unique properties of the higher-order GUP, it is found that value of the deformation parameter can be both positive and negative, which is different from the classical case.</description>

      <title>On causality and its violation in $f(R,\lm,T)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, $f(R,\lm, T)$ gravity is considered. It is a generalization of the theories $f(R,T)$ and $f(R, \lm)$. This modified theory of gravity exhibits strong geometry-matter coupling. The problem of causality and its violation is verified in this model. Such analysis is carried out using G\"{o}del-type solutions considering different types of matter. It is shown that this model allows both causal and non-causal solutions. These solutions depend directly on the content of matter present in the universe. For the non-causal solution, a critical radius is calculated, beyond which causality is violated. Taking different matter contents, an infinite critical radius emerges that leads to a causal solution. To obtain a causal solution, a natural relationship arises between the parameters of the theory.</description>

      <title>Perturbations of Black Holes Surrounded by Anisotropic Matter Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our research aims to probe the anisotropic matter field around black holes using black hole perturbation theory. Black holes in the universe are usually surrounded by matter or fields, and it is important to study the perturbation and the characteristic modes of a black hole that coexists with such a matter field. In this study, we focus on a family of black hole solutions to Einstein's equations that extend the Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m spacetime to include an anisotropic matter field. In addition to mass and charge, this type of black hole possesses additional hair due to the negative radial pressure of the anisotropic matter. We investigate the perturbations of the massless scalar and electromagnetic fields and calculate the quasinormal modes (QNMs). We also study the critical orbits around the black hole and their properties to investigate the connection between the eikonal QNMs, black hole shadow radius, and Lyapunov exponent. Additionally, we analyze the grey-body factors and scattering coefficients using the perturbation results. Our findings indicate that the presence of anisotropic matter fields leads to a splitting in the QNM frequencies compared to the Schwarzschild case. This splitting feature is also reflected in the shadow radius, Lyapunov exponent, and grey-body factors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an exact solution to standard model hydrodynamic cosmological perturbation theory in a matter-dominated era that is taken to be adiabatic. The solution is in the form of hypergeometric functions. While such functions can oscillate they do not appear to oscillate with the acoustic sound velocity. We show that for the model the hydrodynamic assumption is only valid at low frequencies, with viscous effects being needed in order to maintain the covariant conservation of the perturbed energy-momentum tensor.</description>

      <title>Impact of correlated magnetic noise on directional stochastic gravitational-wave background searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One potential factor that could impede searches for the stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB), arising from the incoherent superposition of a multitude of weak and unresolvable gravitational-wave signals in the Universe, is correlated magnetic noise at Earth-scale distances, such as the Schumann resonances. As the sensitivity of terrestrial detectors to SGWBs increases, these effects are expected to become even more pronounced, emphasizing the importance of considering correlated noise sources in SGWB searches. In this study, we explore for the first time the impact of this class of noise on anisotropic SGWB searches. We focus on the low-frequency range of 20-200 Hz with a resolution of 1/32 Hz, using data from the LEMI-120 and Metronix MFS-06e magnetometers, located at the sites of the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo interferometers, respectively, during the third observing run. These measurements were then compared with the directional upper limit derived from gravitational-wave data collected during the third observing run of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration. The results indicate that the magnetic noise correlations are below the interferometers' sensitivity level during the O3 observing run. The potential impact of magnetic correlations on the Advanced LIGO detectors has also been investigated at the A+ design sensitivity level.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that an electric-magnetic duality transformation is a symmetry of the classical source-free Maxwell theory in generic spacetimes. This provides a conserved Noether charge, physically related to the polarization state of the electromagnetic field. We argue that this conservation law fails to hold at the quantum level in presence of a background classical gravitational field with non-trivial dynamics, as determined by the Chern-Pontryagin scalar. This is the spin 1 analog of the chiral anomaly for massless Dirac fermions.</description>

      <title>Running gravitational constant induced dark energy as a solution to $\sigma_8$ tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05965v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a modified gravity model with a running gravitational constant coupled to a varying dark energy fluid and test its imprint on the growth of structure in the universe. Using Redshift Space Distortion (RSD) measurement results, we show a tension at the $3 \sigma$ level between the best fit $\Lambda$CDM and the corresponding parameters obtained from the Planck data. Unlike many modified gravity-based solutions that overlook scale dependence and model-specific background evolution, we study this problem in the broadest possible context by incorporating both factors into our investigation. We performed a full perturbation analysis to demonstrate a scale dependence in the growth equation. Fixing the scale to $k = 0.1 h$ Mpc$^{-1}$ and introducing a phenomenological functional form for the varying Newton coupling $G$ with only one free parameter, we conduct a likelihood analysis of the RSD selected data. The analysis reveals that the model can bring the tension level within $1 \sigma$ while maintaining the deviation of $G$ from Newton's gravitational constant at the fifth order.</description>

      <title>Deep Neural Emulation of the Supermassive Black-hole Binary Population</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While supermassive black-hole (SMBH)-binaries are not the only viable source for the low-frequency gravitational wave background (GWB) signal evidenced by the most recent pulsar timing array (PTA) data sets, they are expected to be the most likely. Thus, connecting the measured PTA GWB spectrum and the underlying physics governing the demographics and dynamics of SMBH-binaries is extremely important. Previously, Gaussian processes (GPs) and dense neural networks have been used to make such a connection by being built as conditional emulators; their input is some selected evolution or environmental SMBH-binary parameters and their output is the emulated mean and standard deviation of the GWB strain ensemble distribution over many Universes. In this paper, we use a normalizing flow (NF) emulator that is trained on the entirety of the GWB strain ensemble distribution, rather than only mean and standard deviation. As a result, we can predict strain distributions that mirror underlying simulations very closely while also capturing frequency covariances in the strain distributions as well as statistical complexities such as tails, non-Gaussianities, and multimodalities that are otherwise not learnable by existing techniques. In particular, we feature various comparisons between the NF-based emulator and the GP approach used extensively in past efforts. Our analyses conclude that the NF-based emulator not only outperforms GPs in the ease and computational cost of training but also outperforms in the fidelity of the emulated GWB strain ensemble distributions.</description>

      <title>Star Log-extended eMulation: a method for efficient computation of the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10556v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We emulate the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations, including tidal deformability, for neutron stars using a novel hybrid method based upon the Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) for the first time. This new method, which we call Star Log-extended eMulation (SLM), utilizes the underlying logarithmic behavior of the differential equations to enable accurate emulation of the nonlinear system. We show predictions for well-known phenomenological equations of state (EOS) with fixed parameters and with a freely-varying parametric Quarkyonic EOS. Our results produce a significant computational speed-up of $\approx 3 \times 10^4$ compared to high fidelity (HF) calculations using standard Runge-Kutta methods, providing an efficient emulator for the numerous TOV evaluations required by multi-messenger astrophysical frameworks that infer constraints on the EOS from neutron star mergers. The ability of the SLM algorithm to learn a mapping between parameters of the EOS and subsequent neutron star properties also opens up potential extensions for assisting in computationally prohibitive uncertainty quantification (UQ) for any type of EOS. The source code for the methods developed in this work will be openly available in a public GitHub repository for community modification and use.</description>

      <title>Bulk Motions in the Black Hole Jet Sheath as a Candidate for the Comptonizing Corona</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By means of two-dimensional general relativistic resistive magnetohydrodynamic simulations, we investigate the properties of the sheath separating the black hole jet from the surrounding medium. We find that the electromagnetic power flowing through the jet sheath is comparable to the overall accretion power, and is an important site of energy dissipation as revealed by the copious appearance of reconnection layers and plasmoid chains: $\sim20\%$ of the radially flowing electromagnetic power is found to be dissipated between 2 and 10 $R_{\rm g}$. The plasma in these dissipation regions moves along a nearly paraboloidal surface with trans-relativistic bulk motions dominated by the radial component, whose dimensionless 4-velocity is $\sim1.2\pm0.5$. In the frame moving with the mean (radially-dependent) velocity, the distribution of stochastic bulk motions resembles a Maxwellian with an `effective bulk temperature' of $\sim$100 keV. Scaling the global simulation to Cygnus X-1 parameters gives a rough estimate of the Thomson optical depth across the jet sheath $\sim0.01-0.1$, and it may increase in future magnetohydrodynamic simulations with self-consistent radiative losses. These properties suggest that the dissipative jet sheath may be a viable `coronal' region, capable of upscattering seed thermal X-ray photons ($\sim$1 keV) into a hard, nonthermal tail, as seen during the hard states of X-ray binaries and active galactic nuclei.</description>

      <title>Neutrino oscillation in the presence of background classical sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The presence of background classical sources affects a quantum field theory significantly in different ways. Neutrino oscillation is a phenomenon that confirms that neutrinos are massive fermions in nature, a celebrated result in modern physics. Neutrino oscillation plays an important role in many astrophysical observations. However, the interactions between the background classical sources with neutrinos are not often considered. In the present article, we show the effect of some classical sources, namely matter currents, electromagnetic waves, torsion, and gravitational waves on neutrino oscillation. It is shown explicitly that the above sources can change the helicity state of neutrinos during neutrino oscillation.</description>

      <title>Shear transport in far-from-equilibrium isotropization of supersymmetric Yang-Mills plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We holographically study the far-from-equilibrium isotropization dynamics of the strongly coupled $\mathcal{N}=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills plasma. The dual gravitational background is driven to be out of equilibrium and anisotropic by a time-dependent change in boundary conditions. At late times, the system relaxes and asymptotically approaches a static configuration. The large initial energy densities accelerate the isotropization significantly compared to the initial geometry corresponding to the supersymmetric Yang-Mills vacuum. We analyze shear transport during isotropization by directly computing the time-dependent stress tensor, which is now a nonlinear function of the shear rate. The shear viscosity far from equilibrium displays much richer dynamics than its near-equilibrium counterpart. Moreover, we uncover that the equilibrium viscosity-to-entropy ratio at late times depends on the details of the quench function and the initial data, which could be due to a resummation of the hydrodynamic description. In particular, this ratio can be parametrically smaller than the Kovtun-Son-Starinets bound calculated from linear response theory.</description>

      <title>Anisotropy in Pantheon+ supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We employ Maximum Likelihood Estimators to examine the Pantheon+ catalogue of Type Ia supernovae for large scale anisotropies in the expansion rate of the Universe. The analyses are carried out in the heliocentric frame, the CMB frame, as well as the Local Group frame. In all frames, the Hubble expansion rate in the redshift range 0.023 &lt; z &lt; 0.15 is found to have a statistically significant dipolar variation exceeding 1.5 km/s/Mpc, i.e. bigger than the claimed 1% uncertainty in the SH0ES measurement of the Hubble parameter H_0. The deceleration parameter too has a redshift-dependent dipolar modulation at &gt;5 sigma significance, consistent with previous findings using the SDSSII/SNLS3 Joint Lightcurve Analysis catalogue. The inferred cosmic acceleration cannot therefore be due to a Cosmological Constant, but is probably an apparent (general relativistic) effect due to the anomalous bulk flow in our local Universe.</description>

      <title>Black Holes and Baryon Number Violation: Unveiling the Origins of Early Galaxies and the Low-Mass Gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose that modifications to the Higgs potential within a narrow atmospheric layer near the event horizon of an astrophysical black hole could significantly enhance the rate of sphaleron transitions, as well as transform the Chern-Simons number into a dynamic variable. As a result, sphaleron transitions in this region occur without suppression, in contrast to low-temperature conditions, and each transition may generate a substantially greater baryon number than would be produced by winding around the Higgs potential in Minkowski spacetime. This effect amplifies baryon number violation near the black hole horizon, potentially leading to a considerable generation of matter. Given the possibility of a departure from equilibrium during the absorption of matter and the formation of relativistic jets in supermassive black holes, we conjecture that this process could contribute to the creation of a significant amount of matter around such black holes. This phenomenon may offer an alternative explanation for the rapid growth of supermassive black holes and their surrounding galaxies in the early Universe, as suggested by recent observations from the JWST. Furthermore, this mechanism may provide insights into the low-mass gap puzzle, addressing the observed scarcity of black holes with masses near the Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit.</description>

      <title>Collective field theory of gauged multi-matrix models: Integrating out off-diagonal strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a two-matrix toy model with a BFSS-like interaction term using the collective field formalism. The main technical simplification is obtained by gauge-fixing first, and integrating out the off-diagonal elements, before changing to the collective field variable. We show that the resulting (2+1)-dimensional collective field action has novel features with respect to non-locality, and that we need to add a mass term to get a time-local potential. As is expected, one recovers the single matrix quantum mechanical collective field Hamiltonian in the proper limit.</description>

      <title>The Odd-Parity Part of the Observed Galaxy Trispectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently the galaxy matter density 4-point correlation function has been looked at to investigate parity violation in large scale structure surveys. The 4-point correlation function is the lowest order statistic which is sensitive to parity violation, since a tetrahedron is the simplest shape that cannot be superimposed on its mirror image by a rotation. If the parity violation is intrinsic in nature, this could give us a window into inflationary physics. However, we need to exhaust all other contaminations before we consider them to be intrinsic. Even though the standard Newtonian redshift-space distortions are parity symmetric, the full relativistic picture is not. Therefore, we expect a parity-odd trispectrum when observing in redshift space. We calculate the trispectrum with the leading-order relativistic effects and investigate in detail the parameter space of the trispectrum and the effects of these relativistic corrections for different parameter values and configurations. We also look at different surveys and how the evolution and magnification biases can be affected by different parameter choices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent computations in gravity suggest that non-supersymmetric extremal black holes lack any sizeable ground state degeneracy. We confirm this for D-brane description of non-supersymmetric 4-charge extremal black holes in N=8 string theory. The microscopic description comprises four stacks of D-branes wrapping various cycles of the internal six-torus and intersecting at a point. The orientations of the stacks are such that supersymmetry is broken completely. We construct the low energy worldline Lagrangian for the brane system, which is seen to have 32 Goldstinos and 28 Goldstones. The Hamiltonian has a unique ground state, which carries a non-zero energy implying the absence of any truly extremal state.</description>

      <title>Implication of preheating on gravity assisted baryogenesis in $R^2$-Higgs inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of preheating on baryogenesis in $R^2$-Higgs inflation. In this scenario, the inclusion of a dimension-six operator ${(R/ \Lambda^2)} B_{\mu\nu} \widetilde{B}^{\mu\nu} $ abundantly generates helical hypermagnetic fields during inflation, leading to a baryon asymmetric Universe at the electroweak crossover. Focusing on the $R^2$-like regime, we first derive the relevant dynamics of preheating using a doubly-covariant formalism. We find that preheating can happen for the Higgs, transverse gauge and Goldstone bosons, however, it is dependent on the value of the non-minimal coupling $\xi_H$ between the Standard Model Higgs field and the Ricci scalar. We identify the preheating temperature to determine the appropriate scale $\Lambda$ for driving baryogenesis, which is around $\Lambda \sim 2.2 \, (2.6) \times 10^{-5}\, M_{\rm P}$ for $\xi_H \sim 1 \, (10)$. Our results represent the most accurate estimation of the scale of gravity induced baryogenesis in $R^2$-Higgs inflation to date. Areas for further improvement are identified.</description>

      <title>Beyond Coleman's Instantons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the absence of gravity, Coleman's theorem states that the $O(4)$-symmetric instanton solution, which is regular at the origin and exponentially decays at infinity, gives the lowest action. Perturbatively, this implies that any small deformation from $O(4)$-symmetry gives a larger action. In this letter we investigate the possibility of extending this theorem to the situation where the $O(4)$-symmetric instanton is singular, provided that the action is finite. In particular, we show a general form of the potential around the origin, which realizes a singular instanton with finite action. We then discuss a concrete example in which this situation is realized, and analyze non-trivial anisotropic deformations around the solution perturbatively. Intriguingly, in contrast to the case of Coleman's instantons, we find that there exists a deformed solution that has the same action as the one for the $O(4)$-symmetric solution up to the second order in perturbation. Our result implies that there exist non-$O(4)$-symmetric solutions with finite action beyond Coleman's instantons, and gives rise to the possibility of the existence of a non-$O(4)$-symmetric instanton with a lower action.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we construct Yang-Mills theory in the $\kappa$-space-time. We derive Yang-Mills equations in the $\kappa$-deformed space-time, valid up to first order in the deformation parameter $a$, using the generalisation of Feynman's approach. We first derive the $\kappa$-deformed Wong's equation and using it, in the Jacobi identity involving velocities and coordinates of $\kappa$-deformed space-time, we derive the $\kappa$-deformed homogeneous Yang-Mills equations. We then construct the Lagrangian for Yang-Mills theory in $\kappa$-deformed space-time and show that it is invariant under SU(N) transformation. We also derive the expression for the force experienced by an isospin-carrying particle in the presence of Yang-Mills field in the $\kappa$-space-time.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Quantum Information from Unequal-Time QFT Correlation Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper continues on the program of developing a relativistic quantum information theory in terms of unequal-time correlation functions in quantum field theory (QFT)[arXiv:2208.03696]. Here, we focus on the definition of quantum resources from the irreducibly quantum behavior contained in the correlation functions of a QFT. We explain how set-ups with $N$ particle detectors probe the information in the high order field correlation functions. Our main object is the associated hierarchy of probability densities of $N$-detector events. We show that classical probabilistic hierarchies are subject to two conditions: Kolmogorov additivity and measurement independence. QFT violates those conditions, and the degree of violation enables us to define novel quantum resources. We give specific examples in set-ups where the main observables are the times of particle detection events. The new resources capture instances of irreducibly quantum behavior differ from the quantum behavior encapsulated in Bell inequalities. An interesting byproduct of our analysis is a relativistic state reduction rule for particles detected through scattering.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is found that a non-minimally coupled scalar tensor theory, Thawing Gravity (TG), can explain multiple tensions plaguing the standard cosmological model $\Lambda$CDM while fitting better to observations than the latter. Using the standard Bayes model comparison method, TG has moderate evidence over $\Lambda$CDM with a Bayes factor $\ln B=+1.5$ in the baseline analysis including CMB, BAO and SNIa. In the baseline+$H_0$ analysis which further takes into account the Cepheids calibration of the SNIa distance ladder from SH0ES, TG has very strong evidence over $\Lambda$CDM with $\ln B=+11.8$. In particular, TG yields $H_0=71.78\pm0.86 \ {\rm km/s/Mpc}$ and $S_8=0.793\pm0.012$, consistent with both local $H_0$ measurement and the large scale structure surveys.</description>

      <title>Shadow Images of Ghosh-Kumar Rotating Black Hole Illuminated By Spherical Light Sources and Thin Accretion Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the astronomical implications of the Ghosh-Kumar rotating Black Hole (BH), particularly its behaviour on shadow images, illuminated by celestial light sources and equatorial thin accretion disks. Our research delineates a crucial correlation between dynamics of the shadow images and the parameters $a$,~ $q$ and the $\theta_{obs}$, which aptly reflect the influence of the model parameters on the optical features of shadow images. Initially, elevated behavior of both $a$ and $q$ transforms the geometry of the shadow images from perfect circles to an oval shape and converges them towards the centre of the screen. By imposing the backward ray-tracing method, we demonstrate the optical appearance of shadow images of the considering BH spacetime in the celestial light source. The results demonstrate that the Einstein ring shows a transition from an axisymmetric closed circle to an arc-like shape on the screen as well as producing the deformation on the shadow shape with the modifications of spacetime parameters at the fixed observational position. Next, we observe that the attributes of accretion disks along with the relevant parameters on the shadow images are illuminated by both prograde and retrograde accreting flow. Our study reveals the process by which the accretion disk transitions from a disk-like structure to a hat-like shape with the aid of observational angles. Moreover, with an increase of $q$, the observed flux of both direct and lensed images of the accretion disk gradually moves towards the lower zone of the screen. Furthermore, we present the intensity distribution of the redshift factors on the screen. Our analysis suggests that the observer can see both redshift and blueshift factors on the screen at higher observational angles, while augmenting the values of both $a$ and $q$, enhancing the effect of redshift on the screen.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the worldline quantum field theory formalism, we compute the radiation-reacted impulse, scattering angle, radiated energy and recoil of a classical black hole (or neutron star) scattering event at fifth post-Minkowskian and sub-leading self-force orders (5PM-1SF). This state-of-the-art four-loop computation employs advanced integration-by-parts and differential equation technology, and is considerably more challenging than the conservative 5PM-1SF counterpart. As compared with the conservative 5PM-1SF, in the radiation sector Calabi-Yau three-fold periods appear and contribute to the radiated energy and recoil observables. We give an extensive exposition of the canonicalization of the differential equations and provide details on boundary integrations, Feynman rules, and integration-by-parts strategies. Comparisons to numerical relativity are also performed.</description>

      <title>Deterministic evolution of gauge fields through a singularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.02941v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The nature of gravitational singularities has been questioned by some recent research, challenging the notion that classical determinism breaks down at these points. By allowing for dynamic changes in the orientation of spatial hypersurfaces, Einstein's equations can be uniquely extended across singularities in certain symmetry-reduced models. A key step in this work was to reformulate the dynamical equations in terms of physical degrees of freedom. The singular behavior, it turns out, is confined to the gauge or unphysical degrees of freedom, and the physical ones evolve smoothly through the singularity. This paper builds on these findings, extending them to a model of gravity coupled with Abelian gauge fields in a homogeneous but anisotropic universe. The study reveals that near the big bang, the dynamics of geometry and gauge fields can be reformulated in a way that preserves determinism, provided there is a change of orientation at the singularity. Intriguingly, the gauge fields are shown to maintain their orientation through the singularity, unlike the spatial hypersurfaces. This suggests that the predicted orientation change of spatial hypersurfaces has physical significance, potentially allowing an observer to determine which side of the big bang they occupy. These results are proved to extend also to non-Abelian gauge fields with only one spatial component.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Study in Myrzakulov $F(R, T)$ Quasi-dilaton Massive Gravity</title>

Abstract: This study explores the cosmological implications of the Myrzakulov $F(R, T)$ quasi-dilaton massive gravity theory, a modification of the de Rham-Gabadadze-Tolley (dRGT) massive gravity theory. Our analysis focuses on the self-accelerating solution of the background equations of motion, which are shown to exist in the theory. Notably, we find that the theory features an effective cosmological constant corresponding to the massive graviton, which has important implications for our understanding of the universe's accelerated expansion. To assess the validity of the Myrzakulov $F(R, T)$ quasi-dilaton massive gravity theory, we employ two datasets: the Union2 Type Ia Supernovae (SNIa) dataset, consisting of 557 observations, and the Pantheon SNIa data, which includes 1048 SNe I-a events gathered from diverse SN I-a samples. Our results demonstrate that the theory is capable of explaining the accelerated expansion of the universe without requiring the presence of dark energy. This finding supports the potential of the Myrzakulov $F(R, T)$ quasi-dilaton massive gravity theory as an alternative explanation for the observed cosmic acceleration. Moreover, we investigate the properties of tensor perturbations within the framework of this theory and derive a novel expression for the dispersion relation of gravitational waves. Our analysis reveals interesting features of the modified dispersion relation in the Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) cosmology, providing new insights into the nature of gravitational waves in the context of the Myrzakulov $F(R, T)$ quasi-dilaton massive gravity theory.</description>

      <title>Angular Location of the $n^{th}$ Einstein Ring at large $n$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16643v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a matched asymptotic expansion to find an analytic formula for the trajectory of a light ray in a Schwarzschild metric, in a power series expansion in the deviation of the impact parameter from its critical value. We present results valid to second sub leading order in this expansion. We use these results to find an analytic expansion for the angular location of the $n^{th}$ Einstein Ring (at large $n$) resulting from a star that lies directly behind a black hole but not necessarily far from it. The small parameter for this expansion is $e^{-\pi (2n+1)}$: our formulae are accurate to third order in this parameter.</description>

      <title>First order corrections to black hole thermodynamics: a simple approach enhanced</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07127v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The inclusion of higher derivative terms in the gravitational action brings about corrections to the original forms of black hole solutions and thermodynamics. A simple and valuable approach has emerged over two decades ago, which states that the first order corrections to black hole thermodynamics, caused by higher derivative terms, can be achieved without explicitly solving the perturbed metric. However, a direct application of this approach may potentially yield incorrect answers as it comes to AdS black holes, which poses a challenge to the valuable approach. In this paper, we identify the subtlety associated with AdS black holes is that certain higher derivative terms may alter the asymptotic structure of the spacetime. By taking this subtlety into account, we successfully enhance the original approach and resolve the mentioned problem. Furthermore, we make an interesting observation that the extremalization analysis that underlies this approach also plays a fundamental role in the perturbation theories of quantum mechanics and other disciplines.</description>

      <title>Post-Newtonian effects in compact binaries with a dark matter spike: A Lagrangian approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06084v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply the Lagrangian method to study the post-Newtonian evolution of a compact binary system with environmental effects, including a dark matter spike, and obtain the resulting gravitational wave emission. This formalism allows one to incorporate post-Newtonian effects up to any desired known order, as well as any other environmental effect around the binary, as long as their dissipation power or force formulae are known. In particular, in this work, we employ this method to study a black hole--black hole binary system of mass ratio $10^5$ by including post-Newtonian effects of order 1PN and 2.5PN, as well as the effect of relativistic dynamical friction. We obtain the modified orbits and the corresponding modified gravitational waveform. Finally, we contrast these modifications against the LISA sensitivity curve in frequency space and show that this observatory can detect the associated signals.</description>

      <title>Non-inertial frames that can mimic gravitational fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16229v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One version of the principle of equivalence, as originally formulated by Einstein, states that ``gravity" can be mimicked locally by going to an ``accelerated frame of reference". As highlighted by Synge, the physical content of this principle remains obscure in so far as it does not refer to the Riemann tensor $R_{abcd}$, which encodes the true effects of gravity. We here give the acceleration profile of a $Born$ rigid, Rindler$esque$, frame that can mimic a gravitational field corresponding to a given $R_{abcd}$. The generalised deviation equation that yields this result also has Centrifugal and Coriolis terms appearing in a purely relational context, yielding a similar connection between angular velocity of rotating, rigid inertial frames and the Riemann tensor. We comment briefly on implications for Mach principle.</description>

Abstract: Unimodular gravity became an object of increasing interest in the late $80$-ties and was recently used in primordial Universe modeling with cosmological constant, in the context of the Brans-Dicke gravity including scalar field. In the present article we investigate the possibility of imposing the unimodular condition within the $5$-dimensional Kaluza-Klein theory including the scalar field. The variational principle is formulated in $5$ dimensions first, and dimensional reduction is applied to the resulting set of equations. A cosmological model based on these equations is then presented and discussed.</description>

Abstract: The geodesics in various spherical Rindler frames are investigated. A display of some kinematical quantities of the spacetime is given. The constant acceleration from the metric acts as the surface gravity of the horizon $r = 0$. The radial geodesics are computed both for the Balasubramanian et al. form of the spherical Rindler space and for the non-diagonal metric of Huang and Sun.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions, critical behavior and microstructure of the FRW universe in the framework of higher order GUP</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17624v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the the phase transition, critical behavior and microstructure of the FRW in the framework of a new higher order generalized uncertainty principle. Our initial step involves deriving the equation of state by defining the work density $W$ from GUP-corrected Friedmann equations as the thermodynamic pressure $P$. Based on the modified equation of state, we conduct an analysis of the $P-V$ phase transition in the FRW universe. Subsequently, we obtain the critical exponents and coexistence curves for the small and large phases of the FRW universe around the critical point. Finally, employing Ruppeiner geometry, we derive the thermodynamic curvature scalar $R_N$, investigating its sign-changing curve and spinodal curve. The results reveal distinctive thermodynamic properties for FRW universes with positive and negative GUP parameters $\beta$. In the case of $\beta&gt;0$, the phase transition, critical behavior and microstructure of FRW universe are consistent with those of Van der Waals fluids. Conversely, for $\beta&lt;0$, the results resemble those obtained through effective scalar field theory. These findings underscore the capacity of quantum gravity to induce phase transitions in the universe, warranting further in-depth exploration.</description>

      <title>Weak equivalence principle and nonrelativistic limit of general dispersion relations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18811v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the weak equivalence principle in the context of modified dispersion relations, a prevalent approach to quantum gravity phenomenology. We find that generic modified dispersion relations violate the weak equivalence principle. The acceleration in general depends on the mass of the test body, unless the Hamiltonian is either two-homogeneous in the test particles' 4-momenta or the corresponding Lagrangian differs from the homogeneous case by a total derivative only. The key ingredient of this calculation is a $3+1$ decomposition of the parametrization invariant relativistic test particle action derived from the dispersion relation. Additionally, we apply a perturbative expansion in the test particle's spatial velocity and the inverse speed of light. To quantify our result, we provide a general formula for the E\"otv\'os factor of modified dispersion relations. As a specific example, we study the point-particle motion determined from the $\kappa$-Poincar\'e dispersion relation in the bicrossproduct basis. Comparing the ensuing non-vanishing E\"otv\'os factor to recent data from the MICROSCOPE experiment, we obtain a bound of the model parameter $\hat{\Xi} {}^{-1}\geq10^{15}{\rm GeV}/c^2$.</description>

      <title>Novel Casimir wormholes in Einstein gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03588v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the context of General Relativity (GR), violation of the null energy condition (NEC) is necessary for existence of static spherically symmetric wormhole solutions. Also, it is a well-known fact that the energy conditions are violated by certain quantum fields, such as the Casimir effect. The magnitude and sign of the Casimir energy depend on Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions and geometrical configuration of the objects involved in a Casimir setup. The Casimir energy may act as an ideal candidate for the matter that supports the wormhole geometry. In the present work, we firstly find traversable wormhole solutions supported by a general form for the Casimir energy density assuming a constant redshift function. As well, in this framework, assuming that the radial pressure and energy density obey a linear equation of state, we derive for the first time Casimir traversable wormhole solutions admitting suitable shape function. Then, we consider three geometric configurations of the Casimir effect such as (i) two parallel plates, (ii) two parallel cylindrical shells, and (iii) two spheres. We study wormhole solutions for each case and their property in detail. We also check the weak and strong energy conditions in the spacetime for the obtained wormhole solutions. The stability of the Casimir traversable wormhole solutions are investigated using the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equation. Finally, we study trajectory of null as well as timelike particles along with quasi-normal modes (QNMs) of a scalar field in the wormhole spacetime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07789v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The effect of Hawking radiation on tripartite measurement uncertainty in a Schwarzschild black hole background is analyzed in this study. Two scenarios are examined. In the first, quantum memory particles approach a Schwarzschild black hole and are positioned near the event horizon, while the particle being measured remains in the asymptotically flat region. In the second scenario, the measured particle moves toward the black hole, and the quantum memories stay in the asymptotically flat region. This study considers two initial quantum states, namely GHZ and W states. Our findings reveal that in both cases, measurement uncertainty increases steadily with rising Hawking temperature. When comparing the GHZ and W states, the GHZ state initially exhibits lower measurement uncertainty at low Hawking temperatures than the W state, indicating greater resilience to Hawking radiation. Additionally, when the quantum memories remain in the asymptotically flat region while the measured particle falls toward the black hole, the uncertainties for GHZ and W states do not align at high temperatures. The GHZ state consistently demonstrates lower measurement uncertainty, showcasing its superior robustness against Hawking radiation.</description>

      <title>Strong Gravitational Lensing by Rotating Quantum-Corrected Black Holes: Insights and Constraints from EHT Observations of M87* and Sgr A*</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11332v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study gravitational lensing in the strong-field limit using the rotating quantum-corrected black hole (RQCBH) with an additional parameter $\alpha$ besides mass $M$ and spin parameter $a$. We discover a decrease in the deflection angle $\alpha_D$, the photon sphere radius $x_{ps}$, and the angular position $\theta_{\infty}$. The flux ratio of the first image to all subsequent images, $r_{mag}$, decreases rapidly as $\alpha$ increases. We compare RQCBH observables with those of Kerr black holes, using Sgr A* and M87* as lenses to observe the effect of the quantum-corrected parameter $\alpha$. For Sgr A*, the angular position $\theta_\infty$ in $\in~(14.8-26.3)~\mu as$, while for M87* $\in~(11.12-19.78)~\mu as$. The angular separation $s$, for supermassive black holes (SMBHs) SgrA* and M87*, differs significantly, with values ranging $\in~(0.033-0.79)~\mu as$ for Sgr A* and $\in~(0.033-0.59)~\mu as$ for M87*. The deviations of the lensing observables $|\Delta\theta_\infty|$ and $|\Delta s|$ for RQCBH ($a=0.8,\alpha=0.4$) from Kerr black holes can reach up to $1.6~\mu as$ and $0.41~\mu as$ for Sgr A*, and $1.2~\mu as$ and $0.31~\mu as$ for M87*. The relative magnitude $r_{mag}$ $\in~(1.81-6.82)~\mu as$. We also compared the time delays between the relativistic images in the 22 SMBHs at the center of various galaxies. We found that RQCBH can be quantitatively distinguished from Kerr black holes. Interestingly, the time delay for Sgr A* and M87* can reach approximately 24.95 min and 308.15 hrs, respectively. Our analysis concludes that, within the 1$\sigma$ region, a significant portion of the parameter space agrees with the EHT results of M87* and Sgr A*.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16920v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate spontaneous vectorization in the Einstein-Maxwell-Vector (EMV) model, introducing a novel mechanism driven by the interplay between electromagnetic and vector fields. A key innovation in our work is the resolution of an apparent divergence in the vector field near the event horizon, achieved by employing a generalized coordinate transformation. This not only extends the domain of existence for vectorized Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes (VRNBHs), but also refines the theoretical understanding of such solutions. We introduce a new concept of combined charge $\sqrt{\tilde{Q}^2 + \tilde{P}^2}$, which better captures the underlying physics of these black holes and provides a unified framework for analyzing thermodynamics and observable phenomena such as light ring structures. Our findings suggest that VRNBHs exhibit enhanced thermodynamic preference and distinctive light ring properties compared to Reissner-Nordstr\"om solutions. Moreover, we demonstrate how this combined charge approach reveals connections to two-charge black hole solutions, offering promising avenues for observational verification within the context of effective field theories.</description>

      <title>Toward Gravitational Lensing in Modified Theories of Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06945v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate gravitational lensing within modified gravity frameworks, focusing on the Hu-Sawicki $f(R)$ and normal branch Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati (nDGP) models, and we compare these results with those obtained from general relativity (GR). Our results reveal that both modified gravity models consistently enhance key lensing parameters relative to GR, including the Einstein radius, lensing optical depth, and time delays. Notably, we find that the Hu-Sawicki $f(R)$ and nDGP models yield significantly larger Einstein radii and higher lensing probabilities, especially at greater redshifts, indicating an increased likelihood of lensing events under modified gravity. Our analysis of time delays further shows that the broader mass distributions in these frameworks lead to pronounced differences in high-mass lens systems, providing potential observational markers of modified gravity. Additionally, we observe amplified magnification factors in wave optics regimes, highlighting the potential for gravitational wave (GW) lensing to differentiate modified gravity effects from GR predictions. Through these findings, we propose modified gravity theories as compelling alternatives to GR in explaining cosmic phenomena, with promising implications for future high-precision gravitational lensing surveys.</description>

      <title>The Lense-Thirring effect at work in M87$^\ast$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08686v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, the temporal evolution of the angles characterizing the spatial configuration of the jet in the supermassive black hole M87$^\ast$ was measured exhibiting a precessional pattern around the hole's spin axis. It would be due to the dragging induced by the fact that the hole's external spacetime is described by the Kerr metric. Here, it is shown that the Lense-Thirring orbital precessions of a test particle moving about a rotating massive object, calculated perturbatively to the first post-Newtonian order, are able to fully reproduce all the measured features of the jet axis of M87$^\ast$. In particular, by assuming that the latter is aligned with the angular momentum of the accretion disk, modelled as an effective particle moving along a circular orbit, the condition that the absolute value of the predicted Lense-Thirring precessional frequency of the disk agrees with the measured value of $0.56\pm 0.02$ radians per year of the jet's one is satisfied for a range of physically meaningful values of the hole's spin parameter, close to unity, and of the effective disk radius, of the order of just over a dozen gravitational radii. Relying upon such assumptions and results, it is possible to predict that the angle between the hole's spin axis and the jet's one stays constant over the years amounting to $1.16^\circ$, in agreement with its measured value of $1.25^\circ\pm 0.18^\circ$. Furthermore, also the temporal pattern and the amplitudes of the time series of the jet's angles are reproduced by the aforementioned Lense-Thirring precessional model.</description>

      <title>Fix three dimensional geometries from entanglement entropies of CFT$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.01355</link>
      <description>arXiv:1809.01355v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an approach to fix the leading behaviors of three dimensional geometries from the dual CFT$_2$ entanglement entropies. We only employ the holographic principle and do not use any assumption about the AdS/CFT correspondence and bulk geometry. Our strategy is to use both UV and IR-like CFT$_2$ entanglement entropies to fix the bulk geodesics. By a simple trick, then the metric can be extracted from the geodesics. As examples, we fix the leading behaviors of the pure AdS$_3$ metric from the entanglement entropies of free CFT$_2$, and more importantly the BTZ black hole from the entanglement entropies of finite temperature CFT$_2$. Consequently, CFT$_2$ with finite size or topological defects can be worked out by simple transformations. Following the same steps, in principle, it is possible to fix the leading behaviors of all three dimensional (topologically distinct) holographic classical geometries from the dual CFT$_2$ entanglement entropies.</description>

      <title>Covariant cosmological quantum space-time, higher-spin and gravity in the IKKT matrix model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.03522</link>
      <description>arXiv:1901.03522v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss a $(3{+}1)$-dimensional covariant quantum space-time describing a FLRW cosmology with Big Bounce, obtained by a projection of the fuzzy hyperboloid $H^4_n$. This provides a background solution of the IKKT matrix model with mass term. We characterize the bosonic fluctuation spectrum, which consists of a tower of higher-spin modes. The modes are organized in terms of an underlying $SO(4,2)$ structure group, which is broken to the $SO(3,1)$ isometry of the background. The resulting higher-spin gauge theory includes all degrees of freedom required for gravity, and should be well suited for quantization. All modes propagate with the same speed of light, even though local boost invariance is not manifest. The propagating metric perturbation modes comprise those of a massless graviton, as well as a scalar mode. Gauge invariance allows to obtain the analog of the linearized Einstein-Hilbert action, which is expected to be induced upon quantization.</description>

      <title>Towards Long-time Geometrization: Stability of the Double-Cusp Spacetimes Under T2-Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17180v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since the early years of General Relativity, understanding the long-time behavior of the cosmological solutions of Einstein's vacuum equations has been a fundamental yet challenging task. Solutions with global symmetries, or perturbations thereof, have been extensively studied and are reasonably understood. On the other hand, thanks to the work of Fischer-Moncrief and M. Anderson, it is known that there is a tight relation between the future evolution of solutions and the Thurston decomposition of the spatial 3-manifold. Consequently, cosmological spacetimes developing a future asymptotic symmetry should represent only a negligible part of a much larger yet unexplored solution landscape. In this work, we revisit a program initiated by the second named author, aimed at constructing a new type of cosmological solution first posed by M. Anderson, where (at the right scale) two hyperbolic manifolds with a cusp separate from each other through a thin torus neck. Specifically, we prove that the so-called double-cusp solution, which models the torus neck, is stable under small $\Sa \times \Sa$ - symmetry-preserving perturbations. The proof, which has interest on its own, reduces to proving the stability of a geodesic segment as a wave map into the hyperbolic plane and partially relates to the work of Sideris on wave maps and the work of Ringstr\"om on the future asymptotics of Gowdy spacetimes. Additionally, we also establish the future long-time existence for the wave map equations for almost all initial data. The proof of this relies primarily on pointwise estimates derived using the energy-momentum tensor.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08442v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We apply machine learning to understand fundamental aspects of holographic duality, specifically the entropies obtained from the apparent and event horizon areas. We show that simple features of only the time series of the pressure anisotropy, namely the values and half-widths of the maxima and minima, the times these are attained, and the times of the first zeroes can predict the areas of the apparent and event horizons in the dual bulk geometry at all times with a fixed maximum length (10) of the input vector. Given that simple Vaidya-type metrics constructed just from the apparent and event horizon areas can be used to approximately obtain unequal time correlation functions, we argue that the corresponding entropy functions are the measures of information that need to be extracted from simple one-point functions to reconstruct specific aspects of correlation functions of the dual state with the best possible approximations.</description>

      <title>Spin-bounded correlations: rotation boxes within and beyond quantum theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09278v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How can detector click probabilities respond to spatial rotations around a fixed axis, in any possible physical theory? Here, we give a thorough mathematical analysis of this question in terms of "rotation boxes", which are analogous to the well-known notion of non-local boxes. We prove that quantum theory admits the most general rotational correlations for spins 0, 1/2, and 1, but we describe a metrological game where beyond-quantum resources of spin 3/2 outperform all quantum resources of the same spin. We prove a multitude of fundamental results about these correlations, including an exact convex characterization of the spin-1 correlations, a Tsirelson-type inequality for spins 3/2 and higher, and a proof that the general spin-J correlations provide an efficient outer SDP approximation to the quantum set. Furthermore, we review and consolidate earlier results that hint at a wealth of applications of this formalism: a theory-agnostic semi-device-independent randomness generator, an exact characterization of the quantum (2,2,2)-Bell correlations in terms of local symmetries, and the derivation of multipartite Bell witnesses. Our results illuminate the foundational question of how space constrains the structure of quantum theory, they build a bridge between semi-device-independent quantum information and spacetime physics, and they demonstrate interesting relations to topics such as entanglement witnesses, spectrahedra, and orbitopes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03906v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider two simple criteria for when a physical theory should be said to be "generally covariant", and we argue that these criteria are not met by Yang-Mills theory, even on geometric formulations of that theory. The reason, we show, is that the bundles encountered in Yang-Mills theory are not natural bundles; instead, they are gauge-natural. We then show how these observations relate to previous arguments about the significance of solder forms in assessing disanalogies between general relativity and Yang-Mills theory. We conclude by suggesting that general covariance is really about functoriality.</description>

      <title>Probing de Sitter Space Using CFT States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14237v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we construct CFT states describing a putative holographic dual to local excitations in the three-dimensional de Sitter space (dS), called the bulk local states. We find that the conjugation operation in dS$_3/$CFT$_2$ is notably different from that in AdS$_3/$CFT$_2$. This requires us to combine two bulk local states constructed out of different primary states in a CPT-invariant way. This analysis explains why Green's functions in the dS Euclidean vacuum cannot simply be obtained from the Wick rotation of those in AdS. We also argue that this characteristic feature explains the emergence of a time coordinate from the dual Euclidean CFT. We show that the information metric for the quantum estimation of bulk coordinate values replicates the de Sitter space metric.</description>

      <title>Prospects for cosmological research with the FAST array: 21-cm intensity mapping survey observation strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00268v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Precise cosmological measurements are essential for understanding the evolution of the universe and the nature of dark energy. The Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST), the most sensitive single-dish radio telescope, has the potential to provide the precise cosmological measurements through neutral hydrogen 21-cm intensity mapping sky survey. This paper primarily explores the potential of technological upgrades for FAST in cosmology. The most crucial upgrade begins with equipping FAST with a wide-band receiver ($0 &lt; z &lt; 2.5$). This upgrade can enable FAST to achieve higher precision in cosmological parameter estimation than the Square Kilometre Array Phase-1 Mid frequency. On this basis, expanding to a FAST array (FASTA) consisting of six identical FASTs would offer significant improvements in precision compared to FAST. Additionally, compared with the current results from the data combination of cosmic microwave background, baryon acoustic oscillations (optical galaxy surveys), and type Ia supernovae, FASTA can provide comparable constraints. Specifically, for the dark-energy equation-of-state parameters, FASTA can achieve $\sigma(w_0) = 0.09$ and $\sigma(w_a) = 0.33$.</description>

      <title>Non-parametric late-time expansion history reconstruction and implications for the Hubble tension in light of recent DESI and Type Ia supernovae data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02365v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We non-parametrically reconstruct the late-time expansion history in light of the latest Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements from DESI combined with various Type Ia Supernovae (SNeIa) catalogs, using interpolation through piece-wise natural cubic splines, and a reconstruction procedure based on Gaussian Processes (GPs). Applied to DESI BAO and PantheonPlus SNeIa data, both methods indicate that deviations from a reference $\Lambda$CDM model in the $z \lesssim 2$ unnormalized expansion rate $E(z)$ are constrained to be $\lesssim 10\%$, but also consistently identify two features in $E(z)$: a bump at $z \sim 0.5$, and a depression at $z \sim 0.9$, which cannot be simultaneously captured by a $w_0w_a$CDM fit. These features, which are stable against assumptions regarding spatial curvature, interpolation knots, and GP kernel, disappear if one adopts the older SDSS BAO measurements in place of DESI, and decrease in significance when replacing the PantheonPlus catalog with the Union3 and DESY5 ones. We infer $c/(r_dH_0)=29.90 \pm 0.33$, with $r_d$ the sound horizon at baryon drag and $H_0$ the Hubble constant. Breaking the $r_d$-$H_0$ degeneracy with the SH0ES prior on $H_0$, the significance of the tension between our non-parametric determination of $r_d=136.20^{+2.20}_{-2.40}\,{\text{Mpc}}$ and the \textit{Planck} $\Lambda$CDM-based determination is at the $5\sigma$ level, slightly lower than the $6\sigma$ obtained when adopting the older SDSS dataset in place of DESI. This indicates the persistence at very high significance of the ``sound horizon tension'', reinforcing the need for pre-recombination new physics. If substantiated in forthcoming data releases, our results tentatively point to oscillatory/non-monotonic features in the shape of the expansion rate at $z \lesssim 2$, of potential interest for dark energy model-building.</description>

      <title>Extremal rotating BTZ black holes cannot be dressed in (anti-)self-dual Maxwell field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16056v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Under the (anti-)self-dual condition for orthonormal components of the Faraday tensor, the 3D Einstein-Maxwell system with a negative cosmological constant $\Lambda$ admits a solution obtained by Kamata and Koikawa and later by Cataldo and Salgado in the most general form. Actually, Clement first obtained this solution and interpreted it as a regular particle-like solution without horizon. Nevertheless, it has been erroneously stated in some literature that this Clement-Cataldo-Salgado (CCS) solution, locally characterized by a single parameter, describes a black hole even in the charged case as it reduces to the extremal rotating Banados-Teitelboim-Zanelli (BTZ) solution in the vacuum limit and its curvature invariants are constant. In this paper, we supplement Clement's interpretation by showing that there appears a parallelly propagated curvature singularity corresponding to an infinite affine parameter along spacelike geodesics at the location of the Killing horizon in the extremal rotating BTZ solution when the (anti-)self-dual Maxwell field is added. If the spatial coordinate $\theta$ is periodic, closed timelike curves exist near the singularity. It is also shown that the CCS solution is of the Cotton type N (in contrast to charged rotating BTZ black holes which are of type I away from the horizon), and the energy-momentum tensor of the Maxwell field is of the Hawking-Ellis type II. The metric solves the Einstein-$\Lambda$ equations also with a massless scalar field or a null dust fluid. We demonstrate that it belongs to the Kundt shear-free, non-twisting, non-expanding class of geometries, whereas extremal rotating BTZ black holes have expanding principal null directions. It means that the CCS metric represents the specific null ("radiative") Maxwell field generated by a singular source, rather than an extremal rotating BTZ black hole dressed in an (anti-)self-dual Maxwell field.</description>

      <title>Scalaron dark matter and the thermal history of the universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05027v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In metric $f(R)$ gravity minimally coupled to the Standard Model, the scalaron field can act as a dark-matter candidate if its mass lies in the range $\text{meV} \lesssim m \lesssim \text{MeV}$. The evolution of the scalaron is influenced by the trace of the stress-energy tensor, whose behaviour, as shown in our previous work, becomes non-adiabatic during the electroweak crossover, potentially triggering scalaron oscillations. While we previously approximated this crossover as a second-order phase transition at the one-loop level, the transition is actually smoother. In this paper, we refine our analysis to account for this smooth crossover and show that scalaron oscillations are still excited in a qualitatively similar manner, driven by the rapid dynamics of the electroweak crossover observed in numerical lattice simulations, provided the scalaron mass is sufficiently small. We also investigate the time-dependent contribution to the stress-energy trace due to the trace anomaly of quantum chromodynamics. Our results indicate that, while the trace anomaly shifts the scalaron's equilibrium value, this shift evolves adiabatically compared to the fast oscillations of the scalaron, meaning that the trace anomaly does not significantly affect the potential cosmological scenarios for scalaron evolution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20040v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the propagation of a domain wall (kink) of the $\phi^4$ model in a radially symmetric environment defined by a gravity source. This source deforms the standard Euclidian metric into a Schwarzschild-like one. We introduce an effective model that accurately describes the dynamics of the kink center. This description works well even outside the perturbation region, i.e., even for large masses of the gravitating object. We observed that such a spherical domain wall surrounding a star-type object inevitably "collapses", i.e., shrinks in radius towards the origin and offer an understanding of the latter phenomenology. The relevant analysis is presented for a circular domain wall and a spherical one.</description>

Abstract: We analyse the impact of the expansion of the Universe on the formation of total spectral energy density of radiation in the intergalactic medium. Assuming the same proper thermal spectrum of sources, we show how the expansion of the Universe changes the nature of the energy distribution of the thermal spectrum: a decrease of the energy density in the Wien range and an increase in the Rayleigh--Jeans range with increasing the redshift of the bulk filled by sources. This is due to the cosmological redshift and the growing contribution of large number of distant sources. The numerical estimations also illustrate the main factors that resolve the Olbers' paradox in the expanding Universe: i) the particle horizon, ii) the finiteness of the volume filled by luminous objects, and iii) the cosmological redshift. Applying the obtained expressions to the epoch of reionization made it possible to estimate the concentration of objects of various classes (stars, globular clusters, dwarf galaxies) necessary for complete reionization of hydrogen at $z=6$. It is shown that even a small part of globular clusters or dwarf galaxies with a thermal spectrum of moderate temperature, from those predicted by Press-Schechter formalism and its improvements, is able to completely reionize hydrogen in the intergalactic medium at $z=6$.</description>

      <title>Ultra-Slow-Roll Inflation on the Lattice: Backreaction and Nonlinear Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23942v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Violating the slow-roll regime during the final stages of inflation can significantly enhance curvature perturbations, a scenario often invoked in models producing primordial black holes and small-scale scalar induced gravitational waves. When perturbations are enhanced, one approaches the regime in which tree-level computations are insufficient, and nonlinear corrections may become relevant. In this work, we conduct lattice simulations of ultra-slow-roll (USR) dynamics to investigate the significance of nonlinear effects, both in terms of backreaction on the background and in the evolution of perturbations. Our systematic study of various USR potentials reveals that nonlinear corrections are significant when the tree-level curvature power spectrum peaks at $\mathcal{P}^{\rm max}_{\zeta} = {\cal O}(10^{-3})-{\cal O}(10^{-2})$, with 5\%$-$10\% corrections. Larger enhancements yield even greater differences. We find a simple universal relation between simulation and tree-level quantities $\dot\phi = \dot\phi_{\rm tree}\left(1+\sqrt{\mathcal{P}^{\rm max}_{\zeta,\rm tree}}\right)$ at the end of the USR phase, which is valid in all cases we consider. Additionally, we explore how nonlinear interactions during the USR phase affect the clustering and non-Gaussianity of scalar fluctuations, crucial for understanding the phenomenological consequences of USR, such as scalar-induced gravitational waves and primordial black holes. Our findings demonstrate the necessity of going beyond leading order perturbation theory results, through higher-order or non-perturbative computations, to make robust predictions for inflation models exhibiting a USR phase.</description>

      <title>Translating current ALP photon coupling strength bounds to the Randall-Sundrum model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08396v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we look at the current bounds on the coupling strength of axion-like particles (ALPs) with two photons in the context of the Randall-Sundrum (RS) model. We relate the coupling strength to the compactification radius that governs the size of the extra dimension in the RS warped geometry model and show how the current bounds on the ALP can be used to derive appropriate constraints on the size of the extra fifth dimension in the RS model. We show that the resulting constraints fail to resolve the gauge hierarchy problem for light/ultralight ALPs and require a massive ALP of at least $m_{a} \gtrsim 0.1$ [GeV] to be relevant in the context of the hierarchy problem when the gauge field is in the bulk.</description>
