      <title>Complexity counts: global and local perspectives on Indo-Aryan numeral systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The numeral systems of Indo-Aryan languages such as Hindi, Gujarati, and Bengali are highly unusual in that unlike most numeral systems (e.g., those of English, Chinese, etc.), forms referring to 1--99 are highly non-transparent and are cannot be constructed using straightforward rules. As an example, Hindi/Urdu *iky\=anve* `91' is not decomposable into the composite elements *ek* `one' and *nave* `ninety' in the way that its English counterpart is. This paper situates Indo-Aryan languages within the typology of cross-linguistic numeral systems, and explores the linguistic and non-linguistic factors that may be responsible for the persistence of complex systems in these languages. Using cross-linguistic data from multiple databases, we develop and employ a number of cross-linguistically applicable metrics to quantifies the complexity of languages' numeral systems, and demonstrate that Indo-Aryan languages have decisively more complex numeral systems than the world's languages as a whole, though individual Indo-Aryan languages differ from each other in terms of the complexity of the patterns they display. We investigate the factors (e.g., religion, geographic isolation, etc.) that underlie complexity in numeral systems, with a focus on South Asia, in an attempt to develop an account of why complex numeral systems developed and persisted in certain Indo-Aryan languages but not elsewhere. Finally, we demonstrate that Indo-Aryan numeral systems adhere to certain general pressures toward efficient communication found cross-linguistically, despite their high complexity. We call for this somewhat overlooked dimension of complexity to be taken seriously when discussing general variation in cross-linguistic numeral systems.</description>

      <title>Geological CO$_2$ Storage in Poland: Review of Sequestration Potential, Policy Development, and Socio-Economic Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Poland's coal-reliant economy faces challenges in meeting European Union climate mandates. Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is pivotal for decarbonizing high-emission sectors (e.g., cement, chemicals, refineries, and steel), enabling substantial CO$_2$ emission reductions while sustaining industrial competitiveness. This multidisciplinary review assesses Poland's CO$_2$ storage potential, integrating geological, regulatory, and socio-economic analyses to evaluate large-scale CCS feasibility. Onshore saline aquifers alongside depleted hydrocarbon fields offer significant storage potential, with offshore Baltic Basin sites constrained by logistical and environmental regulations, including the Helsinki Convention. Evolving policy and regulatory framework is evaluated, including recent amendments to the Geological and Mining Law that may facilitate onshore CO$_2$ storage near industrial hubs. We analyze regional and data compilation constraints, infrastructure readiness, and the integration of the CCUS value chain. It was found that current storage assessments face challenges, including sparse data, restricted research access, and limited industry-academia collaboration, which impede maturing basin-scale and site-specific analyses to higher storage readiness levels. These gaps introduce significant uncertainty and undermine reliability, which limits informed business decisions. Socio-economic barriers, including public skepticism, financial uncertainties, and regulatory gaps, hinder large-scale CCS deployment, necessitating transparent engagement. A framework for building public trust through transparent governance, inclusive community engagement, and proactive risk communication was suggested to build trust and foster CCS acceptance in Poland. Proactive stakeholder involvement and transparent risk communication, particularly in coal-dependent communities, are critical.</description>

      <title>Edge Games: Cooperative Partner Selection in Network Cooperation Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The phenomenon of group cooperation constitutes a fundamental mechanism underlying various social and biological systems. Complex networks provide a structural framework for group interactions, where individuals can not only obtain information from their neighbors but also choose neighbors as cooperative partners. However, traditional evolutionary game theory models, where nodes are the game players, are not convenient for directly choosing cooperative partners. Here, we exchange the roles of nodes and edges and innovatively propose the "edge game" model, using edges in complex networks as virtual game players for group games. Theoretical analysis and simulation experiments show that by configuring a synergy factor (r) that satisfies the "moderate cooperation" condition, a stable cooperative structure can be achieved for any network at the evolutionary equilibrium. Specifically, when there is no constraint on the number of cooperators per node, the condition for the evolution of cooperation in the network is r &gt; kmax, where kmax is the maximum degree of the nodes. When there is a threshold constraint, in nearest-neighbor coupled networks (with degree k), the condition for "moderate cooperation" is k &lt; r &lt; 2k. In heterogeneous networks, a variable synergy factor scheme is adopted, where the synergy factor for each game group (rx) is defined to be proportional to the degree of the central node (kx) in the group (rx = n-fold*kx), "moderate cooperation" can be achieved when 1 &lt; n-fold &lt; 2. If the value of r exceeds the range, it may lead to "excessive cooperation" with node overload. Comparing algorithm performance and time complexity, edge games demonstrate advantages over other optimization algorithms. Simple and universal, the edge game provides a new approach to addressing multi-agent cooperation problems in the era of machine intelligence.</description>

      <title>A mix of long-duration hydrogen and thermal storage enables large-scale electrified heating in a renewable European energy system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrogen-based long-duration electricity storage (LDES) is a key component of renewable energy systems to deal with seasonality and prolonged periods of low wind and solar energy availability. In this paper, we investigate how electrified heating with heat pumps impacts LDES requirements in a fully renewable European energy system, and which role thermal storage can play. Using a large weather dataset of 78 weather years, we find that electrified heating significantly increases LDES needs, as optimal average energy capacities more than quadruple across all weather years compared to a scenario without electrified heating. We attribute 75% of this increase to a leverage effect, as additional electric load amplifies storage needs during times of low renewable availability. The remaining 25% are the result of a compound effect, where exceptional cold spells coincide with periods of renewable scarcity. Furthermore, heat pumps increase the variance in optimal storage capacities between weather years substantially because of demand-side weather variability. Long-duration thermal storage attached to district heating networks can reduce LDES needs by on average 36%. To support and safeguard wide-spread heating electrification, policymakers should expedite the creation of adequate regulatory frameworks for both long-duration storage types to de-risk investments in light of high weather variability.</description>

      <title>Stationary and Non-Stationary Transition Probabilities in Decision Making: Modeling COVID-19 Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the complexities of stationary and non-stationary transition probabilities within the framework of a Markov Decision Process (MDP), specifically applied to COVID-19. The research highlights the critical role these probabilities play in accurately modeling disease dynamics and informing evidence-based decisions by policymakers and public health authorities. By incorporating both stationary transition probabilities (which assume constant rates of state changes) and non-stationary transition probabilities (which adapt to evolving conditions), the findings are pivotal for offering practical insights into optimizing resource allocation and intervention strategies to mitigate the pandemic's impacts. The structured analysis within this paper includes a detailed model description, derivation of balanced systems, and formulation of transition probabilities, all contextualized within a COVID-19 scenario. These contributions are invaluable for enhancing the efficacy of pandemic response strategies, ultimately improving public health outcomes and economic efficiency.</description>

      <title>Incorporating episodic memory into quantum models of judgment and decision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An important challenge for quantum theories of cognition and decision concerns the incorporation of memory for recently made judgments and their effects on later judgments. First, we review a general approach to measurement based on system plus environment representations of states and measurement instruments. These more general measurement models provide ways to incorporate effects of recent judgments on later judgments. Then we compare three different measurement models that are based on these more general measurement operations to a puzzling collection of question order effect findings.</description>

      <title>Modeling the Impact of Misinformation Dynamics on Antimicrobial Resistance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Antimicrobial Resistance (RAM) poses a significant threat to global public health, making important medicines less useful. While the medical and biological reasons behind RAM are well studied, we still don't know enough about how false health information affects people's actions, which can speed up RAM. This study presents a new mathematical model to investigate the complex interplay between the spread of misinformation and the dynamics of RAM. We adapt a multi-strain fake news model, including distinct population compartments representing individuals susceptible to, believing in, or skeptical of various ideas related to antibiotic use. The model considers multiple "strains" of misinformation, such as the wrong belief that antibiotics are effective for viral infections or not trusting medical advice regarding prudent antibiotic prescription. Time delays are integrated to reflect the latency in information processing, behavioral change, and the manifestation of resistance. Through stability analysis and numerical simulations, this research aims to identify critical factors and parameters that influence the propagation of harmful beliefs and their consequent impact on behaviors contributing to RAM. The findings could help develop public health campaigns to reduce the negative impact of misinformation on fighting antimicrobial resistance.</description>

      <title>Boltzmann-Informed Probabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional interpretations of probability, whether frequentist or subjective, make no reference to the concept of energy. In this paper, we propose that assigning hypothetical energy levels to the outcomes of a random variable can yield improved probability estimates. We apply this Boltzmann-informed approach to the context of sports betting and analyze five seasons of the English Premier League data. It was found that when used to compute the Kelly criterion, Boltzmann-informed probabilities consistently outperform probabilities derived from the original betting odds. These findings demonstrate the value of integrating energy-informed probabilities into studying complex social systems.</description>

      <title>Fluent but Culturally Distant: Can Regional Training Teach Cultural Understanding?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are used around the world but exhibit Western cultural tendencies. To address this cultural misalignment, many countries have begun developing "regional" LLMs tailored to local communities. Yet it remains unclear whether these models merely speak the language of their users or also reflect their cultural values and practices. Using India as a case study, we evaluate five Indic and five global LLMs along two key dimensions: values (via the Inglehart-Welzel map and GlobalOpinionQA) and practices (via CulturalBench and NormAd). Across all four tasks, we find that Indic models do not align more closely with Indian cultural norms than global models. In fact, an average American person is a better proxy for Indian cultural values than any Indic model. Even prompting strategies fail to meaningfully improve alignment. Ablations show that regional fine-tuning does not enhance cultural competence and may in fact hurt it by impeding recall of existing knowledge. We trace this failure to the scarcity of high-quality, untranslated, and culturally grounded pretraining and fine-tuning data. Our study positions cultural evaluation as a first-class requirement alongside multilingual benchmarks and offers a reusable methodology for developers. We call for deeper investments in culturally representative data to build and evaluate truly sovereign LLMs.</description>

      <title>Fermionic operatorial model of a system with competitive and cooperative interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An operatorial model of a system made by $N$ agents interacting each other with mechanisms that can be thought of as cooperative or competitive is presented. We associate to each agent an annihilation, creation and number fermionic operator, and interpret the mean values of the number operators over an initial condition as measures of the agents' wealth status. The dynamics of the system is assumed to be ruled by a Hermitian Hamiltonian operator $\mathcal{H}$, and the classical Heisenberg view is used. The dynamical outcome is then enriched by using the recently introduced variant of $(\mathcal{H},\rho)$--induced dynamics, where $\rho$ denotes a rule that periodically modifies some of the parameters involved in $\mathcal{H}$. The agents are partitioned in three subgroups, one interacting each other only with a competitive mechanism, one interacting each other only with a cooperative mechanism, and one opportunist subgroup able to compete and cooperate. Some numerical simulations show that the $(\mathcal{H},\rho)$--induced dynamics approach makes, in all the cases, the cooperative subgroup definitely to be more efficient in improving its wealth status than the other subgroups.</description>

      <title>Multidimensional Assessment of Public Space Quality: A Comprehensive Framework Across Urban Space Typologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive framework for evaluating the quality of public spaces across various urban typologies. Through a systematic review of 159 research studies, we identify universal quality factors that transcend spatial types as well as specialized factors unique to specific public environments. Our findings establish accessibility (73.6%), safety/security (58.4%), and comfort (52.8%) as foundational requirements across all public space types, while revealing distinct quality priorities for different typologies: open spaces emphasize comfort (70%), parks prioritize activities (60%), green spaces focus on aesthetics and natural elements (70% and 60%), and public facilities uniquely emphasize indoor environment quality (41.7%). The research reveals a hierarchical relationship between factors, where accessibility enables other qualities, safety serves as a prerequisite for utilization, and comfort determines engagement quality. We identify critical limitations in current assessment approaches, including artificial intelligence studies focused on easily quantifiable factors, domain-specific research confined within disciplinary boundaries, and overreliance on subjective perceptions without objective measures. This research provides a foundation for integrated approaches to public space assessment that acknowledge the complexity of public urban environments while addressing both universal human needs and context-specific requirements. The findings support urban planners, designers, and policymakers in developing balanced assessment methodologies that ensure both comparability across spaces and sensitivity to local conditions, ultimately contributing to the creation of high-quality public spaces that enhance urban life and community wellbeing.</description>

      <title>Modeling the Path of Structural Strategic Deterrence: A Sand Table Simulation and Research Report on China's Military-Industrial Capability System against the United States Based on Rare Earth Supply Disconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study proposes a systematic non-kinetic deterrence path modeling framework based on strategic rare earth supply cut-off, aiming to assess the strategic effects of China's export control policy against the United States at the military system level. The model adopts a four-layer structure of "policy input -- resource node -- equipment system -- capability output" and integrates path dependency modeling, degradation function design, and capability lag prediction mechanisms to form a strategic simulation system. The study incorporates graph neural networks and LSTM-based time series methods to dynamically evaluate the impact of rare earth supply disruption on key U.S. military platforms such as the F-35 fighter, nuclear submarines, and AI combat systems, identifying critical path nodes and strategic timing windows. Results indicate that a ten-year zero-tolerance policy on rare earth exports would lead to a significant technological disconnect between years 3 to 5 and a systemic capability lag between years 8 to 12, with an estimated average annual economic impact of 35 to 40 billion USD. These findings demonstrate that rare earth export cut-offs can serve as a structural strategic deterrent capable of disrupting deployment tempos without direct confrontation. The proposed model provides quantifiable and visualized tools for strategic decision-making and supports national-level security simulations and policy optimization research.</description>

      <title>Improving flocking behaviors in street networks with vision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We improve a flocking model on street networks introduced in a previous paper. We expand the field of vision of walkers, making the model more realistic. Under such conditions, we obtain groups of walkers whose gathering times and robustness to break ups are better than previous results. We explain such improvements because the alignment rule with vision guaranties walkers do not split into divergent directions at intersections anymore, and because the attraction rule with vision gathers distant groups. This paves the way to a better understanding of events where walkers have collective decentralized goals, like protests.</description>

      <title>Properties of zero-determinant strategies in multichannel games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling payoffs in repeated games is one of the important topics in control theory of multi-agent systems. Recently proposed zero-determinant strategies enable players to unilaterally enforce linear relations between payoffs. Furthermore, based on the mathematics of zero-determinant strategies, regional payoff control, in which payoffs are enforced into some feasible regions, has been discovered in social dilemma situations. More recently, theory of payoff control was extended to multichannel games, where players parallelly interact with each other in multiple channels. However, properties of zero-determinant strategies specific to multichannel games are still not clear. In this paper, we elucidate properties of zero-determinant strategies in multichannel games. First, we relate the existence condition of zero-determinant strategies in multichannel games to that of zero-determinant strategies in each channel. We then show that the existence of zero-determinant strategies in multichannel games requires the existence of zero-determinant strategies in some channels. This result implies that the existence of zero-determinant strategies in multichannel games is tightly restricted by structure of games played in each channel.</description>

      <title>Science for Peace and the need for Civil Clauses at universities and civilian research institutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: After the end of World War II, the commitment to confine scientific activities in universities and research institutions to peaceful and civilian purposes has entered, in the form of {\it Civil Clauses}, the charters of many research institutions and universities. In the wake of recent world events, the relevance and scope of such Civil Clauses has been questioned in reports issued by some governments and by the EU Commission, a development that opens the door to a possible blurring of the distinction between peaceful and military research.
  This paper documents the reflections stimulated by a panel discussion on this issue recently organized by the Science4Peace Forum. We review the adoptions of Civil Clauses in research organizations and institutions in various countries, present evidence of the challenges that are emerging to such Civil Clauses, and collect arguments in favour of maintaining the purely civilian and peaceful focus of public (non-military) research.</description>

      <title>Network classification through random walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Network models have been widely used to study diverse systems and analyze their dynamic behaviors. Given the structural variability of networks, an intriguing question arises: Can we infer the type of system represented by a network based on its structure? This classification problem involves extracting relevant features from the network. Existing literature has proposed various methods that combine structural measurements and dynamical processes for feature extraction. In this study, we introduce a novel approach to characterize networks using statistics from random walks, which can be particularly informative about network properties. We present the employed statistical metrics and compare their performance on multiple datasets with other state-of-the-art feature extraction methods. Our results demonstrate that the proposed method is effective in many cases, often outperforming existing approaches, although some limitations are observed across certain datasets.</description>

      <title>Forager with Inertia : Better for Survival?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the fate of a forager who searches for food performing simple random walk on lattices. The forager consumes the available food on the site it visits and leaves it depleted but can survive up to $S$ steps without food. We introduce the concept of inertia in the dynamics which allows the forager to rest with probability $p$ upon consumption of food. The parameter $p$ significantly affects the lifetime of the forager, showing that the inertia can be beneficial for the forager for chosen parameter values. The study of various other quantities reveals interesting scaling behavior with $p$ and also departure from usual diffusive behavior for $0.5 &lt; p &lt; 1$. In addition to numerical approach, the problem has also been studied with analytical approach in one dimension and the results agree reasonably well.</description>

      <title>A Systematic Approach for Studying How Topological Measurements Respond to Complex Networks Modifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Different types of graphs and complex networks have been characterized, analyzed, and modeled based on measurements of their respective topology. However, the available networks may constitute approximations of the original structure as a consequence of sampling incompleteness, noise, and/or error in the representation of that structure. Therefore, it becomes of particular interest to quantify how successive modifications may impact a set of adopted topological measurements, and how respectively undergone changes can be interrelated, which has been addressed in this paper by considering similarity networks and hierarchical clustering approaches. These studies are developed respectively to several topological measurements (accessibility, degree, hierarchical degree, clustering coefficient, betweenness centrality, assortativity, and average shortest path) calculated from complex networks of three main types (Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi, Barab\'asi-Albert, and geographical) with varying sizes or subjected to progressive edge removal or rewiring. The coincidence similarity index, which can implement particularly strict comparisons, is adopted for two main purposes: to quantify and visualize how the considered topological measurements respond to the considered network alterations and to represent hierarchically the relationships between the observed changes undergone by the considered topological measurements. Several results are reported and discussed, including the identification of three types of topological changes taking place as a consequence of the modifications. In addition, the changes observed for the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi and Barab\'asi-Albert networks resulted mutually more similarly affected by topological changes than for the geometrical networks. The latter type of network has been identified to have more heterogeneous topological features than the other two types of networks.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Median Voter: A Model of How the Ideological Dimension Shapes Party Polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11512v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Defying the median voter theorem, party polarization has spread globally, especially in the United States. As concerns grow over its risks to democracy, political science has probed its causes, revealing two paradoxes: while polarization between U.S. political parties has undeniably increased since the 1970s, the corresponding rise in issue polarization among voters remains contested; moreover, the growing number of politically relevant issues would be expected to counteract party polarization rather than reinforce it. To examine these findings theoretically, we analyze a mathematical model of bipartisan elections where voters and parties interact in a multidimensional ideological space. We derive equations that determine the critical threshold of expected voter support needed for a party to find it strategically advantageous to position itself at the center or outside of it. This threshold fundamentally increases with the decrease of the effective dimension of the ideological space, while issue polarization among voters plays a secondary role. Thus, the model points to both paradoxes being explainable if ideological dimensionality is causally linked to polarization. The model reveals a Curie point: below this threshold, parties polarize as in a ferromagnetic phase, with voters acting like aligned spins; above it, they shift toward the center, akin to a paramagnetic phase.</description>

      <title>Negative Ties Highlight Hidden Extremes in Social Media Polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05590v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Human interactions in the online world comprise a combination of positive and negative exchanges. These diverse interactions can be captured using signed network representations, where edges take positive or negative weights to indicate the sentiment of the interaction between individuals. Signed networks offer valuable insights into online political polarization by capturing antagonistic interactions and ideological divides on social media platforms. This study analyzes polarization on Men\'eame, a Spanish social media platform that facilitates engagement with news stories through comments and voting. Using a dual-method approach -- Signed Hamiltonian Eigenvector Embedding for Proximity (SHEEP) for signed networks and Correspondence Analysis (CA) for unsigned networks -- we investigate how including negative ties enhances the understanding of structural polarization levels across different conversation topics on the platform. While the unsigned Men\'eame network effectively delineates ideological communities, only by incorporating negative ties can we identify ideologically extreme users who engage in antagonistic behaviors: without them, the most extreme users remain indistinguishable from their less confrontational ideological peers.</description>

      <title>Quantifying interdisciplinary synergy in higher STEM education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17841v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a framework to quantify and utilize interdisciplinarity in science and engineering curricula in the case of university-level higher education. We analyze interdisciplinary relations by standardizing large-scale official educational data in Korea using a cutting-edge large language model and constructing knowledge maps for disciplines of scientific education. We design and evaluate single-field and integrated dual-field curricula by adapting pedagogical theory and utilizing information theory-based metrics. We develop standard curricula for individual disciplines and integrated curricula combining two fields, with their interdisciplinarity quantified by the curriculum synergy score. The results indicate higher interdisciplinarity for combinations within or across closely related fields, especially in engineering fields. Based on the analysis, engineering fields constitute the core structure of our design for curriculum interdisciplinarity, while basic natural science fields are located at peripheral stems to provide fundamental concepts.</description>
