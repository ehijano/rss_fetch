      <title>Spin precession and laser-induced spin-polarized photocurrents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling spin currents in topological insulators (TIs) is crucial for spintronics but challenged by the robustness of their chiral edge states, which impedes the spin manipulation required for devices like spin-field effect transistors (SFETs). We theoretically demonstrate that this challenge can be overcome by synergistically applying circularly polarized light and gate-tunable Rashba spin-orbit coupling (rSOC) to a 2D TI. Laser irradiation provides access to Floquet sidebands where rSOC induces controllable spin precession, leading to the generation of one-way, switchable spin-polarized photocurrents, an effect forbidden in equilibrium TIs. This mechanism effectively realizes SFET functionality within a driven TI, specifically operating within a distinct Floquet replica, offering a new paradigm for light-based control in topological spintronics.</description>

      <title>Thermal Transport and Application Reassessment of ThSi$_2$N$_4$ Monolayer: From FET Channel to Thermoelectric Material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The two-dimensional M$_2$Z$_4$ materials are proposed as suitable replacements for silicon channels in field-effect transistors (FETs). In the present work, the ThSi$_2$N$_4$ monolayer from the family, with the very appropriate electron mobility, is thermally investigated using the non-equilibrium Monte Carlo simulation of the phonon Boltzmann transport equation. The reliability of the MOSFET with the ThSi$_2$N$_4$ channel has been reassessed and determined to be low due to the high maximum temperature achieved. The phonon analysis is performed and reveals that the dominant contribution of fast and energetic LA and also slow and low energy ZA phonons alongside the minor participation of the TA phonons is responsible for the peak temperature rise reaching 800 K. This finding presents that the ThSi$_2$N$_4$ monolayer is not a good candidate for replacing as silicon channel but alternatively is capable of generating a significant temperature gradient, which makes it, a suitable candidate for using as a thermoelectric material in thermoelectric generators.</description>

      <title>Bilayer graphene as a template for manufacturing novel 2D materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent intensive research on two-dimensional materials (2DMs) rekindle the interest in the intercalation of various atoms and molecules into layered compounds as a tool to manufacture 2DMs and tune their optoelectronic, magnetic and catalytic properties. Intercalation into free-standing bilayer graphene (BLG) has received special attention, as graphene is stable, chemically inert and enables one to study the atomic structure of the intercalated 2DM using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. It was also discovered that the protecting action of graphene sheets makes it possible to not only stabilize the encapsulated single sheets of marginally stable layered materials, but also synthesize completely new 2D systems inside BLG, which in comparison to the bulk graphite allows for easier intercalation and much larger increase in the inter-layer separation of the sheets. In this review, we summarize the recent progress in this area, with a special focus on new materials created inside BLG. We compare the experimental findings to the theoretical predictions, pay special attention to the discrepancies and outline the challenges in the field. Finally, we discuss unique opportunities offered by the intercalation into 2DMs beyond graphene and their heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Algebraic States in Continuum in $ d\gt 1$ Dimensional Non-Hermitian Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the existence of algebraically localized eigenstates embedded within the continuum spectrum of 2D non-Hermitian systems with a single impurity. These modes, which we term algebraic states in continuum (AICs), decay algebraically as $1/|r|$ from the impurity site, and their energies lie within the bulk continuum spectrum under periodic boundary conditions. We analytically derive the threshold condition for the impurity strength required to generate such states. Remarkably, AICs are forbidden in Hermitian systems and in 1D non-Hermitian systems, making them unique to non-Hermitian systems in two and higher dimensions. To detect AICs, we introduce a local density of states as an experimental observable, which is readily accessible in photonic/acoustic platforms.</description>

      <title>Material realization of spinless, covalent-type Dirac semimetals in three dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Realization of a three-dimensional (3D) analogue of graphene has been a central challenge in topological materials science. Graphene is stabilized by covalent bonding unlike conventional spin-orbit type 3D Dirac semimetals (DSMs). In this study, we demonstrate the material realization of covalent-type 3D DSMs $R_8$Co$X_3$ stabilized by covalent bonding. We observe that the carrier mobility $\mu$ of Dirac fermions reaches 3,000$\,\mathrm{cm^2/Vs}$ even in polycrystalline samples, and $\mu$ increases with the inverse of the Fermi energy, evidencing significant contributions to charge transport from Dirac electrons. $R_8$Co$X_3$ provides a material platform for exploration of Dirac electrons in three dimensions with wide chemical tunability.</description>

      <title>A time-reversal invariant vortex in topological superconductors and gravitational $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a topological superconductor in the presence of a time-reversal invariant vortex. The eigenmodes of the Bogoliubov-de-Genne (BdG) Hamiltonian show a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topology: the time-reversal invariant vortex with odd winding number supports a pair of helical Majorana zero-modes at the vortex and the edge, while there is no such zero-modes when the winding number is even. We find that this $\mathbb{Z}_2$ structure can be interpreted as an emergent gravitational effect. Identifying the gap function as spatial components of the vielbein in 2 +1-dimensional gravity theory, we can explicitly convert the BdG equation into the Dirac equation coupled to a nontrivial gravitational background. We find that the gravitational curvature is induced at the vortex core, with its total flux quantized in integer multiples of $\pi$, reflecting the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological structure. Although the curvature vanishes everywhere except at the vortex core, the fermionic spectrum remains sensitive to the total curvature flux, owing to the gravitational Aharonov-Bohm effect.</description>

      <title>Force sensing with a graphene nanomechanical resonator coupled to photonic crystal guided resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving optimal force sensitivity with nanomechanical resonators requires the ability to resolve their thermal vibrations. In two-dimensional resonators, this can be done by measuring the energy they absorb while vibrating in an optical standing wave formed between a light source and a mirror. However, the responsivity of this method -- the change in optical energy per unit displacement of the resonator -- is modest, fundamentally limited by the physics of propagating plane waves. We present simulations showing that replacing the mirror with a photonic crystal supporting guided resonances increases the responsivity of graphene resonators by an order of magnitude. The steep optical energy gradients enable efficient transduction of flexural vibrations using low optical power, thereby reducing heating. Furthermore, the presence of two guided resonances at different wavelengths allows thermal vibrations to be resolved with a high signal-to-noise ratio across a wide range of membrane positions in free space. Our approach provides a simple optical method for implementing ultrasensitive force detection using a graphene nanomechanical resonator.</description>

      <title>Quantum Kinetic Anatomy of Electron Angular Momenta Edge Accumulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling electron's spin and orbital degrees of freedom has been a major research focus over the past two decades, as it underpins the electrical manipulation of magnetization. Leveraging a recently introduced quantum kinetic theory of multiband systems [T. Valet and R. Raimondi, Phys. Rev. B 111, L041118 (2025)], we outline how the intrinsic angular momenta linear response is partitioned into intraband and interband contributions. Focusing on time reversal and inversion symmetric metals, we show that the spin and orbital Hall currents are purely intraband. We also reveal that the edge densities originate partially, and in the orbital case mostly, from a new interband mechanism. We discuss how this profoundly impacts the interpretation of orbital edge accumulation observations, and has broader implications for our understanding of current induced torques.</description>

      <title>Anisotropy-Driven Anomalous Inverse Orbital Hall Effect in Fe Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the anomalous orbital effects in iron (Fe) films with strong uniaxial anisotropy, highlighting the interactions between spin and orbital currents. Using heterogeneous YIG/Fe and YIG/Pt/Fe structures, fabricated by oblique deposition in a magnetic field, spin pumping ferromagnetic resonance (SP-FMR) measurements were performed. It was observed that the uniaxial anisotropy enables the emergence of spin-to-charge (AISHE) and orbital-to-charge (AIOHE) conversion signals in out-of-plane configurations, where the spin polarization is parallel to the direction of the spin current. Experimental analysis revealed that orbital dynamics, mediated by orbital Hall conductivity, are more prominent in Fe films due to the low spin-orbit interaction (SOC) and high orbital response. These findings provide fundamental insights for the advancement of orbitronics devices, indicating the potential for controlling orbital and spin currents through magnetic and anisotropic parameters.</description>

      <title>Photogalvanic effect in hydrodynamic flows of nonreciprocal electron liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study nonlinear hydrodynamic electron transport driven by an AC electric field. In noncentrosymmetric conductors with broken time-reversal (TR) symmetry the nonlinear flow of such liquids is nonreciprocal, giving rise to a DC current $I^{DC}$ that is quadratic in the amplitude of the AC electric field. This is the hydrodynamic analogue of the linear photogalvanic effect (PGE), which arises in bulk noncentrosymmetric materials with broken TR symmetry. The magnitude of $I^{DC}$ depends on both the properties of the electron fluid and the geometry of the flow, and may be characterized by two dimensionless parameters: the nonreciprocity number $\mathcal{N}$, and the frequency-dependent vibrational number $\mathcal{R}$. Due to nonlocality of hydrodynamic transport, at low frequencies of the AC drive, $I^{DC}$ is super-extensive. The AC component of the electric current is likewise strongly affected by nonreciprocity: the hysteretic current-voltage dependence becomes skewed, which can be interpreted in terms of nonreciprocity of the memory retention time.</description>

      <title>Reversible Modification of Rashba States in Topological Insulators at Room Temperature by Edge Functionalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum materials with novel spin textures from strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC) are essential components for a wide array of proposed spintronic devices. Topological insulators have necessary strong SOC that imposes a unique spin texture on topological states and Rashba states that arise on the boundary, but there is no established methodology to control the spin texture reversibly. Here, we demonstrate that functionalizing Bi2Se3 films by altering the step-edge termination directly changes the strength of SOC and thereby modifies the Rashba strength of 1D edge states. Scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy shows that these Rashba edge states arise and subsequently vanish through the Se functionalization and reduction process of the step edges. The observations are corroborated by density functional theory calculations, which show that a subtle chemical change of edge termination fundamentally alters the underlying electronic structure. Importantly, we experimentally demonstrated fully reversible and repeatable switching of Rashba edge states across multiple cycles at room temperature. The results imply Se functionalization as a practical method to control SOC and spin texture of quantum states in topological insulators.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast and reliable domain-wall and skyrmion logic in a chirally coupled ferrimagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unlocking the spin degree of freedom in addition to the electron's charge, spin-based logic offers an in-memory computing architecture beyond-CMOS technology. Here, we encode information into chiral spin textures (e.g., chiral domain-wall and skyrmion) and achieve an ultrafast and reliable all-electrical logic by exploiting the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction-induced chiral coupling. Taking advantage of fast spin dynamics in antiferromagnetically coupled systems, we achieved a fast domain-wall motion passing through the logic gate, exceeding 1 kilometre per second, yielding an operation time of 50 picoseconds for a 50 nanometres-long logic gate. Furthermore, we present a fast logic operation with skyrmion bubbles in a racetrack that exhibits a topologically protected computation scheme. Our work demonstrates a viable approach for advanced microchips with high operation frequency and ultralow power consumption, paving the way for next-generation computing technologies.</description>

      <title>Exciton transport driven by spin excitations in an antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07071v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new class of optical quasiparticles called magnetic excitons recently emerged in magnetic van der Waals materials. Akin to the highly effective strategies developed for electrons, the strong interactions of these excitons with the spin degree of freedom may provide innovative solutions for long-standing challenges in optics, such as steering the flow of energy and information. Here, we demonstrate transport of excitons by spin excitations in the van der Waals antiferromagnetic semiconductor CrSBr. Key results of our study are the observations of ultrafast, nearly isotropic exciton propagation substantially enhanced at the Neel temperature, transient contraction and expansion of the exciton clouds at low temperatures, as well as superdiffusive behavior in bilayer samples. These signatures largely defy description by commonly known exciton transport mechanisms and are related to the currents of incoherent magnons induced by laser excitation instead. We propose that the drag forces exerted by these currents can effectively imprint characteristic properties of spin excitations onto the motion of excitons. The universal nature of the underlying exciton-magnon scattering promises driving of excitons by magnons in other magnetic semiconductors and even in non-magnetic materials by proximity in heterostructures, merging the rich physics of magneto-transport with optics and photonics.</description>

      <title>Superconducting Photocurrent and Light Enriched Supercurrent Phase Relation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Noncentrosymmetric superconductors are expected to exhibit DC photocurrents even for irradiation frequencies below the superconducting gap. Such superconducting photocurrent are non-dissipative and track the quantum geometry of the superconducting state. Here we argue that superconducting photocurrent drives changes to the constitutive superconducting current phase relation (CPR) manifesting in a light controlled inductive response as well as altering the critical current. For chiral incident light, we find that superconducting photocurrent can transform reciprocal CPR into a non-reciprocal CPR producing a non-reciprocal inductance and light-controlled superconducting diode effect. These provide a protocol for measuring superconducting photocurrent and new tools for mapping the quantum geometry and order parameter of superconductors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Waveguide quantum electrodynamics (QED) provides a powerful framework for engineering quantum interactions, traditionally relying on periodic photonic arrays with continuous energy bands. Here, we investigate waveguide QED in a fundamentally different environment: A one-dimensional photonic array whose hopping strengths are structured aperiodically according to the deterministic Fibonacci-Lucas substitution rule. These "Fibonacci waveguides" lack translational invariance and are characterized by a singular continuous energy spectrum and critical eigenstates, representing a deterministic intermediate between ordered and disordered systems. We demonstrate how to achieve decoherence-free, coherent interactions in this unique setting. We analyze two paradigmatic cases: (i) Giant emitters resonantly coupled to the simplest aperiodic version of a standard waveguide. For these, we show that atom photon bound states form only for specific coupling configurations dictated by the aperiodic sequence, leading to an effective atomic Hamiltonian, which itself inherits the Fibonacci structure; and (ii) emitters locally and off-resonantly coupled to the aperiodic version of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger waveguide. In this case the mediating bound states feature aperiodically modulated profiles, resulting in an effective Hamiltonian with multifractal properties. Our work establishes Fibonacci waveguides as a versatile platform, which is experimentally feasible, demonstrating that the deterministic complexity of aperiodic structures can be directly engineered into the interactions between quantum emitters.</description>

      <title>Quantum sensing with ultracold simulators in lattice and ensemble systems: a review</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sensing of parameters is an important aspect in all disciplines, with applications ranging from fundamental science to medicine. Quantum sensing and metrology is an emerging field that lies at the cross-roads of quantum physics, quantum technology, and the discipline in which the parameter estimation is to be performed. While miniaturization of devices often requires quantum mechanics to be utilized for understanding and planning of a parameter estimation, quantum-enhanced sensing is also possible that uses paradigmatic quantum characteristics like quantum coherence and quantum entanglement to go beyond the so-called standard quantum limit. The current review hopes to bring together the concepts related to quantum sensing as realized in ensemble systems, like spin ensembles, light-matter systems, and Bose-Einstein condensates, and lattice systems, like those which can be modelled by the Bose- and Fermi-Hubbard models, and quantum spin models.</description>

      <title>Gap reopening as signature of coupling between Majorana zero modes in Sn-(Bi,Sb)2(Te,S)3-based Josephson trijunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the past two decades, enormous efforts have been made to search for possible platforms and schemes to implement topological quantum computation (TQC). In exploring the Fu-Kane scheme of TQC based on Josephson trijunctions constructed on topological insulators, the expected Majorana phase diagram of a single trijunction has been experimentally verified. If Majorana zero modes indeed exist in this kind of trijunctions, coupling between them in multiple trijunction devices would be further expected. In this study, we fabricated Josephson devices containing two adjacent Josephson trijunctions on the surface of Sn-(Bi,Sb)2(Te,S)3, and observed that the minigap reopens for both trijunctions in their phase spaces where a closure would otherwise be expected if the trijunctions existed independently. Our findings would provide new experimental support for the validity of the Fu-Kane theory and instill further confidence in advancing along the TQC scheme proposed by Fu and Kane.</description>

      <title>Unconventional Magnetism, Sliding Ferroelectricity, and Magneto-Optical Kerr Effects in a Multiferroic Bilayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Antiferromagnetic (AFM) materials offer a promising platform for exploring novel couplings between altermagnetic (AM) spin-splitting and magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE), with potential applications in next-generation quantum technologies. In this work, first-principles calculations, symmetry analysis, and kp modeling are employed to demonstrate how interlayer sliding in AFM multiferroic bilayers enables engineering of the electronic, magnetic, and magneto-optical properties. This study reveals an unprecedented dimension-driven AM crossover, where the 2D paraelectric (PE) bilayer exhibits spin-degenerate bands protected by the [C2||Mc] spin-space symmetry, while the 3D counterpart manifests AM spin-splitting along kz not equal to 0 paths. Furthermore, interlayer sliding breaks the Mc symmetry and stabilizes a ferroelectric (FE) state characterized by compensated ferrimagnetism and a Zeeman effect, which produces non-relativistic spin-split bands. In the FE phase, the inclusion of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) lifts accidental degeneracies, creating `alternating' spin-polarized bands due to the interplay of Zeeman and Rashba effects. Crucially, the spin polarization, ferro-valley polarization, and Kerr angle are simultaneously reversible by switching either interlayer sliding or the Neel vector. These findings highlight the rich coupling between electronic, magnetic, and optical orders in sliding multiferroics, thereby paving the way for ultra-low-power spintronics and optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Electric-field-assisted phase switching for crystal phase quantum dot fabrication in GaAs nanowires</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The occurrence of several crystal phases within nanostructures of a single material presents both challenges and opportunities. While unintended phase mixing can degrade optoelectronic performances, deliberate control of polytypism enables novel heterostructures with unique quantum properties, crystal phase quantum dots (CPQDs). However, since tailoring the formation of CPQDs is difficult, applications remain scarce. Here, we demonstrate electric-field-driven crystal phase switching in GaAs nanowires during vapor-liquid-solid growth, enabling precise control of crystal phases and creations of CPQDs with monolayer precision. Nanowires are epitaxially grown on custom-made silicon micro-substrates using chemical vapor deposition within an in-situ TEM. Real-time imaging reveals that the electric field switches instantaneously the crystal phase between zinc blende and wurtzite, creating atomically sharp interfaces. Numerical simulations are developed to investigate the impact of the electric field on the catalyst droplet geometry, which largely governs the crystal phase. This constitutes a key progress towards unlocking the potential of CPQDs.</description>

      <title>Thickness-Dependent Spin Pumping in YIG/W$_{90}$Ti$_{10}$ Bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the spin pumping efficiency in YIG/YIG/W$_{90}$Ti$_{10}$ bilayers by measuring the thickness dependence of both the YIG and WTi layers using broadband ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) spectroscopy. The deposition of a 5-nm WTi layer leads to enhanced Gilbert damping in thinner YIG films, indicating efficient spin current injection. From the spin pumping contribution to the damping of the YIG/WTi bilayer, we determine an effective spin mixing conductance of $ 3.3 \times 10^{18}~\mathrm{m}^{-2} $ for the 5-nm WTi layer. Further measurements with varying WTi thickness reveal a non-monotonic dependence of spin mixing conductance, peaking at $ 4.2 \times 10^{18}~\mathrm{m}^{-2} $ for a 3-nm WTi layer. This behavior is attributed to a structural phase transition from the high-spin--orbit $ \beta $-phase to the less efficient $ \alpha $-phase in thicker WTi layers. Furthermore, comparative analysis with YIG/W bilayers shows that Ti doping significantly reduces $ g^{\uparrow\downarrow}_{\mathrm{eff}} $. These findings highlight the critical role of alloy composition and structural phase in tuning spin transport for spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Excess quasiparticles and their dynamics in the presence of subgap states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Material inhomogeneities in a superconductor generically lead to broadening of the density of states and to subgap states. The latter are associated with spatial fluctuations of the gap in which quasiparticles can be trapped. Recombination between such localized quasiparticles is hindered by their spatial separation and hence their density could be higher than expectations based on the recombination between mobile quasiparticles. We show here that the recombination between localized and mobile excitations can be efficient at limiting the quasiparticle density. We comment on the significance of our findings for devices such as superconducting resonators and qubits. We find that for typical aluminum devices, the subgap states do not significantly influence the quasiparticle density.</description>

      <title>On the difference between thermalization in open and isolated quantum systems: a case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11932v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thermalization of isolated and open quantum systems has been studied extensively. However, being the subject of investigation by different scientific communities and being analysed using different mathematical tools, the connection between the isolated (IQS) and open (OQS) approaches to thermalization has remained opaque. Here we demonstrate that the fundamental difference between the two paradigms is the order in which the long time and the thermodynamic limits are taken. This difference implies that they describe physics on widely different time and length scales. Our analysis is carried out numerically for the case of a double quantum dot (DQD) coupled to a fermionic lead. We show how both OQS and IQS thermalization can be explored in this model on equal footing, allowing a fair comparison between the two. We find that while the quadratically coupled (free) DQD experiences no isolated thermalization, it of course does experience open thermalization. For the non-linearly interacting DQD coupled to a fermionic lead, the many-body interaction in the DQD breaks the integrability of the whole system. We find that this system shows strong evidence of both OQS and IQS thermalization in the same dynamics, but at widely different time scales, consistent with reversing the order of the long time and the thermodynamic limits.</description>

      <title>Two-color laser control of photocurrent and high harmonics in graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07767v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We comprehensively investigate two-color-laser-driven photocurrent and high harmonic generation (HHG) in graphene models. By numerically solving the quantum master equation, we uniformly explore a broad parameter regime including both the weak (perturbative) and intense-laser (nonperturbative) cases while considering the dissipation effects. We demonstrate that the HHG spectra can be drastically altered by tuning the real-space path traced by the laser electric field. This controllability is explained by the dynamical symmetry argument. We also show that both the magnitude and the direction of photocurrent (zeroth order harmonics) can be controlled by varying the frequency, intensity, ellipticity, and relative phase of the two-color laser. Furthermore, the nature of photocurrent is shown to be classified into shift- or injection-current types, depending on the phase of two-color laser. Our findings indicate that even in centrosymmetric electron systems, photocurrent and HHG can be quantitatively controlled by adjusting various external parameters if we utilize multicolor laser with a lower spatial or temporal symmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15333v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The surface states of intrinsic higher order topological phases are protected by the spatial symmetries of a finite sample. This property makes the existing scattering theory of topological invariants inapplicable because the scattering geometry is either incompatible with the symmetry or does not probe the bulk topology. We resolve this obstacle by using a symmetric scattering geometry that probes transport from the inside to the outside of the sample. We demonstrate that the intrinsic higher order topology is captured by the flux dependence of the reflection matrix. Our finding follows from identifying the spectral flow of a flux line as a signature of higher order topology. We show how this scattering approach applies to several examples of higher order topological insulators and superconductors. Our theory provides an alternative approach for proving bulk--edge correspondence in intrinsic higher order topological phases, especially in presence of disorder.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03033v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semiconductor spin qubits have emerged as a promising platform for quantum computing, following a significant improvement in their control fidelities over recent years. Increasing the qubit count remains challenging, beginning with the fabrication of small features and complex fanouts. A particular challenge has been formed by the need for individual barrier gates to control the exchange interaction between adjacent spin qubits. Here, we propose a method to vary two-qubit interactions without applying pulses on individual barrier gates while also remaining insensitive to detuning noise in first order. Experimentally we find that changing plunger gate voltages over 300 mV can tune the exchange energy $J$ from 100 kHz to 60 MHz. This allows us to perform two-qubit operations without changing the barrier gate voltage. Based on these findings we conceptualize a spin qubit architecture without individual barrier gates, simplifying the fabrication while maintaining the control necessary for universal quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Single-step high-fidelity three-qubit gates by anisotropic chiral interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12182v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Direct multi-qubit gates are becoming critical to facilitate quantum computations in near-term devices by reducing the gate counts and circuit depth. Here, we demonstrate that fast and high fidelity three-qubit gates can be realized in a single step by leveraging small anisotropic and chiral three-qubit interactions. These ingredients naturally arise in state-of-the-art spin-based quantum hardware through a combination of spin-orbit interactions and orbital magnetic fields. These interactions resolve the key synchronization issues inherent in protocols relying solely on two-qubit couplings, which significantly limit gate fidelity. We confirm with numerical simulations that our single-step three-qubit gate can outperform existing protocols, potentially achieving infidelity $\leq 10^{-4}$ in 80-100 ns under current experimental conditions. To further benchmark its performance, we also propose an alternative composite three-qubit gate sequence based on anisotropic two-qubit interactions with built-in echo sequence and show that the single-step protocol can outperform it, making it highly suitable for near-term quantum processors.</description>

Abstract: A comparative study of electronic transport and spin polarization between clean and Aubry-Andre-Harper chains in the presence of electron-electron (e-e) and electron-phonon (e-ph) interactions is presented. The entire system is simulated within a tight-binding framework based on the Hubbard-Holstein model. Trans-mission probability and spin polarization are evaluated using the Green's function method under the Hartree-Fock mean-field approximation through a self-consistent procedure. The transmission profile is found to be consistent with the band structure, which is also discussed. An overall enhancement of spin polariza-tion induced by e-ph interaction is reported for the first time, to the best of our knowledge. Our analysis may be useful for studying controlled spin-selective electron transmission in the presence of e-ph coupling.</description>

      <title>Work-function and structures of (100), (111) and (101) Au surfaces with/without oxygen</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16208v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Work function (f)is fundamental for chemistry and electronics. Additionally, f can be used to examine the validity of the theoretical surfaces by comparing it with experimental f, even in the absence of long-range orders. In the reported and present experiments, the difference in f between pristine and oxygen-covered Au surfaces (df) is &lt;1 eV at =&lt;1 ML (1 ML: one full-monolayer). Contrarily, the available density functional theory (DFT) reports df ~ 3 eV for Au(111) surfaces at 1 ML. Hence, we study structures of O-atom-covered Au(100), Au(110), and Au(111) surfaces using DFT. The calculated most stable structures show df &lt;1.1 eV at =&lt;1 ML and a nearly constant df at &gt; 1 ML, which match experiments and are confirmed using hybrid functional. These agreements result from the stability-criteria transition between low and high O-coverages, driven by the O-induced displacements of Au-atoms and the new surface structures at high O-coverages. The most stable structures exhibit molecule-like O arrangements at Au(111) surfaces at 1 ML and all surfaces at 2 ML; the former is considered chemisorption. At Au(111) surfaces, some structures containing O-atoms in subsurfaces have formation energies that approach those of the most stable structures, while the variation of these structures increases with surface size. Hence, mixing these structures with the most stable structures is believed to destroy long-range orders, which agrees with the experiments. The density of states at the surfaces calculated using the hybrid functional exhibit small bandgaps at the Au(100) and Au(110) surfaces at 1 ML.</description>

Abstract: We present a comprehensive first-principles investigation of boron fullerenes and two-dimensional boron sheets, unified under a coordination-based framework. By classifying over a dozen boron nanostructures, including B$_{12}$, B$_{40}$, B$_{38}$, B$_{65}$, B$_{80}$, and B$_{92}$, according to their local atomic environments (4-, 5-, and 6-fold coordination), we identify clear trends in structural stability, electronic properties, and magnetism. A universal energetic scaling relation $E_c(n) = -a/n^b + E_c^{\mathrm{sheet}}$, with $b = 0.4$ or $b = 0.9$ depending on the coordination family, captures the convergence of fullerene cohesive energies toward those of 2D boron phases. Notably, we establish one-to-one structural correspondences between select cages and experimentally accessible borophenes: B$_{40}$ mirrors the $\chi^3$-sheet, B$_{65}$ the $\beta_{12}$-sheet, B$_{80}$ the $\alpha$-sheet, and B$_{92}$ the $bt$-sheet. Our analysis reveals two distinct families of boron nanostructures based on the scaling exponent: one with $b = 0.9$, comprising structures with significant 6-fold coordination, and another with $b = 0.4$, which includes B$_{40}$, B$_{38}$, and two experimentally observed borophenes. These clusters also exhibit large HOMO--LUMO gaps (e.g., $E_g = 1.78$~eV for B$_{40}$, 1.14~eV for B$_{92}$), contrasting with the metallicity of their 2D counterparts and, in the case of B$_{65}$, spontaneous spin polarization ($M = 3\mu_B$). Our findings provide a predictive strategy for designing boron nanostructures by leveraging coordination fingerprints, and are further validated by the recent experimental synthesis of the B$_{80}$ cage. This work bridges zero- and two-dimensional boron chemistry, offering a roadmap for the future synthesis and application of boron-based materials.</description>

      <title>On-chip magnon polaritons in the ultrastrong coupling regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06065v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Light-matter interactions underpin the quantum technologies from quantum information processing to quantum sensing. When the coupling strength of light-matter interactions approaches the resonance frequencies of light and matter - the ultrastrong coupling regime - antiresonant (counter-rotating) processes, in which a photon and a matter excitation are simultaneously created or annihilated, induce non-negligible ground-state quantum entanglement between light and matter. Ultrastrong coupling thus provides a robust platform for noise-tolerant quantum entanglement, essential for reliable quantum technologies. However, the diamagnetic term typically counteracts antiresonant interactions, inhibiting intriguing phenomena such as thermal equibilium superradiant phase transitions. Here, we present an on-chip platform consisting of a superconducting resonator and thin ferromagnetic films achieving ultrastrong magnon-photon coupling system (magnon polaritons) via collective magnetic-dipole interactions, significantly circumventing the diamagnetic term. We experimentally demonstrate a pronounced Bloch-Siegert shift of about 60 MHz - direct evidence of antiresonant interactions - and observe cooperative enhancement of the effective coupling strength through increasing the number of remote magnon elements coupling with one photon mode. This scalable platform facilitates exploration of exotic quantum phenomena driven by antiresonant interactions, bridging spintronics and quantum optics, and enabling noise-tolerant quantum technological applications.</description>
