      <title>Video2Roleplay: A Multimodal Dataset and Framework for Video-Guided Role-playing Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Role-playing agents (RPAs) have attracted growing interest for their ability to simulate immersive and interactive characters. However, existing approaches primarily focus on static role profiles, overlooking the dynamic perceptual abilities inherent to humans. To bridge this gap, we introduce the concept of dynamic role profiles by incorporating video modality into RPAs. To support this, we construct Role-playing-Video60k, a large-scale, high-quality dataset comprising 60k videos and 700k corresponding dialogues. Based on this dataset, we develop a comprehensive RPA framework that combines adaptive temporal sampling with both dynamic and static role profile representations. Specifically, the dynamic profile is created by adaptively sampling video frames and feeding them to the LLM in temporal order, while the static profile consists of (1) character dialogues from training videos during fine-tuning, and (2) a summary context from the input video during inference. This joint integration enables RPAs to generate greater responses. Furthermore, we propose a robust evaluation method covering eight metrics. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, highlighting the importance of dynamic role profiles in developing RPAs.</description>

      <title>Copycat vs. Original: Multi-modal Pretraining and Variable Importance in Box-office Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The movie industry is associated with an elevated level of risk, which necessitates the use of automated tools to predict box-office revenue and facilitate human decision-making. In this study, we build a sophisticated multimodal neural network that predicts box offices by grounding crowdsourced descriptive keywords of each movie in the visual information of the movie posters, thereby enhancing the learned keyword representations, resulting in a substantial reduction of 14.5% in box-office prediction error. The advanced revenue prediction model enables the analysis of the commercial viability of "copycat movies," or movies with substantial similarity to successful movies released recently. We do so by computing the influence of copycat features in box-office prediction. We find a positive relationship between copycat status and movie revenue. However, this effect diminishes when the number of similar movies and the similarity of their content increase. Overall, our work develops sophisticated deep learning tools for studying the movie industry and provides valuable business insight.</description>

      <title>Jamendo-QA: A Large-Scale Music Question Answering Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Jamendo-QA, a large-scale dataset for Music Question Answering (Music-QA). The dataset is built on freely licensed tracks from the Jamendo platform and is automatically annotated using the Qwen-Omni model. Jamendo-QA provides question-answer pairs and captions aligned with music audio, enabling both supervised training and zero-shot evaluation. Our resource aims to fill the gap of music-specific QA datasets and foster further research in music understanding, retrieval, and generative applications. In addition to its scale, Jamendo-QA covers a diverse range of genres, instruments, and metadata attributes, allowing robust model benchmarking across varied musical contexts. We also provide detailed dataset statistics and highlight potential biases such as genre and gender imbalance to guide fair evaluation. We position Jamendo-QA as a scalable and publicly available benchmark that can facilitate future research in music understanding, multimodal modeling, and fair evaluation of music-oriented QA systems.</description>

      <title>Clinical Multi-modal Fusion with Heterogeneous Graph and Disease Correlation Learning for Multi-Disease Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-disease diagnosis using multi-modal data like electronic health records and medical imaging is a critical clinical task. Although existing deep learning methods have achieved initial success in this area, a significant gap persists for their real-world application. This gap arises because they often overlook unavoidable practical challenges, such as modality missingness, noise, temporal asynchrony, and evidentiary inconsistency across modalities for different diseases. To overcome these limitations, we propose HGDC-Fuse, a novel framework that constructs a patient-centric multi-modal heterogeneous graph to robustly integrate asynchronous and incomplete multi-modal data. Moreover, we design a heterogeneous graph learning module to aggregate multi-source information, featuring a disease correlation-guided attention layer that resolves the modal inconsistency issue by learning disease-specific modality weights based on disease correlations. On the large-scale MIMIC-IV and MIMIC-CXR datasets, HGDC-Fuse significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Emotion-Aware Speech Generation with Character-Specific Voices for Comics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an end-to-end pipeline for generating character-specific, emotion-aware speech from comics. The proposed system takes full comic volumes as input and produces speech aligned with each character's dialogue and emotional state. An image processing module performs character detection, text recognition, and emotion intensity recognition. A large language model performs dialogue attribution and emotion analysis by integrating visual information with the evolving plot context. Speech is synthesized through a text-to-speech model with distinct voice profiles tailored to each character and emotion. This work enables automated voiceover generation for comics, offering a step toward interactive and immersive comic reading experience.</description>

      <title>Beyond Spurious Signals: Debiasing Multimodal Large Language Models via Counterfactual Inference and Adaptive Expert Routing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown substantial capabilities in integrating visual and textual information, yet frequently rely on spurious correlations, undermining their robustness and generalization in complex multimodal reasoning tasks. This paper addresses the critical challenge of superficial correlation bias in MLLMs through a novel causal mediation-based debiasing framework. Specially, we distinguishing core semantics from spurious textual and visual contexts via counterfactual examples to activate training-stage debiasing and employ a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture with dynamic routing to selectively engages modality-specific debiasing experts. Empirical evaluation on multimodal sarcasm detection and sentiment analysis tasks demonstrates that our framework significantly surpasses unimodal debiasing strategies and existing state-of-the-art models.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models on Spoken Sarcasm Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sarcasm detection remains a challenge in natural language understanding, as sarcastic intent often relies on subtle cross-modal cues spanning text, speech, and vision. While prior work has primarily focused on textual or visual-textual sarcasm, comprehensive audio-visual-textual sarcasm understanding remains underexplored. In this paper, we systematically evaluate large language models (LLMs) and multimodal LLMs for sarcasm detection on English (MUStARD++) and Chinese (MCSD 1.0) in zero-shot, few-shot, and LoRA fine-tuning settings. In addition to direct classification, we explore models as feature encoders, integrating their representations through a collaborative gating fusion module. Experimental results show that audio-based models achieve the strongest unimodal performance, while text-audio and audio-vision combinations outperform unimodal and trimodal models. Furthermore, MLLMs such as Qwen-Omni show competitive zero-shot and fine-tuned performance. Our findings highlight the potential of MLLMs for cross-lingual, audio-visual-textual sarcasm understanding.</description>

      <title>Beyond Video-to-SFX: Video to Audio Synthesis with Environmentally Aware Speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The generation of realistic, context-aware audio is important in real-world applications such as video game development. While existing video-to-audio (V2A) methods mainly focus on Foley sound generation, they struggle to produce intelligible speech. Meanwhile, current environmental speech synthesis approaches remain text-driven and fail to temporally align with dynamic video content. In this paper, we propose Beyond Video-to-SFX (BVS), a method to generate synchronized audio with environmentally aware intelligible speech for given videos. We introduce a two-stage modeling method: (1) stage one is a video-guided audio semantic (V2AS) model to predict unified audio semantic tokens conditioned on phonetic cues; (2) stage two is a video-conditioned semantic-to-acoustic (VS2A) model that refines semantic tokens into detailed acoustic tokens. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of BVS in scenarios such as video-to-context-aware speech synthesis and immersive audio background conversion, with ablation studies further validating our design. Our demonstration is available at~\href{https://xinleiniu.github.io/BVS-demo/}{BVS-Demo}.</description>

      <title>SCENEFORGE: Enhancing 3D-text alignment with Structured Scene Compositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The whole is greater than the sum of its parts-even in 3D-text contrastive learning. We introduce SceneForge, a novel framework that enhances contrastive alignment between 3D point clouds and text through structured multi-object scene compositions. SceneForge leverages individual 3D shapes to construct multi-object scenes with explicit spatial relations, pairing them with coherent multi-object descriptions refined by a large language model. By augmenting contrastive training with these structured, compositional samples, SceneForge effectively addresses the scarcity of large-scale 3D-text datasets, significantly enriching data complexity and diversity. We systematically investigate critical design elements, such as the optimal number of objects per scene, the proportion of compositional samples in training batches, and scene construction strategies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SceneForge delivers substantial performance gains across multiple tasks, including zero-shot classification on ModelNet, ScanObjNN, Objaverse-LVIS, and ScanNet, as well as few-shot part segmentation on ShapeNetPart. SceneForge's compositional augmentations are model-agnostic, consistently improving performance across multiple encoder architectures. Moreover, SceneForge improves 3D visual question answering on ScanQA, generalizes robustly to retrieval scenarios with increasing scene complexity, and showcases spatial reasoning capabilities by adapting spatial configurations to align precisely with textual instructions.</description>

      <title>Zero-Shot Visual Grounding in 3D Gaussians via View Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 3D Visual Grounding (3DVG) aims to locate objects in 3D scenes based on text prompts, which is essential for applications such as robotics. However, existing 3DVG methods encounter two main challenges: first, they struggle to handle the implicit representation of spatial textures in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), making per-scene training indispensable; second, they typically require larges amounts of labeled data for effective training. To this end, we propose \underline{G}rounding via \underline{V}iew \underline{R}etrieval (GVR), a novel zero-shot visual grounding framework for 3DGS to transform 3DVG as a 2D retrieval task that leverages object-level view retrieval to collect grounding clues from multiple views, which not only avoids the costly process of 3D annotation, but also eliminates the need for per-scene training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art visual grounding performance while avoiding per-scene training, providing a solid foundation for zero-shot 3DVG research. Video demos can be found in https://github.com/leviome/GVR_demos.</description>

      <title>FLOAT: Generative Motion Latent Flow Matching for Audio-driven Talking Portrait</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01064v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of diffusion-based generative models, portrait image animation has achieved remarkable results. However, it still faces challenges in temporally consistent video generation and fast sampling due to its iterative sampling nature. This paper presents FLOAT, an audio-driven talking portrait video generation method based on flow matching generative model. Instead of a pixel-based latent space, we take advantage of a learned orthogonal motion latent space, enabling efficient generation and editing of temporally consistent motion. To achieve this, we introduce a transformer-based vector field predictor with an effective frame-wise conditioning mechanism. Additionally, our method supports speech-driven emotion enhancement, enabling a natural incorporation of expressive motions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art audio-driven talking portrait methods in terms of visual quality, motion fidelity, and efficiency.</description>

      <title>RETRO: REthinking Tactile Representation Learning with Material PriOrs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14319v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tactile perception is profoundly influenced by the surface properties of objects in contact. However, despite their crucial role in shaping tactile experiences, these material characteristics have been largely neglected in existing tactile representation learning methods. Most approaches primarily focus on aligning tactile data with visual or textual information, overlooking the richness of tactile feedback that comes from understanding the materials' inherent properties. In this work, we address this gap by revisiting the tactile representation learning framework and incorporating material-aware priors into the learning process. These priors, which represent pre-learned characteristics specific to different materials, allow tactile models to better capture and generalize the nuances of surface texture. Our method enables more accurate, contextually rich tactile feedback across diverse materials and textures, improving performance in real-world applications such as robotics, haptic feedback systems, and material editing.</description>

      <title>Tiny is not small enough: High-quality, low-resource facial animation models through hybrid knowledge distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18352v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The training of high-quality, robust machine learning models for speech-driven 3D facial animation requires a large, diverse dataset of high-quality audio-animation pairs. To overcome the lack of such a dataset, recent work has introduced large pre-trained speech encoders that are robust to variations in the input audio and, therefore, enable the facial animation model to generalize across speakers, audio quality, and languages. However, the resulting facial animation models are prohibitively large and lend themselves only to offline inference on a dedicated machine. In this work, we explore on-device, real-time facial animation models in the context of game development. We overcome the lack of large datasets by using hybrid knowledge distillation with pseudo-labeling. Given a large audio dataset, we employ a high-performing teacher model to train very small student models. In contrast to the pre-trained speech encoders, our student models only consist of convolutional and fully-connected layers, removing the need for attention context or recurrent updates. In our experiments, we demonstrate that we can reduce the memory footprint to up to 3.4 MB and required future audio context to up to 81 ms while maintaining high-quality animations. This paves the way for on-device inference, an important step towards realistic, model-driven digital characters.</description>

      <title>AToken: A Unified Tokenizer for Vision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14476v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present AToken, the first unified visual tokenizer that achieves both high-fidelity reconstruction and semantic understanding across images, videos, and 3D assets. Unlike existing tokenizers that specialize in either reconstruction or understanding for single modalities, AToken encodes these diverse visual inputs into a shared 4D latent space, unifying both tasks and modalities in a single framework. Specifically, we introduce a pure transformer architecture with 4D rotary position embeddings to process visual inputs of arbitrary resolutions and temporal durations. To ensure stable training, we introduce an adversarial-free training objective that combines perceptual and Gram matrix losses, achieving state-of-the-art reconstruction quality. By employing a progressive training curriculum, AToken gradually expands from single images, videos, and 3D, and supports both continuous and discrete latent tokens. AToken achieves 0.21 rFID with 82.2% ImageNet accuracy for images, 3.01 rFVD with 40.2% MSRVTT retrieval for videos, and 28.28 PSNR with 90.9% classification accuracy for 3D.. In downstream applications, AToken enables both visual generation tasks (e.g., image generation with continuous and discrete tokens, text-to-video generation, image-to-3D synthesis) and understanding tasks (e.g., multimodal LLMs), achieving competitive performance across all benchmarks. These results shed light on the next-generation multimodal AI systems built upon unified visual tokenization.</description>
