      <title>Statistical inference of collision frequencies from x-ray Thomson scattering spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thomson scattering spectra measure the response of plasma particles to incident radiation. In warm dense matter, which is opaque to visible light, x-ray Thomson scattering (XRTS) enables a detailed probe of the electron distribution and has been used as a diagnostic for electron temperature, density, and plasma ionization. In this work, we examine the sensitivities of inelastic XRTS signatures to modeling details including the dynamic collision frequency and the electronic density of states. Applying verified Monte Carlo inversion methods to dynamic structure factors obtained from time-dependent density functional theory, we assess the utility of XRTS signals as a way to inform the dynamic collision frequency, especially its direct-current (DC) limit, which is directly related to the electrical conductivity.</description>

      <title>Multi-component multi-scale hydrodynamic plasma flow models in mechanical and thermal disequilibria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present work is motivated by the mixing mechanism in inertial confinement fusion (ICF), which remarkably degrades the ignition performance. The mixing is a direct result of velocity disequilibrium and affected by temperature disequilibrium.To deal with these disequilibria, we propose a fully-disequilibrium hydrodynamic model (termed as Baer-Nunziato-Zeldovich model or BNZ model) with 9 equations, 4 temperatures (two for ions, and two for electrons), 4 pressures (two for ions, and two for electrons) and 2 ion velocities for two-component dense plasma flows. The model can be used for describing both grain and atomic mixing by choosing corresponding relaxation mechanism. The derivation starts from a multi-component conservative entropy-dissipative Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK) model to obtain a 14-equation model. It is then reduced to more practical 9-equation BNZ model and further to simpler 8-equation model, 6-equation model (the Kapila-Zeldovich model or the KZ model), and the 5-equation model. The reductions are performed on the basis of various relaxation time evaluations, the plasma neutrality and the smallness of the electron mass. The models are thermodynamics-compatible, and capable of dealing with mechanical and thermal disequilibria at both atomic and grain scales. Moreover, the corresponding hydrodynamic subsystems are shown to be hyperbolic and solved with the Godunov finite volume method. The BNZ model and solution methods are verified and validated by some benchmark problems and 1D-2D comparisons. We then consider the velocity, pressure and temperature disequilibria during the passage of an ablation shock in ICF.</description>

      <title>Indirect nonlinear interaction between toroidal Alfv\'en eigenmode and ion temperature gradient mode mediated by zonal structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The indirect nonlinear interactions between toroidal Alfv\'en eigenmode (TAE) and ion temperature gradient mode (ITG) are investigated using nonlinear gyrokinetic theory and ballooning mode formalism. More specifically, the local nonlinear ITG mode equation is derived adopting the fluid-ion approximation, with the contributions of zonal field structure and phase space zonal structure beat-driven by finite amplitude TAE accounted for on the same footing. The obtained nonlinear ITG mode equation is solved both analytically and numerically, and it is found that, the zonal structure beat-driven by TAE has only weakly destabilizing effects on ITG, contrary to usual speculations and existing numerical results.</description>

      <title>Simulation and analysis of a high-k electron scale turbulence diagnostic for MAST-U</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plasma turbulence on disparate spatial and temporal scales plays a key role in defining the level of confinement achievable in tokamaks, with the development of reduced numerical models for cross-scale turbulence effects informed by experimental measurements an essential step. MAST-U is a well-equipped facility having instruments to measure ion and electron scale turbulence at the plasma edge. However, measurement of core electron scale turbulence is challenging, especially in H mode. Using a novel synthetic diagnostic approach, we present simulated measurement specifications of a proposed mm-wave based collective scattering instrument optimised for measuring both normal and binormal electron scale turbulence in the core and edge of MAST-U. A powerful modelling framework has been developed that combines beam-tracing techniques with gyrokinetic simulations to predict the sensitivity, localisation and spectral range of measurement. For the reconstructed MAST 022769 shot, a maximum measurable normalised bi-normal wavenumber of $k_{\perp} \rho_{e} \sim 0.6$ was predicted in the core and $k_{\perp} \rho_{e} \sim 0.79$ near the pedestal, with localisation lengths $L_{FWHM}$ ranging from $\sim$ 0.4 m in the core at $k_{\perp} \rho_{e} \sim 0.1$ to ~0.08m at $k_{\perp} \rho_{e} \sim 0.45$. Synthetic diagnostic analysis for the 022769 shot using CGYRO gyrokinetic simulation spectra reveal that ETG turbulence wavenumbers of peak spectral intensity comfortably fall within the measurable range of the instrument from the core to the pedestal. The proposed diagnostic opens up opportunities to study new regimes of turbulence and confinement in association with upcoming non-inductive, microwave based current drive experiments on MAST-U and can provide insight into cross-scale turbulence effects, while having suitability to operate during burning plasma scenarios on future reactors such as STEP.</description>

      <title>Surrogate Models studies for laser-plasma accelerator electron source design through numerical optimisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optimisation of the plasma target design for high quality beam laser-driven plasma injector electron source relies on numerical parametric studies using Particle in Cell (PIC) codes. The common input parameters to explore are laser characteristics and plasma density profiles extracted from computational fluid dynamic studies compatible with experimental measurements of target plasma density profiles. We demonstrate the construction of surrogate models using machine learning technique for a laser-plasma injector (LPI) electron source based on more than 12000 simulations of a laser wakefield acceleration performed for sparsely spaced input parameters [1]. Surrogate models are very interesting for LPI design and optimisation because they are much faster than PIC simulations. We develop and compare the performance of three surrogate models, namely, Gaussian processes (GP), multilayer perceptron (MLP), and decision trees (DT). We then use the best surrogate model to quickly find optimal working points to get a selected electron beam energy, charge and energy spread using different methods, namely random search, Bayesian optimisation and multi-objective Bayesian optimisation</description>

      <title>Catastrophic cooling in optically thin plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The solar corona is the prototypical example of a low density environment heated to high temperatures by external sources. The plasma cools radiatively, and because it is optically thin to this radiation, it becomes possible to model the density, velocity, and temperature structure of the system by modifying the MHD equations to include energy source terms that approximate the local heating and cooling rates. The solutions can be highly inhomogeneous and even multiphase because the well known linear instability associated with these source terms, thermal instability, leads to a catastrophic heating and cooling of the plasma in the nonlinear regime. Here we show that there is a separate, much simpler instance of catastrophic heating and cooling accompanying these source terms that can rival thermal instability in dynamical importance. The linear stability criterion is the isochoric one identified by Parker (1953), and we demonstrate that cooling functions derived from collisional ionization equilibrium are highly prone to violating this criterion. If catastrophic cooling instability can act locally in global simulations, then it is an alternative mechanism for forming condensations, and due to its nonequilibrium character, it may be relevant to explaining a host of phenomena associated with the production of cooler gas in hot, low density plasmas.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of Metaplectic Geometrical Optics for Reduced Modeling of Plasma Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03882v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The WKB approximation of geometrical optics is widely used in plasma physics, quantum mechanics and reduced wave modeling in general. However, it is well-known that the approximation breaks down at focal and turning points. In this work we present the first unsupervised numerical implementation of the recently developed metaplectic geometrical optics framework, which extends the applicability of geometrical optics beyond the limitations of WKB, such that the wave field remains finite at caustics. The implementation is in 1D and uses a combination of Gauss-Freud quadrature and barycentric rational function inter- and extrapolation to perform an inverse metaplectic transform numerically. The capabilities of the numerical implementation are demonstrated on Airy's and Weber's equation, which both have exact solutions to compare with. Finally, the implementation is applied to the plasma physics problem of linear conversion of X-mode to electron Bernstein waves at the upper hybrid layer and a comparison is made with results from fully kinetic particle-in-cell simulations. In all three applications we find good agreement between the exact results and the new reduced wave modeling paradigm of metaplectic geometrical optics.</description>

      <title>On the convergence of bootstrap current to the Shaing-Callen limit in stellarators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21599v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bootstrap current in stellarators can be presented as a sum of a collisionless value given by the Shaing-Callen asymptotic formula and an off-set current, which non-trivially depends on plasma collisionality and radial electric field. Using NEO-2 modelling, analytical estimates and semi-analytical studies with help of a propagator method, it is shown that the off-set current in the $1/\nu$ regime does not converge with decreasing collisionality $\nu_\ast$ but rather shows oscillations over $\log\nu_\ast$ with an amplitude of the order of the bootstrap current in an equivalent tokamak. The convergence to the Shaing-Callen limit appears in regimes with significant orbit precession, in particular, due to a finite radial electric field, where the off-set current decreases as $\nu_\ast^{3/5}$. The off-set current strongly increases in case of nearly aligned magnetic field maxima on the field line where it diverges as $\nu_\ast^{-1/2}$ in the $1/\nu$ regime and saturates due to the precession at a level exceeding the equivalent tokamak value by ${v_E^\ast}^{-1/2}$ where $v_E^\ast$ is the perpendicular Mach number. The latter off-set, however, can be minimized by further aligning local magnetic field maxima and by fulfilling an extra integral condition of "equivalent ripples" for the magnetic field. A criterion for the accuracy of this alignment and of ripple equivalence is derived. In addition, the possibility of the bootstrap effect at the magnetic axis caused by the above off-set is also discussed.</description>
