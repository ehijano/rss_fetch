      <title>Are these quasi-normal modes?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss how to extract numerically the expected lowest quasi-normal mode (QNM) associated with the pressure anisotropy for a Bjorken flux evolution to equilibrium. This QNM was easily decoded subtracting the hydrodynamical attractors and was compared with other authors calculations. After evolutions with transients close to the expected lowest QNM the system goes to a tail (pure imaginary frequency) for late times. We analyze the relevance of Navier-Stokes, second order and Borel attractors at each stage of the evolution, which begins far-from-equilibrium and ends close to equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Partial Differential Equations for MHV Celestial Amplitudes in Liouville Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we continue our study of Liouville theory and celestial amplitudes by deriving a set of partial differential equations governing the $n$-point MHV celestial amplitudes for gluons and gravitons, parametrised by the Liouville coupling constant $b$. These equations provide a systematic framework for computing the perturbative expansion in $b$ of the celestial amplitudes, which are known to reproduce the tree-level MHV $n$-point functions for pure Yang-Mills and Einstein gravity in the semiclassical $b\rightarrow0$ limit. We demonstrate that the $\mathcal{O}(b^{2})$ corrections are logarithmic for both gluons and gravitons. Additionally, we compute the correction to the celestial operator product expansion (OPE) parametrised by $b^{2}$ and show that it is isomorphic to the one-loop correction to the celestial OPEs of gluons and gravitons. We propose that celestial Liouville theory, extended beyond its semiclassical limit, encodes the one-loop corrections to Yang-Mills theory and perturbative gravity in flat spacetime.</description>

      <title>6d Large Charge and 2d Virasoro Blocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute observables in the interacting rank-one 6d $\mathcal{N}=(2,0)$ SCFT at large R-charge. We focus on correlators involving $\Phi^n$, namely symmetric products of the bottom component of the supermultiplet containing the stress-tensor. By using the moduli space effective action and methods from the large-charge expansion, we compute the OPE coefficients $\langle\Phi^n\Phi^m\Phi^{n+m}\rangle$ in an expansion in 1/n. The coefficients of the expansion are only partially determined from the 6d perspective, but we manage to fix them order-by-order in 1/n numerically by utilizing the 6d/2d correspondence. This is made possible by the fact that this $6d$ observable can be extracted in 2d from a specific double-scaling limit of the vacuum Virasoro block, which can be efficiently computed numerically. We also extend the computation to higher-rank SCFTs, and discuss various applications of our results to 6d as well as 2d.</description>

      <title>Pinching Sudakov</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we discuss the factorization of the Sudakov form factor on the Coulomb branch of maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory in the near mass-shell limit. We unravel all pinch singularities of this observable making use of the Method of Regions. We find their operator content in terms of matrix elements of Wilson lines on semi-infinite and finite intervals for the jet and ultrasoft functions, respectively. However, naive factorization into these incoherent momentum components is broken at two-loop order by effects subleading in the parameter of dimensional regularization. To save the day, we perform an appropriate twisting of the functions involved as well as simultaneous finite scheme transformation of the 't Hooft coupling. Infrared physics of twisted jet and ultrasoft functions is governed by the octagon anomalous dimension, while the untwisted ultrasoft function possesses infrared evolution driven by an anomalous dimension different from the ubiquitous cusp.</description>

      <title>Dissipation in the $1/D$ expansion for planar matrix models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the thermal behavior of a large number of matrix degrees of freedom in the planar limit. We work in $0+1$ dimensions, with $D$ matrices, and use $1/D$ as an expansion parameter. This can be thought of as a non-commutative large-$D$ vector model, with two independent quartic couplings for the two different orderings of the matrices. We compute a thermal two-point correlator to ${\cal O}(1/D)$ and find that the degeneracy present at large $D$ is lifted, with energy levels split by an amount $\sim 1/\sqrt{D}$. This implies a timescale for thermal dissipation $\sim \sqrt{D}$. At high temperatures dissipation is predominantly due to one of the two quartic couplings.</description>

      <title>Ocneanu Algebra of Seams: Critical Unitary $E_6$ RSOS Lattice Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the $A$ series and exceptional $E_6$ Restricted Solid-On-Solid lattice models as prototypical examples of the critical Yang-Baxter integrable two-dimensional $A$-$D$-$E$ lattice models. We focus on type I theories which are characterized by the existence of an extended chiral symmetry in the continuum scaling limit. Starting with the commuting family of column transfer matrices on the torus, we build matrix representations of the Ocneanu graph fusion algebra as integrable seams for arbitrary finite-size lattices with the structure constants specified by Petkova and Zuber. This commutative seam algebra contains the Verlinde, fused adjacency and graph fusion algebras as subalgebras. Our matrix representation of the Ocneanu algebra encapsulates the quantum symmetry of the commuting family of transfer matrices. In the continuum scaling limit, the integrable seams realize the topological defects of the associated conformal field theory and the known toric matrices encode the twisted conformal partition functions.</description>

      <title>Kerr Black hole mimickers sourced by a string fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present rotating solutions of Einstein's gravity coupled to an effective Born-Infeld theory that describes the end of open-string tachyon condensation after the decay of an unstable $D$-brane or a brane-antibrane system. The geometry of these solutions is that of the rotating frozen star. The solutions are stationary, non-singular and ultracompact, and their exterior geometry is identical, for all practical purposes, to that of the Kerr solution. The Born-Infeld matter consists of radial electric-flux tubes that emanate from, or end at, the ellipsoidal core of the star. Each end of the flux tubes carries an electric charge, so that the electric field can be viewed as being sourced by an ellipsoidal charge distribution of positive and negative charges near the center of the star. Meanwhile, the star's outer layer is equal and oppositely charged, resulting in a vanishing electric field in the external spacetime. We show that these rotating solutions are ultrastable against radial perturbations, just like their static frozen star counterparts. They are also effectively immune to ergoregion instabilities, as we discuss.</description>

      <title>Quantizing the folded string in AdS$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In two-dimensional flat space, the oscillatory motion of a closed folded string--or alternatively, two massless particles connected by a string--can be quantized using the 't Hooft equation. This paper presents an alternative method for quantizing the folded string in anti-de Sitter space. By using variables inspired by integrability, setting $g \equiv {(R_\text{AdS})^2 \over 2\pi \alpha'}$ to a specific p-dependent $\mathcal{O}(1)$ value, and applying a particular boundary condition to the antisymmetrized wavefunction, we obtain a spectrum that precisely matches that of fermion bilinear operators in the disorder-averaged Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model with p-fermion interactions.</description>

      <title>Holography for Boundary Lifshitz Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a holographic duality for the boundary Lifshitz field theory (BLFT). Similar to holographic BCFT, holographic BLFT can be consistently defined by imposing either a Neumann boundary condition (NBC) or a conformal boundary condition (CBC) on the end of the world (EOW) brane. We propose $g$-functions and derive $g$-theorem for these two types of holographic BLFT. On the field theory side, we consider BLFT whose path integral is prescribed to include also paths bouncing off the boundary. The entanglement entropy for an interval for the Lifshitz invariant ground state is computed in the saddle point approximation, and is found to agree precisely with the holographic result in both limits when the interval is very close or very far away from the boundary.</description>

      <title>Fermions in the fuzzy sphere Kaluza-Klein model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider spinors on the total space of a Kaluza-Klein model with fuzzy sphere fibre and geometrically realised Dirac operator on the product. We show that a single massless spinor on the product appears on spacetime as multiplets of spinors with a particular signature of differing masses and $SU(2)$ Yang-Mills charges. For example, for the reduced fuzzy sphere isomorphic to $M_2(\mathbb{C})$, a massless spinor appears as two $SU(2)$ doublets and an $SU(2)$ quadruplet in mass ratios $1:5/3:7/3$. Although such signatures do not appear to exactly math the Standard Model, the paper provides proof of concept of the approach, which can be applied to other noncommutative fibre algebras.</description>

      <title>Black hole scattering amplitudes via analytic small-frequency expansion and monodromy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We utilize three complementary approaches to pinpoint the exact form of scattering amplitudes in Schwarzschild spacetime. First, we solve the Regge-Wheeler equation perturbatively in the small-frequency regime. We use the obtained solutions to determine the monodromy in the near-spatial infinity region, which leads to a specific partial differential equation on the elements of the scattering matrix. As a result, it can be written in terms of the elements of the infinitesimal generator of the monodromy transformation and an integration constant. This constant is further related to the Nekrasov-Shatashvili free energy through the resummation of infinitely many instantons. The quasinormal mode frequencies are also studied in the small-frequency approximation.</description>

      <title>Observational constraints on $\alpha$-Starobinsky inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we revisit $\alpha$-Starobinsky inflation, also know as $E$-model, in the light of current CMB and LSS observations. The inflaton potential in the Einstein frame for this model contains a parameter $\alpha$ in the exponential, which alters the predictions for the scalar and tensor power spectra of Starobinsky inflation. We obtain these power spectra numerically without using slow-roll approximation and perform MCMC analysis to put constraints on parameters $M$ and $\alpha$ from Planck-2018, BICEP/Keck (BK18) and other LSS observations. We consider general reheating scenario by varying the number of e-foldings during inflation, $N_{pivot}$, along with the other parameters. We find $\log_{10}\alpha = 0.0^{+1.6}_{-5.6}$, $\log_{10}M= -4.91^{+0.69}_{-2.7}$ and $N_{pivot} = 53.2^{+3.9}_{-5}$ with $95\%$ C. L.. This implies that the present CMB and LSS observations are insufficient to constrain the parameter $\alpha$. We also find that there is no correlation between $N_{pivot}$ and $\alpha$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the perturbative unitarity bound given by higher dimensional bosonic operators up to dim-6 for the two-Higgs-doublet model (2HDM). They lead to new physics beyond the Standard Model. We point out that such operators can lead to a larger cross-section in the vector boson fusion channels for the scalars, compared to the tree-level 2HDM. We have obtained limits on a few bosonic operators up to dim-6 for 2HDM, by ensuring unitarity of the S-matrix.</description>

      <title>Love symmetry in higher-dimensional rotating black hole spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a method for constructing a 1-parameter family of globally-defined Love symmetry generators in rotating black hole spacetimes of general dimension. The key ingredient is to focus on the vicinity of the (physical) outer horizon, matching only the radial derivative and the outer horizon pole pieces of the Klein--Gordon operator in the black hole spacetime to the $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ Casimir operator. After revisiting the 4D Kerr and 5D Myers--Perry cases, the procedure is illustrated on generalized Lense--Thirring spacetimes which describe a wide variety of slowly rotating black hole metrics in any number of dimensions. Such spacetimes are known to admit an extended tower of Killing tensor and Killing vector symmetries and, as demonstrated in this paper, allow for separability of the massive scalar wave equation in Myers--Perry-like coordinates. Interestingly, separability also occurs in the horizon-penetrating Painlev{\'e}--Gullstrand coordinates associated with the freely infalling observer who registers flat space around her all the way to singularity.</description>

      <title>Charged scalars at finite electric field and temperature in the optimized perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the symmetry breaking and restoration behavior of a self-interacting charged scalar field theory under the influence of a constant electric field and finite temperature. Our study is performed in the context of the optimized perturbation theory. The dependence of the effective potential with constant electric fields is established by means of the bosonic propagators in the Schwinger proper-time method. Explicit analytical expressions for the electric and thermal contributions are found. Our results show a decreasing behavior for the vacuum expectation value as a function of the electric fields, which is strengthened by the temperature effect. A first-order phase transition that occurs at zero /weak electric fields changes to a second-order phase transition under strong electric fields. The critical temperature for the phase transition exhibited a very weak dependence on the electric field. Additionally, we computed the vacuum persistence probability rate for the interacting theory, finding a peak at the critical point. The maximum value of this rate at the critical point is found to be independent of the coupling constant but depended solely on the magnitude of the electric field.</description>

      <title>Testing EGB gravity coupled to bumblebee field and black hole parameter estimation with EHT observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A general covariant Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet Gravity in Four-Dimensional (4D EGB) spacetime is shown to bypass Lovelock's theorem and is free from Ostrogradsky instability. Meanwhile, the bumblebee theory is a vector-tensor theory. It extends the Einstein--Maxwell theory that allows for the spontaneous symmetry breaking that leads to the field acquiring a vacuum expectation value, introducing Lorentz violation into the system. We investigate rotating black holes in the 4D EGB-bumblebee gravity model where Lorentz symmetry is spontaneously broken -- Kerr EGB bumblebee (KEGBB) black holes. The latest observations from the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) of the supermassive black holes (SMBHs) M87* and Sgr A* have sparked intensified interest in the study of black hole shadows, which present a novel avenue for investigating SMBHs within the strong-field regime. Motivated by this, we model SMBHs M87* and Sgr A* as KEGBB black holes, and using the EHT observation result, for given $l$, to find earlier upper limits on the $\alpha$ and $a$ are altered. The KEGBB and Kerr black holes are indiscernible in some parameter space, and one cannot rule out the possibility that the former may serve as strong candidates for astrophysical black holes. Employing our newly developed parameter estimation technique, we use two EHT observables -- namely, the angular diameter of the shadow, $d_{sh}$, and the axial ratio, $\mathcal{D}_A$ -- to estimate parameters of M87* and Sgr A* taking into account observational errors associated with the EHT results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The S-dual $(\mathbf G^\vee\curvearrowright\mathbf M^\vee)$ of the pair $(\mathbf G\curvearrowright\mathbf M)$ of a smooth affine algebraic symplectic manifold $\mathbf M$ with hamiltonian action of a complex reductive group $\mathbf G$ was introduced implicitly in [arXiv:1706.02112] and explicitly in [arXiv:1807.09038] under the cotangent type assumption. The definition was a modification of the definition of Coulomb branches of gauge theories in [arXiv:1601.03586]. It was motivated by the S-duality of boundary conditions of 4-dimensional $\mathcal N=4$ super Yang-Mills theory, studied by Gaiotto and Witten [arXiv:0807.3720]. It is also relevant to the relative Langlands duality proposed by Ben-Zvi, Sakellaridis and Venkatesh. In this article, we review the definition and properties of S-dual.</description>

      <title>Induced Gravitational Waves probing Primordial Black Hole Dark Matter with Memory Burden</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum evaporation of a black hole is conventionally studied semiclassically by assuming self-similarity of the black hole throughout the evaporation process. However, its validity was recently questioned, and the lifetime of a black hole is conjectured to be much extended by the memory burden effect. It gives rise to the possibility that the primordial black holes (PBHs) lighter than $10^{10}$ grams are the dark matter in the Universe. To probe such PBH dark matter, we study gravitational waves (GWs) induced by primordial curvature perturbations that produced the PBHs. We find $\Omega_\text{GW}(f_\text{peak})h^2 = 7 \times 10^{-9}$ with the peak frequency $f_\text{peak} = 1\times 10^{3} \, (M_\text{PBH}/(10^{10}\,\mathrm{g}))^{-1/2}\, \mathrm{Hz}$, and the induced GWs associated with the PBH dark matter whose initial mass is greater than about $10^7$ grams can be tested by future observations such as Cosmic Explorer. Furthermore, the scenario can be in principle confirmed by detecting another GW signal from the mergers of PBHs, which leads to high-frequency GWs with $f_\text{peak} = 2 \times 10^{27}\, (M_\text{PBH, ini}/(10^{10}\, \mathrm{g}))^{-1} \, \mathrm{Hz} $. On the other hand, the induced GW signals stronger than expected would contradict the dark matter abundance and exclude the memory burden effect.</description>

Abstract: Quantum computers are promising tools for the simulation of many-body systems, and among those, QCD stands out by its rich phenomenology. Every simulation starts with a codification, and here we succently review a newly developed compact encoding based on the identification between registers and particles; the quantum memory is divided into registers, and to each we associate a Hilbert space of dimension the number of degrees of freedom of the codified particles. In this way we gain an exponential compression over direct encodings for a low number of particles with many degrees of freedom. As an example we apply this encoding on a two-register memory and implement antisymmetrization and exponentiation algorithms.</description>

      <title>Anomaly freedom in effective Loop Quantum Cosmology: pedagogical summary and generalized holonomy corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The issue of consistency is crucial in quantum gravity. It has recently been intensively addressed for effective symmetry-reduced models. In this article, we exhaustively study the anomaly freedom of effective loop quantum cosmology with generalized holonomy corrections, considering loop correction of the constraints at the perturbative order. We pedagogically explain why, although the holonomy correction -- including the details of the chosen scheme -- applied on the background part of the constraints is crucial, it becomes irrelevant when implemented on perturbative expansions, in the sense that all consequences are "absorbed" in the counter-terms used for the regularization. The possibility of closing the algebra of constraints without counter-terms is also studied. It is argued that, although enforcing a first-class algebra is a strong requirement, this can be achieved in several different ways, often overlooked, which generates ambiguities on the restriction of the form of the generalized holonomy correction. Those ambiguities are examined in details, leading to the conclusion that the consistency of the effective theory for cosmological perturbations, especially when considering scalar modes, cannot be achieved without counter-terms. We also take the opportunity of this work to clarify, as much as possible, all the required steps so that future works have a clear material at disposal. In particular, a highly detailed calculation of all the brackets is provided, emphasizing the (usually implicit) assumptions, hypotheses and manipulations required to ensure the closure of the algebra. Prospects for future works are underlined.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Parameter Space of Inflation Model on the Brane and its Compatibility with the Swampland Conjectures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, inflationary models have been studied from different perspectives using different conditions. Now, in this paper, we want to investigate the inverse monomial Inflation $(IMI)$ on the brane. We limit our results to the potentials of the form $\frac{M^{4+\sigma}}{\phi^{\sigma}}$. We calculate some cosmological parameters and then we investigate the satisfaction of the model with some conjectures of the swampland program. We will check the model's compatibility with the refined dS swampland conjecture(RDSSC), further refining the de Sitter swampland conjecture (FRSDC), scalar weak gravity (SWGC), and strong scalar weak gravity conjecture (SSWGC). Despite the incompatibility with (DSSC), We find a specific region of compatibility with other ones which means it satisfied the (FRDSSC) for example with (a=0.982873, b=0.017127, q=2.2). Also, the model is compatible with the (SWGC) with the ($\phi\leq \sigma+2$) condition and consistent with the (SSWGC) with the ($\phi \leq \sqrt{(\sigma+2)(\sigma+1)}$) condition. Since inverse monomial Inflation(IMI) on the brane could satisfy some swampland conjecture simultaneously, it has the potential to be a "real" inflation model of the universe.</description>

      <title>Spin of Primordial Black Holes from Broad Power Spectrum: Radiation Dominated Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a study to obtain the initial spin or the nondimensional Kerr parameter $a_{*}$ of primordial black holes (PBHs) created during the radiation dominated phase of the universe from not only nearly monochromatic but also broad curvature power spectra. Motivated by inflation and first-order phase transitions, we consider a power law shape for the curvature perturbation. Although we can naturally neglect the contribution from the length scales smaller than the scale of interest, that from the larger scales may potentially be significant for a broad power spectrum, for which the spin is sensitive to the width of the power spectrum. So, we introduce a width parameter $r_{k}$, the ratio of the largest scale to the length of interest. We find that the root mean square of $a_{*}$ is largest for PBHs created from locally nearly scale invariant curvature power spectra with $r_{k} \sim 3.5$. The upper limit is $\sim 1\times 10^{-4}$ for $M=10^{17}-10^{23}$ g,
  $\sim 1.7\times 10^{-4}$ for $M=1-100 M_{\odot}$ and $\sim 2.5\times 10^{-3}$ even for an incredibly large mass of $M=10^{50}$ g.</description>

      <title>From spacetime thermodynamics to Weyl transverse gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There exist two consistent theories of self-interacting gravitons: general relativity and Weyl transverse gravity. The latter has the same classical solutions as general relativity, but different local symmetries. We argue that Weyl transverse gravity also naturally arises from thermodynamic arguments. In particular, we show that thermodynamic equilibrium of local causal diamonds together with the strong equivalence principle encodes the gravitational dynamics of Weyl transverse gravity rather than general relativity. We obtain this result in a self-consistent way, verifying the validity of our initial assumptions, i.e. the proportionality between entropy and area and the different versions of the equivalence principle in Weyl transverse gravity. Furthermore, we extend the thermodynamic derivation of the equations of motion from Weyl transverse gravity to a class of modified theories of gravity with the same local symmetries. For this purpose, we employ the general expression for Wald entropy in such theories.</description>

      <title>Les Houches lecture notes on topological recursion</title>

Abstract: You may have seen the words "topological recursion" mentioned in papers on matrix models, Hurwitz theory, Gromov-Witten theory, topological string theory, knot theory, topological field theory, JT gravity, cohomological field theory, free probability theory, gauge theories, to name a few. The goal of these lecture notes is certainly not to explain all these applications of the topological recursion framework. Rather, the intention is to provide a down-to-earth (and hopefully accessible) introduction to topological recursion itself, so that when you see these words mentioned, you can understand what it is all about. These lecture notes accompanied a series of lectures at the Les Houches school "Quantum Geometry (Mathematical Methods for Gravity, Gauge Theories and Non-Perturbative Physics)" in Summer 2024.</description>

      <title>The 't Hooft equation as a quantum spectral curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.07154v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In an attempt to establish a link between different quantization methods, I examine the massless 't Hooft equation, which governs meson bound state wavefunctions in 2d SU(N) gauge theory in the large-N limit. The integral equation can also be obtained by lightcone quantizing a folded string in flat space. The folded string is a limiting case of a more general setup: a four-segmented string moving in AdS$_3$. I compute its classical spectral curve by using celestial variables and planar bipartite graphs (on-shell diagrams/brane tilings). The adjugate of the Kasteleyn matrix vanishes at two special points, which ensures that the string segments form a closed loop in target space. The Hamiltonian takes on a Ruijsenaars-Schneider form and the phase space is a coadjoint SL(2) orbit whose middle region has been removed. In AdS, the 't Hooft equation acquires an extra term, which has previously been proposed as an effective confining potential in QCD. After an integral transform, the equation can be inverted in terms of a finite difference equation. I show that this difference equation can be interpreted as the quantized (non-analytic) spectral curve of the string. I calculate the spectrum numerically, which interpolates between $M^2=n(n+1)$ in the tensionless limit and 't Hooft's nearly linear Regge trajectory at infinite AdS radius.</description>

Abstract: In a recent paper [1], we proposed that the quantum states of black hole responsible for the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy are given by Bell states of Fermi quanta in the interior of black hole. In this paper, we include the effect of tunneling on these entangled states and show that partial tunneling of these Bell states of Fermi quanta give rises to the Page curve of Hawking radiation. We also show that the entirety of information initially stored in the black hole is returned to the outside via the Hawking radiation.</description>

Abstract: We study the $S$-matrix of Goldstones in the renormalizable theory of a $U(1)$ complex scalar at finite charge, i.e. in a state that breaks Lorentz invariance. The theory is weakly coupled so that this $S$-matrix exists at all energies. Unlike the Lorentz invariant case, the resulting $S$-matrix is not analytic in the exchanged (complexified) four-momentum. The non-analyticities stem from the LSZ reduction formula, as a consequence of the energy-dependent mixing between the radial and Goldstone modes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18937v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Unruh effect can be formulated as the statement that the Minkowski vacuum in a Rindler wedge has a boost as its modular flow. In recent years, other examples of states with geometrically local modular flow have played important roles in understanding energy and entropy in quantum field theory and quantum gravity. Here I initiate a general study of the settings in which geometric modular flow can arise, showing (i) that any geometric modular flow must be a conformal symmetry of the background spacetime, and (ii) that in a well behaved class of "weakly analytic" states, geometric modular flow must be future-directed. I further argue that if a geometric transformation is conformal but not isometric, then it can only be realized as modular flow in a conformal field theory. Finally, I discuss a few settings in which converse results can be shown -- i.e., settings in which a state can be constructed whose modular flow reproduces a given vector field.</description>

      <title>Monotonicity of RG flow in emergent dual holography of worldsheet nonlinear $\sigma$ model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09122v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on the renormalization group (RG) flow of worldsheet bosonic string theory, we construct an effective holographic dual description of the target space theory identifying the RG scale with the emergent extra dimension. This results in an effective dilaton-gravity theory, analogous to the low-energy description of bosonic M-theory. We argue that this holographic dual effective field theory is non-perturbative in the $\alpha'$ expansion. To investigate the monotonicity of RG flow of the metric in the emergent spacetime, we consider entropy production along the RG flow. We construct a microscopic entropy functional based on the probability distribution function of the holographic dual effective field theory, regarded as Gibbs or Shannon entropy. Given that the Ricci flow represents the 1-loop RG flow equation of the target space metric for the 2D non-linear sigma model, and motivated by Perelman's proof of the monotonicity of Ricci flow, we propose a Perelman's entropy functional for the holographic dual effective field theory. Furthermore, utilizing the equivalence between the Hamilton-Jacobi equation and the local RG equation, we show that the RG flow of holographic Perelman's entropy functional is the Weyl anomaly. This eventually verify the monotonicity of RG flow for the emergent target spacetime. Interestingly, we find that the microscopic entropy production rate can be determined by integrating the rate of change of the holographic Perelman's entropy functional over all possible metric configurations along the flow.</description>

      <title>Flat space spinning massive amplitudes from momentum space CFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06447v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the flat space limit of AdS using the momentum space representation of CFT correlators. The flat space limit involves sending the AdS radius and the dimensions of operators dual to massive fields to infinity while also scaling appropriately the sources of the dual operators. In this limit, d-dimensional CFT correlators become (d+1)-dimensional scattering amplitudes. We exemplify our discussion with the computation of the flat-space limit of the CFT 3-point function of a conserved current, a non-conserved charged vector operator and its conjugate. The flat-space limit should yield the scattering amplitude of an Abelian gauge field with two massive vector fields. This scattering amplitude computes the electromagnetic form factors of the electromagnetic current in a spin-1 state, and these form factors encode the electromagnetic properties of the massive vector field (charge, magnetic moment and quadruple moment). In terms of the CFT, the flat-space limit amounts to zooming in the infrared region of the triple-K integrals that determine the 3-point function, while also scaling to infinity the order of (some of) the Bessel functions that feature in the triple-K integrals. In this limit the triple-K integral becomes proportional to the energy-preserving delta function, and the flat space limit correctly yields the corresponding flat space scattering amplitude in complete detail.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16429v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This note study the soft behavior of Yang-Mills (YM) and bi-adjoint scalar (BAS) amplitudes at tree level, by using transmutation operators proposed by Cheung, Shen and Wen. By acting such transmutation operators to gravity amplitudes in the soft limit, we reproduce universal soft factors of YM amplitudes at the leading and sub-leading orders, and explain that the analogous universal soft behavior does not exist at the sub-sub-leading order. Subsequently, by acting the same operators on YM amplitudes, we obtain the universal soft factor of BAS amplitudes at the leading order. Furthermore, we find that a "weaker" version of universal soft behavior of BAS amplitudes holds at the sub-leading order, if we exclude the special $4$-point case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10194v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we explore in detail, the time evolution of Krylov complexity. We demonstrate, through analytical computations, that in finite many-body systems, while ramp and plateau are two generic features of Krylov complexity, the manner in which complexity saturates reveals the chaotic nature of the system. In particular, we show that the dynamics towards saturation precisely distinguish between chaotic and integrable systems. For chaotic models, the saturation value of complexity reaches its infinite time average at a finite saturation time. In this case, depending on the initial state, it may also exhibit a peak before saturation. In contrast, in integrable models, complexity approaches the infinite time average value from below at a much longer timescale. We confirm this distinction using numerical results for specific spin models.</description>

      <title>The Magnetic Maze: A System With Tunable Scale Invariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02176v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Random magnetic field configurations are ubiquitous in nature. Such fields lead to a variety of dynamical phenomena, including localization and glassy physics in some condensed matter systems and novel transport processes in astrophysical systems. Here we consider the physics of a charged quantum particle moving in a ``magnetic maze'': a high-dimensional space filled with a randomly chosen vector potential and a corresponding magnetic field. We derive a path integral description of the model by introducing appropriate collective variables and integrating out the random vector potential, and we solve for the dynamics in the limit of large dimensionality. We derive and analyze the equations of motion for Euclidean and real-time dynamics, and we calculate out-of-time-order correlators. We show that a special choice of vector potential correlations gives rise, in the low temperature limit, to a novel scale-invariant quantum theory with a tunable dynamical exponent. Moreover, we show that the theory is chaotic with a tunable chaos exponent which approaches the chaos bound at low temperature and strong coupling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.01766v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scalarization is a mechanism that endows strongly self-gravitating bodies, such as neutron stars and black holes, with a scalar-field configuration. It resembles a phase transition in that the scalar configuration appears only when a certain quantity that characterizes the compact object, for example, its compactness or spin, is beyond a threshold. A critical and comprehensive review of scalarization, including the mechanism itself, theories that exhibit it, its manifestation in neutron stars, black holes and their binaries, potential extension to other fields, and a thorough discussion of future perspectives, is provided.</description>

      <title>Testing the coupling of dark radiations in light of the Hubble tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.09863v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We are studying the effects of Self-Interacting dark radiation (SIdr) on the evolution of the universe. Our main focus is on the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and how SIdr could potentially help resolve the Hubble tension. We are looking into different scenarios by mixing SIdr with Free-Streaming dark radiation (FSdr) or not to determine whether SIdr can indeed contribute to solving the Hubble tension. We find that SIdr alone can increase the Hubble constant ($H_0$) to $70.1_{-1.6}^{+1.3}, \text{km/s/Mpc}$ with a value of $N_{\rm eff}=3.27_{-0.31}^{+0.23}$. However, including \lzy{FSdr} disfavors the existence of SIdr $\tilde N_{\rm si}\approx0.37$. Even though the Hubble constant is increased compared to the predicted value, it entails $N_{\rm eff}=3.52\pm0.25$. Finally, we implement the Fisher method for future experiments and a $7.64\sigma$ measurement of $\tilde N_{\rm si}$ will be obtained when combing data from Planck, AliCPT, and CMB-S4.</description>

      <title>Perturbative analysis of the three gluon vertex in different gauges at one-loop</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05262v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we present a perturbative analysis of the three-gluon vertex for a kinematical symmetric configuration in dimension $n=4-2\epsilon$ and different covariant gauges.Our study can describe the form factors of the three gluon vertex in a wide range of momentum. We employ a momentum subtraction (MOM) scheme to define the renormalized vertex. We give an in-depth review of three commonly used vector basis for the vertex, and explicitly show the expressions to change from one basis to the other. Although our estimates are valid only in the perturbative regime, we extend our numerical predictions to the infrared domain and show that in $n=4$ some nonperturbative properties are qualitatively present already at perturbation theory. In particular, we find a critical gauge above which the leading form factor displays the so-called zero crossing. We contrast our findings to those of other models and observe a fairly good agreement.</description>

      <title>Measurements of the Low-Acceleration Gravitational Anomaly from the Normalized Velocity Profile of Gaia Wide Binary Stars and Statistical Testing of Newtonian and Milgromian Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05720v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-acceleration gravitational anomaly is investigated with a new method of exploiting the normalized velocity profile $\tilde{v}\equiv v_p/v_c$ of wide binary stars as a function of the normalized sky-projected radius $s/r_{\rm{M}}$ where $v_p$ is the sky-projected relative velocity between the pair, $v_c$ is the Newtonian circular velocity at the sky-projected separation $s$, and $r_{\rm{M}}$ is the MOND radius. With a Monte Carlo method Gaia observed binaries and their virtual Newtonian counterparts are probabilistically distributed on the $s/r_{\rm{M}}$ versus $\tilde{v}$ plane and a logarithmic velocity ratio parameter $\Gamma$ is measured in the bins of $s/r_{\rm{M}}$. With three samples of binaries covering a broad range in size, data quality, and implied fraction of hierarchical systems including a new sample of 6389 binaries selected with accurate distances and radial velocities, I find a unanimous systematic variation from the Newtonian flat line. With $\Gamma=0$ at $s/r_{\rm{M}}\lesssim 0.15$ or $s\lesssim 1$~kilo astronomical units (kau), I get $\Gamma=0.068\pm 0.015$ (stat) $_{-0.015}^{+0.024}$ (syst) for $s/r_{\rm{M}} \gtrsim 0.7$ or $s\gtrsim 5$~kau. The gravitational anomaly (i.e.\ acceleration boost) factor given by $\gamma_g = 10^{2\Gamma}$ is measured to be $\gamma_g = 1.37_{-0.09}^{+0.10}$ (stat) $_{-0.09}^{+0.16}$ (syst). With a reduced $\chi^2$ test of Newtonian and Milgromian nonrelativistic theories, I find that Newtonian gravity is ruled out at $5.8\sigma$ ($\chi^2_\nu=9.4$) by the new sample (and $9.2\sigma$ by the largest sample used). The Milgromian AQUAL theory is acceptable with $0.5\lesssim \chi^2_\nu\lesssim 3.1$. These results agree well with earlier results with the "acceleration-plane analysis" for a variety of samples and the "stacked velocity profile analysis" for a pure binary sample.</description>

      <title>Full-shape analysis with simulation-based priors: constraints on single field inflation from BOSS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13310v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Perturbative, or effective field theory (EFT)-based, full-shape analyses of galaxy clustering data involve ``nuisance parameters'' to capture various observational effects such as the galaxy-dark matter connection (galaxy bias). We present an efficient approach to set informative physically motivated priors on these parameters. We extract these priors from simulated galaxy catalogs based on halo occupation distribution (HOD) models. First, we build a joint distribution between EFT galaxy bias and HOD parameters from a set of 10,500 HOD mock catalogs. We use the field level EFT technique that allows for cosmic variance cancellation, enabling a precision calibration of EFT parameters from computationally inexpensive small-volume simulations. Second, we use neural density estimators -- normalizing flows -- to model the marginal probability density of the EFT parameters, which can be used as a prior distribution in full shape analyses. As a first application, we use our HOD-based priors in a new analysis of galaxy power spectra and bispectra from the BOSS survey in the context of single field primordial non-Gaussianity. We find that our priors lead to a reduction of the posterior volume of bias parameters by an order of magnitude. We also find $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm equil} = 320\pm 300$ and $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm ortho} = 100\pm 130$ (at 68\% CL) in a combined two-template analysis, representing a $\approx 40\%$ improvement in constraints on single field primordial non-Gaussianity, equivalent to doubling the survey volume.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14352v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In \cite{B3}, Bridgeland defined a geometric structure, named a Joyce structure, conjectured to exist on the space $M$ of stability conditions of a $CY_3$ triangulated category. Given a non-degeneracy assumption, a feature of this structure is a complex hyper-K\"ahler metric with homothetic symmetry on the total space $X = TM$ of the holomorphic tangent bundle. \par Generalising the isomonodromy calculation which leads to the $A_2$ Joyce structure in \cite{BM}, we obtain an explicit expression for a hyper-K\"ahler metric with homothetic symmetry via construction of the isomonodromic flows of a Schr\"odinger equation with deformed polynomial oscillator potential of odd degree $2n+1$. The metric is defined on a total space $X$ of complex dimension $4n$ and fibres over a $2n$--dimensional manifold $M$ which can be identified with the unfolding of the $A_{2n}$-singularity. The hyper-K\"ahler structure is shown to be compatible with the natural symplectic structure on $M$ in the sense of admitting an \textit{affine symplectic fibration} as defined in \cite{BS}. \par Separately, using the additional conditions imposed by a Joyce structure, we consider reductions of Pleba\'nski's heavenly equations that govern the hyper-K\"ahler condition. We introduce the notion of a \textit{projectable hyper-Lagrangian} foliation and show that in dimension four such a foliation of $X$ leads to a linearisation of the heavenly equation. The hyper-K\"ahler metrics constructed here are shown to admit such a foliation.</description>

Abstract: We show that the Dirac equation is separated into four differential equations for time-period Majarana fermions in Kerr-Newman, Kerr-Newman-(A)dS spacetimes. Although they can not be transformed into radial and angular equations, the four differential equations yield two algebraic identities. When the electric or magnetic charge is nonzero, they conclude that there is no differentiable time-periodic Majorana fermions outside the event horizon in Kerr-Newman and Kerr-Newman-AdS spacetimes, or between the event horizon and the cosmological horizon in Kerr-Newman-dS spacetime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08145v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the single-parameter $\mathcal{R}+ c\mathcal{R}^2$ gravitational action and use constraints from astrophysics and the laboratory to derive a natural relation between the coefficient $c$ and the value of the cosmological constant. We find that the renormalisation of $c$ from the energy of the inflationary phase to the infrared, where the acceleration of the expansion of the Universe takes place, is correlated with the evolution of the vacuum energy. Our results suggest that the coefficient of the $\mathcal{R}^2$ term may provide an unexpected bridge between high-energy physics and cosmological phenomena such as inflation and dark energy.</description>

Abstract: Zel'dovich and Polnarev, in their seminal paper [1] extending previous work on the Memory Effect, suggested that a gravitational wave generated by flyby would merely displace the particles. We confirm their prediction numerically by fine-tuning the wave profile proposed by Gibbons and Hawking [2], and then analytically for its approximation by a P\"oschl-Teller potential. Higher-order derivative profiles proposed for gravitational collapse, etc [2] are shortly discussed.</description>
