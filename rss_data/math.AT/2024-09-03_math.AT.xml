      <title>Operadic right modules via the dendroidal formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we study the homotopy theory of the category $\mathsf{RMod}_{\mathbf{P}}$ of right modules over a simplicial operad $\mathbf{P}$ via the formalism of forest spaces $\mathsf{fSpaces}$, as introduced by Heuts, Hinich and Moerdijk. In particular, we show that, for $\mathbf{P}$ is closed and $\Sigma$-free, there exists a Quillen equivalence between the projective model structure on $\mathsf{RMod}_{\mathbf{P}}$, and the contravariant model structure on the slice category $\mathsf{fSpaces}_{/N\mathbf{P}}$ over the dendroidal nerve of $\mathbf{P}$. As an application, we comment on how this result can be used to compute derived mapping spaces of between operadic right modules.</description>

      <title>Koszul duality and a classification of stable Weiss towers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a version of Koszul duality for categories, which extends the Koszul duality of operads and right modules. We demonstrate that the derivatives which appear in Weiss calculus (with values in spectra) form a right module over the Koszul dual of the category of vector spaces and orthogonal surjections, resolving conjectures of Arone--Ching and Espic. Using categorical Fourier transforms, we then classify Weiss towers. In particular, we describe the $n$-th polynomial approximation as a pullback of the $(n-1)$-st polynomial approximation along a ``generalized norm map''.</description>

      <title>The directed Vietoris-Rips complex and homotopy and singular homology groups of finite digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove analogues of classical results for higher homotopy groups and singular homology groups of pseudotopological spaces. Pseudotopological spaces are a generalization of (\v{C}ech) closure spaces which are in turn a generalization of topological spaces. Pseudotopological spaces also include graphs and directed graphs as full subcategories. Thus they are a bridge that connects classical algebraic topology with the more applied side of topology. More specifically, we show the existence of a long exact sequence for homotopy groups of pairs of pseudotopological spaces and that a weak homotopy equivalence induces isomorphisms for homology groups. Our main result is the construction of weak homotopy equivalences between the geometric realizations of directed Vietoris-Rips complexes and their underlying directed graphs. This implies that singular homology groups of finite directed graphs can be efficiently calculated from finite combinatorial structures, despite their associated chain groups being infinite dimensional. This work is similar to the work of McCord for finite topological spaces but in the context of pseudotopological spaces. Our results also give a novel approach for studying (higher) homotopy groups of discrete mathematical structures such as (directed) graphs or digital images.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is the second part of a project aimed at formalizing Rozansky-Witten models in the functorial field theory framework. In the first part we constructed a symmetric monoidal $(\infty, 3)$-category $\mathscr{CRW}$ of commutative Rozansky-Witten models with the goal of approximating the $3$-category of Kapustin and Rozansky. In this paper we extend work of Brunner, Carqueville, Fragkos, and Roggenkamp on the affine Rozansky-Witten models: we exhibit a functor connecting their $2$-category of matrix factorizations with the homotopy $2$-category of $\mathscr{CRW}$, and calculate the associated TFTs.</description>

      <title>Topological degree as a discrete diagnostic for disentanglement, with applications to the $\Delta$VAE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the ability of Diffusion Variational Autoencoder ($\Delta$VAE) with unit sphere $\mathcal{S}^2$ as latent space to capture topological and geometrical structure and disentangle latent factors in datasets. For this, we introduce a new diagnostic of disentanglement: namely the topological degree of the encoder, which is a map from the data manifold to the latent space. By using tools from homology theory, we derive and implement an algorithm that computes this degree. We use the algorithm to compute the degree of the encoder of models that result from the training procedure. Our experimental results show that the $\Delta$VAE achieves relatively small LSBD scores, and that regardless of the degree after initialization, the degree of the encoder after training becomes $-1$ or $+1$, which implies that the resulting encoder is at least homotopic to a homeomorphism.</description>

      <title>Orbital categories and weak indexing systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We initiate the combinatorial study of the poset $\mathrm{wIndex}_{\mathcal{T}}$ of weak $\mathcal{T}$-indexing systems, consisting of composable collections of arities for $\mathcal{T}$-equivariant algebraic structures, where $\mathcal{T}$ is an orbital $\infty$-category, such as the orbit category of a finite group. In particular, we show that these are equivalent to weak $\mathcal{T}$-indexing categories and characterize various unitality conditions.
  Within this sits a natural generalization $\mathrm{Index}_{\mathcal{T}} \subset \mathrm{wIndex}_{\mathcal{T}}$ of Blumberg-Hill's indexing systems, consisting of arities for structures possessing binary operations and unit elements. We characterize the relationship between the posets of unital weak indexing systems and indexing systems, the latter remaining isomorphic to transfer systems on this level of generality. We use this to characterize the poset of unital $C_{p^n}$-weak indexing systems.</description>

      <title>The ideal-valued index of fibrations with total space a $G_{2}$ flag manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.01279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2103.01279v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the cohomology of the $G_2$-flag manifolds $G_2/U(2)_{\pm}$, and their structure as a fiber bundle over the homogeneous space $G_2/SO(4)$, we compute the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Fadell-Husseini index of such fiber bundles, for the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ action given by complex conjugation.
  Also, considering the tautological bundle $\gamma$ over $\widetilde{G}_{4}(\mathbb{R}^{7})$, we compute the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Fadell-Husseini index of the pullback bundle of $s\gamma$ along the composition of the fiber bundle $ G_2/U(2)_{\pm} \to G_2/SO(4)$, the embedding between $G_2/SO(4)$ and $\widetilde{G}_{3}(\mathbb{R}^{7})$, and the map that takes the orthogonal complement of a subspace. Here $s\gamma$ means the associated sphere bundle of $\gamma$. Furthermore, we derive a general formula for the $n$-fold product bundle $s\gamma^n$ for which we make the same computations. We finish our work with an application of our computations in a problem concerning discrete geometry.</description>

      <title>Skeleta and categories of algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2110.09595v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define a notion of a connectivity structure on an $\infty$-category, analogous to a $t$-structure but applicable in unstable contexts -- such as spaces, or algebras over an operad. This allows us to generalize notions of n-skeleta, minimal skeleta, and cellular approximation from the category of spaces. For modules over an Eilenberg-Mac Lane spectrum, these are closely related to the notion of projective amplitude. We apply these to ring spectra, where they can be detected via the cotangent complex and higher Hochschild homology with coefficients. We show that the spectra $Y(n)$ of chromatic homotopy theory are minimal skeleta for $H\mathbb{F}_2$ in the category of associative ring spectra. Similarly, Ravenel's spectra $T(n)$ are shown to be minimal skeleta for $BP$ in the same way, which proves that these admit canonical associative algebra structures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.18613v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A notion of vector field cobordism for oriented manifolds was defined by B\"okstedt and Svane. We extend this notion to define complex section cobordism for almost complex manifolds. We then determine the complex section cobordism groups and a relevant cobordism category. We describe an obstruction which tells us when a cobordism class contains a manifold, which can be equipped with $r$ linearly independent complex sections, in terms of the Chern classes. Finally, we show that this obstruction vanishes for certain multiplicative generators in the complex cobordism ring.</description>

      <title>Cyclic duality between BV algebras and BV modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15278v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that if an operad is at the same time a cosimplicial object such that the respective structure maps are compatible with the operadic composition in a natural way, then one obtains a Gerstenhaber algebra structure on cohomology, and if the operad is cyclic, even that of a BV algebra. In particular, if a cyclic opposite module over an operad with multiplication is itself a cyclic operad that meets the cosimplicial compatibility conditions, the cohomology of its cyclic dual turns into a BV algebra. This amounts to conditions for when the cyclic dual of a BV module is endowed with a BV algebra structure, a result we exemplify by looking at classical and less classical (co)homology groups in Hopf algebra theory.</description>

      <title>A note on the smash product and regular associativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12316v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This note is about the smash product of pointed topological spaces, without relying on some convenient subcategory. We deal with its partial associativity properties and their connection with the function spaces, introducing a property of regular associativity related to the colax monoidal structure of the product. We also study a large class of triples of pointed spaces where associativity fails.
  Lax and colax monoidal structures are unusual and interesting, in category theory. Some parts of this note will be obvious to a topologist and others to a categorist, in order to take into account both backgrounds.</description>

      <title>Assembly of Constructible Factorization Algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19472v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a toolbox of extension, gluing, and assembly techniques for factorization algebras.
  Using these tools, we fill various gaps in the literature on factorization algebras on stratified manifolds, the main one being that constructible factorization algebras form a sheaf of symmetric monoidal $\infty$-categories. Additionally, we explain how to assemble constructible factorization algebras from the data on the individual strata together with module structures associated to the relative links; thus answering a question by Ayala.
  Along the way, we give detailed proofs of the following facts which are also of independent interest: constructibility is a local condition; the $\infty$-category of disks is a localization of any sufficiently fine poset of disks; constructibility implies the Weiss condition on disks; constructible factorization algebras are algebras for the $\infty$-operad of embedded disks. For each of these, variants or special cases already existed, but they were either incomplete or not general enough.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18693v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We identify Grandis' directed spaces as a full reflective subcategory of the category of multipointed $d$-spaces. When the multipointed $d$-space realizes a precubical set, its reflection coincides with the standard realization of the precubical set as a directed space. The reflection enables us to extend the construction of the natural system of topological spaces in Baues-Wirsching's sense from directed spaces to multipointed $d$-spaces. In the case of a cellular multipointed $d$-space, there is a discrete version of this natural system which is proved to be bisimilar up to homotopy. We also prove that these constructions are invariant up to homotopy under globular subdivision. These results are the globular analogue of Dubut's results. Finally, we point the apparent incompatibility between the notion of bisimilar natural systems and the q-model structure of multipointed $d$-spaces and we give some suggestions for future works.</description>

Our treatment is self-contained and accessible for readers with a working knowledge of simplicial complexes and (co)homology. The main motivation is a link with Bieri-Eckmann duality for discrete groups, which is explored in a companion paper.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18520v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the previous paper, we studied obstructions to the existence of complex sections on almost complex manifolds up to cobordism. We determined the obstruction rationally, in terms of the Chern classes. In this paper, we study the torsion obstructions, that is, the obstructions which vanish after tensoring with $\mathbb{Q}$ or multiplication by an integer. Calculations with the Adams-Novikov spectral sequence for the Thom spectra $\mathbf{MTU}(d)$ allow us to show the torsion obstructions for low $r$. For prime $p\geq 3$, we show that torsion obstructions for finding $r$ complex sections of order $p$ vanish for $r&lt;p^2-p$.</description>

Abstract: The space of surfaces $\mathbf{X}: [0,1]^2 \to \mathbb{R}^d$ is equipped with natural horizontal and vertical concatenation operations, and we study representations of surfaces which preserve this algebraic structure. The framework of higher category theory allows us to formalize this notion in terms of a functor between double groupoids. We construct such functors by generalizing the classical concept of the path-ordered exponential as a nonabelian path integral. This generalization yields a notion of nonabelian surface integration, and is known in higher gauge theory as surface holonomy (or higher parallel transport). We extend these constructions from smooth surfaces to bounded controlled $p$-variation surfaces in the Young regime, with $p &lt; 2$. By focusing on surface holonomy valued in higher generalizations of the classical matrix groups, called matrix double groups, we obtain explicit computations for piecewise linear approximations. Furthermore, we generalize the nonabelian Stokes' and Fubini theorems to the Young regime. Finally, we use these matrix surface holonomy functors to construct characteristic functions for random surfaces such as fractional Brownian sheets with Hurst parameter $h&gt; \frac{1}{2}$.</description>
