      <title>Deep Learning Based Dynamics Identification and Linearization of Orbital Problems using Koopman Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of the Two-Body and Circular Restricted Three-Body Problems in the field of aerospace engineering and sciences is deeply important because they help describe the motion of both celestial and artificial satellites. With the growing demand for satellites and satellite formation flying, fast and efficient control of these systems is becoming ever more important. Global linearization of these systems allows engineers to employ methods of control in order to achieve these desired results. We propose a data-driven framework for simultaneous system identification and global linearization of both the Two-Body Problem and Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem via deep learning-based Koopman Theory, i.e., a framework that can identify the underlying dynamics and globally linearize it into a linear time-invariant (LTI) system. The linear Koopman operator is discovered through purely data-driven training of a Deep Neural Network with a custom architecture. This paper displays the ability of the Koopman operator to generalize to various other Two-Body systems without the need for retraining. We also demonstrate the capability of the same architecture to be utilized to accurately learn a Koopman operator that approximates the Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem.</description>

      <title>The effect of spatially-varying collision frequency on the development of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) instability is ubiquitously observed, yet has traditionally been studied using ideal fluid models. Collisionality can vary strongly across the fluid interface, and previous work demonstrates the necessity of kinetic models to completely capture dynamics in certain collisional regimes. Where previous kinetic simulations used spatially- and temporally-constant collision frequency, this work presents 5-dimensional (two spatial, three velocity dimensions) continuum-kinetic simulations of the RT instability using a more realistic spatially-varying collision frequency. Three cases of collisional variation are explored for two Atwood numbers: low to intermediate, intermediate to high, and low to high. The low to intermediate case exhibits no RT instability growth, while the intermediate to high case is similar to a fluid limit kinetic case with interface widening biased towards the lower collisionality region. A novel contribution of this work is the low to high collisionality case that shows significantly altered instability growth through upward movement of the interface and damped spike growth due to increased free-streaming particle diffusion in the lower region. Contributions to the energy-flux from the non-Maxwellian portions of the distribution function are not accessible to fluid models and are greatest in magnitude in the spike and regions of low collisionality. Increasing the Atwood number results in greater RT instability growth and reduced upward interface movement. Deviation of the distribution function from Maxwellian is inversely proportional to collision frequency and concentrated around the fluid interface. The linear phase of RT instability growth is well-described by theoretical linear growth rates accounting for viscosity and diffusion.</description>

      <title>Identification of a Single Plasma Parcel during a Parker Solar Probe-Solar Orbiter radial alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12382v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Configurations where two spacecraft, such as Parker Solar Probe (PSP) and Solar Orbiter (SolO), are radially aligned provide opportunities to study the evolution of a single solar wind parcel during so called plasma line-ups. The most critical part of such studies is arguably the identification of what can be considered a same plasma crossing both spacecraft. We present here a method that allowed us to find what we believe to be the same plasma parcel passing through PSP ($\sim 0.075$ au) and SolO ($\sim 0.9$ au) after their radial alignment the 29/04/2021. We started by modeling the plasma propagation in order to get a first estimation of the plasma line-up intervals. The identification of the same density structure (with a crossing duration $\sim 1.5$ h) passing through the two spacecraft allows to precise and confirm this estimation. Our main finding is how stable the density structure is, remaining well recognizable from PSP to SolO despite its $\sim 137$ hours journey in the inner heliosphere. We moreover found that the studied slow solar wind plasma parcel undergone a significant acceleration (from $\sim 200$ to $\sim 300$ km/s) during its propagation.</description>
