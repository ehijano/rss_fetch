      <title>Beyond the classification theorem of Cameron, Goethals, Seidel, and Shult</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1976, Cameron, Goethals, Seidel, and Shult classified all the graphs with smallest eigenvalue at least $-2$ by relating such graphs to root systems that occur in the classification of semisimple Lie algebras. In this paper, extending their beautiful theorem, we give a complete classification of all connected graphs with smallest eigenvalue in $(-\lambda^*, -2)$, where $\lambda^* = \rho^{1/2} + \rho^{-1/2} \approx 2.01980$, and $\rho$ is the unique real root of $x^3 = x + 1$. Our result is the first classification of infinitely many connected graphs with their smallest eigenvalue in $(-\lambda, -2)$ for any constant $\lambda &gt; 2$.</description>

      <title>Evolutive sandpiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sandpile group or Abelian sandpile model was the first example of a self-organized critical system studied by Bak, Tang and Wiesenfeld. The dynamics of the sandpiles occurs when the grains topple over a graph. In this study, we allow the graph evolve over time and change the topology at each stage. This results in the occurrence of phenomenons impossible in the classical sandpile models. Like, configurations over evolutive graphs that are always are unstable. We also experiment with the stabilization of configurations with a large number of grains at the center. This allow us to obtain fractals. Finally, we obtain some power laws associated with some evolutive graphs.</description>

      <title>On the rectilinear crossing number of complete balanced multipartite graphs and layered graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A rectilinear drawing of a graph is a drawing of the graph in the plane in which the edges are drawn as straight-line segments. The rectilinear crossing number of a graph is the minimum number of pairs of edges that cross over all rectilinear drawings of the graph. Let $n \ge r$ be positive integers. The graph $K_n^r$, is the complete $r$-partite graph on $n$ vertices, in which every set of the partition has at least $\lfloor n/r \rfloor$ vertices. The layered graph, $L_n^r$, is an $r$-partite graph on $n$ vertices, in which for every $1\le i \le r-1$, all the vertices in the $i$-th partition are adjacent to all the vertices in the $(i+1)$-th partition. In this paper, we give upper bounds on the rectilinear crossing numbers of $K_n^r$ and~$L_n^r$.</description>

Abstract: Given graphs $H$ and $F$, the generalized Tur\'an number $\mathrm{ex}(n,H,F)$ is the largest number of copies of $H$ in $n$-vertex $F$-free graphs. We study the case when either $H$ or $F$ is a matching. We obtain several asymptotic and exact results.</description>

      <title>Induced orthogonality in semilattices with 0 and in pseudocomplemented lattices and posets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On an arbitrary meet-semilattice S with 0 we define an orthogonality relation and investigate the lattice Cl(S) of all subsets of S closed under this orthogonality. We show that if S is atomic then Cl(S) is a complete atomic Boolean algebra. If S is a pseudocomplemented lattice, this orthogonality relation can be defined by means of the pseudocomplementation. Finally, we show that if S is a complete pseudocomplemented lattice then Cl(S) is a complete Boolean algebra. For pseudocomplemented posets a similar result holds if the subset of pseudocomplements forms a complete lattice satisfying a certain compatibility condition.</description>

      <title>Eigenvalues and graph minors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $spex(n,H_{minor})$ denote the maximum spectral radius of $n$-vertex $H$-minor free graphs. The problem on determining this extremal value can be dated back to the early 1990s. Up to now, it has been solved for $n$ sufficiently large and some special minors, such as $\{K_{2,3},K_4\}$, $\{K_{3,3},K_5\}$, $K_r$ and $K_{s,t}$. In this paper, we find some unified phenomena on general minors. Every graph $G$ on $n$ vertices with spectral radius $\rho\geq spex(n,H_{minor})$ contains either an $H$ minor or a spanning book $K_{\gamma_H}\nabla(n-\gamma_H)K_1$, where $\gamma_H=|H|-\alpha(H)-1$. Furthermore, assume that $G$ is $H$-minor free and $\Gamma^*_s(H)$ is the family of $s$-vertex irreducible induced subgraphs of $H$, then $G$ minus its $\gamma_H$ dominating vertices is $\Gamma^*_{\alpha(H)+1}(H)$-minor saturate, and it is further edge-maximal if $\Gamma^*_{\alpha(H)+1}(H)$ is a connected family. As applications, we obtain some known results on minors mentioned above. We also determine the extremal values for some other minors, such as flowers, wheels, generalized books and complete multi-partite graphs. Our results extend some conjectures on planar graphs, outer-planar graphs and $K_{s,t}$-minor free graphs. To obtain the results, we combine stability method, spectral techniques and structural analyses. Especially, we give an exploration of using absorbing method in spectral extremal problems.</description>

      <title>Derangement Representation of Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A derangement $k$-representation of a graph $G$ is a map $\pi$ of $V(G)$ to the symmetric group $S_k$, such that for any two vertices $v$ and $u$ of $V(G)$, $v $ and $u$ are adjacent if and only if $\pi(v)(i) \neq \pi(u)(i)$ for each $i \in \{1,2,3,\ldots,k\}$. The derangement representation number of $G$ denoted by $drn(G)$, is the minimum of $k$ such that $G$ has a derangement $k$-representation. In this paper, we prove that any graph has a derangement $k$-representation. Also, we obtain some lower and upper bounds for $drn(G)$, in terms of the basic parameters of $G$. Finally, we determine the exact value or give the better bounds of the derangement representation number of some classes of graphs.</description>

      <title>Characterization of order structures avoiding three-term arithmetic progressions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that the set of all nonnegative integers may be equipped with a total order that is chaotic in the sense that there is no monotone three-term arithmetic progressions. Such chaotic order must be so complicated that the resulting ordered set cannot be order isomorphic to the set of all nonnegative integers or the set of all integers with the standard order. In this paper, we completely characterize order structures of chaotic orders on the set of all nonnegative integers, as well as on the set of all integers and on the set of all rational numbers.</description>

      <title>A congruential recurrence characrerizes the inverses of S\'{o}s permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a proof of the three gaps theorem, a class of permutations known as the S\'{o}s permutations was introduced. It is known that a S\'{o}s permutation, as a sequence, satisfies a certain recurrence (S\'{o}s's recurrence), however, whether the converse holds remains unknown. On the other hand, the inverses of S\'{o}s permutations have been studied also. It has been reported that such a permutation satisfies a congruential recurrence as a sequence. The converse problem of this fact, i.e., whether a permutation satisfying the congruential recurrence is the inverse of a S\'{o}s permutation, is also unsolved, except for a finite number of the degrees of the permutations. This paper relates the set of permutations satisfying the congruential recurrence to other sets of permutations and gives upper bounds for their cardinalities. The upper bounds are in fact tight. In particular, the set of permutations satisfying the congruential recurrence has the same cardinality as that of S\'{o}s permutations, giving the affirmative answer to the above unsolved problem as a corollary. As another corollary, it is shown that all permutation, which is regarded as a congruential quasi-progression of diameter 1 in that the set formed by the first order differences modulo the degree of the permutation is a singleton or a set of two successive integers, is the inverse of a S\'{o}s permutation with an elementary operation called as shift applied. As an application of these facts, we present a procedure that lifts the set of the inverses of the S\'{o}s permutations of a given degree to the set of the same kind with the degree increased by one, without referring to the underlying parameters defining the S\'{o}s permutations or the Farey sequence associated to them.</description>

Abstract: The domination polynomial (the total domination polynomial) of a graph $ G $ of order $ n $ is the generating function of the number of dominating sets (total dominating sets) of $ G $ of any size. In this paper, we study the domination polynomial and the total domination polynomial of zero-divisor graphs of the ring $ \mathbb{Z}_n $ where $ n\in\lbrace 2p, p^2, pq, p^2q, pqr, p^\alpha\rbrace $, and $ p, q, r $ are primes with $ p&gt;q&gt;r&gt;2 $.</description>

      <title>Efficiency analysis for the Perron vector of a reciprocal matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In prioritization schemes, based on pairwise comparisons, such as the Analytical Hierarchy Process, it is necessary to extract a cardinal ranking vector from a reciprocal matrix that is unlikely to be consistent. It is natural to choose such a vector only from efficient ones. One of the most used ranking methods employs the (right) Perron eigenvector of the reciprocal matrix as the vector of weights. It is known that the Perron vector may not be efficient. Here, we focus on extending arbitrary reciprocal matrices and show, constructively, that two different extensions of any fixed size always exist for which the Perron vector is inefficient and for which it is efficient, with the following exception. If B is consistent, any reciprocal matrix obtained from B by adding one row and one column has efficient Perron vector. As a consequence of our results, we obtain families of reciprocal matrices for which the Perron vector is inefficient. These include known classes of such matrices and many more. We also characterize the 4-by-4 reciprocal matrices with inefficient Perron vector. Some prior results are generalized or completed.</description>

      <title>On a conjecture of Gross, Mansour and Tucker for $\Delta$-matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gross, Mansour, and Tucker introduced the partial-duality polynomial of a ribbon graph [Distributions, European J. Combin. 86, 1--20, 2020], the generating function enumerating partial duals by the Euler genus. Chmutov and Vignes-Tourneret wondered if this polynomial and its conjectured properties would hold for general delta-matroids, which are combinatorial abstractions of ribbon graphs. Yan and Jin contributed to this inquiry by identifying a subset of delta-matroids-specifically, even normal binary ones-whose twist polynomials are characterized by a singular term. Building upon this foundation, the current paper expands the scope of the investigation to encompass even non-binary delta-matroids, revealing that none of them have width-changing twists.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $k$ be odd, and $n$ an odd multiple of $3$. We prove that $C_k \rtimes C_8$ and $(C_n \times C_3)\rtimes C_8$ do not have the Directed Cayley Isomorphism (DCI) property. When $k$ is also prime, $C_k \rtimes C_8$ had previously been proved to have the Cayley Isomorphism (CI) property. To the best of our knowledge, the groups $C_p \rtimes C_8$ (where $p$ is an odd prime) are only the second known infinite family of groups that have the CI property but do not have the DCI property. This also shows that no group with an element of order $8$ has the DCI property.</description>

Abstract: Let $A$ be a nonempty set of positive integers. The restricted partition function $p_A(n)$ denotes the number of partitions of $n$ with parts in $A$. When the elements in $A$ are pairwise relatively prime positive integers, Ehrhart and Sert\"oz-\"Ozl\"uk derived two reduction formulas for $p_A(n)$ for $A$ with three parameters. We extend their findings for general $A$ using the Bernoulli-Barnes polynomials.</description>

      <title>Perfect Matching in Product Graphs and in their Random Subgraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For $t \in \mathbb{N}$ and every $i\in[t]$, let $H_i$ be a $d_i$-regular connected graph, with $1&lt;|V(H_i)|\le C$ for some integer $C\ge 2$. Let $G=\square_{i=1}^tH_i$ be the Cartesian product of $H_1, \ldots, H_t$. We show that if $t\ge 5C\log_2C$ then $G$ contains a (nearly-)perfect matching.
  Then, considering the random graph process on $G$, we generalise the result of Bollob\'as on the binary hypercube $Q^t$, showing that with high probability, the hitting times for minimum degree one, connectivity, and the existence of a (nearly-)perfect matching in the $G$-random-process are the same. We develop several tools which may be of independent interest in a more general setting of the typical existence of a perfect matching under percolation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A family of sets is $r$-wise agreeing if for any $r$ sets from the family there is an element $x$ that is either contained in all or contained in none of the $r$ sets. The study of such families is motivated by questions in discrete optimization. In this paper, we determine the size of the largest non-trivial $r$-wise agreeing family. This can be seen as a generalization of the classical Brace-Daykin theorem.</description>

      <title>Extensions of discrete Helly theorems for boxes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove extensions of Halman's discrete Helly theorem for axis-parallel boxes in $\mathbb{R}^d$. Halman's theorem says that, given a set $S$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$, if $F$ is a finite family of axis-parallel boxes such that the intersection of any $2d$ contains a point of $S$, then the intersection of $F$ contains a point of $S$. We prove colorful, fractional, and quantitative versions of Halman's theorem. For the fractional versions, it is enough to check that many $(d+1)$-tuples of the family contain points of $S$. Among the colorful versions we include variants where the coloring condition is replaced by an arbitrary matroid. Our results generalize beyond axis-parallel boxes to $H$-convex sets.</description>

Our main result implies the ham-sandwich theorem, the necklace splitting theorem for two thieves, a theorem about chessboard splittings with hyperplanes with fixed directions, and all known cases of Langerman's conjecture about equipartitions with $n$ hyperplanes.
  Our main result also confirms an infinite number of previously unknown cases of the following conjecture of Takahashi and Sober\'on:
  For any $d+k-1$ measures in $\mathbb{R}^d$, there exist an arrangement of $k$ parallel hyperplanes that bisects each of the measures.
  The general result follows from the case of measures that are supported on a finite set with an odd number of points. The proof for this case is inspired by ideas of differential and algebraic topology, but it is a completely elementary parity argument.</description>

      <title>A lower bound on the number of colours needed to nicely colour a sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hadwiger--Nelson problem is about determining the chromatic number of the plane (CNP), defined as the minimum number of colours needed to colour the plane so that no two points of distance 1 have the same colour. In this paper we investigate a related problem for spheres and we use a few natural restrictions on the colouring. Thomassen showed that with these restrictions, the chromatic number of all manifolds satisfying certain properties (including the plane and all spheres with a large enough radius) is at least 7. We prove that with these restrictions, the chromatic number of any sphere with a large enough radius is at least 8. This also gives a new lower bound for the minimum colours needed for colouring the 3-dimensional space with the same restrictions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Information-processing tasks modelled by homomorphisms between relational structures can witness quantum advantage when entanglement is used as a computational resource. We prove that the occurrence of quantum advantage is determined by the same type of algebraic structure (known as a minion) that captures the polymorphism identities of CSPs and, thus, CSP complexity. We investigate the connection between the minion of quantum advantage and other known minions controlling CSP tractability and width. In this way, we make use of complexity results from the algebraic theory of CSPs to characterise the occurrence of quantum advantage in the case of graphs, and to obtain new necessary and sufficient conditions in the case of arbitrary relational structures.</description>

      <title>On multidimensional generalization of binary search</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work generalizes the binary search problem to a $d$-dimensional domain $S_1\times\cdots\times S_d$, where $S_i=\{0, 1, \ldots,n_i-1\}$ and $d\geq 1$, in the following way. Given $(t_1,\ldots,t_d)$, the target element to be found, the result of a comparison of a selected element $(x_1,\ldots,x_d)$ is the sequence of inequalities each stating that either $t_i &lt; x_i$ or $t_i&gt;x_i$, for $i\in\{1,\ldots,d\}$, for which at least one is correct, and the algorithm does not know the coordinate $i$ on which the correct direction to the target is given. Among other cases, we show asymptotically almost matching lower and upper bounds of the query complexity to be in $\Omega(n^{d-1}/d)$ and $O(n^d)$ for the case of $n_i=n$. In particular, for fixed $d$ these bounds asymptotically do match. This problem is equivalent to the classical binary search in case of one dimension and shows interesting differences for higher dimensions. For example, if one would impose that each of the $d$ inequalities is correct, then the search can be completed in $\log_2\max\{n_1,\ldots,n_d\}$ queries. In an intermediate model when the algorithm knows which one of the inequalities is correct the sufficient number of queries is $\log_2(n_1\cdot\ldots\cdot n_d)$. The latter follows from a graph search model proposed by Emamjomeh-Zadeh et al. [STOC 2016].</description>

Abstract: This paper studies the relationship between quadratic Hodge classes on moduli spaces of pseudostable and stable curves given by the contraction morphism $\mathcal{T}.$ While Mumford relations do not hold in the pseudostable case, we show that one can express the (pullback via $\mathcal{T}$ of the) Chern classes of $\mathbb{E}\oplus \mathbb{E}^\vee$ solely in terms of descendants and strata classes. We organize the combinatorial structure of the pullback of products of two pseudostable $\lambda$ classes and obtain an explicit comparison of arbitrary pseudostable and stable quadratic Hodge integrals.</description>

      <title>Random Gabidulin Codes Achieve List Decoding Capacity in the Rank Metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gabidulin codes, serving as the rank-metric counterpart of Reed-Solomon codes, constitute an important class of maximum rank distance (MRD) codes. However, unlike the fruitful positive results about the list decoding of Reed-Solomon codes, results concerning the list decodability of Gabidulin codes in the rank metric are all negative so far. For example, in contrast to Reed-Solomon codes, which are always list decodable up to the Johnson bound in the Hamming metric, Raviv and Wachter-Zeh (IEEE TIT, 2016 and 2017) constructed a class of Gabidulin codes that are not even combinatorially list decodable beyond the unique decoding radius in the rank metric. Proving the existence of Gabidulin codes with good combinatorial list decodability in the rank metric has remained a long-standing open problem.
  In this paper, we resolve the aforementioned open problem by showing that, with high probability, random Gabidulin codes over sufficiently large alphabets attain the optimal generalized Singleton bound for list decoding in the rank metric. In particular, they achieve list decoding capacity in the rank metric.
  Our work is significantly influenced by the recent breakthroughs in the combinatorial list decodability of Reed-Solomon codes, especially the work by Brakensiek, Gopi, and Makam (STOC 2023). Our major technical contributions, which may hold independent interest, consist of the following: (1) We initiate the study of ``higher order MRD codes'' and provide a novel unified theory, which runs parallel to the theory of ``higher order MDS codes'' developed by BGM. (2) We prove a natural analog of the GM-MDS theorem, proven by Lovett (FOCS 2018) and Yildiz and Hassibi (IEEE TIT, 2019), which we call the GM-MRD theorem. In particular, our GM-MRD theorem for Gabidulin codes are strictly stronger than the GM-MDS theorem for Gabidulin codes, proven by Yildiz and Hassibi (IEEE TIT, 2019).</description>

      <title>On the structure of envy-free orientations on graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fair division is the problem of allocating a set of items among agents in a fair manner. One of the most sought-after fairness notions is envy-freeness (EF), requiring that no agent envies another's allocation. When items are indivisible, it ceases to exist, and envy-freeness up to any good (EFX) emerged as one of its strongest relaxations. The existence of EFX allocations is arguably the biggest open question within fair division. Recently, Christodoulou, Fiat, Koutsoupias, and Sgouritsa (EC 2023) introduced showed that EFX allocations exist for the case of graphical valuations where an instance is represented by a graph: nodes are agents, edges are goods, and each agent values only her incident edges. On the other hand, they showed NP-hardness for checking the existence of EFX orientation where every edge is allocated to one of its incident vertices, and asked for a characterization of graphs that exhibit EFX orientation regardless of the assigned valuations. In this paper, we make significant progress toward answering their question. We introduce the notion of strongly EFX orientable graphs -- graphs that have EFX orientations regardless of how much agents value the edges. We show a surprising connection between this property and the chromatic number of the graph, namely $\chi(G)$ for graph $G$. In particular, we show that graphs with $\chi(G)\le 2$ are strongly EFX orientable, and those with $\chi(G)&gt;3$ are not strongly EFX orientable. We provide examples of strongly EFX orientable and non-strongly EFX orientable graphs of $\chi(G)=3$ to prove tightness. Finally, we give a complete characterization of strong EFX orientability when restricted to binary valuations.</description>

Abstract: In this work we introduce a new notion called opacity complexity to measure the complexity of automatic sequences. We study basic properties of this notion, and exhibit an algorithm to compute it. As applications, we compute the opacity complexity of some well-known automatic sequences, including in particular constant sequences, purely periodic sequences, the Thue-Morse sequence, the period-doubling sequence, the Golay-Shapiro(-Rudin) sequence, the paperfolding sequence, the Baum-Sweet sequence, the Tower of Hanoi sequence, and so on.</description>

      <title>Broken lines and compatible pairs for rank 2 quantum cluster algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There have been several combinatorial constructions of universally positive bases in cluster algebras, and these same combinatorial objects play a crucial role in the known proofs of the famous positivity conjecture for cluster algebras. The greedy basis was constructed in rank $2$ by Lee-Li-Zelevinsky using compatible pairs on Dyck paths. The theta basis, introduced by Gross-Hacking-Keel-Kontsevich, has elements expressed as a sum over broken lines on scattering diagrams. It was shown by Cheung-Gross-Muller-Musiker-Rupel-Stella-Williams that these bases coincide in rank $2$ via algebraic methods, and they posed the open problem of giving a combinatorial proof by constructing a (weighted) bijection between compatible pairs and broken lines.
  We construct a quantum-weighted bijection between compatible pairs and broken lines for the quantum type $A_2$ and the quantum Kronecker cluster algebras. By specializing the quantum parameter, this handles the problem of Cheung et al. for skew-symmetric cluster algebras of finite and affine type. For cluster monomials in skew-symmetric rank-$2$ cluster algebras, we construct a quantum-weighted bijection between positive compatible pairs (which comprise almost all compatible pairs) and broken lines of negative angular momentum.</description>

Abstract: We prove the inverse conjecture for the Gowers U^{s+1}[N]-norm for all s &gt;= 3; this is new for s &gt; 3, and the cases s&lt;3 have also been previously established. More precisely, we establish that if f : [N] -&gt; [-1,1] is a function with || f ||_{U^{s+1}[N]} &gt; \delta then there is a bounded-complexity s-step nilsequence F(g(n)\Gamma) which correlates with f, where the bounds on the complexity and correlation depend only on s and \delta. From previous results, this conjecture implies the Hardy-Littlewood prime tuples conjecture for any linear system of finite complexity.

Abstract: Total positivity of matrices is deeply studied and plays an important role in various branches of mathematics. The aim of this paper is to study the criteria for coefficientwise Hankel-total positivity of the row-generating polynomials of generalized $m$-Jacobi-Rogers triangles and their applications.
  Using the theory of production matrices, we present the criteria for coefficientwise Hankel-total positivity of the row-generating polynomials of the output matrices of certain production matrices. In particular, we gain a criterion for coefficientwise Hankel-total positivity of the row-generating polynomial sequence of the generalized $m$-Jacobi-Rogers triangle. This immediately implies that the corresponding generalized $m$-Jacobi-Rogers triangular convolution preserves the Stieltjes moment property of sequences and its zeroth column sequence is coefficientwise Hankel-totally positive and log-convex of higher order in all the indeterminates. In consequence, for $m=1$, we immediately obtain some results on Hankel-total positivity for the Catalan-Stieltjes matrices. In particular, we in a unified manner apply our results to some combinatorial triangles or polynomials including the generalized Jacobi Stirling triangle, a generalized elliptic polynomial, a refined Stirling cycle polynomial and a refined Eulerian polynomial. For the general $m$, combining our criterion and a function satisfying an autonomous differential equation, we present different criteria for coefficientwise Hankel-total positivity of the row-generating polynomial sequence of exponential Rirodan arrays. In addition, we also derive some results for coefficientwise Hankel-total positivity in terms of compositional functions and $m$-branched Stieltjes-type continued fractions. We apply our results to many combinatorial polynomials and solve some conjcetures proposed by Sokal.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.07643v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider a connected graph $G$ and let $T$ be a spanning tree of $G$. Every edge $e \in G-T$ induces a cycle in $T \cup \{e\}$. The intersection of two distinct such cycles is the set of edges of $T$ that belong to both cycles. The MSTCI problem consists in finding a spanning tree that has the least number of such non-empty intersections and the instersection number is the number of non-empty intersections of a solution. In this article we consider three aspects of the problem in a general context (i.e. for arbitrary connected graphs). The first presents two lower bounds of the intersection number. The second compares the intersection number of graphs that differ in one edge. The last is an attempt to generalize a recent result for graphs with a universal vertex.</description>

Abstract: We study three combinatorial models for the lower-triangular matrix with entries $t_{n,k} = \binom{n}{k} n^{n-k}$: two involving rooted trees on the vertex set $[n+1]$, and one involving partial functional digraphs on the vertex set $[n]$. We show that this matrix is totally positive and that the sequence of its row-generating polynomials is coefficientwise Hankel-totally positive. We then generalize to polynomials $t_{n,k}(y,z)$ that count improper and proper edges, and further to polynomials $t_{n,k}(y,\mathbf{\phi})$ in infinitely many indeterminates that give a weight $y$ to each improper edge and a weight $m! \, \phi_m$ for each vertex with $m$ proper children. We show that if the weight sequence $\mathbf{\phi}$ is Toeplitz-totally positive, then the two foregoing total-positivity results continue to hold. Our proofs use production matrices and exponential Riordan arrays.</description>

Abstract: Efficient vectors are the natural set from which to choose a cardinal ranking vector for a pairwise comparison matrix. Such vectors are the key to certain business project selection models. Many ways to construct specific efficient vectors have been proposed. Yet, no previous method to produce all efficient vectors was known. Here, using some graph theoretic ideas, as well as a numerical extension technique, we show how to generate inductively all efficient vectors for any given pairwise comparison matrix. We apply this method to give a matricial proof of the fact that the set of efficient vectors and other related sets are piecewise linearly connected. In addition, we determine explicitly all efficient vectors for a 4-by-4 pairwise comparison matrix. Several examples are provided.</description>

      <title>The connectivity of friends-and-strangers graphs on complete multipartite graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.08121v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For simple graphs $X$ and $Y$ on $n$ vertices, the friends-and-strangers graph $\mathsf{FS}(X,Y)$ is the graph whose vertex set consists of all bijections $\sigma: V(X) \to V(Y)$, where two bijections $\sigma$ and $\sigma'$ are adjacent if and only if they agree on all but two adjacent vertices $a, b \in V(X)$ such that $\sigma(a), \sigma(b) \in V(Y)$ are adjacent in $Y$. Resolving a conjecture of Wang, Lu, and Chen, we completely characterize the connectedness of $\mathsf{FS}(X, Y)$ when $Y$ is a complete bipartite graph. We further extend this result to when $Y$ is a complete multipartite graph. We also determine when $\mathsf{FS}(X, Y)$ has exactly two connected components where $X$ is bipartite and $Y$ is a complete bipartite graph.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.02909v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kalai's $3^d$ conjecture states that every centrally-symmetric $d$-polytope has at least $3^d$ faces. We give short proofs for two special cases: if $P$ is unconditional (that is, invariant w.r.t. reflection in any coordinate hyperplane), and more generally, if $P$ is locally anti-blocking. In both cases we show that the minimum is attained exactly for the Hanner polytopes.</description>

      <title>Behavior of the Minimum Degree Throughout the $d$-process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.16111v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $d$-process generates a graph at random by starting with an empty graph with $n$ vertices, then adding edges one at a time uniformly at random among all pairs of vertices which have degrees at most $d-1$ and are not mutually joined. We show that, in the evolution of a random graph with $n$ vertices under the $d$-process with $d$ fixed, with high probability, for each $j \in \{0,1,\dots,d-2\}$, the minimum degree jumps from $j$ to $j+1$ when the number of steps left is on the order of $\ln(n)^{d-j-1}$. This answers a question of Ruci\'nski and Wormald. More specifically, we show that, when the last vertex of degree $j$ disappears, the number of steps left divided by $\ln(n)^{d-j-1}$ converges in distribution to the exponential random variable of mean $\frac{j!}{2(d-1)!}$; furthermore, these $d-1$ distributions are independent.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.00100v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a (simple) grid polygon $P$ in a grid of equilateral triangles, Defant and Jiradilok considered a billiards system where beams of light bounce around inside of $P$. We study the relationship between the perimeter $\operatorname{perim}(P)$ of $P$ and the number of different trajectories $\operatorname{cyc}(P)$ that the billiards system has. Resolving a conjecture of Defant and Jiradilok, we prove the sharp inequality $\operatorname{cyc}(P) \leq (\operatorname{perim}(P) + 2)/4$ and characterize the equality cases.</description>

      <title>Sparse graph counting and Kelley-Meka bounds for binary systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12248v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a recent breakthrough, Kelley and Meka (FOCS 2023) obtained a strong upper bound on the density of sets of integers without nontrivial three-term arithmetic progressions. In this work, we extend their result, establishing similar bounds for all linear patterns defined by binary systems of linear forms, where ``binary'' indicates that every linear form depends on exactly two variables. Prior to our work, no strong bounds were known for such systems even in the finite field model setting. A key ingredient in our proof is a graph counting lemma. The classical graph counting lemma, developed by Thomason (Random Graphs 1985) and Chung, Graham, and Wilson (Combinatorica 1989), is a fundamental tool in combinatorics. For a fixed graph $H$, it states that the number of copies of $H$ in a pseudorandom graph $G$ is similar to the number of copies of $H$ in a purely random graph with the same edge density as $G$. However, this lemma is only non-trivial when $G$ is a dense graph. In this work, we prove a graph counting lemma that is also effective when $G$ is sparse. Moreover, our lemma is well-suited for density increment arguments in additive number theory. As an immediate application, we obtain a strong bound for the Tur\'an problem in Abelian Cayley graphs: we prove that an Abelian Cayley graph on $N$ vertices that does not contain any $r$-clique as a subgraph must have at most $2^{-\Omega_r(\log^{1/16}N)}\cdot N^2$ edges. These results hinge on the technology developed by Kelley and Meka and the follow-up work by Kelley, Lovett, and Meka (STOC 2024).</description>

Abstract: The double star $S(m_1,m_2)$ is obtained from joining the centres of a star with $m_1$ leaves and a star with $m_2$ leaves. We give a short proof of a new upper bound on the two-colour Ramsey number of $S(m_1,m_2)$, for positive $m_1,m_2$ fulfilling $(\sqrt 5+1)m_2/2 &lt; m_1 &lt; 3m_2$. Our result implies that for all positive $m$, the Ramsey number of the double star $S(2m,m)$ is at most $4.275m$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05860v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given $\pi \in S_n$, let $Z_{n,k}(\pi)=\sum_{1\leq i_1&lt;\dots&lt;i_k\leq n} \mathbf{1}(\{ \pi_{i_1}&lt;\dots&lt;\pi_{i_k}\}$ denote the number of increasing subsequences of length $k$. Consider the problem of studing the distribution of $Z_{n,k}$ for general $k$ and $n$. For the 2nd moment, Ross Pinsky made a combinatorial study by considering a pair of subsequences $i^{(r)}_1&lt;\dots&lt;i^{(r)}_k$ for $r \in \{1,2\}$, and conditioning on the size of the intersection $j = |\{i_1^{(1)},\dots,i^{(1)}_k\} \cap \{i^{(2)}_1,\dots,i^{(2)}_k\}|$. We obtain the large deviation rate function for $\mathbf{E}[Z_{n,k} Z_{n,\ell}]$ in the asymptotic regime $k\sim \kappa n^{1/2}$, $\ell \sim \lambda n^{1/2}$ as $n \to \infty$, for $\kappa,\lambda \in (0,\infty)$. This uses multivariate generating function techniques, as found in the textbook of Pemantle and Wilson. For higher moments, if one thinks of the ``overlap'' between two subsequences $i^{(r)}_1&lt;\dots&lt;i^{(r)}_k$ for $r \in \{1,2\}$, as the size of their intersection $j$, then an ultrametric ansatz leads to rigorous lower bounds for the higher moments. For the 3rd moment, the replica symmetric ansatz leads to a complete elliptic integral for the generating function, following a method similar to the diagonal method of Furstenberg, Hautus and Klarner.</description>

      <title>The Stanley-Stembridge Conjecture for $\bf 2 + 1 +1$-avoiding unit interval orders: a diagrammatic proof</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07280v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A natural unit interval order is a naturally labelled partially ordered set that avoids patterns ${\bf 3} + {\bf 1}$ and $\bf 2 + 2$. To each natural unit interval order one can associate a symmetric function. The Stanley-Stembridge conjecture states that each such symmetric function is positive in the basis of complete homogenous symmetric functions. This conjecture has connections to cohomology rings of Hessenberg varieties, and to Kazhdan-Lusztig theory. We use a diagrammatic technique to re-prove the special case of the conjecture for unit interval orders additionally avoiding pattern $\bf 2 + 1 + 1$. Originally this special case is due to Gebhard and Sagan.</description>

      <title>Off-diagonally symmetric domino tilings of the Aztec diamond of odd order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09057v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the enumeration of off-diagonally symmetric domino tilings of odd-order Aztec diamonds in two directions: (1) with one boundary defect, and (2) with maximally-many zeroes on the diagonal. In the first direction, we prove a symmetry property which states that the numbers of off-diagonally symmetric domino tilings of the Aztec diamond of order $2n-1$ are equal when the boundary defect is at the $k$th position and the $(2n-k)$th position on the boundary, respectively. This symmetry property proves a special case of a recent conjecture by Behrend, Fischer, and Koutschan.
  In the second direction, a Pfaffian formula is obtained for the number of "nearly" off-diagonally symmetric domino tilings of odd-order Aztec diamonds, where the entries of the Pfaffian satisfy a simple recurrence relation. The numbers of domino tilings mentioned in the above two directions do not seem to have a simple product formula, but we show that these numbers satisfy simple matrix equations in which the entries of the matrix are given by Delannoy numbers. The proof of these results involves the method of non-intersecting lattice paths and a modification of Stembridge's Pfaffian formula for families of non-intersecting lattice paths. Finally, we propose conjectures concerning the log-concavity and asymptotic behavior of the number of off-diagonally symmetric domino tilings of odd-order Aztec diamonds.</description>

      <title>Inscribable fans I: Inscribed cones and virtual polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.07724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2012.07724v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate polytopes inscribed into a sphere that are normally equivalent (or strongly isomorphic) to a given polytope $P$. We show that the associated space of polytopes, called the inscribed cone of $P$, is closed under Minkowski addition. Inscribed cones are interpreted as type cones of ideal hyperbolic polytopes and as deformation spaces of Delaunay subdivisions. In particular, testing if there is an inscribed polytope normally equivalent to $P$ is polynomial time solvable.
  Normal equivalence is decided on the level of normal fans and we study the structure of inscribed cones for various classes of polytopes and fans, including simple, simplicial, and even. We classify (virtually) inscribable fans in dimension $2$ as well as inscribable permutahedra and nestohedra.
  A second goal of the paper is to introduce inscribed virtual polytopes. Polytopes with a fixed normal fan $\mathcal{N}$ form a monoid with respect to Minkowski addition and the associated Grothendieck group is called the type space of $\mathcal{N}$. Elements of the type space correspond to formal Minkowski differences and are naturally equipped with vertices and hence with a notion of inscribability. We show that inscribed virtual polytopes form a subgroup, which can be non-trivial even if $\mathcal{N}$ does not have actual inscribed polytopes.
  We relate inscribed virtual polytopes to routed particle trajectories, that is, piecewise-linear trajectories of particles in a ball with restricted directions. The state spaces gives rise to connected groupoids generated by reflections, called reflection groupoids. The endomorphism groups of reflection groupoids can be thought of as discrete holonomy groups of the trajectories and we determine when they are reflection groups.</description>

Abstract: Consider a connected graph $G$ and let $T$ be a spanning tree of $G$. Every edge $e \in G-T$ induces a cycle in $T \cup \{e\}$. The intersection of two distinct such cycles is the set of edges of $T$ that belong to both cycles. We consider the problem of finding a spanning tree that has the least number of such non-empty intersections.</description>

Abstract: For any hereditary graph class $F$, we construct optimal adjacency labeling schemes for the classes of subgraphs and induced subgraphs of Cartesian products of graphs in $F$. As a consequence, we show that, if $F$ admits efficient adjacency labels (or, equivalently, small induced-universal graphs) meeting the information-theoretic minimum, then the classes of subgraphs and induced subgraphs of Cartesian products of graphs in $F$ do too. Our proof uses ideas from randomized communication complexity, hashing, and additive combinatorics, and improves upon recent results of Chepoi, Labourel, and Ratel [Journal of Graph Theory, 2020].</description>

Abstract: The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is a much discussed method in ranking business alternatives based on empirical and judgemental information. We focus here upon the key component of deducing efficient vectors for a reciprocal matrix of pair-wise comparisons. It is not yet known how to produce all efficient vectors. It has been shown that the entry-wise geometric mean of all columns is efficient for any reciprocal matrix. Here, by combining some new basic observations with some known theory, we 1) give a method for inductively generating large collections of efficient vectors, and 2) show that the entry-wise geometric mean of any collection of distinct columns of a reciprocal matrix is efficient. We study numerically, using different measures, the performance of these geometric means in approximating the reciprocal matrix by a consistent matrix.</description>

      <title>Hypergraph dualization with FPT-delay parameterized by the degeneracy and dimension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.06974v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: At STOC 2002, Eiter, Gottlob, and Makino presented a technique called ordered generation that yields an $n^{O(d)}$-delay algorithm listing all minimal transversals of an $n$-vertex hypergraph of degeneracy $d$. Recently at IWOCA 2019, Conte, Kant\'e, Marino, and Uno asked whether this XP-delay algorithm parameterized by $d$ could be made FPT-delay for a weaker notion of degeneracy, or even parameterized by the maximum degree $\Delta$, i.e., whether it can be turned into an algorithm with delay $f(\Delta)\cdot n^{O(1)}$ for some computable function $f$. Moreover, and as a first step toward answering that question, they note that they could not achieve these time bounds even for the particular case of minimal dominating sets enumeration. In this paper, using ordered generation, we show that an FPT-delay algorithm can be devised for minimal transversals enumeration parameterized by the degeneracy and dimension, giving a positive and more general answer to the latter question.</description>

      <title>A determinantal point process approach to scaling and local limits of random Young tableaux</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.11885v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We obtain scaling and local limit results for large random Young tableaux of fixed shape $\lambda^0$ via the asymptotic analysis of a determinantal point process due to Gorin and Rahman (2019). More precisely, we prove:
  (1) an explicit description of the limiting surface of a uniform random Young tableau of shape $\lambda^0$, based on solving a complex-valued polynomial equation;
  (2) a simple criteria to determine if the limiting surface is continuous in the whole domain;
  (3) and a local limit result in the bulk of a random Poissonized Young tableau of shape $\lambda^0$.
  Our results have several consequences, for instance: they lead to explicit formulas for the limiting surface of $L$-shaped tableaux, generalizing the results of Pittel and Romik (2007) for rectangular shapes; they imply that the limiting surface for $L$-shaped tableaux is discontinuous for almost-every $L$-shape; and they give a new one-parameter family of infinite random Young tableaux, constructed from the so-called random infinite bead process.</description>

Abstract: In 2017, Igusa and Todorov gave a bijection between signed exceptional sequences and ordered partial clusters. In this paper, we show that every term in an exceptional sequence is either relatively projective or relatively injective or both and we refine this bijection to one between projectively signed exceptional sequences and ordered partial positive clusters by assigning signs to objects that are not relatively injective. We also give a characterization of relatively projective/injective objects in terms of supports of the objects in the exceptional sequence.</description>
