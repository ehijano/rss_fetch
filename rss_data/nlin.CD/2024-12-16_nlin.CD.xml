      <title>Dynamical mean-field theory for a highly heterogeneous neural population</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale systems with inherent heterogeneity often exhibit complex dynamics that are crucial for their functional properties. However, understanding how such heterogeneity shapes these dynamics remains a significant challenge, particularly in systems with widely varying time scales. To address this, we extend Dynamical Mean Field Theory$\unicode{x2014}$a powerful framework for analyzing large-scale population dynamics$\unicode{x2014}$to systems with heterogeneous temporal properties. Using the population dynamics of a biological neural network as an example, we develop a theoretical framework that determines how inherent heterogeneity influences the critical transition point of the network. By introducing a model that incorporates graded-persistent activity$\unicode{x2014}$a property where certain neurons sustain activity over extended periods without external inputs$\unicode{x2014}$we show that neurons with extremely long timescales shift the system's transition point and expand its dynamical regime, enhancing its suitability for temporal information processing. Furthermore, we validate our framework by applying it to a system with heterogeneous adaptation, demonstrating that such heterogeneity can reduce the dynamical regime, contrary to previous simplified approximations. These findings establish a theoretical foundation for understanding the functional advantages of diversity in complex systems and offer insights applicable to a wide range of heterogeneous networks beyond neural populations.</description>

      <title>Controlling dynamical systems into unseen target states using machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel, model-free, and data-driven methodology for controlling complex dynamical systems into previously unseen target states, including those with significantly different and complex dynamics. Leveraging a parameter-aware realization of next-generation reservoir computing, our approach accurately predicts system behavior in unobserved parameter regimes, enabling control over transitions to arbitrary target states. Crucially, this includes states with dynamics that differ fundamentally from known regimes, such as shifts from periodic to intermittent or chaotic behavior. The method's parameter-awareness facilitates non-stationary control, ensuring smooth transitions between states. By extending the applicability of machine learning-based control mechanisms to previously inaccessible target dynamics, this methodology opens the door to transformative new applications while maintaining exceptional efficiency. Our results highlight reservoir computing as a powerful alternative to traditional methods for dynamic system control.</description>

      <title>Universality of extreme events in turbulent flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The universality of small scales, a cornerstone of turbulence, has been nominally confirmed for low-order mean-field statistics, such as the energy spectrum. However, small scales exhibit strong intermittency, exemplified by formation of extreme events which deviate anomalously from a mean-field description. Here, we investigate the universality of small scales by analyzing extreme events of velocity gradients in different turbulent flows, viz. direct numerical simulations (DNS) of homogeneous isotropic turbulence, inhomogeneous channel flow, and laboratory measurements in a von Karman mixing tank. We demonstrate that the scaling exponents of velocity gradient moments, as function of Reynolds number ($Re$), are universal, in agreement with previous studies at lower $Re$, and further show that even proportionality constants are universal when considering one moment order as a function of another. Additionally, by comparing various unconditional and conditional statistics across different flows, we demonstrate that the structure of the velocity gradient tensor is also universal. Overall, our findings provide compelling evidence that even extreme events are universal, with profound implications for turbulence theory and modeling.</description>

      <title>Cycling Signatures: Identifying Cycling Motions in Time Series using Algebraic Topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04734v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recurrence is a fundamental characteristic of dynamical systems with complicated behavior. Understanding the inner structure of recurrence is challenging, especially if the system has many degrees of freedom and is subject to noise. We develop algebraic topological notions for identifying and classifying elementary recurrent motions -- called cycling -- and the transitions between those. Statistics on these cycling motions can be computed from sampled trajectories (time series data), providing coarse global information on the structure of the recurrent behavior. We demonstrate this through three examples; in particular, we identify and analyze six cycling motions in a four dimensional system with a hyperchaotic attractor. We see this as a promising approach to reveal coarse-grained dynamical information on high-dimensional systems.</description>
