      <title>Morse functions constructed by random walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct random Morse functions on surfaces by random walk and compute related distributions. We study the space of Morse functions through these random variables. We consider subspaces characterized by the surfaces with boundary obtained by cutting the closed domain surface of the Morse function at the levels of regular values. We consider Morse functions having a bounded number of critical points and one single local minimum. We find a small set of Morse functions which are close enough to any other Morse function in the sense that they share the same characterizing surfaces with boundary.</description>

      <title>How doth the random triangle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Charles L. Dodgson, also known as Lewis Carroll, in his book "Pillow problems" from 1893 asked for the likelihood of a random triangle to be obtuse. Clearly, the answer to Dodgson's question depends strongly on the assumed random distribution. In this article, we show nevertheless that there are certain fundamental limitations imposed by the geometry of Euclidean space. Specifically, we give universal lower bounds for how improbable obtuse triangles can be, if drawn from a distribution in $\mathbb{R}^d$. We prove that planar obtuse triangles cannot be less likely than 1/3, and construct a distribution for which the probability is 4/9. Analogous results are provided in three and higher dimensions, where obtuse triangles can be increasingly less likely. Sharpness of the lower bounds are left as open problems.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic root distribution of polynomials under repeated polar differentiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a sequence of real rooted polynomials $\{p_n\}_{n\geq 1}$ with a fixed asymptotic root distribution, we study the asymptotic root distribution of the repeated polar derivatives of this sequence. This limiting distribution can be seen as the result of fractional free convolution and pushforward maps along M\"obius transforms for distributions. This new family of operations on measures forms a semigroup and satisfy some other nice properties. Using the fact that polar derivatives commute with one another, we obtain a non-trivial commutation relation between these new operations. We also study a notion of polar free infinite divisibility and construct Belinschi-Nica type semigroups. Finally, we provide some interesting examples of distributions that behave nicely with respect to these new operations, including the Marchenko-Pastur and the Cauchy distributions.</description>

      <title>Coagulation-Fragmentation Duality of Infinitely Exchangeable Partitions from Coupled Mixed Poisson Species Sampling Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jim Pitman's (1999) celebrated coagulation-fragmentation duality for the PD($\alpha$,$\theta$) family of laws of Pitman and Marc Yor (1997) has resisted generalization beyond its canonical setting. We resolve this by introducing a novel, four-part coupled process built upon the Poisson Hierarchical Indian Buffet Process (PHIBP), a framework we recently developed for modeling microbiome species sampling across multiple ($J \ge 1$) groups. This provides a tractable generalization of the duality to processes driven by arbitrary subordinators, yielding explicit laws for both single-group and the previously uncharacterised multi-group structured partitions.
  The static, fixed-time partitions are revealed to be a single projection of an inherently dynamic, four-component coupled system. This new construction simultaneously defines: (i) the fine-grained partition, (ii) its coagulation operator, (iii) a forward-in-time system of coupled, time-homogeneous fragmentation processes in the sense of Jean Bertoin (2006), and (iv) a dual, backward-in-time structured coalescent. All four components are governed by the same underlying compositional structure, which yields their exact compound Poisson representations and, for the coalescent, drives simultaneous, across-group merger events.
  The chief result is a general coagulation-fragmentation duality that generalizes Pitman's duality in two fundamental directions. First, it holds for arbitrary driving subordinators, defining a vast new family of single-group dualities. Second, it operates in the previously uncharacterised multi-group ($J$-group) setting. This work establishes a unified and tractable framework for a rich class of partition-valued dynamics, revealing structural connections between the theories of fragmentation and coalescence.</description>

      <title>Quadratic BSDEs with double constraints driven by G-Brownian motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the well-posedness of quadratic backward stochastic differential equations driven by G-Brownian motion (referred to as G-BSDEs) with double mean reflections. By employing a representation of the solution via G-BMO martingale techniques, along with fixed point arguments, the Skorokhod problem, the backward Skorokhod problem, and the {\theta}-method, we establish existence and uniqueness results for such G-BSDEs under both bounded and unbounded terminal conditions.</description>

      <title>Random punctured hyperbolic surfaces &amp; the Brownian sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider random genus-0 hyperbolic surfaces $\mathcal{S}_n$ with $n + 1$ punctures, sampled according to the Weil-Petersson measure. We show that, after rescaling the metric by $n^{-1/4}$, the surface $\mathcal{S}_n$ converges in distribution to the Brownian sphere - a random compact metric space homeomorphic to the 2-sphere, exhibiting fractal geometry and appearing as a universal scaling limit in various models of random planar maps. Without rescaling the metric, we establish a local Benjamini--Schramm convergence of $\mathcal{S}_n$ to a random infinite-volume hyperbolic surface with countably many punctures, homeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^2 \setminus \mathbb{Z}^2$. Our proofs mirror techniques from the theory of random planar maps. In particular, we develop an encoding of punctured hyperbolic surfaces via a family of plane trees with continuous labels, akin to Schaeffer's bijection. This encoding stems from the Epstein-Penner decomposition and, through a series of transformations, reduces to a model of single-type Galton--Watson trees, enabling the application of known invariance principles.</description>

      <title>Critical long-range percolation I: High effective dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In long-range percolation on $\mathbb{Z}^d$, points $x$ and $y$ are connected by an edge with probability $1-\exp(-\beta\|x-y\|^{-d-\alpha})$, where $\alpha&gt;0$ is fixed and $\beta \geq 0$ is a parameter. As $d$ and $\alpha$ vary, the model is conjectured to exhibit eight qualitatively different second-order critical behaviours, with a transition between mean-field and low-dimensional regimes when $d=\min\{6,3\alpha\}$, a transition between long- and short-range regimes at a crossover value $\alpha_c(d)$, and with various logarithmic corrections at the boundaries between these regimes.
  This is the first of a series of three papers developing a rigorous theory of the model's critical behavior in five of these eight regimes, including all long-range (LR) and high-dimensional (HD) regimes. In this paper, we introduce our non-perturbative real-space renormalization group method and apply this method to analyze the HD regime $d&gt;\min\{6,3\alpha\}$. In particular, we compute the tail of the cluster volume and establish the superprocess scaling limits of the model, which transition between super-Levy and super-Brownian behavior when $\alpha=2$. All our results hold unconditionally for $d&gt; 3\alpha$, without any perturbative assumptions on the model; beyond this regime, when $d&gt; 6$ and $\alpha \geq d/3$, they hold under the assumption that appropriate two-point function estimates hold as provided for spread-out models by the lace expansion. Our results on scaling limits also hold (with possible slowly-varying corrections to scaling) in the critical-dimensional regime with $d=3\alpha&lt;6$ subject to a marginal-triviality condition we call the hydrodynamic condition; this condition is verified in the third paper in this series, in which we also compute the precise logarithmic corrections to mean-field scaling when $d=3\alpha&lt;6$.</description>

      <title>Critical long-range percolation II: Low effective dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In long-range percolation on $\mathbb{Z}^d$, points $x$ and $y$ are connected by an edge with probability $1-\exp(-\beta\|x-y\|^{-d-\alpha})$, where $\alpha&gt;0$ is fixed and $\beta \geq 0$ is a parameter. As $d$ and $\alpha$ vary, the model is conjectured to exhibit eight qualitatively different second-order critical behaviours, with a transition between mean-field and low-dimensional regimes when $d=\min\{6,3\alpha\}$, a transition between long- and short-range regimes at a crossover value $\alpha_c(d)$, and with various logarithmic corrections at the boundaries between these regimes.
  This is the second of three papers developing a rigorous theory of the model's critical behavior in five of these eight regimes, including all long-range (LR) and high-dimensional (HD) regimes. We focus on the long-range low-dimensional (LR-LD) regime $d/3&lt;\alpha&lt;\alpha_c(d)$, where the model is below its upper critical dimension. Since computing $\alpha_c(d)$ for $2&lt;d&lt;6$ appears to be beyond the scope of current techniques, we give an axiomatic definition of the LR regime which we prove holds for $\alpha &lt;1$. Using this, we prove up-to-constants estimates for the critical and slightly subcritical two-point function in the LR regime and for the volume tail and $k$-point function in the LR-LD regime. We deduce that the critical exponents satisfy the identities \[
  \eta = 2-\alpha, \qquad \gamma = (2-\eta)\nu, \qquad \text{ and } \qquad \Delta = \nu d_f \] in the LR regime (if $\gamma$, $\nu$, or $\Delta$ is well-defined) and that $\delta$ and $d_f$ follow the hyperscaling identities \[
  \delta = \frac{d+\alpha}{d-\alpha} \qquad \text{ and } \qquad d_f = \frac{d+\alpha}{2} \] in the LR-LD regime. Our results are suggestive of conformal invariance in the LR-LD regime, with the critical $k$-point function matching an explicit M\"obius-covariant function up-to-constants.</description>

      <title>Critical long-range percolation III: The upper critical dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In long-range percolation on $\mathbb{Z}^d$, points $x$ and $y$ are connected by an edge with probability $1-\exp(-\beta\|x-y\|^{-d-\alpha})$, where $\alpha&gt;0$ is fixed and $\beta \geq 0$ is a parameter. As $d$ and $\alpha$ vary, the model is conjectured to exhibit eight qualitatively different second-order critical behaviours, with a transition between mean-field and low-dimensional regimes when $d=\min\{6,3\alpha\}$, a transition between long- and short-range regimes at a crossover value $\alpha_c(d)$, and with various logarithmic corrections at the boundaries between these regimes.
  This is the second of three papers developing a rigorous theory of the model's critical behavior in five of these eight regimes, including all long-range (LR) and high-dimensional (HD) regimes. Here, we analyze the model at its upper critical dimension $d=3\alpha&lt;6$. We prove the hydrodynamic condition holds, which allows us to apply our first paper's RG analysis to deduce that the model has the same superprocess scaling limits as in high dimension, after accounting for slowly varying corrections to scaling. We then compute the precise logarithmic corrections to scaling by analyzing the RG flow to second order. Our results yield in particular that for $d=3\alpha &lt; 6$ the critical volume tail is \[
  \mathbb{P}_{\beta_c}(|K|\geq n) \sim C \frac{(\log n)^{1/4}}{\sqrt{n}} \] as $n\to \infty$, while the critical two- and three-point functions are \[ \mathbb{P}_{\beta_c}(x\leftrightarrow y) \asymp \|x-y\|^{-d+\alpha} \; \text{ and } \; \mathbb{P}_{\beta_c}(x\leftrightarrow y \leftrightarrow z) \asymp \sqrt{\frac{\|x-y\|^{-d+\alpha}\|y-z\|^{-d+\alpha}\|z-x\|^{-d+\alpha}}{\log(1+\min\{\|x-y\|,\|y-z\|,\|z-x\|\})}}. \] These logarithmic corrections match those in hierarchical percolation but differ from those conjectured for nearest-neighbour percolation on $\mathbb{Z}^6$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a continuation to \cite{MRW} where the Poincar\'e and log-Sobolev inequalities were studied for the sticky-reflected Brownian motion on Riemannian manifolds with boundary, this paper establishes the super and weak Poincar\'e inequalities for more general sticky-reflected diffusion processes. As applications, the convergence rate and uniform integrability of the associated diffusion semigroups are characterized. The main results are illustrated by concrete examples.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a framework for stochastic differential equations (SDEs) with interaction on compact, connected, $d$-dimensional manifolds. For SDEs whose drift and diffusion coefficients may depend on both the state variable and the empirical distribution, we establish existence and uniqueness of strong solutions under general regularity assumptions. We study the associated measure valued process on the Wasserstein space over the manifold, deriving an explicit It\^o Wiener decomposition. We prove Malliavin differentiability of the solution and, using directional derivatives in the Wasserstein space, establish smooth dependence of the solution on the measure component for a class of coefficients.</description>

      <title>Analysis of a mean-field limit of interacting two-dimensional nonlinear integrate-and-fire neurons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the solutions of a McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equation (SDE) driven by a Poisson process. In neuroscience, this SDE models the mean field limit of a system of $N$ interacting excitatory neurons with $N$ large.
  Each neuron spikes randomly with rate depending on its membrane potential. At each spiking time, the neuron potential is reset to the value $\bar v$, its adaptation variable is incremented by $\bar w$ and all other neurons receive an additional amount
  $J/N$ of potential after some delay where $J$ is the connection strength. Between jumps, the neurons drift according to some two-dimensional ordinary differential equation with explosive behavior.
  We prove the existence and uniqueness of solutions of a heuristically derived mean-field limit of the system when $N\to\infty$. We then study the existence of stationary distributions and provide several properties (regularity, tail decay, etc.) based on a Doeblin estimate using a Lyapunov function. Numerical simulations are provided to assess the hypotheses underlying the results.</description>

Abstract: Research in Economics and Game theory has necessitated results on Carath\'eodory-type selections. In particular, one has to obtain Carath\'eodory type-selections from correspondences that need not be continuous (neither lower-semicontinuous nor upper-semicontinuous). We provide new theorems on Carath\'eodory type-selections that include as corollaries the results in Kim-Prikry-Yannelis \cite{KPY:87}. We also, obtain new random fixed-point theorems, random maximal elements, random (Nash) equilibrium and Bayesian equilibrium extending and generalizing theorems of Browder \cite{Browder:68}, Fan \cite{Fan:52} and Nash \cite{Nash}, among others.</description>

      <title>Continuous limits of large plant-pollinator random networks and some applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.05219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.05219v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a stochastic individual-based model of interacting plant and pollinator species through a bipartite graph: each species is a node of the graph, an edge representing interactions between a pair of species. The dynamics of the system depends on the between- and within-species interactions: pollination by insects increases plant reproduction rate but has a cost which can increase plant death rate, depending on the densities of pollinators. Pollinators reproduction is increased by the resources harvested on plants. Each species is characterized by a trait corresponding to its degree of generalism. This trait determines the structure of the interaction graph and the quantities of resources exchanged between species. Our model includes in particular nested or modular networks. Deterministic approximations of the stochastic measure-valued process by systems of ordinary differential equations or integro-differential equations are established and studied, when the population is large or when the graph is dense and can be replaced with a graphon. The long-time behaviors of these limits are studied and central limit theorems are established to quantify the difference between the discrete stochastic individual-based model and the deterministic approximations. Finally, studying the continuous limits of the interaction network and the resulting PDEs, we show that nested plant-pollinator communities are expected to collapse towards a coexistence between a single pair of species of plants and pollinators.</description>

      <title>Occupied Processes: Going with the Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07936v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A stochastic process $X$ becomes occupied when it is enlarged with its occupation flow $\mathcal{O}$, which tracks the time spent by the path at each level. Crucially, the occupied process $(\mathcal{O},X)$ enjoys a Markov structure when $X$ is Markov. We develop a novel It\^o calculus for occupied processes that lies midway between Dupire's functional It\^o calculus and the classical version. We derive a surprisingly simple It\^o formula and, through Feynman-Kac, unveil a broad class of path-dependent PDEs where $\mathcal{O}$ plays the role of time. The space variable, given by the current value of $X$, remains finite-dimensional, thereby paving the way for standard elliptic PDE techniques and numerical methods.
  In the financial applications, we demonstrate that occupation flows provide unified Markovian lifts for exotic options and variance instruments, allowing financial institutions to price and manage derivatives books with a single numerical solver. We then explore avenues in financial modeling where volatility is driven by the occupied process. In particular, we propose the local occupied volatility (LOV) model which not only calibrates to European vanilla options but also offers the flexibility to capture stylized facts of volatility and fit other instruments. We also present an extension of forward variance models that leverages the entire forward occupation surface.</description>

      <title>Subdiffusive concentration for the chemical distance in Bernoulli percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14834v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Considering supercritical Bernoulli percolation on $\mathbb{Z}^d$, Garet and Marchand [GM09] proved a diffusive concentration for the graph distance. In this paper, we sharpen this result by establishing the subdiffusive concentration inequality, which revisits the sublinear bound of the variance proved by Dembin [Dem22] as a consequence. Our approach is inspired by similar work in First-passage percolation [BR08, DHS14], combined with new tools to address the challenge posed by the infinite weight of the model. These tools, including the notion of effective radius and its properties, enable a simple one-step renormalization process as a systematic means of managing the effects of resampling edges.</description>

      <title>Strict inequalities for arm exponents in planar percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23250v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss a general method to prove quantitative improvements on correlation inequalities and apply it to arm estimates for Bernoulli bond percolation on the square lattice. Our first result is that the two-arm exponent is strictly larger than twice the one-arm exponent and can be seen as a quantitative improvement on the Harris-FKG inequality. This answers a question of Garban and Steif, which was motivated by the study of exceptional times in dynamical percolation. Our second result is that the monochromatic arm exponents are strictly larger than their polychromatic versions, and can be seen as a quantitative improvement on Reimer's main lemma. This second result is not new and was already proved by Beffara and Nolin using a different argument.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03864v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider the nonlinear stochastic heat equation $$
  \frac{\partial u (t,x)}{\partial t}=\frac{\partial^2 u (t,x)}{\partial x^2}+ \sigma(u (t,x))\dot{W}(t,x),\quad t&gt; 0,\,
  x\in \mathbb{R}, $$ where $\dot W$ is a Gaussian noise which is white in time and has the covariance of a fractional Brownian motion with Hurst parameter $H\in(\frac 14,\frac 12)$ in the space variable. When $\sigma(0)=0$, the well-posedness of the solution and its H\"older continuity have been proved by Hu et al. \cite{HHLNT2017}. In this paper, we study the asymptotic properties of the temporal gradient $u(t+\varepsilon, x)-u(t, x)$ at any fixed $t \ge 0$ and $x\in \mathbb R$, as $\varepsilon\downarrow 0$. As applications, we deduce Khintchine's law of iterated logarithm, Chung's law of iterated logarithm, and a result on the $q$-variations of the temporal process $\{u(t, x)\}_{t \ge 0}$, where $x\in \mathbb R$ is fixed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08285v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Takagi-van der Waerden functions $f_r (x)$, a well-known class of continuous but nowhere differentiable functions, from probabilistic point of view. As an application of elephant random walks remembering the very recent past (ERWVRP, a.k.a. symmetric correlated random walks), we obtain precise estimates for the oscillations of $f_r (x)$. We also establish a result on the necessary and sufficient condition for localization of the ERWVRP with variable step length, which can be applied to obtain a complete description of the differentiability properties of the Takagi-van der Waerden class functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17112v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study variance bounds under symmetry constraints in classical, free, and Boolean probability. Starting from the classical fact that for a Bernoulli random variable $X$ and an independent $Y$ with $X+Y$ symmetric about $0$, one must have $\mathrm{Var}(Y)\geq pq$, we establish exact analogues in the free and Boolean settings. Using projections as the noncommutative counterpart of Bernoulli variables, we prove that the same bound persists for freely and Boolean independent symmetrizers. These results not only unify variance inequalities across different probabilistic frameworks but also have potential applications in quantum information and noncommutative stochastic modeling.</description>

      <title>The circular law for non-Hermitian random band matrices up to bandwidth $N^{1/2+c}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18143v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider inhomogeneous square random matrices of size $N$ with independent entries of mean 0 and finite variance. We assume that the variance profile of this matrix is doubly stochastic and has a band-like structure with an appropriately defined bandwidth $W$. We prove that when the entries have a bounded density and a subgaussian tail, then the empirical spectral measure for the eigenvalues of the matrix converges to the circular law as $N$ tends to infinity whenever $W\geq N^{1/2+c}$ for any $c&gt;0$. In the special case of block band matrices the density assumption is not needed and the moment condition is relaxed. This establishes the circular law limit throughout the entire delocalization regime in 1-d: $W\geq N^{1/2+c}$ and extends the previous thresholds for the circular law limit with exponent $\frac{5}{6},\frac{8}{9},\frac{33}{34}$ in $N$. The main technical input is a new lower bound on the small-ish singular values via Green function estimates and a new lower bound on the least singular value with fewer moment conditions.</description>

      <title>De-Preferential Attachment Random Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18144v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we consider a growing random graph sequence where a new vertex is less likely to join to an existing vertex with high degree and more likely to join to a vertex with low degree. In contrast to the well studied \emph{preferential attachment random graphs} \cite{BarAlb99}, we call such a sequence a \emph{de-preferential attachment random graph model}. We consider two types of models, namely, \emph{inverse de-preferential}, where the attachment probabilities are inversely proportional to the degree and \emph{linear de-preferential}, where the attachment probabilities are proportional to $c-$degree, where $c &gt; 0$ is a constant. For the case when each new vertex comes with exactly one half-edge we show that the degree of a fixed vertex is asymptotically of the order $\sqrt{\log n}$ for the inverse de-preferential case and of the order $\log n$ for the linear case. These show that compared to preferential attachment, the degree of a fixed vertex grows to infinity at a much slower rate for these models. We also show that in both cases limiting degree distributions have exponential tails. In fact we show that for the inverse de-preferential model the tail of the limiting degree distribution is faster than exponential while that for the linear de-preferential model is exactly the $\mbox{Geometric}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)$ distribution. For the case when each new vertex comes with $m &gt; 1$ half-edges, we show that similar asymptotic results hold for fixed vertex degree in both inverse and linear de-preferential models. Our proofs make use of the martingale approach as well as embedding to certain continuous time age dependent branching processes.</description>

      <title>Monge-Kantorovich distance for PDEs: the coupling method</title>

      <description>arXiv:1903.11349v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We informally review a few PDEs for which the Monge-Kantorovich distance between pairs of solutions, possibly with some judicious cost function, decays: heat equation, Fokker-Planck equation, heat equation with varying coefficients, fractional heat equation with varying coefficients, homogeneous Boltzmann equation for Maxwell molecules, and some nonlinear integro-differential equations arising in neurosciences. We always use the same method, that consists in building a coupling between two solutions. This amounts to solve a well-chosen PDE posed on the Euclidian square of the physical space, i.e. doubling the variables. Finally, although the above method fails, we recall a simple idea to treat the case of the porous media equation. We also introduce another method based on the dual Monge-Kantorovich problem.</description>

Abstract: We explain how the (shifted) Ratios Conjecture for $L(s,\chi)$ would extend a randomization argument of Harper from a conductor-limited range to an unlimited range of ``beyond square-root cancellation'' for character twists of the Liouville function. As a corollary, the Liouville function would have nontrivial cancellation in arithmetic progressions of modulus just exceeding the well-known square-root barrier. Morally, the paper passes from random matrices to random multiplicative functions.</description>

      <title>Graphon branching processes and fractional isomorphism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02528v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In their study of the giant component in inhomogeneous random graphs, Bollob\'as, Janson, and Riordan introduced a class of branching processes parametrized by a possibly unbounded graphon. We prove that the tree structures underlying two such branching processes have the same distributions if and only if the corresponding graphons are fractionally isomorphic, a notion introduced by Greb\'ik and Rocha.
  A different class of branching processes was introduced by Hladk\'y, Nachmias, and Tran in relation to uniform spanning trees in finite graphs approximating a given connected graphon. We prove that that the tree structures of two such branching processes have the same distributions if and only if the corresponding graphons are fractionally isomorphic up to scalar multiple. Combined with a recent result of Archer and Shalev, this implies that if uniform spanning trees of two dense graphs have a similar local structure, they have a similar scaling limit.
  As a side result we give a characterization of fractional isomorphism for graphs as well as graphons in terms of their connected components.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10785v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a numerical method for simulation of wall-bounded incompressible turbulent flows by integrating the technology of random vortex method with the core idea of Large Eddy Simulation (LES). Specifically, we utilize the filtering function in LES, interpreted as spatial averaging, along with the integral representation theorem for parabolic equations, to achieve a closure numerical scheme which may be used for calculating solutions of Navier-Stokes equations. This approach circumvents the challenge associated with handling the non-locally integrable 3-dimensional integral kernel in the random vortex method and facilitates the computation of numerical solutions for flow systems via Monte-Carlo method. Comprehensive numerical simulations, along with systematic comparisons against other numerical approaches, are conducted for both turbulent and laminar flows in unbounded and wall-bounded domains, considering two- and three-dimensional cases. These results collectively demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>On Discounted Infinite-Time Mean Field Games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15131v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the infinite-time mean field games with discounting, establishing an equilibrium where individual optimal strategies collectively regenerate the mean-field distribution. To solve this problem, we partition all agents into a representative player and the social equilibrium. When the optimal strategy of the representative player shares the same feedback form with the strategy of the social equilibrium, we say the system achieves a Nash equilibrium.
  We construct a Nash equilibrium using the stochastic maximum principle and infinite-time forward-backward stochastic differential equations(FBSDEs). By employing the elliptic master equations, a class of distribution-dependent elliptic PDEs , we provide a representation for the Nash equilibrium. We prove the Yamada-Watanabe theorem and show the weak uniqueness for infinite-time FBSDEs. And we prove that the solutions to a system of infinite-time FBSDEs can be employed to construct viscosity solutions for a class of distribution-dependent elliptic PDEs.</description>
