      <title>Multimodal Stock Price Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In an era where financial markets are heavily influenced by many static and dynamic factors, it has become increasingly critical to carefully integrate diverse data sources with machine learning for accurate stock price prediction. This paper explores a multimodal machine learning approach for stock price prediction by combining data from diverse sources, including traditional financial metrics, tweets, and news articles. We capture real-time market dynamics and investor mood through sentiment analysis on these textual data using both ChatGPT-4o and FinBERT models. We look at how these integrated data streams augment predictions made with a standard Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM model) to illustrate the extent of performance gains. Our study's results indicate that incorporating the mentioned data sources considerably increases the forecast effectiveness of the reference model by up to 5%. We also provide insights into the individual and combined predictive capacities of these modalities, highlighting the substantial impact of incorporating sentiment analysis from tweets and news articles. This research offers a systematic and effective framework for applying multimodal data analytics techniques in financial time series forecasting that provides a new view for investors to leverage data for decision-making.</description>

      <title>Regression and Forecasting of U.S. Stock Returns Based on LSTM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper analyses the investment returns of three stock sectors, Manuf, Hitec, and Other, in the U.S. stock market, based on the Fama-French three-factor model, the Carhart four-factor model, and the Fama-French five-factor model, in order to test the validity of the Fama-French three-factor model, the Carhart four-factor model, and the Fama-French five-factor model for the three sectors of the market. French five-factor model for the three sectors of the market. Also, the LSTM model is used to explore the additional factors affecting stock returns. The empirical results show that the Fama-French five-factor model has better validity for the three segments of the market under study, and the LSTM model has the ability to capture the factors affecting the returns of certain industries, and can better regress and predict the stock returns of the relevant industries. Keywords- Fama-French model; Carhart model; Factor model; LSTM model.</description>

      <title>FactorGCL: A Hypergraph-Based Factor Model with Temporal Residual Contrastive Learning for Stock Returns Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a fundamental method in economics and finance, the factor model has been extensively utilized in quantitative investment. In recent years, there has been a paradigm shift from traditional linear models with expert-designed factors to more flexible nonlinear machine learning-based models with data-driven factors, aiming to enhance the effectiveness of these factor models. However, due to the low signal-to-noise ratio in market data, mining effective factors in data-driven models remains challenging. In this work, we propose a hypergraph-based factor model with temporal residual contrastive learning (FactorGCL) that employs a hypergraph structure to better capture high-order nonlinear relationships among stock returns and factors. To mine hidden factors that supplement human-designed prior factors for predicting stock returns, we design a cascading residual hypergraph architecture, in which the hidden factors are extracted from the residual information after removing the influence of prior factors. Additionally, we propose a temporal residual contrastive learning method to guide the extraction of effective and comprehensive hidden factors by contrasting stock-specific residual information over different time periods. Our extensive experiments on real stock market data demonstrate that FactorGCL not only outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods but also mines effective hidden factors for predicting stock returns.</description>

      <title>Impermanent loss and Loss-vs-Rebalancing II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04097v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper examines the relationship between impermanent loss (IL) and loss-versus-rebalancing (LVR) in automated market makers (AMMs). Our main focus is on statistical properties, the impact of fees, the role of block times, and, related to the latter, the continuous time limit. We find there are three relevant regimes: (i) very short times where LVR and IL are identical; (ii) intermediate time where LVR and IL show distinct distribution functions but are connected via the central limit theorem exhibiting the same expectation value; (iii) long time behavior where both the distribution functions and averages are distinct. Subsequently, we study how fees change this dynamics with a special focus on competing time scales like block times and 'arbitrage times'.</description>

      <title>Kernel Three Pass Regression Filter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07292v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We forecast a single time series using a high-dimensional set of predictors. When these predictors share common underlying dynamics, an approximate latent factor model provides a powerful characterization of their co-movements Bai(2003). These latent factors succinctly summarize the data and can also be used for prediction, alleviating the curse of dimensionality in high-dimensional prediction exercises, see Stock &amp; Watson (2002a). However, forecasting using these latent factors suffers from two potential drawbacks. First, not all pervasive factors among the set of predictors may be relevant, and using all of them can lead to inefficient forecasts. The second shortcoming is the assumption of linear dependence of predictors on the underlying factors. The first issue can be addressed by using some form of supervision, which leads to the omission of irrelevant information. One example is the three-pass regression filter proposed by Kelly &amp; Pruitt (2015). We extend their framework to cases where the form of dependence might be nonlinear by developing a new estimator, which we refer to as the Kernel Three-Pass Regression Filter (K3PRF). This alleviates the aforementioned second shortcoming. The estimator is computationally efficient and performs well empirically. The short-term performance matches or exceeds that of established models, while the long-term performance shows significant improvement.</description>
