      <title>Pricing and hedging for a sticky diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17011v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a financial market model featuring a risky asset whose price follows a sticky geometric Brownian motion and a riskless asset that grows with a constant interest rate $r\in \mathbb R $. We prove that this model satisfies No Arbitrage (NA) and No Free Lunch with Vanishing Risk (NFLVR) only when $r=0 $. Under this condition, we derive the corresponding arbitrage-free pricing equation, assess replicability and representation of the replication strategy. We then show that all locally bounded replicable payoffs for the standard Black--Scholes model are also replicable for the sticky model. Last, we evaluate via numerical experiments the impact of hedging in discrete time and of misrepresenting price stickiness.</description>

      <title>Optimal stopping and divestment timing under scenario ambiguity and learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09349v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Aiming to analyze the impact of environmental transition on the value of assets and on asset stranding, we study optimal stopping and divestment timing decisions for an economic agent whose future revenues depend on the realization of a scenario from a given set of possible futures. Since the future scenario is unknown and the probabilities of individual prospective scenarios are ambiguous, we adopt the smooth model of decision making under ambiguity aversion of Klibanoff et al (2005), framing the optimal divestment decision as an optimal stopping problem with learning under ambiguity aversion. We then prove a minimax result reducing this problem to a series of standard optimal stopping problems with learning. The theory is illustrated with two examples: the problem of optimally selling a stock with ambiguous drift, and the problem of optimal divestment from a coal-fired power plant under transition scenario ambiguity.</description>

      <title>A Unifying Approach for the Pricing of Debt Securities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06303v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a unifying framework for the pricing of debt securities under general time-inhomogeneous short-rate diffusion processes. The pricing of bonds, bond options, callable/putable bonds, and convertible bonds (CBs) are covered. Using continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) approximation, we obtain closed-form matrix expressions to approximate the price of bonds and bond options under general one-dimensional short-rate processes. A simple and efficient algorithm is also developed to price callable/putable debts. The availability of a closed-form expression for the price of zero-coupon bonds allows for the perfect fit of the approximated model to the current market term structure of interest rates, regardless of the complexity of the underlying diffusion process selected. We further consider the pricing of CBs under general bi-dimensional time-inhomogeneous diffusion processes to model equity and short-rate dynamics. Credit risk is also incorporated into the model using the approach of Tsiveriotis and Fernandes (1998). Based on a two-layer CTMC method, an efficient algorithm is developed to approximate the price of convertible bonds. When conversion is only allowed at maturity, a closed-form matrix expression is obtained. Numerical experiments show the accuracy and efficiency of the method across a wide range of model parameters and short-rate models.</description>
