      <title>Expanding the reach of diffusing wave spectroscopy and tracer bead microrheology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusing Wave Spectroscopy (DWS) is an extension of standard dynamic light scattering (DLS), applied to soft materials that are turbid or opaque. The propagation of light is modeled using light diffusion, characterized by a light diffusion coefficient that depends on the transport mean free path l* of the medium. DWS is highly sensitive to small particle displacements or other local fluctuations in the scattering properties and can probe subnanometer displacements. Analyzing the motion of beads in a viscoelastic matrix, known as one-bead microrheology, is one of the most common applications of DWS. Despite significant advancements since its invention in 1987, including two-cell and multi-speckle DWS, challenges such as merging single and multi-speckle data and limited accuracy for short correlation times persist. Here, we address these issues by improving the two-cell Echo DWS scheme. We propose a calibration-free method to blend and merge Echo and two-cell DWS data and demonstrate the use of regularized inversion algorithms to enhance data quality at very short times. Building on this, we introduce stable corrections for bead and fluid inertia, significantly improving the quality of microrheology data at high frequencies.</description>

      <title>Dissipative anomalies of stresses in soft amorphous solids: footprints of density singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In soft amorphous solids, localized irreversible (plastic) stress dissipation occurs as a response to external forcings. A crucial question is whether we can identify structural properties linked to a region's propensity to undergo a plastic stress drop when thermal effects are negligible. To address this question, I follow a theoretical framework provided by Onsager's ideal turbulence theory, representing a non-perturbative application of the renormalization group scale-invariance principle. First, I analyze the zero temperature limit for the fine-grained balance equation for the stress tensor corresponding to instanton realizations. I show that irreversible stress drops can occur if the density gradients diverge. I then derive a balance relation for the coarse-grained instantaneous stress tensor with arbitrary regularization scale $\ell$. From the latter, I obtain an expression for the local inter-scale stress flux in terms of moments of the density increments. By assuming that the density field is Besov regular, I determine the scaling of the stress flux with $\ell$. From this scaling, I show that distributional solutions of the noiseless Dean (NDE) equation can sustain stress dissipation due to a non-equilibrium inter-scale stress flux if the scaling exponents of the density structure functions are below a critical threshold. The athermal limit of fine-grained and coarse-grained descriptions must describe the same phenomenology, \textit{i.e.} the existence of stress dissipation must be independent of any regularization of the dynamics. Using this principle, I analyze the limit $\ell\rightarrow 0$ and argue that flow realizations of athermal disordered systems correspond to ultraviolet fixed-point solutions of the coarse-grained NDE equations with sufficiently low Besov regularity.</description>

      <title>Chiral ground states in a nematic liquid crystal confined to a cylinder with homeotropic anchoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The singular potential method in the Q tensor order parameter representation is used to determine the ground state configuration of an elastically anisotropic nematic liquid crystal when confined to a cylindrical geometry with homeotropic anchoring. Ground states of broken chiral symmetry are found for sufficiently small values of the twist elastic constant relative to bend and splay constants. For small cylinder radius, twisted configurations, which feature two disclinations lines that wind around the long axis of the cylinder, are generally found to minimize the free energy of the nematic. For larger radii, ground state configurations are (non singular) escaped configuration. Twisted and untwisted escaped configurations are almost degenerate in energy in this region. This near degeneracy is broken when splay-bend contrast is allowed.</description>

      <title>Self-assembly of anisotropic particles on curved surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The surface curvature of membranes, interfaces, and substrates plays a crucial role in shaping the self-assembly of particles adsorbed on these surfaces. However, little is known about the interplay between particle anisotropy and surface curvature and how they couple to alter the free energy landscape of particle assemblies. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we investigate the effect of prescribed curvatures on a quasi-2D assembly of anisotropic patchy particles. By varying curvature and surface coverage, we uncover a rich geometric phase diagram, with curvature inducing ordered structures entirely absent on planar surfaces. Large spatial domains of ordered structures can contain hidden microdomains of orientational textures imprinted by the surface on the assembly. The dynamical landscape is also reshaped by surface curvature, with a glass state emerging at modest densities and high curvature. Our findings show that the coupling between surface curvature and particle geometry opens a new space of morphologies and structures that can be exploited for material design.</description>

      <title>Turing patterns on polymerized membranes: a coarse-grained lattice modelling with internal degree of freedom for polymer direction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We numerically study Turing patterns (TPs) on two-dimensional surfaces with a square boundary in ${\bf R}^3$ using a surface model for polymerized membranes. The variables used to describe the membranes correspond to two distinct degrees of freedom: an internal degree of freedom for the polymer directions in addition to the positional degree of freedom. This generalised surface model enables us to identify a non-trivial interference between the TP system and the membranes. To this end, we employ a hybrid numerical technique, utilising Monte Carlo updates for membrane configurations and discrete time iterations for the FitzHugh-Nagumo type Turing equation. The simulation results clearly show that anisotropies in the mechanical deformation properties, particularly the easy axes associated with the stretching and bending of the membranes, determine the direction of the TPs to be perpendicular or parallel to the easy axes. Additionally, by calculating the dependence of the maximum entropy on the internal degree of freedom, we can obtain information on the relaxation with respect to the polymer structure. This crucial information serves to remind us that non-equilibrium configurations can be captured within the canonical Monte Carlo simulations.</description>

      <title>Self-assembly of Dipolar Crystals from Magnetic Colloids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the self-assembly of magnetic colloids using the Stockmayer (SM) model characterized by short-range Lennard-Jones interactions and long-range dipole-dipole interactions. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we design cooling protocols that yield perfectly assembled single-domain magnetic crystals. We identify cooling rates at which the system transforms from an amorphous glass to a crystal, where magnetic ordering promotes crystalline order. Remarkably, we observe that the latter develops via a spontaneous transition rather than through the traditional nucleation and growth mechanism. For a weakly dipolar fluid ($\mu=1$), this self-assembly results in a face-centered cubic (FCC) colloidal crystal with dipole moments chained along the (111) direction. For fluids with higher dipole moment ($\mu = 2.5$), the crystal structure shifts towards a body-centered orthorhombic (BCO) arrangement due to the compression of chains from strong dipolar attractions. These results provide valuable insights into the mechanisms driving crystallization in magnetic fluids, opening new avenues for understanding the formation of magnetically responsive colloidal magnetic crystals with promising applications.</description>

      <title>Sol-gel transition in heteroassociative RNA-protein solutions: A quantitative comparison of coarse-grained simulations and the Semenov-Rubinstein theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protein RNA-binding domains selectively interact with specific RNA sites, a key interaction that determines the emergent cooperative behaviors in RNA-protein mixtures. Through molecular dynamics simulations, we investigate the impact of the specific binding interactions on the phase transitions of an examplary RNA-protein system and compare it with predictions of the Semenov-Rubinstein theory of associative polymers. Our findings reveal a sol-gel (percolation) transition without phase separation, characterized by double reentrant behavior as the RNA or protein concentration increases. We highlight the crucial role of bridge formations in driving these transitions, particularly when binding sites are saturated. The theory quantitatively predicts the binding numbers at equilibrium in the semidilute regime, but it significantly overestimates the size of the concentration range where percolation is observed. This can partly be traced back to the fact that the mean-field assumption in the theory is not valid in the dilute regime, and that the theory neglects the existence of cycles in the connectivity graph of the percolating cluster at the sol-gel transition. Our study enriches the understanding of RNA-protein phase behaviors, providing valuable insights for the interpretation of experimental observations.</description>

      <title>Collective behaviors of self-propelled particles with tunable alignment angles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel aligning active matter model by extending the nematic alignment rule in self-propelled rods to tunable alignment angles, as represented by collision of cone-shaped particles. Non-vanishing alignment angles introduce frustration in the many-body interactions, and we investigate its effect on the collective behavior of the system. Through numerical simulations of an agent-based microscopic model, we found that the system exhibits distinct phenomenology compared to the original self-propelled rods. In particular, anti-parallel bands are observed in an intermediate parameter range. The linear stability analysis of the continuum description derived from the Boltzmann approach demonstrates qualitative consistency with the microscopic model, while frustration due to many-body interactions in the latter destabilizes homogeneous nematic order over a wide range of the alignment angle.</description>

      <title>Developing an unfolding-incorporated coarse-grained polymer model for fibrinogen to study the mechanical behaviour</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fibrinogen is a protein found in blood that forms Fibrin polymer network to build a clot during wound healing process when there is a cut in the blood vessel. The fibrin fiber is highly stretchable and shows a complex mechanical properties. The fibrin monomer, Fibrinogen, has a very complex structure which is responsible for its unusual elastic behaviour. In this work, we focus on mechanism of unfolding of D-domain of Fibrinogen, and study its effect in the mechanical behaviour. We develop a coarse-grained (CG) bead-spring model for Fibrinogen which captures the unfolding of folded D-domains along with other necessary structural properties which affect the mechanical behaviour. The results from our unfolding-incorporated coarse-grained polymer (UCGP) model matches with the experimental results. This model has capacity to serve as the minimal unit to build a large-scale hierarchical structure of fibrin fiber and network to possibly unfold the mystery of fibrin's unusual elastic behaviour. This model can also be used for other polymers having folded domains or sacrificial bonds.</description>

      <title>String Formation and Arrested Ordering Kinetics in Nematics Induced by Polar Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our study explores the mixture of polar particles in apolar environment. We employ a coarse-grained approach to model the mixture, where polar particles are in minority. The interaction between polar and apolar components is incorporated via a coupling term in the free energy. Coupling generates local interaction in the system which results in the formation of string like structures connecting a pair of half integer topological defects. The increase in the coupling strength or the density of polar particles results in the: Sharper strings with larger probability of connecting the topological defects of same charge and the enhanced dynamics of topological defects. However, the ordering kinetics of the system shows the delayed coarsening for larger coupling or polar density. Our results can be used to develop controlled kinetics as well as to detect the impurities in liquid crystals.</description>

      <title>Controlling curvature of self-assembling surfaces via patchy particle design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Curved structures in soft matter and biological systems commonly emerge as a result of self-assembly processes where building blocks aggregate in a controlled manner, giving rise to specific system structure and properties. Learning how to precisely tune the curved geometry of these assemblies can in turn elucidate new ways of controlling their functionality. We discuss how one can target self-assembly into surfaces with specified Gaussian curvature in a one-component system of model patchy particles. Given the vast design space of potential patch distributions, we address the problem using an inverse design approach based on automatic differentiation and develop an optimization scheme which solves the exploding gradients problem that arises when we differentiate through long molecular dynamics trajectories. We discuss the model requirements for successful optimization, determine the significant hyperparameter choices influencing algorithm performance and, finally, we demonstrate that we can consistently design patch patterns for assembly into clusters with different target curvature radii.</description>

      <title>Neural Density Functional Theory in Higher Dimensions with Convolutional Layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on recent advancements in using machine learning for classical density functional theory for systems with one-dimensional, planar inhomogeneities, we propose a machine learning model for application in two dimensions (2D) akin to density functionals in weighted density forms, as e. g. in fundamental measure theory (FMT). We implement the model with fast convolutional layers only and apply it to a system of hard disks in fully 2D inhomogeneous situations. The model is trained on a combination of smooth and steplike external potentials in the fluid phase. Pair correlation functions from test particle geometry show very satisfactory agreement with simulations although these types of external potentials have not been included in the training. The method should be fully applicable to 3D problems, where the bottleneck at the moment appears to be in obtaining smooth enough 3D histograms as training data from simulations.</description>

      <title>Inferring traits of hyperuniformity from local structures via persistent homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08899v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hyperuniformity refers to the suppression of density fluctuations at large scales. Typical for ordered systems, this property also emerges in several disordered physical and biological systems, where it is particularly relevant to understand mechanisms of pattern formation and to exploit peculiar attributes, e.g., interaction with light and transport phenomena. While hyperuniformity is a global property, ideally defined for infinitely extended systems, several disordered correlated systems have finite size. It has been shown in [Phys. Rev. Research 6, 023107 (2024)] that global hyperuniform characteristics systematically correlate with distributions of topological properties representative of local arrangements. In this work, building on this information, we explore and assess the inverse relationship between hyperuniformity and local structures in point patterns as described by persistent homology. Standard machine learning algorithms trained on persistence diagrams are shown to detect hyperuniformity of periodic point patterns with high accuracy. Therefore, we demonstrate that the information on patterns' local structures allows for characterizing whether finite size arrangements are analogous to those realized in hyperuniform patterns. Then, addressing more quantitative aspects, we show that parameters defining hyperuniformity globally can be reconstructed by comparing persistence diagrams of targeted patterns with reference ones. We also explore the generation of patterns entailing given topological properties. The results of this study pave the way for advanced analysis of hyperuniform patterns including local information, and introduce basic concepts for their inverse design.</description>

      <title>Stability analysis through folds: An end-loaded elastic with a lever arm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04729v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many physical systems can be modelled as parameter-dependent variational problems. The associated equilibria may or may not exist realistically and can only be determined after examining their stability. Hence, it is crucial to determine the stability and track their transitions. Generally, the stability characteristics of the equilibria change near folds in the parameter space. The direction of stability changes is embedded in a specific projection of the solutions, known as distinguished bifurcation diagrams. In this article, we identify such projections for variational problems characterized by fixed-free ends -- a class of problems frequently encountered in mechanics. Using these diagrams, we study an Elastica subject to an end load applied through a rigid lever arm. Several instances of snap-back instability are reported, along with their dependence on system parameters through numerical examples. These findings have potential applications in the design of soft robot arms and other actuator designs.</description>
