      <title>Proposal for realizing and probing topological crystalline insulators in optical lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a lattice model which exhibits topological transitions from $Z_2$ topological insulators to mirror symmetry-protected topological crystalline insulators by introducing additional spin-orbit coupling terms. The topological phase is characterized by the mirror winding number, defined within the mirror symmetry invariant subspace, which ensures the protection of gapless edge states and zero-energy corner states under specific boundary conditions. Additionally, we propose a feasible scheme using ultracold atoms confined in a stacked hexagonal optical lattice with Raman fields to realize the two-dimensional topological crystalline insulators. Detection of the mirror winding number in these systems can be achieved by implementing a simple quench sequence and observing the evolution of the time-of-flight patterns.</description>

      <title>Dynamical control in a prethermalized molecular ultracold plasma: Local dissipation drives global relaxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prethermalization occurs as an important phase in the dynamics of many-body systems when strong coupling drives a quasi-equilibrium in a subspace separated from the thermodynamic equilibrium by the restriction of a gap in energy or other conserved quantity. Here, we report the signature of an enduring prethermal regime of arrested relaxation in the molecular ultracold plasma that forms following the avalanche of a state-selected Rydberg gas of nitric oxide. Electron collisions mix orbital angular momentum, scattering Rydberg molecules to states of very high-$\ell$. Spontaneous predissociation purifies this non-penetrating character, creating an extraordinary gap between the plasma states of $n \approx \ell$, with measured $n&gt;200$ and penetrating states of $\ell = 0, ~1$ and 2. Evolution to a statistically equilibrated state of N and O atoms cannot occur without Rydberg electron penetration, and this gap blocks relaxation for a millisecond or more. Evolving through the critical phase, electrons that balance the NO$^+$ charge behave as though localized in the prethermal phase and play an ineffective role in bridging this gap. However, the application of a weak radiofrequency (RF) field promotes a dramatic degree of relaxation owing to electron collisions. On an entirely different scale, exciting a quantum-state transition in an exceedingly small fraction of the molecules in the prethermalized ensemble acts with even greater effect to drive the entire system toward equilibrium. We ascribe this to dissipative character added to a small fraction of the states in the prethermally localized ensemble. Using the Lindblad master equation, we illustrate qualitatively similar dynamics for a toy model of an open quantum system that consists of a localized set of spins on which dissipation acts locally at a single site.</description>

      <title>Emergent Universal Quench Dynamics in Randomly Interacting Spin Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Universality often emerges in low-energy equilibrium physics of quantum many-body systems, despite their microscopic complexity and variety. Recently, there has been a growing interest in studying far-from-equilibrium dynamics of quantum many-body systems. Such dynamics usually involves highly excited states beyond the traditional low-energy theory description. Whether universal behaviors can also emerge in such non-equilibrium dynamics is a central issue at the frontier of quantum dynamics. Here we report the experimental observation of universal dynamics by monitoring the spin depolarization process in a solid-state NMR system described by an ensemble of randomly interacting spins. The spin depolarization can be related to temporal spin-spin correlation functions at high temperatures. We discover a remarkable phenomenon that these correlation functions obey a universal functional form. This experimental fact helps us identify the dominant interacting processes in the spin depolarization dynamics that lead to this universality. Our observation demonstrates the existence of universality even in non-equilibrium dynamics at high temperatures, thereby complementing the well-established universality in low-energy physics.</description>

      <title>Tailoring Bound State Geometry in High-Dimensional Non-Hermitian Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is generally believed that the non-Hermitian effect (NHSE), due to its non-reciprocal nature, creates barriers for the appearance of impurity bound states. In this paper, we find that in two and higher dimensions, the presence of geometry-dependent skin effect eliminates this barrier such that even an infinitesimal impurity potential can confine bound states in this type of non-Hermitian systems. By examining bound states around Bloch saddle points, we find that non-Hermiticity can disrupt the isotropy of bound states, resulting in concave dumbbell-shaped bound states. Our work reveals a geometry transition of bound state between concavity and convexity in high-dimensional non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <title>Effective Polaron Dynamics of an Impurity Particle Interacting with a Fermi Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the quantum dynamics of a homogeneous ideal Fermi gas coupled to an impurity particle on a three-dimensional box with periodic boundary condition. For large Fermi momentum $k_\text{F}$, we prove that the effective dynamics is generated by a Fr\"ohlich-type polaron Hamiltonian, which linearly couples the impurity particle to an almost-bosonic excitation field. Moreover, we prove that the effective dynamics can be approximated by an explicit coupled coherent state. Our method is applicable to two relevant settings: first, an interaction coupling $\lambda=1$ and masses of order 1 for time scales of order $k_\text{F}^{-1}$; second to the case of $\lambda=k_\text{F}^{-1}$ and a heavy Fermi gas with masses of order $k_\text{F}$ for time scales of order 1.</description>

      <title>Cosmological particle production in a quantum field simulator as a quantum mechanical scattering problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The production of quantum field excitations or particles in cosmological spacetimes is a hallmark prediction of curved quantum field theory. The generation of cosmological perturbations from quantum fluctuations in the early universe constitutes an important application. The problem can be quantum-simulated in terms of structure formation in an interacting Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) with time-dependent s-wave scattering length. Here, we explore a mapping between cosmological particle production in general (D+1)-dimensional spacetimes and scattering problems described by the non-relativistic stationary Schr\"odinger equation in one dimension. Through this mapping, intuitive explanations for emergent spatial structures in both the BEC and the cosmological system can be obtained for a large class of analogue cosmological scenarios, ranging from power-law expansions to periodic modulations. The investigated cosmologies and their scattering analogues are tuned to be implemented in a (2+1)-dimensional quantum field simulator.</description>

      <title>dx2-y2-wave Bose Metal induced by the next-nearest-neighbor hopping t'</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconductivity arises when electrons form Cooper pairs with phase coherence. In contrast, a lack of phase coherence in Cooper pairs can lead to an uncondensed metallic ground state known as the Bose metal state. In this study, we investigate an attractively interacting fermionic system with nearest-neighbor (NN) hopping (t) and next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) hopping (t') anisotropy between two species of spins in a two-dimensional (2D) lattice. Utilizing the constrained path quantum Monte Carlo (CPQMC) method, we demonstrate the existence of a dx2-y2-wave Cooper pair Bose metal (CPBM) phase with t'/t &gt; 0.7. The CPBM phase exhibits a dome-like structure in the phase diagram of filling n~0.65, with the maximal region around an optimal t'/t ~ 0.2, suggesting that an appropriate value of t' facilitates the formation of the Bose metal. Furthermore, we find that a Bose metal formed by fermions with a closed Fermi surface confirms that the crucial condition for this exotic phenomenon is primarily the anisotropy of the Fermi surface, rather than its topology. Our finding of the dx2-y2-wave CPBM demonstrates the same pairing symmetry as the pseudogap behavior in cuprates, and its experimental realization in ultracold atom systems is also feasible.</description>

      <title>Emergent spinon-holon Feshbach resonance in a doped Majumdar-Ghosh model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Experimental and numerical spectroscopy have revealed rich physics in antiferromagnets, in particular in frustrated and doped systems. The Majumdar-Ghosh (MG) model has an analytically known spin-disordered ground state of dimerized singlets as a result of magnetic frustration. Here we study the single-hole angle-resolved photoemission spectrum (ARPES) of a doped MG model, where we introduce a spin-hole interaction that is experimentally accessible with ultracold molecules. We report a bound spinon-holon ground state and clear signatures of a spinon-holon molecule state and polarons in the ARPES spectrum at different magnetizations. Moreover, we find signatures of an emergent Feshbach resonance with tunable interactions associated with the unbinding of the spinon and the holon. Our results provide new insights into the physics of dopants in frustrated $t$-$J$ models and establish the latter as a new platform for studies of emergent few-body phenomena.</description>

      <title>Observation of dense collisional soliton complexes in a two-component Bose-Einstein condensate</title>

Abstract: Solitons are nonlinear solitary waves which maintain their shape over time and through collisions, occurring in a variety of nonlinear media from plasmas to optics. We present an experimental and theoretical study of hydrodynamic phenomena in a two-component atomic Bose-Einstein condensate where a soliton array emerges from the imprinting of a periodic spin pattern by a microwave pulse-based winding technique. We observe the ensuing dynamics which include shape deformations, the emergence of dark-antidark solitons, apparent spatial frequency tripling, and decay and revival of contrast related to soliton collisions. For the densest arrays, we obtain soliton complexes where solitons undergo continued collisions for long evolution times providing an avenue towards the investigation of soliton gases in atomic condensates.</description>

Abstract: We consider a ring-shaped triple-well potential with few polar bosons with in-plane dipole orientation. By diagonalizing the extended Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian, we investigate the ground state properties of the system as we rotate the dipole angle and vary the on-site and dipole-dipole interaction strengths. We find that the anisotropic character of the dipolar interactions, as well as the competition between dipole and on-site interactions lead to different ground states and that the entanglement between sites also depends on the number of particles. We further characterize the system by studying the condensed fraction and coherence properties for different polarization angles, highlighting the possible effect of the dipolar interaction as manipulation tool.</description>

      <title>When Superconductivity Crosses Over: From BCS to BEC</title>

Abstract: New developments in superconductivity, particularly through unexpected and often astonishing forms of superconducting materials, continue to excite the community and stimulate theory. It is now becoming clear that there are two distinct platforms for superconductivity: natural and synthetic materials. The study of these artificial materials has greatly expanded in the last decade or so, with the discoveries of new forms of superfluidity in artificial heterostructures and the exploitation of proximitization. Natural superconductors continue to surprise through the Fe-based pnictides and chalcogenides, and nickelates as well as others. It is the goal of this review to present this two-pronged investigation into superconductors, with a focus on those that we have come to understand belong somewhere between the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) and Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) regimes. We characterize in detail the nature of this "crossover" superconductivity, which is to be distinguished from crossover superfluidity in atomic Fermi gases. In the process, we address the multiple ways of promoting a system out of the BCS and into the BCS-BEC crossover regime within the context of concrete experimental realizations. These involve natural materials, such as organic conductors, as well as artificial, mostly two-dimensional materials, such as magic-angle twisted bilayer and trilayer graphene, or gate-controlled devices, as well as one-layer and interfacial superconducting films. This work should be viewed as a celebration of BCS theory by showing that even though this theory was initially implemented with the special case of weak correlations in mind, it can in a very natural way be extended to treat the case of these more exotic strongly correlated superconductors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.10453v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum spin liquids subject to a periodic drive can display fascinating non-equilibrium heating behavior because of their emergent fractionalized quasi-particles. Here, we investigate a driven Kitaev honeycomb model and examine the dynamics of emergent Majorana matter and $Z_2$ flux excitations. We uncover a distinct two-step heating profile $\textrm{--}$ dubbed fractionalized prethermalization $\textrm{--}$ and a quasi-stationary state with vastly different temperatures for the matter and the flux sectors. We argue that this peculiar prethermalization behavior is a consequence of fractionalization. Furthermore, we discuss an experimentally feasible protocol for preparing a zero-flux initial state of the Kiteav honeycomb model with a low energy density, which can be used to observe fractionalized prethermalization in quantum information processing platforms.</description>

      <title>Spectral continuum in the Rabi-Stark model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16758v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Rabi-Stark model is a non-linear generalization of the quantum Rabi model including the dynamical Stark shift as a tunable term, which can be realized via quantum simulation on a cavity QED platform. When the Stark coupling becomes equal to the mode frequency, the spectrum changes drastically, a transition usually termed "spectral collapse" because numerical studies indicate an infinitely degenerate ground state. We show that the spectrum extends continuously from a threshold value up to infinity. A set of normalizable states are embedded in the continuum which furnishes an unexpected analogy to the atomic Stark effect. Bound states and continuum can be obtained analytically through two equally justified, but different confluence processes of the associated differential equation in Bargmann space. Moreover, these results are obtained independently using a method based on adiabatic elimination of the spin degree of freedom and corroborated through large-scale numerical checks.</description>
