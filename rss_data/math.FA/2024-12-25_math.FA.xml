      <title>Subspaces with or without a common complement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let H be a separable complex Hilbert space. Denote by Gr(H) the Grassmann manifold of H. We study the following sets of pairs of elements in Gr(H):
  Delta={(S,T) in Gr(H) x Gr(H): there exists Z in Gr(H) such that S\dot{+} Z=T \dot{+} Z=H },
  which are pairs of subspaces that have a common complement, and
  Gamma={(S,T) in Gr(H) x Gr(H): (S,T) does not belong to Delta}, Gamma=Gr(H) x Gr(H) - Delta,
  which are pairs of subspaces that do not admit a common complement. We identify S withP_S, the subspace S with the orthogonal projection P_S onto S. Thus we may regard Delta and Gamma as subsets of B(H) x B(H) (here B(H) denotes the algebra of bounded linear operators in H. We show that Delta is open, and its connected components are parametrized by the dimension and codimension of the subspaces. The connected component of Delta having both infinite dimensional and co-dimensional subspaces is dense in the corresponding component of Gr(H) x Gr(H). On the other hand, Gamma is a (closed) C^\infty submanifold of B(H) x B(H), and we characterize the connected components of Gamma in terms of dimensions and semi-Fredholm indices. We study the role played by the geodesic structure of the Grassmann geometry of H in the geometry of both Delta and Gamma. Several examples of pairs in Delta and the connected components of Gamma are given in Hilbert spaces of functions.</description>

      <title>Multilinear Strongly Singular Integral Operators with Generalized Kernels on RD-Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we introduce a class of multilinear strongly singular integral operators with generalized kernels on the RD-space. The boundedness of these operators on weighted Lebesgue spaces is established. Moreover, two types of endpoint estimates and their boundedness on generalized weighted Morrey spaces are obtained. Our results further generalize the relevant conclusions on generalized kernels in Euclidean spaces. Moreover, the weak-type results on weighted Lebesgue spaces are brand new even in the situation of Euclidean spaces. In addition, when the generalized kernels degenerate into classical kernels, our research results also extend the relevant known results. It is worth mentioning that our RD spaces are more general than theirs.</description>

      <title>The symbol of the normal operator for the d-plane transform on the Euclidean space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We directly compute the symbol of the normal operator for the d-plane transform on the Euclidean space. We show that this symbol is the product of the symbol of the power of the Laplacian of order -d/2 and a constant given by an invariant integral over excess-dimensional spaces. This leads to an alternative derivation of the filtered backprojection formula for the d-plane transform.</description>

      <title>Indices of quadratic programs over reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces for fun and profit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give an abstract perspective on quadratic programming with an eye toward long portfolio theory geared toward explaining sparsity via maximum principles. Specifically, in optimal allocation problems, we see that support of an optimal distribution lies in a variety intersect a kind of distinguished boundary of a compact subspace to be allocated over. We demonstrate some of its intelligence by using it to solve mazes and interpret such behavior as the underlying space trying to understand some hypothetical platonic index for which the capital asset pricing model holds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show an isomorphism between an algebra which is naturally constructed from the Toeplitz algebra generated by d-shifts, and an ideal of the C * -algebra of the (2d + 1)-dimensional Heisenberg group. This is a particular case of a more general result for graded nilpotent Lie groups involving symbols in the filtered calculus. The proof presented here however only involves basic functional analysis while still showcasing the ideas of the proof in the general setting.</description>

      <title>The injective hull of ideals of weighted holomorphic mappings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the injectivity of normed ideals of weighted holomorphic mappings. To be more precise, the concept of injective hull of normed weighted holomorphic ideals is introduced and characterized in terms of a domination property. The injective hulls of those ideals -- generated by the procedures of composition and dual -- are described and these descriptions are applied to some examples of such ideals. A characterization of the closed injective hull of an operator ideal in terms of an Ehrling-type inequality -- due to Jarchow and Pelczy\'nski -- is established for weighted holomorphic mappings.</description>

      <title>Spectral Property of Magnetic Quantum Walk on Hypercube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce and investigate a model of magnetic quantum walk on a general hypercube. We first construct a set of unitary involutions associated with a magnetic potential $\nu$ by using quantum Bernoulli noises. And then, with these unitary involutions as the magnetic shift operators, we define the evolution operator $\mathsf{W}^{(\nu)}$ for the model, where $\nu$ is the magnetic potential. We examine the point-spectrum and approximate-spectrum of the evolution operator $\mathsf{W}^{(\nu)}$ and obtain their representations in terms of the coin operator system of the model. We show that the point-spectrum and approximate-spectrum of $\mathsf{W}^{(\nu)}$ are completely independent of the magnetic potential $\nu$ although $\mathsf{W}^{(\nu)}$ itself is dependent of the magnetic potential $\nu$. Our work might suggest that a quantum walk perturbed by a magnetic field can have spectral stability with respect to the magnetic potential.</description>

      <title>Global Bifurcation Curve for Fourth-Order MEMS/NEMS Models with Clamped Boundary Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Global solution curve and exact multiplicity of positive solutions for a class of fourth-order equations with doubly clamped boundary conditions are established. The results extend a theorem of P. Korman (2004) by allowing the presence of a singularity in the nonlinearity. The paper also provides a global a priori bound for $C^3$-norm of positive solutions, which is optimal in terms of regularity. Examples arising in MEMS/NEMS models are presented to illustrate applications of the main results.</description>

      <title>Fundamental solutions for parabolic equations and systems: universal existence, uniqueness, representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a universal, conceptually simple and systematic method to prove well-posedness to Cauchy problems for weak solutions of parabolic equations with non-smooth, time-dependent, elliptic part having a variational definition. Our classes of weak solutions are taken with minimal assumptions. We prove the existence and uniqueness of a fundamental solution which seems new in this generality: it is shown to always coincide with the associated evolution family for the initial value problem with zero source and it yields representation of all weak solutions. Our strategy is a variational approach avoiding density arguments, a priori regularity of weak solutions or regularization by smooth operators. One of our main tools are embedding results which yield time continuity of our weak solutions going beyond the celebrated Lions regularity theorem and that is addressing a variety of source terms. We illustrate our results with three concrete applications : second order uniformly elliptic part with Dirichlet boundary condition on domains, integro-differential elliptic part, and second order degenerate elliptic part.</description>

      <title>Matrix Chaos Inequalities and Chaos of Combinatorial Type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Matrix concentration inequalities and their recently discovered sharp counterparts provide powerful tools to bound the spectrum of random matrices whose entries are linear functions of independent random variables. However, in many applications in theoretical computer science and in other areas one encounters more general random matrix models, called matrix chaoses, whose entries are polynomials of independent random variables. Such models have often been studied on a case-by-case basis using ad-hoc methods that can yield suboptimal dimensional factors.
  In this paper we provide general matrix concentration inequalities for matrix chaoses, which enable the treatment of such models in a systematic manner. These inequalities are expressed in terms of flattenings of the coefficients of the matrix chaos. We further identify a special family of matrix chaoses of combinatorial type for which the flattening parameters can be computed mechanically by a simple rule. This allows us to provide a unified treatment of and improved bounds for matrix chaoses that arise in a variety of applications, including graph matrices, Khatri-Rao matrices, and matrices that arise in average case analysis of the sum-of-squares hierarchy.</description>

      <title>Generalized Hilbert operator acting on Bergman spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.10747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.10747v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mu$ be a positive Borel measure on $[0,1)$. If $f \in H(\mathbb{D})$ and $\alpha&gt;-1$, the generalized integral type Hilbert operator defined as follows:
  $$\mathcal{I}_{\mu_{\alpha+1}}(f)(z)=\int^1_{0} \frac{f(t)}{(1-tz)^{\alpha+1}}d\mu(t), \ \ \ z\in \mathbb{D} .$$ The operator $\mathcal{I}_{\mu_{1}}$ has been extensively studied recently. In this paper, we characterize the measures $\mu$ for which $\mathcal{I}_{\mu_{\alpha+1}}$ is a bounded (resp., compact) operator acting between the Bloch space $\mathcal {B}$ and Bergman space $ A^{p}$, or from $A^{p}(0&lt;p&lt;\infty)$ into $ A^{q}(q\geq 1)$. We also study the analogous problem in Bergman spaces $A^{p}(1 \leq p\leq 2)$. Finally, we determine the Hilbert-Schmidt class on $A^{2}$ for all $\alpha&gt;-1$.</description>

      <title>The Riesz basisness of the eigenfunctions and eigenvectors connected to the stability problem of a fluid-conveying tube with boundary control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.01432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.01432v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the present paper we study the stability problem for a stretched tube conveying fluid with boundary control. The abstract spectral problem concerns operator pencils of the forms \begin{equation*} \mathcal{M}\left(\lambda\right)=\lambda^2G+\lambda D+C\quad\text{and}\quad\mathcal{P}\left(\lambda\right)=\lambda I-T \end{equation*} taking values in different Hilbert product spaces. Thorough analysis is made of the location and asymptotics of eigenvalues in the complex plane and Riesz basisness of the corresponding eigenfunctions and eigenvectors. Well-posedness of the closed-loop system represented by the initial-value problem for the abstract equation \begin{equation*} \dot{{x}}\left(t\right)=Tx\left(t\right) \end{equation*} is established in the framework of semigroups as well as expansions of the solutions in terms of eigenvectors and stability of the closed-loop system operator $T$. For the parameters of the problem we give regions, larger than those in the literature, in which a stretched tube with flow, simply supported at one end, with a boundary controller applied at the other end, can be made exponentially stable.</description>
