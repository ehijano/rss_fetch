      <title>Restoring Kibble-Zurek Scaling and Defect Freezing in Non-Hermitian Systems under Biorthogonal Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian physics provides an effective description of open and nonequilibrium systems and hosts many novel and intriguing phenomena such as exceptional points and non-Hermitian skin effect. Despite extensive theoretical and experimental studies, however, how to properly deal with the nonadiabatic dynamics in driven non-Hermitian quantum system is still under debate. Here, we develop a theoretical framework based on time-dependent biorthogonal quantum formalism by redefining the associated state to obtain the gauge-independent transition probability, and study the nonadiabatic dynamics of a linearly driven non-Hermitian system. In contrast to the normalization method that leads to a modified Kibble-Zurek scaling behavior, our approach predicts that the defect production at exceptional points exhibits power-law scaling behaviors conforming to the Kibble-Zurek mechanism. In the fast quench regime, universal scaling behaviors are also found with respect to the initial quenching parameter, which can be explained by the impulse-adiabatic approximation. Moreover, as trespassing the PT -broken region, the phenomenon of defect freezing, i.e., violation of adiabaticity, is observed.</description>

      <title>Quantum-centric computation of molecular excited states with extended sample-based quantum diagonalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The simulation of molecular electronic structure is an important application of quantum devices. Recently, it has been shown that quantum devices can be effectively combined with classical supercomputing centers in the context of the sample-based quantum diagonalization (SQD) algorithm. This allowed the largest electronic structure quantum simulation to date (77 qubits) and opened near-term devices to practical use cases in chemistry toward the hundred-qubit mark. However, the description of many important physical and chemical properties of those systems, such as photo-absorption/-emission, requires a treatment that goes beyond the ground state alone. In this work, we extend the SQD algorithm to determine low-lying molecular excited states. The extended-SQD method improves over the original SQD method in accuracy, at the cost of an additional computational step. It also improves over quantum subspace expansion based on single and double electronic excitations, a widespread approach to excited states on pre-fault-tolerant quantum devices, in both accuracy and efficiency. We employ the extended SQD method to compute the first singlet (S$_1$) and triplet (T$_1$) excited states of the nitrogen molecule with a correlation-consistent basis set, and the ground- and excited-state properties of the [2Fe-2S] cluster.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Geometry of the Haldane Model under a Quantum Quench</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12470v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the time evolution of a topological system when the system undergoes a sudden quantum quench within the same nontrivial phase. Using Haldane's honeycomb model as an example, we show that equilibrium states in a topological phase can be distinguished by geometrical features, such as the characteristic momentum at which the half-occupied edge modes cross, the associated edge-mode velocity, and the winding vector about which the normalized pseudospin magnetic field winds along a great circle on the Bloch sphere. We generalize these geometrical quantities for non-equilibrium states and use them to visualize the quench dynamics of the topological system. In general, we find the pre-quench equilibrium state relaxes to the post-quench equilibrium state in an oscillatory fashion, whose amplitude decay as $t^{1/2}$. In the process, however, the characteristic winding vector of the non-equilibrium system can evolve to regimes that are not reachable with equilibrium states.</description>
