      <title>Stellar Physics and General Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The general theory of relativity is currently established as the most precise theory of gravity supported by observations, and its application is diverse ranging from astronomy to cosmology, while its application to astrophysics has been restricted only to compact stars due to the assumption that the Newtonian approximation is sufficient for celestial bodies with medium density such as the sun. Surprisingly, the recent research of the author has implied that this long-held assumption is not valid, and that non-perturbative effects significantly change relevant results obtained by Newtonian gravity. In particular, local physical quantities inside the sun are newly predicted to exhibit power law differently from the so-called standard solar model. This surprising result is reviewed including brief discussion of physics behind the discrepancy and a new application of the new mass formula to gas planets.</description>

      <title>A Link Between White Dwarf Pulsars and Polars: Multiwavelength Observations of the 9.36-Minute Period Variable Gaia22ayj</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: White dwarfs (WDs) are the most abundant compact objects, and recent surveys have suggested that over a third of WDs in accreting binaries host a strong (B $\gtrsim$ 1 MG) magnetic field. However, the origin and evolution of WD magnetism remain under debate. Two WD pulsars, AR Sco and J191213.72-441045.1 (J1912), have been found, which are non-accreting binaries hosting rapidly spinning (1.97-min and 5.30-min, respectively) magnetic WDs. The WD in AR Sco is slowing down on a $P/\dot{P}\approx 5.6\times 10^6$ yr timescale. It is believed they will eventually become polars, accreting systems in which a magnetic WD (B $\approx 10-240$ MG) accretes from a Roche lobe-filling donor spinning in sync with the orbit ($\gtrsim 78$ min). Here, we present multiwavelength data and analysis of Gaia22ayj, which outbursted in March 2022. We find that Gaia22ayj is a magnetic accreting WD that is rapidly spinning down ($P/\dot{P} = 6.1^{+0.3}_{-0.2}\times 10^6$ yr) like WD pulsars, but shows clear evidence of accretion, like polars. Strong linear polarization (40%) is detected in Gaia22ayj; such high levels have only been seen in the WD pulsar AR Sco and demonstrate the WD is magnetic. High speed photometry reveals a 9.36-min period accompanying a high amplitude ($\sim 2$ mag) modulation. We associate this with a WD spin or spin-orbit beat period, not an orbital period as was previously suggested. Fast (60-s) optical spectroscopy reveals a broad ``hump'', reminiscent of cyclotron emission in polars, between 4000-8000 Angstrom. We find an X-ray luminosity of $L_X = 2.7_{-0.8}^{+6.2}\times10^{32} \textrm{ erg s}^{-1}$ in the 0.3-8 keV energy range, while two VLA radio campaigns resulted in a non-detection with a $F_r &lt; 15.8\mu\textrm{Jy}$ 3$ \sigma$ upper limit. The shared properties of both WD pulsars and polars suggest that Gaia22ayj is a missing link between the two classes of magnetic WD binaries.</description>

      <title>Photometric Determination of Unresolved Main-sequence Binaries in the Pleiades: Binary Fraction and Mass Ratio Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate determination of binary fractions ($f_{\rm b}$) and mass ratio ($q$) distributions is crucial for understanding the dynamical evolution of open clusters. We present an improved multiband fitting technique to enhance the analysis of binary properties. This approach enables an accurate photometric determination of $f_{\rm b}$ and $q$ distribution in a cluster. The detectable mass ratio can be down to the $q_{\rm lim}$, limited by the minimum stellar mass in theoretical models. First, we derived an empirical model for magnitudes of Gaia DR3 and 2MASS bands that match the photometry of single stars in the Pleiades. We then performed a multiband fitting for each cluster member, deriving the probability density function (PDF) of its primary mass ($\mathcal{M}_1$) and $q$ in the Bayesian framework. 1154 main-sequence (MS) single stars or unresolved MS+MS binaries are identified as members of the Pleiades. By stacking their PDFs, we conducted a detailed analysis of binary properties of the cluster. We found the $f_{\rm b}$ of this sample is $0.34 \pm 0.02$. The $q$ distribution exhibits a three-segment power-law profile: an initial increase, followed by a decrease, and then another increase. This distribution can be interpreted as a fiducial power-law profile with an exponent of -1.0 that is determined in the range of $0.3 &lt; q &lt; 0.8$, but with a deficiency of binaries at lower $q$ and an excess at higher $q$. The variations of $f_{\rm b}$ and $q$ with $\mathcal{M}_1$ reveal a complex binary distribution within the Pleiades, which might be attributed to a combination of primordial binary formation mechanisms, dynamical interactions, and the observational limit of photometric binaries imposed by $q_{\rm lim} (\mathcal{M}_1)$.</description>

      <title>Non-evolutionary effects on period change in Magellanic Cepheids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical Cepheids are a cornerstone class of pulsators, fundamental to testing stellar evolution and pulsation theories. Their secular period changes, characterized through $O-C$ (Observed minus Calculated) diagrams, offer valuable insights into their evolution. While evolutionary period changes are well understood from both observational and theoretical perspectives, shorter timescale period changes (on the order of ($\sim$ 10$^{2}$-10$^{4}$ days) - known as non-evolutionary period changes are yet to be systematically explored.
  In this work, we present a detailed and comprehensive search for non-evolutionary period changes using $O-C$ analysis of Magellanic Cloud (MC) Cepheids, based on 20+ years of OGLE photometry data. Our sample includes both the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) Cepheids, focusing on single radial mode Cepheids (both fundamental (FU) and first overtone (FO) modes). The results are grouped into two phenomena: (a) Cepheids in binary systems (b) Non-linear period changes.</description>

      <title>Superstrong magnetic fields in sunspot bipolar light bridges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent solar observations of bipolar light bridges (BLBs) in sunspots have, in a few individual cases, revealed magnetic fields up to 8.2 kG, which is at least twice as strong as typical values measured in sunspot umbrae. However, the small number of such observations hinted that such strong fields in these bright photospheric features that separate two opposite-polarity umbrae, are a rare phenomenon. We determine the field strength in a large sample of BLBs with the aim of establishing how prevalent such strong fields are in BLBs. We apply a state-of-the-art inversion technique that accounts for the degradation of the data by the intrinsic point spread function of the telescope, to the so far largest set of spectropolarimetric observations, by Hinode/Solar Optical Telescope spectropolarimeter, of sunspots containing BLBs. We identified 98 individual BLBs within 51 distinct sunspot groups. Since 66.3% of the BLBs were observed multiple times, a total of 630 spectropolarimetric scans of these 98 BLBs were analysed. All analysed BLBs contain magnetic fields stronger than 4.5 kG at unit optical depth. The field strengths decrease faster with height than the fields in umbrae and penumbrae. BLBs display a unique continuum intensity and field strength combination, forming a population well separated from umbrae and the penumbrae. The high brightness of BLBs in spite of their very strong magnetic fields points to the presence of a so far largely unexplored regime of magnetoconvection.</description>

      <title>Observations of the Ultraviolet-bright Star III-60 in the Globular Cluster NGC 6723</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have analyzed archival far-ultraviolet spectra of the UV-bright star III-60 in the globular cluster NGC 6723 obtained with the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE) and the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS). We find that the star's photospheric parameters (effective temperature $T_{\rm eff} = 44{,}800 \pm 1200$, surface gravity $\log g = 4.89 \pm 0.18$, and helium abundance $\log N({\rm He})/N({\rm H}) = -0.84 \pm 0.29$) are consistent with the values derived from its optical spectrum, suggesting that optically-derived values are generally accurate for evolved stars with $T_{\rm eff} \lesssim$ 50,000 K. Relative to the cluster's RGB stars, III-60 is enhanced in nitrogen and depleted in carbon and oxygen. The star exhibits strong P Cygni profiles in both components of the N V $\lambda 1240$ doublet, but the resonance lines of other species show no evidence of a stellar wind. The star's effective temperature and luminosity place it on the evolutionary tracks of stars evolving from the blue horizontal branch, but its high mass ($\sim 1.2 \, M_{\odot}$) indicates that it is the product of a stellar merger. Its helium, carbon, and nitrogen abundances suggest that it is following an evolutionary path similar to that of the low-carbon, intermediate helium-rich hot subdwarfs.</description>

      <title>Spin-period variations in the intermediate polar RX J2133.7+5107</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the results of long-term time series photometry on RX J2133.7+5107 (also known as 1RXS J213344.1+510725) obtained at several observatories. Using data taken during 17 years, we determined the current value of the spin period of $570.811470$ seconds with the formal accuracy of $0.000006$ seconds and a spin-up of the white dwarf with a characteristic time of $1.483(1)\times10^5$ years. This is even faster than that reported previously and, if confirmed, makes this object have one of the fastest spin-up timescales of all known intermediate polars. We derived an improved value of the superhump period of the system to be $0^d.280130(1)$. Superhump maxima timings are moving on the phase curve from season to season, showing non-monotonic changes, without a change in superhump period.</description>

      <title>A Near-IR Search for Helium in the Superluminous Supernova SN 2024ahr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a detailed study of SN 2024ahr, a hydrogen-poor superluminous supernova (SLSN-I), for which we determine a redshift of $z=0.0861$. SN 2024ahr has a peak absolute magnitude of $M_g\approx M_r\approx -21$ mag, rest-frame rise and decline times (50$\%$ of peak) of about 40 and 80 days, respectively, and typical spectroscopic evolution in the optical band. Similarly, modeling of the UV/optical light curves with a magnetar spin-down engine leads to typical parameters: an initial spin period of $\approx 3.3$ ms, a magnetic field strength of $\approx 6\times 10^{13}$ G, and an ejecta mass of $\approx 9.5$ M$_\odot$. Due to its relatively low redshift we obtained a high signal-to-noise ratio near-IR spectrum about 43 rest-frame days post-peak to search for the presence of helium. We do not detect any significant feature at the location of the He I $\,\lambda 2.058$ $\mu$m feature, and place a conservative upper limit of $\sim 0.05$ M$_\odot$ on the mass of helium in the outer ejecta. We detect broad features of Mg I $\,\lambda 1.575$ $\mu$m and a blend of Co II $\,\lambda 2.126$ $\mu$m and Mg II, $\lambda 2.136$ $\mu$m, which are typical of Type Ic SNe, but with higher velocities. Examining the sample of SLSNe-I with NIR spectroscopy, we find that, unlike SN 2024ahr, these events are generally peculiar. This highlights the need for a large sample of prototypical SLSNe-I with NIR spectroscopy to constrain the fraction of progenitors with helium (Ib-like) and without helium (Ic-like) at the time of the explosion, and hence the evolutionary path(s) leading to the rare outcome of SLSNe-I.</description>

      <title>Photometry of outer Solar System objects from the Dark Energy Survey II: a joint analysis of trans-Neptunian absolute magnitudes, colors, lightcurves and dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For the 696 trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) with absolute magnitudes $5.5 &lt; H_r &lt; 8.2$ detected in the Dark Energy Survey (DES), we characterize the relationships between their dynamical state and physical properties -- namely $H_r$, indicating size; colors, indicating surface composition; and flux variation semi-amplitude $A$, indicating asphericity and surface inhomogeneity. We seek ``birth'' physical distributions that can recreate these parameters in every dynamical class. We show that the observed colors of these TNOs are consistent with 2 Gaussian distributions in $griz$ space, ``near-IR bright'' (NIRB) and ``near-IR faint'' (NIRF), presumably an inner and outer birth population, respectively. We find a model in which both the NIRB and NIRF $H_r$ and $A$ distributions are independent of current dynamical states, supporting their assignment as birth populations. All objects are consistent with a common rolling $p(H_r)$, but NIRF objects are significantly more variable. Cold classicals (CCs) are purely NIRF, while hot classical (HC), scattered, and detached TNOs are consistent with $\approx70\%$ NIRB, and resonances' NIRB fractions show significant variation. The NIRB component of the HCs and of some resonances have broader inclination distributions than the NIRFs, i.e. their current dynamics retains information about birth location. We find evidence for radial stratification within the birth NIRB population, in that HC NIRBs are on average redder than detached or scattered NIRBs; a similar effect distinguishes CCs from other NIRFs. We estimate total object counts and masses of each class within our $H_r$ range. These results will strongly constrain models of the outer solar system.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Scattering From the Sun and Planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: General relativity predicts that massless waves should scatter from the Riemann curvature of their backgrounds. These scattered waves are sometimes called $\textit{tails}$ and have never been directly observed. Here we calculate the gravitational waves scattered in the backward direction (scattering angle $\vartheta=\pi$) from the weak-field curvature of an extended massive object, finding close agreement with previous results in the long-wavelength limit. These long-wavelength results are then applied to gravitational waves in the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) sensitivity band scattering from the Sun and planets. We estimate that scattering from the Sun and the planets from Jupiter to Neptune could contribute a $10^{-3}$ amplitude modulation to LISA observations when these objects almost intersect the line of sight between LISA and the source, leading to forward scattering with $\vartheta\simeq0$. These conditions should be realized for the Sun during the lifetime of LISA if the detection rate of long-duration sources is not much smaller than a thousand per year.</description>

      <title>Chemistry in the Galactic Center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gas and dust in the Galactic Center are subjected to energetic processing by intense UV radiation fields, widespread shocks, enhanced rates of cosmic-rays and X-rays, and strong magnetic fields. The Giant Molecular Clouds in the Galactic Center present a rich chemistry in a wide variety of chemical compounds, some of which are prebiotic. We have conducted unbiased, ultrasensitive and broadband spectral surveys toward the G+0.693-0.027 molecular cloud located in the Galactic Center, which have yielded the discovery of new complex organic molecules proposed as precursors of the "building blocks" of life. I will review our current understanding of the chemistry in Galactic Center molecular clouds, and summarize the recent detections toward G+0.693-0.027 of key precursors of prebiotic chemistry. All this suggests that the ISM is an important source of prebiotic material that could have contributed to the process of the origin of life on Earth and elsewhere in the Universe.</description>

Abstract: The carbon isotope ratio ($^{12}\mathrm{C}/^{13}\mathrm{C}$) is a potential tracer of giant planet and brown dwarf formation. The GQ Lup system, hosting the K7 T Tauri star GQ Lup A and its substellar companion GQ Lup B, offers a unique opportunity to investigate this ratio in a young system. We aim to characterise the atmosphere of GQ Lup B, determining its temperature, chemical composition, spin, surface gravity, and $^{12}\mathrm{C}/^{13}\mathrm{C}$, while also measuring the same ratio for its host star, GQ Lup A. High-resolution K-band spectra of GQ Lup were obtained using CRIRES+ at the VLT. We modelled the starlight contribution from GQ Lup A and fitted GQ Lup B\'s spectrum with atmospheric models from petitRADTRANS. The $^{12}\mathrm{C}/^{13}\mathrm{C}$ ratio for GQ Lup A was derived using isotope-sensitive PHOENIX models. Atmospheric analysis of GQ Lup B revealed abundances of H$_2$O, $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, HF, Na, Ca, and Ti, along with a C/O ratio of $0.50 \pm 0.01$, consistent with the solar value. The carbon isotope ratio was measured as $^{12}\mathrm{C}/^{13}\mathrm{C} = 53^{+7}_{-6}$ for GQ Lup B and $^{12}\mathrm{C}/^{13}\mathrm{C} = 51^{+10}_{-8}$ for GQ Lup A. Strong veiling of the photospheric lines of GQ Lup A was identified and accounted for. The similar $^{12}\mathrm{C}/^{13}\mathrm{C}$ values in GQ Lup A and B suggest a common origin from a shared material reservoir, supporting formation via disc fragmentation or gravitational collapse.</description>

      <title>Double white dwarf binary population in MOCCA star clusters -- Comparisons with observations of close and wide binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04314v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There could be a significant population of double white dwarf binaries (DWDs) inside globular clusters (GCs), however, these are often too faint to be individually observed. We have utilized a large number GC models evolved with the Monte Carlo Cluster Simulator (MOCCA) code, to create a large statistical dataset of DWDs. These models include multiple-stellar populations, resulting in two distinct initial populations: one dense and another less dense. Due to the lower density of one population, a large number of objects escape during the early GC evolution, leading to a high mass-loss rate. In this dataset we have analysed three main groups of DWDs, namely in-cluster binaries, escaped binaries, and isolated evolution of primordial binaries. We compared the properties of these groups to observations of close and wide binaries. We find that the number of escaping DWDs is significantly larger than the number of in-cluster binaries and those that form via the isolated evolution of all promiridial binaries in our GC models. This suggests that dynamics play an important role in the formation of DWDs. For close binaries, we found a good agreement in the separations of escaped binaries and isolated binaries, but in-cluster binaries showed slight differences. We could not reproduce the observed extremely low mass WDs due to the limitations of our stellar and binary evolution prescriptions. For wide binaries, we also found a good agreement in the separations and masses, after accounting for observational selection effects. We conclude that, even though the current observational samples of DWDs are extremely biased and incomplete, our results compare reasonably well with observations.</description>

      <title>Superoutbursts and Positive Superhumps Occurred During the Standstill of a Z Cam-type Dwarf Nova</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17611v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dwarf novae are semi-detached binaries, where a white dwarf accretes material from a cool main-sequence companion via an accretion disk, and are known for their intermittent outbursts, making them key systems for studying accretion physics. The accumulation of large survey datasets has challenged traditional models, which assumed that the disk remains hot and cannot produce superoutbursts during the standstill of Z Cam-type dwarf nova and that superoutbursts require a mass ratio of q = M_2/M_1 &lt; 0.25 - 0.33. Here we report the detection of superoutbursts and positive superhumps (PSHs) during a standstill in the Z Cam-type star AT Cnc with a mass ratio larger than 0.33. Notably, the PSHs evolve gradually before the superoutburst begins, suggesting that an eccentric, precessing disk forms first, with the superoutburst occurring as the disk radius continues to expand. These findings provide the first detailed observational evidence of superoutbursts and PSHs occurring during standstill, offering important new insights into the classification of dwarf novae and the underlying mechanisms of outbursts</description>

      <title>Observations of Microlensed Images with Dual-field Interferometry: On-sky Demonstration and Prospects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12227v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interferometric observations of gravitational microlensing events offer an opportunity for precise, efficient, and direct mass and distance measurements of lensing objects, especially those of isolated neutron stars and black holes. However, such observations have previously been possible for only a handful of extremely bright events. The recent development of a dual-field interferometer, GRAVITY Wide, has made it possible to reach out to significantly fainter objects and increase the pool of microlensing events amenable to interferometric observations by two orders of magnitude. Here, we present the first successful observation of a microlensing event with GRAVITY Wide and the resolution of microlensed images in the event OGLE-2023-BLG-0061/KMT-2023-BLG-0496. We measure the angular Einstein radius of the lens with subpercent precision, $\theta_{\rm E} = 1.280 \pm 0.009$ mas. Combined with the microlensing parallax detected from the event light curve, the mass and distance to the lens are found to be $0.472 \pm 0.012\,M_{\odot}$ and $1.81 \pm 0.05$ kpc, respectively. We present the procedure for the selection of targets for interferometric observations and discuss possible systematic effects affecting GRAVITY Wide data. This detection demonstrates the capabilities of the new instrument, and it opens up completely new possibilities for the follow-up of microlensing events and future routine discoveries of isolated neutron stars and black holes.</description>

      <title>Cleaning WASP-33 b transits from the host star photometric variability: analysis of TESS data from two sectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13422v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Based on TESS observations of a $\delta$ Scuti variable WASP-33 obtained in 2019 and 2022, we thoroughly investigate the power spectrum of this target photometric flux and construct a statistically exhaustive model for its variability. This model contains $30$ robustly justified harmonics detected in the both TESS sectors simultaneously, $13$ less robust harmonics detected in a single TESS sector, a red noise and a quasiperiodic noise terms. This allowed us to greatly improve the accuracy of the exoplanet WASP-33 b transit timings, reducing the TTV residuals r.m.s. drastically, by a factor of $3.5$, from $63$ s to $18$ s. Finally, our analysis does not confirm existence of a detectable orbital phase variation claimed previously based on WASP-33 TESS photometry of 2019.</description>

      <title>Extending the cosmic distance ladder two orders of magnitude with strongly lensed Cepheids, carbon AGB, and RGB stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09162v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational lensing by galaxy clusters can create extreme magnification near the cluster caustics, thereby enabling detection of individual luminous stars in high-redshift background galaxies. Those stars can include non-explosive standard candles such as Cepheid variables, carbon stars in the asymptotic giant branch, and stars at the tip of the red-giant branch out to $z\lesssim1$. A large number of such detections, combined with modeling of the magnification affecting these stars (including microlensing), opens the door to extending the distance range of these standard candles by two orders of magnitude, thereby providing a check on the distances derived from supernovae. Practical measurement of a distance modulus depends on measuring the apparent magnitude of a ``knee feature'' in the lensed luminosity function due to the great abundance of red-giant-branch stars just below the luminosity of the tip of the red-giant branch. As a bonus, strongly lensed stars detected in deep exposures also provide a robust method of mapping small dark-matter substructures, detections of which also cluster around the critical curves of small-scale dark matter halos.</description>

      <title>Discovery and Detailed Study of the M31 Classical Nova AT 2023tkw: Evidence for Internal Shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18215v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a detailed analysis of an extragalactic slow classical nova in M31 exhibiting multiple peaks in its light curve. Spectroscopic and photometric observations were used to investigate the underlying physical processes. Shock-induced heating events resulting in the expansion and contraction of the photosphere are likely responsible for the observed multiple peaks. Deviation of the observed spectrum at the peak from the models also suggests the presence of shocks. The successive peaks occurring at increasing intervals could be due to the series of internal shocks generated near or within the photosphere. Spectral modeling suggests a low-mass white dwarf accreting slowly from a companion star. The ejecta mass, estimated from spectral analysis, is $\sim 10^{-4}\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$, which is typical for a slow nova. We estimate the binary, by comparing the archival HST data and eruption properties with stellar and novae models, to comprise a 0.65 $\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ primary white dwarf and a K III cool evolved secondary star.</description>

      <title>Continuous In-Situ and Remote Sun Observation for Space Weather Monitoring and Mitigation of Infrastructure Threats Through an Optimized Heliocentric Satellite Constellation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07777v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although vital for life on Earth, solar activity poses questions and increasing threats to humanity due to the Sun's unknown dynamics, intensified by our dependence on terrestrial and space-based infrastructure. This situation is compounded by significant gaps in our understanding of space weather phenomena, the Sun's magnetic field, and the need for rapid responses to unpredicted solar events. To address these issues, an optimized heliocentric satellite constellation is proposed that leverages satellites in an Elliptical Walker Constellation. This system offers (among others) equally distributed arguments of periapsis separations and cross-coupled true anomalies with respect to the Sun-centric coordinate frame. In this paper it is also demonstrated that this strategic multi-spacecraft configuration makes it possible to distinguish spatial and temporal changes in solar wind phenomena, reconstruct, in 3D, Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs), predict which space or ground-based infrastructure and when it will be affected by CMEs, maintain continuous coverage of the critical Sun-Earth line throughout the mission's duration, and protect future missions by providing simultaneously in-situ and remote measurements from small and cost-effective satellites.</description>

      <title>The angular momentum of 1.2$M_\odot$ to 2.0$M_\odot$ main-sequence and turn-off stars constrain the relationship between star-forming environment and galactic evolution history</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01035v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: \textit{Kepler} and \textit{Gaia} data shows an anomaly in the angular momentum-age relationship for 1.2-2 main-sequence stars. After considering model-induced correlation of parameters, the moment of inertia, stellar velocity distribution, sample selection effects, interactions between the Milky Way and dwarf galaxies, the star-disk interaction during the early pre-main sequence, and the angular momentum change on the main sequence, this work suggests that the earlier the star within this mass range born, the smaller the angular momentum at the time of born, following an exponential decay relationship. This relationship should be attributed to the variation in molecular cloud parameters throughout the history of the Milky Way.</description>
