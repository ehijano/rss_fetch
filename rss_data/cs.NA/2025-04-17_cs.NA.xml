      <title>Maximum bound principle for Q-tensor gradient flow with low regularity integrators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate low-regularity integrator (LRI) methods for the Q-tensor model governing nematic liquid-crystalline semilinear parabolic equation. First- and second-order temporal discretizations are developed using Duhamel's formula, and we rigorously prove that both schemes preserve the maximum bound principle (MBP) and energy dissipation under minimal regularity requirements. Optimal convergence rates are established for the proposed methods. Numerical experiments validate the theoretical findings, demonstrating that the eigenvalues of Q remain strictly confined within the physical range (-1/3},2/3).</description>

      <title>FEM-DtN-SIM Method for Computing Resonances of Schr\"{o}dinger Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of resonances of the Schr\"{o}dinger operator has a long-standing tradition in mathematical physics. Extensive theoretical investigations have explored the proximity of resonances to the real axis, their distribution, and bounds on the counting functions. However, computational results beyond one dimension remain scarce due to the nonlinearity of the problem and the unbounded nature of the domain. We propose a novel approach that integrates finite elements, Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DtN) mapping, and the spectral indicator method. The DtN mapping, imposed on the boundary of a truncated computational domain, enforces the outgoing condition. Finite elements allow for the efficient handling of complicated potential functions. The spectral indicator method effectively computes (complex) eigenvalues of the resulting nonlinear algebraic system without introducing spectral pollution. The viability of this approach is demonstrated through a range of numerical examples.</description>

      <title>A method for bounding high-order finite element functions: Applications to mesh validity and bounds-preserving limiters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel method for bounding high-order multi-dimensional polynomials in finite element approximations. The method involves precomputing optimal piecewise-linear bounding boxes for polynomial basis functions, which can then be used to locally bound any combination of these basis functions. This approach can be applied to any element/basis type at any approximation order, can provide local (i.e., subcell) extremum bounds to a desired level of accuracy, and can be evaluated efficiently on-the-fly in simulations. Furthermore, we show that this approach generally yields more accurate bounds in comparison to traditional methods based on convex hull properties (e.g., Bernstein polynomials). The efficacy of this technique is shown in applications such as mesh validity checks and optimization for high-order curved meshes, where positivity of the element Jacobian determinant can be ensured throughout the entire element, and continuously bounds-preserving limiters for hyperbolic systems, which can enforce maximum principle bounds across the entire solution polynomial.</description>

      <title>Fast Mixed-Precision Real Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evaluating real-valued expressions to high precision is a key building block in computational mathematics, physics, and numerics. A typical implementation evaluates the whole expression in a uniform precision, doubling that precision until a sufficiently-accurate result is achieved. This is wasteful: usually only a few operations really need to be performed at high precision, and the bulk of the expression could be computed much faster. However, such non-uniform precision assignments have, to date, been impractical to compute. We propose a fast new algorithm for deriving such precision assignments. The algorithm leverages results computed at lower precisions to analytically determine a mixed-precision assignment that will result in a sufficiently-accurate result. Our implementation, Reval, achieves an average speed-up of 1.72x compared to the state-of-the-art Sollya tool, with the speed-up increasing to 5.21x on the most difficult input points. An examination of the precisions used with and without precision tuning shows that the speed-up results from assigning lower precisions for the majority of operations, though additional optimizations enabled by the non-uniform precision assignments also play a role.</description>

      <title>A Technical Survey of Sparse Linear Solvers in Electronic Design Automation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sparse linear system solvers ($Ax=b$) are critical computational kernels in Electronic Design Automation (EDA), underpinning vital simulations for modern IC and system design. Applications like power integrity verification and electrothermal analysis fundamentally solve large-scale, sparse algebraic systems from Modified Nodal Analysis (MNA) or Finite Element/Volume Method (FEM/FVM) discretizations of PDEs. Problem dimensions routinely reach $10^6-10^9$ unknowns, escalating towards $10^{10}$+ for full-chip power grids \cite{Tsinghua21}, demanding stringent solver scalability, low memory footprint, and efficiency. This paper surveys predominant sparse solver paradigms in EDA: direct factorization methods (LU, Cholesky), iterative Krylov subspace methods (CG, GMRES, BiCGSTAB), and multilevel multigrid techniques. We examine their mathematical foundations, convergence, conditioning sensitivity, implementation aspects (storage formats CSR/CSC, fill-in mitigation via reordering), the critical role of preconditioning for ill-conditioned systems \cite{SaadIterative, ComparisonSolversArxiv}, and multigrid's potential optimal $O(N)$ complexity \cite{TrottenbergMG}. Solver choice critically depends on the performance impact of frequent matrix updates (e.g., transient/non-linear), where iterative/multigrid methods often amortize costs better than direct methods needing repeated factorization \cite{SaadIterative}. We analyze trade-offs in runtime complexity, memory needs, numerical robustness, parallel scalability (MPI, OpenMP, GPU), and precision (FP32/FP64). Integration into EDA tools for system-level multiphysics is discussed, with pseudocode illustrations. The survey concludes by emphasizing the indispensable nature and ongoing evolution of sparse solvers for designing and verifying complex electronic systems.</description>

      <title>A structure-preserving numerical method for quasi-incompressible Navier-Stokes-Maxwell-Stefan systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A conforming finite element scheme with mixed explicit-implicit time discretization for quasi-incompressible Navier-Stokes-Maxwell-Stefan systems in a bounded domain with periodic boundary conditions is presented. The system consists of the Navier-Stokes equations, together with a quasi-incompressibility constraint, coupled with the cross-diffusion Maxwell-Stefan equations. The numerical scheme preserves the partial masses and the quasi-incompressibility constraint and dissipates the discrete energy. Numerical experiments in two space dimensions illustrate the convergence of the scheme and the structure-preserving properties.</description>

      <title>Lagrangian finite elements in Sobolev-like spaces of order $3/2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a Sobolev-like space of order $3/2$, denoted as $\widehat{H}^{3/2}$, for Lagrangian finite elements, especially for $C^0$ elements. It is motivated by the limitations of current stability analysis of the evolving surface finite element method (ESFEM), which relies exclusively on an energy estimate framework. To establish a PDE-based analysis framework for ESFEM, we encounter a fundamental regularity mismatch: the ESFEM adopts the $C^0$ elements, while the PDE regularity theory requires $H^{3/2}$ regularity for solutions. To overcome this difficulty, we first examine the properties of the continuous $H^{3/2}$ space, then introduce a Dirichlet lift and Scott-Zhang type interpolation operators to bridge to the discrete $\widehat{H}^{3/2}$ space. Our new $\widehat{H}^{3/2}$ space is shown to be compatible with the elliptic PDE regularity theory, the trace inequality, and the inverse inequality. Notably, we extend the critical domain deformation estimate in ESFEM to the $\widehat{H}^{3/2}$ setting. The $\widehat{H}^{3/2}$ theory provides a foundation for establishing a PDE-based convergence analysis framework of ESFEM.</description>

      <title>Convergence of finite elements for the Eyles-King-Styles model of tumour growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a convergence analysis of evolving surface finite element methods (ESFEM) applied to the original Eyles-King-Styles model of tumour growth. The model consists of a Poisson equation in the bulk, a forced mean curvature flow on the surface, and a coupled velocity law between bulk and surface. Due to the non-trivial bulk-surface coupling, all previous analyses -- which exclusively relied on energy-estimate based approaches -- required an additional regularization term. By adopting the $\widehat{H}^{3/2}$ theory and the multilinear forms, we develop an essentially new theoretical framework that enables the application of PDE regularity theory to stability analysis. Based on this framework, we provide the first rigorous convergence proof for the original model without regularization.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11968v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a variance reduction method for calculating transport coefficients in molecular dynamics using an importance sampling method via Girsanov's theorem applied to Green--Kubo's formula. We optimize the magnitude of the perturbation applied to the reference dynamics by means of a scalar parameter~$\alpha$ and propose an asymptotic analysis to fully characterize the long-time behavior in order to evaluate the possible variance reduction. Theoretical results corroborated by numerical results show that this method allows for some reduction in variance, although rather modest in most situations.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Quadrature Rules for Solving PDEs using Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we consider issues surrounding integration when using Neural Networks to solve Partial Differential Equations. We focus on the Deep Ritz Method as it is of practical interest and sensitive to integration errors. We show how both deterministic integration rules as well as biased, stochastic quadrature can lead to erroneous results, whilst high order, unbiased stochastic quadrature rules on integration meshes can significantly improve convergence at an equivalent computational cost. Furthermore, we propose novel stochastic quadrature rules for triangular and tetrahedral elements, offering greater flexibility when designing integration meshes in more complex geometries. We highlight how the variance in the stochastic gradient limits convergence, whilst quadrature rules designed to give similar errors when integrating the loss function may lead to disparate results when employed in a gradient-based optimiser.</description>

      <title>Epstein zeta method for many-body lattice sums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many-body interactions arise naturally in the perturbative treatment of classical and quantum many-body systems and play a crucial role in the description of condensed matter systems. In the case of three-body interactions, the Axilrod-Teller-Muto (ATM) potential is highly relevant for the quantitative prediction of material properties. The computation of the resulting energies in d-dimensional lattice systems is challenging, as a high-dimensional lattice sum needs to be evaluated to high precision. This work solves this long-standing issue. We present an efficiently computable representation of many-body lattice sums in terms of singular integrals over products of Epstein zeta functions. For three-body interactions in 3D, this approach reduces the runtime for computing the ATM lattice sum from weeks to minutes. Our approach further extends to a broad class of n-body lattice sums. We demonstrate that the computational cost of our method only increases linearly with n, evading the exponential increase in complexity of direct summation. The evaluation of 51-body interactions on a two-dimensional lattice, corresponding to a 100-dimensional sum, can be performed within seconds on a laptop. We discuss techniques for computing the arising singular integrals and compare the accuracy of our results against computable benchmarks, achieving full precision for exponents greater than the system dimension. Finally, we apply our method to study the stability of a three-dimensional lattice system with Lennard-Jones two-body interactions under the inclusion of an ATM three-body term at finite pressure, finding a transition from the face-centered-cubic to the body-centered-cubic lattice structure with increasing ATM coupling strength. This work establishes the mathematical foundation for an ongoing investigation into the influence of many-body interactions on the stability of matter.</description>

Abstract: In this note we discuss the numerical solution of the eddy current approximation of the Maxwell equations using the simple Pragmatic Algebraic Model to include hysteresis effects. In addition to the more standard time-stepping approach we propose a space-time finite element method which allows both for parallelization and adaptivity simultaneously in space and time.

      <title>Central-Upwind Scheme for the Phase-Transition Traffic Flow Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase-transition models are an important family of non-equilibrium continuum traffic flow models, offering properties like replicating complex traffic phenomena, maintaining anisotropy, and promising potentials for accommodating automated vehicles. However, their complex mathematical characteristics such as discontinuous solution domains, pose numerical challenges and limit their exploration in traffic flow theory. This paper focuses on developing a robust and accurate numerical method for phase-transition traffic flow models: We propose a second-order semi-discrete central-upwind scheme specifically designed for discontinuous phase-transition models. This novel scheme incorporates the projection onto appropriate flow domains, ensuring enhanced handling of discontinuities and maintaining physical consistency and accuracy. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed scheme through extensive and challenging numerical tests, showcasing their potential to facilitate further research and application in phase-transition traffic flow modeling. The ability of phase-transition models to embed the ``time-gap'' -- a crucial element in automated traffic control -- as a conserved variable aligns seamlessly with the control logic of automated vehicles, presenting significant potential for future applications, and the proposed numerical scheme now substantially facilitates exploring such potentials.</description>

      <title>Computing the Tropical Abel--Jacobi Transform and Tropical Distances for Metric Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11619v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metric graphs are important models for capturing the structure of complex data across various domains. While much effort has been devoted to extracting geometric and topological features from graph data, computational aspects of metric graphs as abstract tropical curves remains unexplored. In this paper, we present the first computational and machine learning-driven study of metric graphs from the perspective of tropical algebraic geometry. Specifically, we study the tropical Abel--Jacobi transform, a vectorization of points on a metric graph via the tropical Abel--Jacobi map into its associated flat torus, the tropical Jacobian. We develop algorithms to compute this transform and investigate how the resulting embeddings depend on different combinatorial models of the same metric graph.
  Once embedded, we compute pairwise distances between points in the tropical Jacobian under two natural metrics: the tropical polarization distance and the Foster--Zhang distance. Computing these distances are generally NP-hard as they turn out to be linked to classical lattice problems in computational complexity, however, we identify a class of metric graphs where fast and explicit computations are feasible. For the general case, we propose practical algorithms for both exact and approximate distance matrix computations using lattice basis reduction and mixed-integer programming solvers. Our work lays the groundwork for future applications of tropical geometry and the tropical Abel--Jacobi transform in machine learning and data analysis.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Quantification in Multiscale Modeling of Polymer Composite Materials Using Physically Recurrent Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates whether Physically Recurrent Neural Networks (PRNNs), a recent surrogate model for heterogeneous materials, trained on a micromodel with fixed material parameters, can maintain accuracy for varying material properties without retraining, and propagate uncertainty in a multiscale framework. Unlike conventional RNNs, where parameter changes require training or explicit inclusion of material properties as extra input features, PRNNs embeds material models in their material layer that allow for modification of material parameters after training. When adjusting material properties dynamically according to the input during testing, PRNN shows high accuracy across a wide range of parameters. Therefore the surrogate can be applied to multiscale uncertainty quantification (UQ). Compared to the full-order simulations on an overly coarse mesh, the PRNN-driven model reduces simulation time by over 7000 times while accurately capturing highly nonlinear evolution of the probability density for the macroscopic response as a result of a given distribution for microscale material parameters. A PRNN-driven UQ is demonstrated on a more accurate finer mesh that would be computationally infeasible with the full-order model.</description>

      <title>Data driven approach towards more efficient Newton-Raphson power flow calculation for distribution grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Power flow (PF) calculations are fundamental to power system analysis to ensure stable and reliable grid operation. The Newton-Raphson (NR) method is commonly used for PF analysis due to its rapid convergence when initialized properly. However, as power grids operate closer to their capacity limits, ill-conditioned cases and convergence issues pose significant challenges. This work, therefore, addresses these challenges by proposing strategies to improve NR initialization, hence minimizing iterations and avoiding divergence. We explore three approaches: (i) an analytical method that estimates the basin of attraction using mathematical bounds on voltages, (ii) Two data-driven models leveraging supervised learning or physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to predict optimal initial guesses, and (iii) a reinforcement learning (RL) approach that incrementally adjusts voltages to accelerate convergence. These methods are tested on benchmark systems. This research is particularly relevant for modern power systems, where high penetration of renewables and decentralized generation require robust and scalable PF solutions. In experiments, all three proposed methods demonstrate a strong ability to provide an initial guess for Newton-Raphson method to converge with fewer steps. The findings provide a pathway for more efficient real-time grid operations, which, in turn, support the transition toward smarter and more resilient electricity networks.</description>

      <title>On projection mappings and the gradient projection method on hyperbolic space forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents several new properties of the intrinsic $\kappa$-projection into $\kappa$-hyperbolically convex sets of $\kappa$-hyperbolic space forms, along with closed-form formulas for the intrinsic $\kappa$-projection into specific $\kappa$-hyperbolically convex sets. It also discusses the relationship between the intrinsic $\kappa$-projection, the Euclidean orthogonal projection, and the Lorentz projection. These properties lay the groundwork for analyzing the gradient projection method and hold importance in their own right. Additionally, new properties of the gradient projection method to solve constrained optimization problems in $\kappa$-hyperbolic space forms are established, considering both constant and backtracking step sizes in the analysis. It is shown that every accumulation point of the sequence generated by the method for both step sizes is a stationary point for the given problem. Additionally, an iteration complexity bound is provided that upper bounds the number of iterations needed to achieve a suitable measure of stationarity for both step sizes. Finally, the properties of the constrained Fermat-Weber problem are explored, demonstrating that the sequence generated by the gradient projection method converges to its unique solution. Numerical experiments on solving the Fermat-Weber problem are presented, illustrating the theoretical findings and demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We look for traveling waves of the semi-discrete conservation law $4\dot u_j +u_{j+1}^2-u_{j-1}^2 = 0$, using variational principles related to concepts of ``hidden convexity'' appearing in recent studies of various PDE (partial differential equations). We analyze and numerically compute with two variational formulations related to dual convex optimization problems constrained by either the differential-difference equation (DDE) or nonlinear integral equation (NIE) that wave profiles should satisfy. We prove existence theorems conditional on the existence of extrema that satisfy a strict convexity criterion, and numerically exhibit a variety of localized, periodic and non-periodic wave phenomena.</description>

      <title>A new T-compatibility condition and its application to the discretization of the damped time-harmonic Galbrun's equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.01878v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the approximation of weakly T-coercive operators. The main property to ensure the convergence thereof is the regularity of the approximation (in the vocabulary of discrete approximation schemes). In a previous work the existence of discrete operators $T_n$ which converge to $T$ in a discrete norm was shown to be sufficient to obtain regularity. Although this framework proved useful for many applications for some instances the former assumption is too strong. Thus in the present article we report a weaker criterion for which the discrete operators $T_n$ only have to converge point-wise, but in addition a weak T-coercivity condition has to be satisfied on the discrete level. We apply the new framework to prove the convergence of certain $H^1$-conforming finite element discretizations of the damped time-harmonic Galbrun's equation, which is used to model the oscillations of stars. A main ingredient in the latter analysis is the uniformly stable invertibility of the divergence operator on certain spaces, which is related to the topic of divergence free elements for the Stokes equation.</description>

      <title>Sharp error bounds for edge-element discretisations of the high-frequency Maxwell equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04507v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove sharp wavenumber-explicit error bounds for first- or second-type-N\'ed\'elec-element (a.k.a. edge-element) conforming discretisations, of arbitrary (fixed) order, of the variable-coefficient time-harmonic Maxwell equations posed in a bounded domain with perfect electric conductor (PEC) boundary conditions. The PDE coefficients are allowed to be piecewise regular and complex-valued; this set-up therefore includes scattering from a PEC obstacle and/or variable real-valued coefficients, with the radiation condition approximated by a perfectly matched layer (PML).
  In the analysis of the $h$-version of the finite-element method, with fixed polynomial degree $p$, applied to the time-harmonic Maxwell equations, the $\textit{asymptotic regime}$ is when the meshwidth, $h$, is small enough (in a wavenumber-dependent way) that the Galerkin solution is quasioptimal independently of the wavenumber, while the $\textit{preasymptotic regime}$ is the complement of the asymptotic regime.
  The results of this paper are the first preasymptotic error bounds for the time-harmonic Maxwell equations using first-type N\'ed\'elec elements or higher-than-lowest-order second-type N\'ed\'elec elements. Furthermore, they are the first wavenumber-explicit results, even in the asymptotic regime, for Maxwell scattering problems with a non-empty scatterer.</description>

Abstract: This paper focuses on studying a model for molecular motors responsible for the bending of the axoneme in the flagella of microorganisms. The model is a coupled system of partial differential equations inspired by J\"ulicher et al. or Camalet, incorporating two rows of molecular motors between microtubules filaments. Existence and uniqueness of a solution is proved, together with the presence of a supercritical Hopf bifurcation. Additionally, numerical simulations are provided to illustrate the theoretical results. A brief study on the generalization to N-rows is also included.</description>

      <title>Riemannian optimisation methods for ground states of multicomponent Bose-Einstein condensates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09617v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the computation of ground states of multicomponent Bose-Einstein condensates, defined as the global minimiser of an energy functional on an infinite-dimensional generalised oblique manifold. We establish the existence of the ground state, prove its uniqueness up to scaling, and characterise it as the solution to a coupled nonlinear eigenvector problem. By equipping the manifold with several Riemannian metrics, we introduce a suite of Riemannian gradient descent and Riemannian Newton methods. Metrics that incorporate first- or second-order information about the energy are particularly advantageous, effectively preconditioning the resulting methods. For a Riemannian gradient descent method with an energy-adaptive metric, we provide a qualitative global and quantitative local convergence analysis, confirming its reliability and robustness with respect to the choice of the spatial discretisation. Numerical experiments highlight the computational efficiency of both the Riemannian gradient descent and Newton methods.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we consider the problem of approximating function evaluations $f(\boldsymbol x_j)$ at given nonequispaced points $\boldsymbol x_j$, $j=1,\dots N$, of a bandlimited function from given values $\hat{f}(\boldsymbol k)$, $\boldsymbol k\in \mathcal I_{\boldsymbol M}$, of its Fourier transform. Note that if a trigonometric polynomial is given, it is already known that this problem can be solved by means of the nonequispaced fast Fourier transform (NFFT). In other words, we introduce a new NFFT-like procedure for bandlimited functions, which is based on regularized Shannon sampling formulas.</description>

      <title>An Improved Adaptive Orthogonal Basis Deflation Method for Multiple Solutions with Applications to Nonlinear Elliptic Equations in Varying Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07624v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multiple solutions are common in various non-convex problems arising from industrial and scientific computing. Nonetheless, understanding the nontrivial solutions' qualitative properties seems limited, partially due to the lack of efficient and reliable numerical methods. In this paper, we design a dedicated numerical method to explore these nontrivial solutions further. We first design an improved adaptive orthogonal basis deflation method by combining the adaptive orthogonal basis method with a bisection-deflation algorithm. We then apply the proposed new method to study the impact of domain changes on multiple solutions of certain nonlinear elliptic equations. When the domain varies from a circular disk to an elliptical disk, the corresponding functional value changes dramatically for some particular solutions, which indicates that these nontrivial solutions in the circular domain may become unstable in the elliptical domain. Moreover, several theoretical results on multiple solutions in existing literature are verified. For the nonlinear Sine-Gordon equation with parameter $\lambda$, nontrivial solutions are found for $\lambda &gt; \lambda_2$, here $\lambda_2$ is the second eigenvalue of the corresponding linear eigenvalue problem. For the singularly perturbed Ginzburg-Landau equation, highly concentrated solutions are numerically found which suggests that their convergent limit is a delta function when the perturbation parameter goes to zero</description>

      <title>Certified Model Order Reduction for parametric Hermitian eigenproblems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02672v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article deals with the efficient and certified numerical approximation of the smallest eigenvalue and the associated eigenspace of a large-scale parametric Hermitian matrix. For this aim, we rely on projection-based model order reduction (MOR), i.e., we approximate the large-scale problem by projecting it onto a suitable subspace and reducing it to one of a much smaller dimension. Such a subspace is constructed by means of weak greedy-type strategies. After detailing the connections with the reduced basis method for source problems, we introduce a novel error estimate for the approximation error related to the eigenspace associated with the smallest eigenvalue. Since the difference between the second smallest and the smallest eigenvalue, the so-called spectral gap, is crucial for the reliability of the error estimate, we propose efficiently computable upper and lower bounds for higher eigenvalues and for the spectral gap, which enable the assembly of a subspace for the MOR approximation of the spectral gap. Based on that, a second subspace is then generated for the MOR approximation of the eigenspace associated with the smallest eigenvalue. We also provide efficiently computable conditions to ensure that the multiplicity of the smallest eigenvalue is fully captured in the reduced space. This work is motivated by a specific application: the repeated identifications of the states with minimal energy, the so-called ground states, of parametric quantum spin system models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09891v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: GMRES is known to determine a least squares solution of $ A x = b $ where $ A \in R^{n \times n} $ without breakdown for arbitrary $ b \in R^n $, and initial iterate $ x_0 \in R^n $ if and only if $ A $ is range-symmetric, i.e. $ R(A^T) = R(A) $, where $ A $ may be singular and $ b $ may not be in the range space $ R(A) $ of $ A $.
  In this paper, we propose applying the Range Restricted GMRES (RRGMRES) to $ A C A^T z = b $, where $ C \in R^{n \times n} $ is symmetric positive definite. This determines a least squares solution $ x = C A^T z $ of $ A x = b $ without breakdown for arbitrary (singular) matrix $ A \in R^{n \times n} $ and $ b, x_0 \in R^n $, and is much more stable and accurate compared to GMRES, RRGMRES and MINRES-QLP applied to $ A x = b $ for inconsistent problems when $ b \notin R(A) $. In particular, we propose applying the NR-SSOR as the inner iteration right preconditioner, which also works efficiently for least squares problems $ \min_{x \in R^n} \| b - A x\|_2 $ for $ A \in R^{m \times n} $ and arbitrary $ b \in R^m $.
  Numerical experiments demonstrate the validity of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Riemannian optimization using three different metrics for Hermitian PSD fixed-rank constraints: an extended version</title>

      <description>arXiv:2204.07830v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For smooth optimization problems with a Hermitian positive semi-definite fixed-rank constraint, we consider three existing approaches including the simple Burer--Monteiro method, and Riemannian optimization over quotient geometry and the embedded geometry. These three methods can be all represented via quotient geometry with three Riemannian metrics $g^i(\cdot, \cdot)$ $(i=1,2,3)$. By taking the nonlinear conjugate gradient method (CG) as an example, we show that CG in the factor-based Burer--Monteiro approach is equivalent to Riemannian CG on the quotient geometry with the Bures-Wasserstein metric $g^1$. Riemannian CG on the quotient geometry with the metric $g^3$ is equivalent to Riemannian CG on the embedded geometry. For comparing the three approaches, we analyze the condition number of the Riemannian Hessian near the minimizer under the three different metrics. Under certain assumptions, the condition number from the Bures-Wasserstein metric $g^1$ is significantly different from the other two metrics.
  Numerical experiments show that the Burer--Monteiro CG method has obviously slower asymptotic convergence rate when the minimizer is rank deficient, which is consistent with the condition number analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.14522v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We characterize the Schr\"odinger bridge problems by a family of Mckean-Vlasov stochastic control problems with no terminal time distribution constraint. In doing so, we use the theory of Hilbert space embeddings of probability measures and then describe the constraint as penalty terms defined by the maximum mean discrepancy in the control problems. A sequence of the probability laws of the state processes resulting from $\epsilon$-optimal controls converges to a unique solution of the Schr\"odinger's problem under mild conditions on given initial and terminal time distributions and an underlying diffusion process. We propose a neural SDE based deep learning algorithm for the Mckean-Vlasov stochastic control problems. Several numerical experiments validate our methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06646v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a Block Majorization Minimization method with Extrapolation (BMMe) for solving a class of multi-convex optimization problems. The extrapolation parameters of BMMe are updated using a novel adaptive update rule. By showing that block majorization minimization can be reformulated as a block mirror descent method, with the Bregman divergence adaptively updated at each iteration, we establish subsequential convergence for BMMe. We use this method to design efficient algorithms to tackle nonnegative matrix factorization problems with the $\beta$-divergences ($\beta$-NMF) for $\beta\in [1,2]$. These algorithms, which are multiplicative updates with extrapolation, benefit from our novel results that offer convergence guarantees. We also empirically illustrate the significant acceleration of BMMe for $\beta$-NMF through extensive experiments.</description>

      <title>Quantum random power method for ground state computation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08556v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a quantum-classical hybrid random power method that approximates a ground state of a Hamiltonian. The quantum part of our method computes a fixed number of elements of a Hamiltonian-matrix polynomial via quantum polynomial filtering techniques with either Hamiltonian simulation or block encoding. The use of the techniques provides a computational advantage that may not be achieved classically in terms of the degree of the polynomial. The classical part of our method is a randomized iterative algorithm that takes as input the matrix elements computed from the quantum part and outputs an approximation of ground state of the Hamiltonian. We prove that with probability one, our method converges to an approximation of a ground state of the Hamiltonian, requiring a constant scaling of the per-iteration classical complexity. The required quantum circuit depth is independent of the initial overlap and has no or a square-root dependence on the spectral gap. The iteration complexity scales linearly as the dimension of the Hilbert space when the quantum polynomial filtering corresponds to a sparse matrix. We numerically validate this sparsity condition for well-known model Hamiltonians. We also present a lower bound of the fidelity, which depends on the magnitude of noise occurring from quantum computation regardless of its charateristics, if it is smaller than a critical value. Several numerical experiments demonstrate that our method provides a good approximation of ground state in the presence of systematic and/or sampling noise.</description>

      <title>Toward end-to-end quantum simulation for protein dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03972v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modeling and simulating the protein folding process overall remains a grand challenge in computational biology. We systematically investigate end-to-end quantum algorithms for simulating various protein dynamics with effects, such as mechanical forces or stochastic noises. A major focus is the read-in of system settings for simulation, for which we discuss (i) efficient quantum algorithms to prepare initial states--whether for ensemble or single-state simulations, in particular, the first efficient procedure for preparing Gaussian pseudo-random amplitude states, and (ii) the first efficient loading of the connectivity matrices of the protein structure. For the read-out stage, our algorithms estimate a range of classical observables, including energy, low-frequency vibrational modes, density of states, displacement correlations, and optimal control parameters. Between these stages, we simulate the dynamic evolution of the protein system, by using normal mode models--such as Gaussian network models (GNM) and all-atom normal mode models. In addition, we conduct classical numerical experiments focused on accurately estimating the density of states and applying optimal control to facilitate conformational changes. These experiments serve to validate our claims regarding potential quantum speedups. Overall, our study demonstrates that quantum simulation of protein dynamics represents a robust, end-to-end application for both early-stage and fully fault-tolerant quantum computing.</description>

      <title>A novel numerical method tailored for unconstrained optimization problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02832v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unconstrained optimization problems become more common in scientific computing and engineering applications with the rapid development of artificial intelligence, and numerical methods for solving them more quickly and efficiently have been getting more attention and research. Moreover, an efficient method to minimize all kinds of objective functions is urgently needed, especially the nonsmooth objective function. Therefore, in the current paper, we focus on proposing a novel numerical method tailored for unconstrained optimization problems whether the objective function is smooth or not. To be specific, based on the variational procedure to refine the gradient and Hessian matrix approximations, an efficient quadratic model with $2n$ constrained conditions is established. Moreover, to improve the computational efficiency, a simplified model with 2 constrained conditions is also proposed, where the gradient and Hessian matrix can be explicitly updated, and the corresponding boundedness of the remaining $2n-2$ constrained conditions is derived. On the other hand, the novel numerical method is summarized, and approximation results on derivative information are also analyzed and shown. Numerical experiments involving smooth, derivative blasting, and non-smooth problems are tested, demonstrating its feasibility and efficiency. Compared with existing methods, our proposed method can efficiently solve smooth and non-smooth unconstrained optimization problems for the first time, and it is very easy to program the code, indicating that our proposed method not also has great application prospects, but is also very meaningful to explore practical complex engineering and scientific problems.</description>
