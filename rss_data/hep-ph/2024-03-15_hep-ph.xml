      <title>Moments of Clarity: Streamlining Latent Spaces in Machine Learning using Moment Pooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many machine learning applications involve learning a latent representation of data, which is often high-dimensional and difficult to directly interpret. In this work, we propose "Moment Pooling", a natural extension of Deep Sets networks which drastically decrease latent space dimensionality of these networks while maintaining or even improving performance. Moment Pooling generalizes the summation in Deep Sets to arbitrary multivariate moments, which enables the model to achieve a much higher effective latent dimensionality for a fixed latent dimension. We demonstrate Moment Pooling on the collider physics task of quark/gluon jet classification by extending Energy Flow Networks (EFNs) to Moment EFNs. We find that Moment EFNs with latent dimensions as small as 1 perform similarly to ordinary EFNs with higher latent dimension. This small latent dimension allows for the internal representation to be directly visualized and interpreted, which in turn enables the learned internal jet representation to be extracted in closed form.</description>

      <title>TMDs from Semi-inclusive Energy Correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel category of observables known as the Semi-Inclusive Energy Correlators (SIECs), an extension of the recently proposed nucleon energy correlator to integrate a new element, the fragmenting energy correlation function. These SIECs gauge the correlation between the examined hadron and the surrounding radiations, providing a comprehensive tomography of the radiative patterns originating from initial state radiation or parton fragmentation. As such, they could function as the generating functions for numerous kinematic distributions. To illustrate, we find a direct relation between the transverse momentum moments (TMMs) of the transverse momentum-dependent (TMD) distributions and the SIECs. We demonstrate how the TMMs of the TMD parton distributions and the fragmentation functions can be distinctively derived from the nucleon energy correlator and the fragmenting energy correlator, respectively, without enforcing the back-to-back kinematics.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vortex states of particles - non-plane-wave solutions of the corresponding wave equation with a helicoidal wave front - open new opportunities for particle physics, unavailable in plane wave scattering. Here we demonstrate that $p\bar p$ annihilation with a vortex proton and antiproton provides access to the phase of proton electromagnetic form factors even in unpolarized scattering.</description>

      <title>Hybrid analysis of radiative corrections to neutron decay with current algebra and effective field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a useful framework for high-precision studies of the neutron beta decay by merging the current algebra description and the fixed-order effective field theory calculation of the electroweak radiative corrections to the neutron axial form factor. We discuss the advantages of this hybrid method and show that it only requires a minimal amount of lattice QCD inputs to achieve a $10^{-4}$ theory accuracy for the Standard Model prediction of the neutron lifetime and the axial-to-vector coupling ratio $\lambda$, both important to the search for physics beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Probe of Gravitational Dark Matter from Preheating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following our previous studies on gravitational dark matter (GDM) production in the early Universe of preheating,we forecast high-frequency gravitational wave (GW) spectra as the indirect probe of such GDM. We use proper lattice simulations to handle the resonance,and to solve the GW equation of motion with resonance induced scalar field excitations as the source term.Our numerical results show that the Higgs scalar excitations in the Higgs preheating model give rise to magnitudes of GW energy density spectra of order $10^{-10}$ at frequencies $10-10^{3}$ MHz, whereas the inflaton fluctuation excitations in the inflaton self-resonant preheating model yield magnitudes of GW energy density spectrum up to $10^{-9}~(10^{-11})$ at frequencies near $30~(2)$ MHz for the index $n=4~(6)$.</description>

      <title>Effect of torsion in long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we investigate the effect of curved spacetime on neutrino oscillation. In a curved spacetime, the effect of curvature on fermionic fields is represented by spin connection. The spin connection consists of a non-universal ``contorsion" part which is expressed in terms of vector and axial current density of fermions. The contraction of contorsion part with the tetrad fields, which connects the internal flat space metric and the spacetime metric, is called torsion. In a scenario where neutrino travels through background of fermionic matter at ordinary densities in a curved spacetime, the Hamiltonian of neutrino oscillation gets modified by the torsional coupling constants $\lambda_{21}^{\prime}$ and $\lambda_{31}^{\prime}$. The aim of this work is to study the effect of $\lambda_{21}^{\prime}$ and $\lambda_{31}^{\prime}$ in DUNE and P2SO. In our study we, (i) discuss the effect of torsional coupling constants on the neutrino oscillation probabilities, (ii) estimate the capability of P2SO and DUNE to put bounds on these parameters and (iii) study how the physics sensitivities get modified in presence of torsion.</description>

      <title>Probing Gauge-Higgs Unification models at the ILC with di-quark forward-backward asymmetry at center-of-mass energies above the $Z$ mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The International Linear Collider (ILC) will allow the precise study of $e^{-}e^{+}\rightarrow q\bar{q}$ interactions at different center-of-mass energies from the $Z$-pole to 1 TeV. In this paper, we discuss the experimental prospects for measuring differential observables in $e^{-}e^{+}\rightarrow b\bar{b}$ and $e^{-}e^{+}\rightarrow c\bar{c}$ at the ILC baseline energies, 250 and 500 GeV. The study is based on full simulation and reconstruction of the International Large Detector (ILD) concept. Two gauge-Higgs unification models predicting new high-mass resonances beyond the Standard Model are discussed. These models predict sizable deviations of the forward-backward observables at the ILC running above the $Z$ mass and with longitudinally polarized electron and positron beams. The ability of the ILC to probe these models via high-precision measurements of the forward-backward asymmetry is discussed. Alternative scenarios at other energies and beam polarization schemes are also discussed, extrapolating the estimated uncertainties from the two baseline scenarios.</description>

      <title>Improved Constraints on the Variation of the Weak Scale from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the recent EMPRESS data on the $^4$He abundance in Big Bang nucleosynthesis as a function of the Higgs vacuum expectation value $v$ and compare our calculation to the recently published work of Burns et al.~[1]. The EMPRESS result for the $^4$He abundance can be explained within $2\sigma$ by $0.03 \leq \delta v / v \leq 0.07$. However, as first noted in~[1], a Higgs VEV in this range would worsen the discrepancy between theory and experiment for the deuterium abundance significantly.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity to sub-GeV dark matter from cosmic-ray scattering with very-high-energy gamma-ray observatories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Huge efforts have been deployed to detect dark matter (DM) in the GeV-TeV mass range involving various detection techniques, and led to strong constraints in the available parameter space. We compute here the sensitivity to sub-GeV DM that can be probed from the inevitable cosmic-ray scattering onto DM particles populating the Milky Way halo. Inelastic scattering of energetic cosmic rays off DM would produce high-energy gamma rays in the final state, providing a new avenue to probe the poorly-constrained so far sub-GeV dark matter mass range. In this work we derive sensitivity forecasts for the inelastic cosmic-ray proton - DM cross section for current and future very-high-energy gamma-ray observatories such as H.E.S.S., LHAASO, CTA and SWGO in the 100 eV to 100 MeV mass range. These inelastic cross section constraints are converted to the elastic proton - DM cross section to highlight further complementarity with cosmological, collider and direct detection searches. The sensitivity computed at 95\% confidence level on the elastic cross section reaches $\sim$2$\times$ 10$^{-32}$ cm$^2$ for a 100 keV DM mass for H.E.S.S.-like and $\sim$7$\times$ 10$^{-34}$ cm$^2$ for a $\sim$1 keV DM mass for LHAASO. The sensitivity prospects for CTA and a strawman SWGO model reach $\sim$6$\times$ 10$^{-34}$ cm$^2$ and $\sim$4$\times$ 10$^{-35}$ cm$^2$, for DM masses of 10 keV and 1 keV, respectively. The sensitivity reach of the gamma-ray observatories considered here enables to probe an uncharted region of the DM mass - cross section parameter space.</description>

      <title>PeV-Scale SUSY and Cosmic Strings from F-term Hybrid Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider F-term hybrid inflation (FHI) and SUSY breaking in the context of a B-L extension of MSSM which largely respects a global U(1) R symmetry. The hidden sector Kaehler manifold enjoys an enhanced SU(1,1)/U(1) symmetry with the scalar curvature determined by the achievement of a SUSY-breaking de Sitter vacuum without ugly tuning. FHI turns out to be consistent with data, provided that the magnitude of the emergent soft tadpole term is confined in the range (1.2-100) TeV, and it is accompanied with the production of B-L cosmic strings. If these are metastable they interpret the present observations from PTA experiments on the stochastic background of gravitational waves with dimensionless tension Gmu~(1-9.2)x10^-8. The mu parameter of MSSM arises by appropriately adapting the Giudice-Masiero mechanism and facilitates the out-of-equilibrium decay of the R saxion at a reheat temperature lower than about 71 GeV. Due to the prolonged matter dominated era the gravitational wave signal is suppressed at high frequencies. The SUSY mass scale turns out to lie in the PeV region.</description>

      <title>Exploring the lepton flavor violating decay modes $b \to s \mu ^{\pm} \tau ^{\mp}$ in SMEFT approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform an analysis of the consequences of various new physics operators on the lepton flavor violating (LFV) decay modes mediated through $b \to s \ell _1 \ell _2$ transitions. We scrutinize the imprints of the (pseudo)scalar and axial(vector) operators on the exclusive LFV decay channels $ B_{(s)} \rightarrow (\phi, K^{*}, K_{2}^{*})\ell_{1}\ell_{2}$ and $\Lambda_{b}\rightarrow \Lambda \ell_{1}\ell_{2}$, where $\ell_{1}, \ell_{2}$ represent $\mu$ or $\tau$. The new physics parameters are constrained by using the upper limits of the branching fractions of the $B \to \tau \mu$ and $B \to K \tau \mu$ processes, assuming the new physics couplings to be real. We then explore the key observables such as the branching fraction, the forward-backward asymmetry, and the longitudinal polarisation fraction of the $B \to (K^*, \phi, K_2^*) \tau ^{\pm} \mu ^{\mp}$ decays. In addition, we also investigate the impact of the new physics couplings on the baryonic $\Lambda _b \to \Lambda \tau ^{\pm} \mu ^{\mp}$ decay channels mediated by the $b \to s$ quark level transition. With the experimental prospects at LHCb upgrade and Belle II, we also predict the upper limits of the above-discussed observables, which could intrigue the new physics search in these channels.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How to describe loop corrections is a fundamental challenge in the quantization of Einstein gravity. In this paper, we give it a try in UV-free scheme, and the result seems to be effective for graviton loops. This indicates that both loops of the renormalizable Standard Model and the non-renormalizable Einstein gravity can be described by the method of UV-free scheme.</description>

      <title>The study of weak decays of doubly charmed baryons within rescattering mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The doubly charmed baryon $\Xi_{cc}^{++}$ has been observed by LHCb through the non-leptonic decay modes of $\Xi_{cc}^{++}\to\Lambda_{c}^{+}K^{-}\pi^{+}\pi^{+}$ and $\Xi_{c}^{+}\pi^{+}$ in 2017. After that, the experimentalists turn their attention to finding other doubly charmed baryons $\Xi_{cc}^{+}$ and $\Omega_{cc}^{+}$. In this work, we investigate the nonleptonic weak decays of doubly charmed baryons ${\cal B}_{cc}\to{\cal B}_{c}P$, where ${\cal B}_{cc}$ denotes the doubly charmed baryons $(\Xi_{cc}^{++},\Xi_{cc}^{+},\Omega_{cc}^{+})$, ${\cal B}_{c}$ represents the singly charmed baryons $({\cal B}_{\bar{3}},{\cal B}_{6})$ and $P$ is the light pseudoscalar. For these non-leptonic decay modes, their short-distance contributions can be accurately estimated in theoretical calculations. However, dealing with the long-distance contributions for final-state-interaction effects is challenging. To address this, we use the rescattering mechanism to calculate the long-distance contributions and first derive the whole hadronic loop contributions for these two-body nonleptonic decays of doubly charmed baryons. Then the decay widths and branching ratios of the 45 nonleptonic decays of doubly charmed baryon are predicted. Among that, the ratio of the branching ratios ${\cal RB}=\frac{{\cal B}(\Xi_{cc}^{++}\to\Xi_{c}^{\prime+}\pi^{+})}{{\cal B}(\Xi_{cc}^{++}\to\Xi_{c}^{+}\pi^{+})}=1.15\pm0.45$ is consistent with the experimental results within statistical errors.</description>

      <title>Cosmologically Consistent Analysis of Gravitational Waves from hidden sectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Production of gravitational waves in the early universe is discussed in a cosmologically consistent analysis within a first order phase transition involving a hidden sector feebly coupled with the visible sector. Each sector resides in its own heat bath leading to a potential dependent on two temperatures, and on two fields: one a standard model Higgs and the other a scalar arising from a hidden sector $U(1)$ gauge theory. A synchronous evolution of the hidden and visible sector temperatures is carried out from the reheat temperature down to the electroweak scale.The hydrodynamics of two-field phase transitions, one for the visible and the other for the hidden is discussed, which leads to separate tunneling temperatures, and different sound speeds for the two sectors. Gravitational waves emerging from the two sectors are computed and their imprint on the measured gravitational wave power spectrum vs frequency is analyzed in terms of bubble nucleation signature, i.e., detonation, deflagration, and hybrid. It is shown that the two-field model predicts gravitational waves accessible at several proposed gravitational wave detectors: LISA, DECIGO, BBO, Taiji and their discovery would probe specific regions of the hidden sector parameter space and may also shed light on the nature of bubble nucleation in the early universe. The analysis presented here indicates that the cosmologically preferred models are those where the tunneling in the visible sector precedes the tunneling in the hidden sector and the sound speed $c_s$ lies below its maximum, i.e., $c^2_s&lt;\frac{1}{3}$. It is of interest to investigate if these features are universal and applicable to a wider class of cosmologically consistent models.</description>

      <title>Measuring the molecular Migdal effect with neutron scattering on diatomic gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Migdal effect is a key inelastic signal channel which could be used to detect low-mass dark matter, but it has never been observed experimentally using Standard Model probes. Here we propose an experiment which could detect the Migdal effect in diatomic molecules through low-energy neutron scattering. The enhancement of the Migdal rate through non-adiabatic couplings, which are absent in isolated atoms, combined with the distinctive photon energies of electronic transitions in CO, suggest that a positive detection of the molecular Migdal effect may be possible with modest beam times at existing neutron facilities.</description>

      <title>Compton scattering from superstrings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a candidate Compton amplitude which is valid for any (integer) quantum spin and free from any spurious poles. We consider the cases of electromagnetism and gravity. We obtain such amplitudes by calculating the corresponding ones from superstring theory involving states on the leading Regge trajectory. To extract the associated field-theory amplitudes a few considerations in the form of simple physical constraints are required, such as: Soft momentum transfer, compactification of polarizations and consistent factorization in the physical channels. We believe the present exploration will be significantly relevant for the physics of compact binary systems with spin.</description>

      <title>Observation and differential cross section measurement of neutral current DIS events with an empty hemisphere in the Breit frame</title>

Abstract: The Breit frame provides a natural frame to analyze lepton-proton scattering events. In this reference frame, the parton model hard interactions between a quark and an exchanged boson defines the coordinate system such that the struck quark is back-scattered along the virtual photon momentum direction. In Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), higher order perturbative or non-perturbative effects can change this picture drastically. As Bjorken-$x$ decreases below one half, a rather peculiar event signature is predicted with increasing probability, where no radiation is present in one of the two Breit-frame hemispheres and all emissions are to be found in the other hemisphere. At higher orders in $\alpha_s$ or in the presence of soft QCD effects, predictions of the rate of these events are far from trivial, and that motivates measurements with real data. We report on the first observation of the empty current hemisphere events in electron-proton collisions at the HERA collider using data recorded with the H1 detector at a center-of-mass energy of 319 GeV. The fraction of inclusive neutral-current DIS events with an empty hemisphere is found to be $0.0112 \pm 3.9\,\%_\text{stat} \pm 4.5\,\%_\text{syst} \pm 1.6\,\%_\text{mod}$ in the selected kinematic region of $150&lt; Q^2&lt;1500$ GeV$^2$ and inelasticity $0.14&lt; y&lt;0.7$. The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 351.1 pb$^{-1}$, sufficient to enable differential cross section measurements of these events. The results show an enhanced discriminating power at lower Bjorken-$x$ among different Monte Carlo event generator predictions.</description>

      <title>Condensate-Induced Inflation from Primordial Gravitational Waves in String-Inspired Chern-Simons Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we elaborate further on a cosmological model of inflation that characterises Chern-Simons (CS) gravity models inspired from string theory. Such models are known to belong to the class of the so-called String-Inspired Running Vacuum Cosmologies. In particular, by applying methods of dynamical systems, commonly used in scalar-field cosmology, we examine in detail, for the first time, the passage from a pre-inflationary era dominated by a stiff-axion-matter equation of state, characteristic of the model, to inflation of Running Vacuum Model (RVM) type. By a careful discussion of the formation of the condensate of the CS gravitational anomaly term, induced by populations of primordial gravitational waves at the end of the stiff-axion-matter era, we show that an effectively linear axion-monodromy potential arises. This eventually causes the transition from the matter to the RVM inflation. By taking into account terms that have previously been ignored in the relevant literature of weak-graviton quantisation, we show that the effect of such terms is to diminish the value of the condensate by half, remaining however in the same order of magnitude. This, in turn, implies that the qualitative conclusions of previous works on the subject remain valid. Moreover, on assuming the approximate cosmic-time independence of the gravitational-CS condensate, we also provide an estimate of the number of sources of the primordial gravitational waves, upon the requirement of respecting the transplanckian conjecture.</description>

      <title>Imaging a semi-classical horizonless compact object with strong redshift</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent advancements in black hole imaging have opened a new era of probing horizon-scale physics with electromagnetic radiation. However, a feature of the observed images, a bright ring encircling a relatively dark region, has not sufficiently proved the existence of event horizons. It thus requires extreme care when studying the possibility of using such image features to examine quantum effects that may change the classical picture of black holes slightly or drastically. In this work, we investigate the image of a horizonless compact object, whose interior metric satisfies the 4D semi-classical Einstein equation non-perturbatively for the Planck constant, and whose entropy agrees with the Bekenstein-Hawking formula. Although the absence of an event horizon allows light rays to pass through the dense interior, the extremely strong redshift significantly darkens the image, making it almost identical to the classical black-hole image. In particular, if there is light emission a bit inside the surface of the object, the intensity around the inner shadow is slightly enhanced, which could be a future observable prediction to characterize the object. We also find through a phenomenological parameter that the image is further darkened due to interactions inside. Thus, the image is consistent with current observations, and the object could be a candidate for black holes in quantum theory.</description>

      <title>Curvature of the chiral phase transition line from the magnetic equation of state of (2+1)-flavor QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the dependence of the chiral phase transition temperature on baryon number and strangeness chemical potentials by calculating the leading order curvature coefficients in the light and strange quark flavor basis as well as in the conserved charge ($B, S$) basis. Making use of scaling properties of the magnetic equation of state (MEoS) and including diagonal as well as off-diagonal contributions in the expansion of the energy-like scaling variable that enters the parametrization of the MEoS, allows to explore the variation of $T_c(\mu_B,\mu_S) = T_c ( 1 - (\kappa_2^B \hat{\mu}_B^2 + \kappa_2^S \hat{\mu}_S^2 + 2\kappa_{11}^{BS} \hat{\mu}_B \hat{\mu}_S))$ along different lines in the $(\mu_B,\mu_S)$ plane. On lattices with fixed cut-off in units of temperature, $aT=1/8$, we find $\kappa_2^B=0.015(1)$, $\kappa_2^S=0.0124(5)$ and $\kappa_{11}^{BS}=-0.0050(7)$. We show that the chemical potential dependence along the line of vanishing strangeness chemical potential is about 10\% larger than along the strangeness neutral line. The latter differs only by about $3\%$ from the curvature on a line of vanishing strange quark chemical potential, $\mu_s=0$. We also show that close to the chiral limit the strange quark mass contributes like an energy-like variable in scaling relations for pseudo-critical temperatures. The chiral phase transition temperature decreases with decreasing strange quark mass, $T_c(m_s)= T_c(m_s^{\rm phy}) (1 - 0.097(2) (m_s-m_s^{\rm phys})/m_s^{\rm phy}+{\cal O}((\Delta m_s)^2)$.</description>

      <title>Detecting the third family of compact stars with normalizing flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the anomaly detection framework based on Normalizing Flows (NF) models introduced in \cite{PhysRevC.106.065802} to detect the presence of a large (destabilising) dense matter phase transition in neutron star (NS) observations of masses and radii, and relate the feasibility of detection with parameters of the underlying mass-radius sequence, which is a functional of the dense matter equation of state. Once trained on simulated data featuring continuous $M(R)$ solutions (i.e., no phase transitions), NF is used to determine the likelihood of a first-order phase transition in a given set of $M(R)$ observations featuring a discontinuity, i.e., perform the anomaly detection. Different mock test sets, featuring two branch solutions in the $M(R)$ diagram, were parameterized by the NS mass at which the phase transition occurs, $M_c$, and the radius difference between the heaviest hadronic star and lightest hybrid star, $\Delta R$. We analyze the impact of these parameters on the NF performance in detecting the presence of a first-order phase transition. Among the results, we report that given a set of 15 stars with radius uncertainty of $0.2$ km, a detection of a two-branch solution is possible with 95\% accuracy if $\Delta R &gt; 0.4$ km.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that if there are conserved flavor symmetries then some properties of a monopole can depend on $\theta$ even when a fermion is massless. The quantized nature of global symmetries and the fractional nature of the Witten effect can lead to interesting structure. Seen from another point of view, aside from possibly breaking baryon and lepton flavor symmetries (the Callan-Rubakov effect), monopole boundary conditions can also break the axial symmetry that otherwise could have been used to remove $\theta$ from the Lagrangian. As an example, in a toy model, we calculate the $\theta$ dependence of the mass of the monopole and properties of the non-zero charge density surrounding the monopole.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extending our previous work in pure Yang-Mills (YM) theory, we compute the generating functional of correlators of collinear twist-$2$ operators that enter the components of balanced superfields -- i.e., superfields with an equal number of dotted and undotted indices in their spinor representation -- in $\mathcal{N} = 1$ SUSY SU($N$) YM theory in Minkowskian and Euclidean space-time, in the conformal limit and renormalization-group improved form, and to the leading and next-to-leading order in the large-$N$ expansion. The latter calculation sets strong UV asymptotic constraints on the nonperturbative solution of large-$N$ $\mathcal{N} = 1$ SUSY YM theory that may be a pivotal guide for the search of such a solution.</description>

Abstract: In this study, computational analysis of neutral Higgs bosons $h$, $H$ and $A$ is carried out within the parameter space of Two Higgs Doublet Model (2HDM) type-I in exact alignment limit of $\sin{(\beta - \alpha)} = 1$ at compact linear collider. Assuming Compact Linear Collider (CLIC) scenario where the electron-positron beams will be collided at $\sqrt{s}$ = 1.5 TeV. Two different values of predicted integrated luminosities are used in our calculations, 1000 $fb^{-1}$ and 2500 $fb^{-1}$. Three signal processes $e^+ e^- \rightarrow Zhh \rightarrow jjb\bar{b}b\bar{b}$, $e^+ e^- \rightarrow ZHH \rightarrow jjb\bar{b}b\bar{b}$ and $e^+ e^- \rightarrow Zhh \rightarrow jjb\bar{b}b\bar{b}$ are selected for analysis. The polarized colliding beams are used to enhance the signal production cross-section. Low $\tan{\beta}$ and equal Higgs masses regime is chosen in favor of Hadronic decay of $Z$ boson and $H \rightarrow b\bar{b}$. Different signal scenarios are selected and event generation is performed for each process separately. The $W$ and $Z$ boson, as well as top quark backgrounds are analyzed. Signal significance is computed at each Higgs mass hypothesis for three signal processes. After a comprehensive study, we did not find sizeable amount of signal events on top of the background but still, signal significance is found to be larger than 1, without taking into account the detector effects and systematics. The maximum calculated value of signal significance is observed to lie in the range of 150 $\leq$ $m_H$ $\leq$ 250 GeV for $Zhh$ while for $ZHH$ the range is 175 $\leq$ $m_H$ $\leq$ 200 GeV at 1000 $fb^{-1}$ and 175 $\leq$ $m_H$ $\leq$ 225 GeV region at 2500 $fb^{-1}$. Similarly, for $ZAA$ process, the significance is highest at $m_A$ = 175 GeV for both 1000 and 2500 $fb^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Disoriented isospin condensates may be the source of anomalous kaon correlations measured in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 2.76$ TeV</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.13280v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The magnitude of fluctuations between charged and neutral kaons measured by the ALICE Collaboration in heavy-ion collisions at the LHC exceeds conventional explanation. Here it is shown that if the scalar condensate, which is typically associated with chiral symmetry, is accompanied by an isospin=1 field, then the combination can produce large fluctuations where $\langle \bar{u}u\rangle \ne \langle \bar{d}d\rangle$. Hadronizing strange and anti-strange quarks might then strongly fluctuate between charged ($u\bar{s}$ or $s\bar{u}$) and neutral ($d\bar{s}$ or $s\bar{d}$) kaons.</description>

      <title>The Interplay of Machine Learning--based Resonant Anomaly Detection Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.11157v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning--based anomaly detection (AD) methods are promising tools for extending the coverage of searches for physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM). One class of AD methods that has received significant attention is resonant anomaly detection, where the BSM is assumed to be localized in at least one known variable. While there have been many methods proposed to identify such a BSM signal that make use of simulated or detected data in different ways, there has not yet been a study of the methods' complementarity. To this end, we address two questions. First, in the absence of any signal, do different methods pick the same events as signal-like? If not, then we can significantly reduce the false-positive rate by comparing different methods on the same dataset. Second, if there is a signal, are different methods fully correlated? Even if their maximum performance is the same, since we do not know how much signal is present, it may be beneficial to combine approaches. Using the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) Olympics dataset, we provide quantitative answers to these questions. We find that there are significant gains possible by combining multiple methods, which will strengthen the search program at the LHC and beyond.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.11418v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study utilizes the double copy relation to derive on-shell gravity as product of gauge fields in Anti-de Sitter(AdS)space. Comparing with its corresponding conformal field theory (CFT) gauge field, we establish a unique connection between CFT gauge field and another gauge field in on-shell AdS space, and confirmed it as a strong-weak correspondence having associated thermodynamic properties. Also, it provides gravity theory coupling to a tensor field instead of a scalar field, to be more complex but perhaps more accurate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.04117v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a scenario in which dark matter particles are accelerated to semi-relativistic velocities through their scattering with the Diffuse Supernova Neutrino Background. Such a subdominant, but more energetic dark matter component can be then detected via its scattering on the electrons and nucleons inside direct detection experiments. This opens up the possibility to probe the sub-GeV mass range, a region of parameter space that is usually not accessible at such facilities. We analyze current data from the XENONnT and LUX-ZEPLIN experiments and we obtain novel constraints on the scattering cross sections of sub-GeV boosted dark matter with both nucleons and electrons. We also highlight the importance of carefully taking into account Earth's attenuation effects as well as the finite nuclear size into the analysis. By comparing our results to other existing constraints, we show that these effects lead to improved and more robust constraints.</description>

      <title>BFBrain: Scalar Bounded-From-Below Conditions from Bayesian Active Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10959v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a procedure leveraging Bayesian deep active learning to rapidly produce highly accurate approximate bounded-from-below conditions for arbitrary renormalizable scalar potentials, in the form of a neural network which may be saved and exported for use in arbitrary parameter space scans. We explore the performance of our procedure on three different scalar potentials with either highly nontrivial or unknown symbolic bounded-from-below conditions (the two-Higgs doublet model, the three-Higgs doublet model, and a version of the Georgi-Machacek model without custodial symmetry). We find that we can produce fast and highly accurate binary classifiers for all three potentials. Furthermore, for the potentials for which no known symbolic necessary and sufficient conditions on boundedness-from-below exist, our classifiers substantially outperform some common approximate analytical methods, such as producing tractable sufficient but not necessary conditions or evaluating boundedness-from-below conditions for scenarios in which only a subset of the theory's fields achieve vev's. Our methodology can be readily adapted to any renormalizable scalar field theory. For the community's use, we have developed a Python package, BFBrain, which allows for the rapid implementation of our analysis procedure on user-specified scalar potentials with a high degree of customizability.</description>

      <title>Third order correction to semileptonic $b\to u$ decay: fermionic contributions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.03685v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the QCD corrections of order $\alpha_s^3$ to the decay rate of $b \to u \ell \bar \nu_\ell$, with $\ell = e,\mu$, originating from diagrams with closed fermion loops and neglecting the mass of the up quark. Our calculation relies on integration-by-parts reduction of Feynman integrals with one propagator raised to a symbolic power in Kira and the numerical evaluation of master integrals with AMFlow. This allows us to obtain results for the fermionic contributions to the total semileptonic rate with an accuracy of more than thirty digits.</description>

      <title>Electron EDM and LFV decays in the light of Muon $(g-2)_\mu$ with U(2) flavor symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16325v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the interplay of New Physics (NP) among the lepton magnetic moment, the lepton flavor violation (LFV) and the electron electric dipole moment (EDM) in light of recent data of the muon $(g-2)_\mu$. The NP is discussed in the leptonic dipole operator with the $U(2)$ flavor symmetry of the charged leptons, where possible CP violating phases of the three family space are taken into account. It is remarked that the third-family contributes significantly to the LFV decay, $\mu \to e\gamma$, and the electron EDM. The experimental upper-bound on $\mu \to e\gamma$ decay gives a severe constraint on the parameters of the flavor model. The predicted electron EDM is rather large due to the CP violating phases in the three family space. In addition, we also study $(g-2)_{e,\tau}$ of the electron and tauon, and EDMs of the muon and tauon as well as the $\tau \to e \gamma$ and $\tau \to \mu \gamma$ decays. The $\tau_R \to \mu_L \gamma$ decay is predicted to be close to the experimental upper-bound.</description>

      <title>Constraints on metastable superheavy dark matter coupled to sterile neutrinos with the Pierre Auger Observatory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14541v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dark matter particles could be superheavy, provided their lifetime is much longer than the age of the universe. Using the sensitivity of the Pierre Auger Observatory to ultra-high energy neutrinos and photons, we constrain a specific extension of the Standard Model of particle physics that meets the lifetime requirement for a superheavy particle by coupling it to a sector of ultra-light sterile neutrinos. Our results show that, for a typical dark coupling constant of 0.1, the mixing angle $\theta_m$ between active and sterile neutrinos must satisfy, roughly, $\theta_m \lesssim 1.5\times 10^{-6}(M_X/10^9~\mathrm{GeV})^{-2}$ for a mass $M_X$ of the dark-matter particle between $10^8$ and $10^{11}~$GeV.</description>

      <title>Fresh look at the LHC limits on scalar leptoquarks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09855v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The scalar-leptoquark (sLQ) parameter space is well explored experimentally. The direct pair production searches at the LHC have excluded light sLQs almost model agnostically, and the high-$p_{\rm T}$ dilepton tail data have put strong bounds on the leptoquark-quark-lepton Yukawa couplings for a wide range of sLQ masses. However, these do not show the complete picture. Previously, Mandal \emph{et al.} [Single productions of colored particles at the LHC: An example with scalar leptoquarks, \href{https://doi.org/10.1007/JHEP07(2015)028}{J. High Energy Phys. 07 (2015) 028}] showed how the dilepton-dijet data from the pair production searches could give strong limits on these couplings. This was possible by including the single-production contribution to the dilepton-dijet signal. In this paper, we take a fresh look at the LHC limits on all sLQs by following the same principle and combine all significant contributions -- from pair and single productions, $t$-channel sLQ exchange and its interference with the Standard Model background -- to the $\mu\mu jj$ final state and recast the limits. We notice that the sLQ exchange and its interference with the background processes play significant roles in the limits. The $\mu\mu jj$-recast limits are comparable to or, in some cases, significantly better than the currently known limits (from high-$p_{\rm T}$ dilepton data and direct searches), i.e., the LHC data rules out more parameter space than what is considered in the current literature. For the first time, we also show how including the QED processes can noticeably improve the sLQ mass exclusion limits from the QCD-only limits.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from supercooled phase transitions: dimensional transmutation meets dimensional reduction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12413v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Models with radiative symmetry breaking typically feature strongly supercooled first-order phase transitions, which result in an observable stochastic gravitational wave background. In this work, we analyse the role of higher order thermal corrections for these transitions, applying high-temperature dimensional reduction to a theory with dimensional transmutation. In particular, we study to what extent high-temperature effective field theories (3D EFT) can be used. We find that despite significant supercooling down from the critical temperature, the high-temperature expansion for the bubble nucleation rate can be applied using the 3D EFT framework, and we point out challenges in the EFT description. We compare our findings to previous studies, and find that the next-to-leading order corrections obtained in this work have a significant effect on the predictions for GW observables, motivating a further exploration of higher order thermal effects.</description>

Abstract: Dark matter can be boosted by high energy particles in astrophysical environments through elastic scattering. We study the production of boosted dark matter via scattering with electrons in the relativistic jet of the closest active galactic nucleus, Centaurus A, and its detection in the Super-Kamiokande experiment. Since there are a huge number of electrons in the jet and dark matter is extremely dense around the supermassive black hole that powers the jet, the number of boosted dark matter is tremendously large. Compared to boosted dark matter from blazars, the dark matter flux from Centaurus A is enhanced due to the proximity of Centaurus A. The constraint on dark matter-electron scattering cross section set by Super-Kamiokande is more stringent, down to $\sim 10^{-36} \, \mathrm{cm}^2$ for $\mathrm{MeV}$ dark matter.</description>

      <title>Criterion for ultra-fast bubble walls: the impact of hydrodynamic obstruction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05911v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The B\"{o}deker-Moore thermal friction is usually used to determine whether or not a bubble wall can run away. However, the friction on the wall is not necessarily a monotonous function of the wall velocity and could have a maximum before it reaches the B\"{o}deker-Moore limit. In this paper, we compare the maximal hydrodynamic obstruction, a frictional force that exists in local thermal equilibrium, and the B\"{o}deker-Moore thermal friction. We study the former in a fully analytical way, clarifying its physical origin and providing a simple expression for its corresponding critical phase transition strength above which the driving force cannot be balanced out by the maximal hydrodynamic obstruction. We find that for large parameter space, the maximal hydrodynamic obstruction is larger than the B\"{o}deker-Moore thermal friction, indicating that the conventional criterion for the runaway behavior of the bubble wall may have to be modified. We also explain how to apply efficiently the modified criterion to particle physics models and discuss possible limitations of the analysis carried out in this paper.</description>

      <title>Hidden-Bottom Pentaquarks: Mass Spectrum, Magnetic Moments and Partial Widths</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14885v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By taking into light the discovery of pentaquark structures like $P_{\psi s}^\Lambda(4338)^0$, $P_c(4380)$ and $P_c(4450)$, we performed the spectroscopy of hidden-bottom pentaquarks. By utilizing special unitary representations, we systematically classified the hidden bottom pentaquarks into two distinct configurations within the SU(3) flavor representation: the octet and decuplet. In this study, we employed an extended version of the GR mass formula along with the effective mass scheme to provide estimations of the masses associated with hidden-bottom pentaquarks. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to estimate the magnetic moments using the effective mass scheme and screened charge scheme. Moreover, by employing the effective Lagrangian, we computed the partial widths for the octet configuration. This comprehensive analysis offers crucial insights into the decay mechanisms and lifetimes of these exotic particles, enhancing our understanding of their fundamental properties. Our findings, which include calculations of masses and magnetic moments, demonstrate reasonable agreement with existing theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>Deciphering the Belle II data on $B\to K \nu \bar\nu$ decay in the (dark) SMEFT with minimal flavour violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19208v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, the Belle II collaboration announced the first measurement of $\mathcal B(B^+\to K^+\nu\bar\nu)$, which is found to be about $2.7\sigma$ higher than the SM prediction. We decipher the data with two new physics scenarios: the underlying $b\to s \nu\bar\nu$ transition is, besides the SM contribution, further affected by heavy new mediators that are much heavier than the EW scale, or amended by an additional decay channel with undetected light final states like dark matter or axion-like particles. These two scenarios can be most conveniently analyzed in the SMEFT and the dark SMEFT (DSMEFT) framework, respectively. We consider the flavour structures of the resulting effective operators to be either generic or satisfy the minimal flavour violation (MFV) hypothesis, both for the quark and lepton sectors. In the first scenario, once the MFV is assumed, only one SM-like low-energy effective operator induced by the SMEFT dim-6 operators can account for the Belle II excess, the parameter space of which is, however, excluded by the Belle upper bound on $\mathcal B(B^0\to K^{*0}\nu\bar\nu)$. In the second scenario, it is found that the Belle II excess can be accommodated by 22 of the DSMEFT operators involving one or two scalar, fermionic, or vector dark matters as well as ALPs. These operators also receive dominant constraints from the $B^0\to K^{*0}+$inv and $B_s\to$inv decays. In the MFV hypothesis, the number of viable operators is reduced to 14, and the $B^+\to\pi^+ +$inv and $K^+\to\pi^++$inv decays start to put further constraints. Within the parameter space allowed by all the current experimental data, the $q^2$ distributions (and $F_L$) of the $B\to K^{(*)}+$inv decays are studied for each viable operator. In addition, we, for the first time, calculate systematically the longitudinal polarization fraction $F_L$ of $K^*$ in the $B\to K^*+$inv decays within the DLEFT.</description>

      <title>Rare $B$ and $K$ decays in a scotogenic model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02897v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A scotogenic model can radiatively generate the observed neutrino mass, provide a dark matter candidate, and lead to rare lepton flavor-violating processes. We aim to extend the model to establish a potential connection to the quark flavor-related processes within the framework of scotogenesis, enhancing the unexpectedly large branching ratio (BR) of $B^+\to K^+ \nu \bar\nu$, observed by Belle II Collaboration. Meanwhile, the model can address tensions between some experimental measurements and standard model (SM) predictions in flavor physics, such as the muon $g-2$ excess and the higher BR of $B_s \to \mu^- \mu^+$. We introduce in the model the following dark particles: a neutral singlet Dirac-type lepton ($N$); two inert Higgs doublets ($\eta_{1,2}$), with one of which carrying a lepton number; a charged singlet dark scalar $(\chi^+)$, and a singlet vector-like up-type dark quark ($T$). The first two entities are responsible for the radiative neutrino mass, and $\chi^+$ couples to right-handed quarks and leptons and can resolve the tensions existing in muon $g-2$ and $B_s\to \mu^- \mu^+$. Furthermore, the BR of $B^+ \to K^+ \nu \bar\nu$ can be enhanced up to a factor of 2 compared to the SM prediction through the mediations of the dark $T$ and the charged scalars. In addition, we also study the impacts on the $K\to \pi \nu \bar\nu$ decays.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04966v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we use a five-dimensional Einstein-dilaton-two-Maxwell holographic QCD model to investigate the dissociation effects of $J/\Psi$ and $\Upsilon(1S)$ states in an anisotropic medium by calculating their spectral functions. The anisotropic background is characterized by an anisotropy parameter, a nontrivial warp factor, a dilaton field, and distinct components of two Maxwell fields. First, we present the holographic quarkonium masses at zero temperature via Physics-Informed Neural Networks. Then, at finite temperature, we derive the spectral functions, representing heavy vector mesons as peaks, and observe that with increasing anisotropy, temperature, chemical potential, and warp factor, the peak height diminishes while its width expands, indicating an accelerated dissociation process. Additionally, the results indicate the anisotropy induces a stronger dissociation effect in the direction parallel to the polarization compared to the perpendicular, revealing the anisotropy's directional influence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08088v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A symmetry-preserving truncation of the quantum field equations describing hadron properties is used to deliver parameter-free predictions for all nucleon elastic electromagnetic form factors and their flavour separation to large values of momentum transfer, $Q^2$. The proton electric form factor, $G_E^p$, possesses a zero, whereas that of the neutron, $G_E^n$, does not. The difference owes to the behaviour of the Pauli form factor of the proton's singly-represented valence $d$-quark. Consequently, $G_E^n&gt;G_E^p$ on a material large-$Q^2$ domain. These predictions can be tested in modern experiments.</description>

      <title>Confronting fuzzy dark matter with the rotation curves of nearby dwarf irregular galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.05793v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate phenomenologically the viability of fuzzy dark matter (FDM). We do this by confronting the predictions of the model, in particular, the formation of a solitonic core at the center of dark matter halos, with a homogeneous and robust sample of high-resolution rotation curves from the "LITTLE THINGS in 3D" catalog. This comprises a collection of isolated, dark matter dominated dwarf-irregular galaxies that provides an optimal benchmark for cosmological studies. We use a statistical framework based on Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques that allows us to extract relevant parameters such as the axion mass, the mass of the solitonic core, the mass of the dark matter halo and its concentration parameter with a rather loose set of priors except for the implementation of a core-halo relation that is predicted by simulations. The results of the fits are used to perform various diagnostics on the predictions of the model. FDM provides an excellent fit to the rotation curves of the "LITTLE THINGS in 3D" catalog, with axion masses determined from different galaxies clustering around $m_a\approx2\times10^{-23}$ eV. However, we find two major problems in our analysis. First, the data follow scaling relations of the properties of the core which are not consistent with the predictions of the soliton. This problem is particularly acute in the core radius - mass relation with a tension that, at face value, has a significance $\gtrsim5\sigma$. The second problem is related to the strong suppression of the linear power spectrum that is predicted by FDM for the axion mass preferred by the data. This can be constrained very conservatively by the galaxy counts in our sample, which leads to a tension exceeding again $5\sigma$. We estimate the effects of baryons in our analysis and discuss whether they could alleviate the tensions of the model with observations.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Friction in Gravitational Atoms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.15460v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to superradiant instabilities, clouds of ultralight bosons can spontaneously grow around rotating black holes, creating so-called "gravitational atoms". In this work, we study their dynamical effects on binary systems. We first focus on open orbits, showing that the presence of a cloud can increase the cross section for the dynamical capture of a compact object by more than an order of magnitude. We then consider closed orbits and demonstrate that the backreaction of the cloud's ionization on the orbital motion should be identified as dynamical friction. Finally, we study for the first time eccentric and inclined orbits. We find that, while ionization quickly circularizes the binary, it barely affects the inclination angle. These results enable a more realistic description of the dynamics of gravitational atoms in binaries and pave the way for dedicated searches with future gravitational wave detectors.</description>

Abstract: This work proposes more solutions for the Wheeler-DeWitt equation in a flat FLRW minisuperspace. We study quantum cosmology in the framework of the de Broglie-Bohm interpretation and investigate the quantum cosmological effects throughout the evolution of the universe. In a particular solution, the tendency for a scalar field to roll down the potential is balanced by the quantum force, and a Minkowski spacetime is obtained.</description>

      <title>Influences of tilted thin accretion disks on the observational appearance of hairy black holes in Horndeski gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10557v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Research on the observational appearance of black holes, both in general relativity and modified gravity, has been in full swing since the Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration announced photos of M87$^{*}$ and Sagittarius A$^{*}$. Nevertheless, limited attention has been given to the impact of tilted accretion disks on black hole images. This paper investigates the $230$ GHz images of non-rotating hairy black holes illuminated by tilted, thin accretion disks in Horndeski gravity with the aid of a ray tracing method. The results indicate that reducing the scalar hair parameter effectively diminishes image luminosity and extends both the critical curve and the inner shadow. This trend facilitates the differentiation between hairy black holes and Schwarzschild black holes, especially in certain parameter spaces where the current Event Horizon Telescope array is capable of capturing such variations. Furthermore, we observe that the inclination of the tilted accretion disk can mimic the observation angle, consequently affecting image brightness and the morphology of the inner shadow. In specific parameter spaces, alterations in the tilt or position of the accretion disk can lead to a drift in the light spot within the images of hairy black holes. This finding may establish a potential correlation between the precession of the tilted accretion disk and image features. Additionally, through an examination of images depicting hairy black holes surrounded by two thin accretion disks, we report the obscuring effect of the accretion environment on the inner shadow of the black hole.</description>

      <title>Hints of Neutrino Dark Matter scattering in the CMB? Constraints from the Marginalized and Profile Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09116v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study scatter-like interactions between neutrinos and dark matter in light of different combinations of temperature, polarization and lensing data released by three independent CMB experiments - the Planck satellite, the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), and the South Pole Telescope (SPT) - in conjunction with Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements. We apply two different statistical methodologies. Alongside the usual marginalization technique, we cross-check all the results through a Profile Likelihood analysis. As a first step, working under the assumption of massless neutrinos, we perform a comprehensive (re-)analysis aimed at assessing the validity of some recent results hinting at a mild preference for non-vanishing interactions from small-scale CMB data. We find compelling resilience in the results already documented in the literature, confirming that interactions with a strength $u_{\nu\rm{DM}} \sim 10^{-5} - 10^{-4}$ appear to be globally favored by ACT (both alone and in combination with Planck). This result is corroborated by the inclusion of additional data, such as the recent ACT-DR6 lensing likelihood, as well as by the Profile Likelihood analysis. Interestingly, a fully consistent preference for interactions emerges from SPT, as well, although it is weaker than the one obtained from ACT. As a second step, we repeat the same analysis considering neutrinos as massive particles. Despite the larger parameter space, all the hints pointing towards interactions are confirmed also in this more realistic case. In addition, we report a very mild preference for interactions in Planck+BAO alone (not found in the massless case) which aligns with small-scale data. While this latter result is not fully confirmed by the Profile Likelihood analysis, the profile distribution does confirm that interactions are not disfavoured by Planck.</description>

      <title>New limits on the local Lorentz invariance violation of gravity in the Standard-Model Extension with pulsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11038v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lorentz Violation (LV) is posited as a possible relic effect of quantum gravity at low energy scales. The Standard-Model Extension provides an effective field-theoretic framework for examining possible deviations attributed to LV. With their high observational accuracy, pulsars serve as ideal laboratories for probing LV. In the presence of LV, both the spin precession of solitary pulsars and orbital dynamics of binary pulsars would undergo modifications. Observations of pulse profiles and times of arrival (TOAs) of pulses allow for an in-depth investigation of these effects, leading to the establishment of strict limits on LV coefficients. We revisit the project of limiting local LV with updated pulsar observations. We employ a new parameter estimation method and utilize state-of-the-art pulsar timing observation data and get new limits on 8 linear combinations of LV coefficients based on 25 tests from 12 different systems. Compared to previous limits from pulsars, precision has improved by a factor of two to three. Additionally, we explore prospects for further improvements from pulsars. Simulation results indicate that more observations of spin precession in solitary millisecond pulsars could significantly enhance the accuracy of spatial LV coefficients, potentially by three to four orders of magnitude. As observational data accumulate, pulsars are anticipated to increasingly contribute to the tests of LV.</description>

      <title>Efficient parameter inference for gravitational wave signals in the presence of transient noises using temporal and time-spectral fusion normalizing flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08122v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Glitches represent a category of non-Gaussian and transient noise that frequently intersects with gravitational wave (GW) signals, exerting a notable impact on the processing of GW data. The inference of GW parameters, crucial for GW astronomy research, is particularly susceptible to such interference. In this study, we pioneer the utilization of temporal and time-spectral fusion normalizing flow for likelihood-free inference of GW parameters, seamlessly integrating the high temporal resolution of the time domain with the frequency separation characteristics of both time and frequency domains. Remarkably, our findings indicate that the accuracy of this inference method is comparable to traditional non-glitch sampling techniques. Furthermore, our approach exhibits greater efficiency, boasting processing times on the order of milliseconds. In conclusion, the application of normalizing flow emerges as pivotal in handling GW signals affected by transient noises, offering a promising avenue for enhancing the field of GW astronomy research.</description>

      <title>Theoretically motivated dark electromagnetism as the origin of relativistic MOND</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08811v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The present paper is a modest attempt to initiate the research program outlined in this abstract. We propose that general relativity and relativistic MOND (RelMOND) are analogues of the broken electroweak symmetry. That is, $SU(2)_R \times U(1)_{YDEM} \rightarrow U(1)_{DEM}$ (DEM stands for dark electromagnetism), and GR is assumed to arise from the broken $SU(2)_R$ symmetry, and is analogous to the weak force. RelMOND is identified with dark electromagnetism $U(1)_{DEM}$, which is the remaining unbroken symmetry after spontaneous symmetry breaking of the darkelectro-grav sector $SU(2)_R \times U(1)_{YDEM}$. This sector, as well as the electroweak sector, arise from the breaking of an $E_8 \times E_8$ symmetry, in a recently proposed model of unification of the standard model with pre-gravitation, this latter being an $SU(2)_R$ gauge theory. The source charge for the dark electromagnetic force is square-root of mass, motivated by the experimental fact that the square-roots of the masses of the electron, up quark, and down quark, are in the ratio 1:2:3, which is a flip of their electric charge ratios 3:2:1 The introduction of the dark electromagnetic force helps understand the weird mass ratios of the second and third generation of charged fermions. We also note that in the deep MOND regime, acceleration is proportional to square-root of mass, which motivates us to propose the relativistic $U(1)_{DEM}$ gauge symmetry as the origin of MOND. We explain why the dark electromagnetic force falls inversely with distance, as in MOND, and not as the inverse square of distance. We conclude that dark electromagnetism is a good mimicker of cold dark matter, and the two are essentially indistinguishable in those cosmological situations where CDM is successful in explaining observations, such as CMB anisotropies, and gravitational lensing.</description>
