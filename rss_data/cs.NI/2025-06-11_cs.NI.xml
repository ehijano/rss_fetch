      <title>Congestion-Aware Path Selection for Load Balancing in AI Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast training of large machine learning models requires distributed training on AI clusters consisting of thousands of GPUs. The efficiency of distributed training crucially depends on the efficiency of the network interconnecting GPUs in the cluster. These networks are commonly built using RDMA following a Clos-like datacenter topology. To efficiently utilize the network bandwidth, load balancing is employed to distribute traffic across multiple redundant paths. While there exists numerous techniques for load-balancing in traditional datacenters, these are often either optimized for TCP traffic or require specialized network hardware, thus limiting their utility in AI clusters.
  This paper presents the design and evaluation of Hopper, a new load-balancing technique optimized for RDMA traffic in AI clusters. Operating entirely at the host level, Hopper requires no specialized hardware or modifications to network switches. It continuously monitors the current path for congestion and dynamically switches traffic to a less congested path when congestion is detected. Furthermore, it incorporates a lightweight mechanism to identify alternative paths and carefully controls the timing of path switching to prevent excessive out-of-order packets.
  We evaluated Hopper using ns-3 simulations and a testbed implementation. Our evaluations show that Hopper reduces the average and 99-percentile tail flow completion time by up to 20% and 14%, respectively, compared to state-of-the-art host-based load balancing techniques.</description>

      <title>5G Aero: A Prototyping Platform for Evaluating Aerial 5G Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The application of small-factor, 5G-enabled Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has recently gained significant interest in various aerial and Industry 4.0 applications. However, ensuring reliable, high-throughput, and low-latency 5G communication in aerial applications remains a critical and underexplored problem. This paper presents the 5th generation (5G) Aero, a compact UAV optimized for 5G connectivity, aimed at fulfilling stringent 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) requirements. We conduct a set of experiments in an indoor environment, evaluating the UAV's ability to establish high-throughput, low-latency communications in both Line-of-Sight (LoS) and Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) conditions. Our findings demonstrate that the 5G Aero meets the required 3GPP standards for Command and Control (C2) packets latency in both LoS and NLoS, and video latency in LoS communications and it maintains acceptable latency levels for video transmission in NLoS conditions. Additionally, we show that the 5G module installed on the UAV introduces a negligible 1% decrease in flight time, showing that 5G technologies can be integrated into commercial off-the-shelf UAVs with minimal impact on battery lifetime. This paper contributes to the literature by demonstrating the practical capabilities of current 5G networks to support advanced UAV operations in telecommunications, offering insights into potential enhancements and optimizations for UAV performance in 5G networks</description>

      <title>Aerial Shepherds: Enabling Hierarchical Localization in Heterogeneous MAV Swarms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A heterogeneous micro aerial vehicles (MAV) swarm consists of resource-intensive but expensive advanced MAVs (AMAVs) and resource-limited but cost-effective basic MAVs (BMAVs), offering opportunities in diverse fields. Accurate and real-time localization is crucial for MAV swarms, but current practices lack a low-cost, high-precision, and real-time solution, especially for lightweight BMAVs. We find an opportunity to accomplish the task by transforming AMAVs into mobile localization infrastructures for BMAVs. However, translating this insight into a practical system is challenging due to issues in estimating locations with diverse and unknown localization errors of BMAVs, and allocating resources of AMAVs considering interconnected influential factors. This work introduces TransformLoc, a new framework that transforms AMAVs into mobile localization infrastructures, specifically designed for low-cost and resource-constrained BMAVs. We design an error-aware joint location estimation model to perform intermittent joint estimation for BMAVs and introduce a similarity-instructed adaptive grouping-scheduling strategy to allocate resources of AMAVs dynamically. TransformLoc achieves a collaborative, adaptive, and cost-effective localization system suitable for large-scale heterogeneous MAV swarms. We implement and validate TransformLoc on industrial drones. Results show it outperforms all baselines by up to 68\% in localization performance, improving navigation success rates by 60\%. Extensive robustness and ablation experiments further highlight the superiority of its design.</description>

      <title>Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based RAN Slicing with Efficient Inter-Slice Isolation in Tactical Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The next generation of tactical networks (TNs) is poised to further leverage the key enablers of 5G and beyond 5G (B5G) technology, such as radio access network (RAN) slicing and the open RAN (O-RAN) paradigm, to unlock multiple architectural options and opportunities for a wide range of innovative applications. RAN slicing and the O-RAN paradigm are considered game changers in TNs, where the former makes it possible to tailor user services to users requirements, and the latter brings openness and intelligence to the management of the RAN. In TNs, bandwidth scarcity requires a dynamic bandwidth slicing strategy. Although this type of strategy ensures efficient bandwidth utilization, it compromises RAN slicing isolation in terms of quality of service (QoS) performance. To deal with this challenge, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based RAN slicing mechanism that achieves a trade-off between efficient RAN bandwidth sharing and appropriate inter- and intra-slice isolation. The proposed mechanism performs bandwidth allocation in two stages. In the first stage, the bandwidth is allocated to the RAN slices. In the second stage, each slice partitions its bandwidth among its associated users. In both stages, the slicing operation is constrained by several considerations related to improving the QoS of slices and users that in turn foster inter- and intra-slice isolation. The proposed RAN slicing mechanism is based on DRL algorithms to perform the bandwidth sharing operation in each stage. We propose to deploy the mechanism in an O-RAN architecture and describe the O-RAN functional blocks and the main DRL model lifecycle management phases involved. We also develop three different implementations of the proposed mechanism, each based on a different DRL algorithm, and evaluate their performance against multiple baselines across various parameters.</description>

      <title>Power Domain Sparse Dimensional Constellation Multiple Access (PD-SDCMA) for Enabled Flexible PONs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the commercial deployment of 5G and the in-depth research of 6G, the demand for high-speed data services in the next-generation fiber optic access systems is growing increasingly. Passive optical networks (PONs) have become a research hotspot due to their characteristics of low loss, high bandwidth, and low cost. However, the traditional orthogonal multiple access (OMA-PON) has difficulty meeting the requirements of the next-generation PON for high spectral efficiency and flexibility. In this paper, a novel transmission technology, namely power-domain sparse dimension constellation multiple access (PD-SDCMA), is proposed for the first time. Through the signal space dimension selection strategy (S2D-strategy) in the high-dimensional signal space, the low-dimensional constellation is sparsely superimposed into the high-dimensional space, thereby reducing multi-user interference and enhancing the system capacity. PD-SDCMA supports higher-order modulation formats and more access groups, and is also compatible with the existing orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) architecture. The simulation results show that in a 25 km single-mode fiber system, compared with PD-NOMA and 3D-NOMA, PD-SDCMA can support more users and significantly reduce BER. This technology provides an efficient and low-cost solution for the evolution of Flexible PONs.</description>

      <title>When Simple Model Just Works: Is Network Traffic Classification in Crisis?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning has been applied to network traffic classification (TC) for over two decades. While early efforts used shallow models, the latter 2010s saw a shift toward complex neural networks, often reporting near-perfect accuracy. However, it was recently revealed that a simple k-NN baseline using packet sequences metadata (sizes, times, and directions) can be on par or even outperform more complex methods. In this paper, we investigate this phenomenon further and evaluate this baseline across 12 datasets and 15 TC tasks, and investigate why it performs so well. Our analysis shows that most datasets contain over 50% redundant samples (identical packet sequences), which frequently appear in both training and test sets due to common splitting practices. This redundancy can lead to overestimated model performance and reduce the theoretical maximum accuracy when identical flows have conflicting labels. Given its distinct characteristics, we further argue that standard machine learning practices adapted from domains like NLP or computer vision may be ill-suited for TC. Finally, we propose new directions for task formulation and evaluation to address these challenges and help realign the field.</description>

      <title>Extending Internet Access Over LoRa for Internet of Things and Critical Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03465v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: LoRa bridges the gap between remote locations and mainstream networks, enabling large-scale Internet of Things (IoT) deployments. Despite the recent advancements around LoRa, Internet access over this technology is still largely unexplored. Most existing solutions only handle packets within the local LoRa network and do not interact with web applications. This limits the scalability and the ability to deliver essential web services in disconnected regions. This work proposes and implements ILoRa to extend the public Internet to disconnected areas for essential service delivery. ILoRa enables accessing Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and web pages on the Internet over a LoRa backbone network. It comprises a ILoRa coordinator code (ICN) and access point nodes (APNs). The ICN interfaces the LoRa network with the public Internet and interprets content. The APN tethers a WiFi hotspot to which devices connect and access the web content. This work further proposes data handling methods for ICNs and APNs. An actual hardware-based implementation validates the proposed system. The implementation achieves a throughput of 1.06 kbps tested for an Internet-based API returning JSON data of 930 B. Furthermore, the APN consumed approximately $0.162$A current, and the resource utilization on the ICN was minimal.</description>

      <title>Direct-to-Cell: A First Look into Starlink's Direct Satellite-to-Device Radio Access Network through Crowdsourced Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00283v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite mega-constellations have recently emerged as a viable access solution for broadband services in underserved areas. In 2024, Direct Satellite-to-Device (DS2D) communications, which enable unmodified smartphones to connect directly to spaceborne base stations, entered large-scale beta testing, with Starlink globally leading deployments. This paper presents the first measurement study of commercial DS2D services. Using crowdsourced mobile network data collected in the U.S. between October 2024 and April 2025, our research derives evidence-based insights into the capabilities, limitations, and prospective evolution of DS2D technologies providing Supplemental Coverage from Space (SCS) services to expand existing mobile network connectivity. We observe a strong correlation between the number of satellites deployed and the expanding extension of observed measurements, concentrated in accessible but poorly covered areas by terrestrial networks, such as national parks and large low-density counties. The data reveal stable physical-layer value measurement throughout the observation period, with a lower median RSRP (24-dB difference) and a higher RSRQ (3 dB difference) compared to terrestrial networks, reflecting the SMS-only usage of the DS2D network during this period. Based on SINR measurements, we estimate the expected performance of the announced DS2D mobile data service to be around 4 Mbps per beam in outdoor conditions. We also discuss strategies to expand this capacity up to 12 Mbps in the future, depending on key regulatory decisions regarding satellite licenses, spectrum availability, and allowable radiated power levels.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.10537v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss an open problem and its converse first posed by Dougherty and Faber in [3], "Network routing on regular directed graphs from spanning factorizations." Does every vertex transitive digraph have a spanning 1=factorization? We show relationships between various properties a regular digraph might have: vertex transitivity, left or right cancellation, tree-like or neighborhood preserving spanning factorizations.</description>
