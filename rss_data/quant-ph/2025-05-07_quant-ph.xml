      <title>FPGA-based Toeplitz Strong Extractor for Quantum Random Number Generators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Random Number Generators (QRNGs) serve as high-entropy sources for Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) systems. However, the raw data from these quantum sources require post-processing to achieve a nearly uniform distribution. This work presents a state-of-the-art implementation of the Toeplitz Strong Extractor on an FPGA, achieving a benchmark extraction speed of 26.57 Gbps. A detailed implementation flow of the post-processing on the FPGA is provided, along with the execution speeds obtained for different randomness extraction ratios. Raw data from an in-house phase noise-based QRNG is processed on the FPGA using this implementation, and the output is validated using the NIST STS 2.1.2 statistical randomness test suite.</description>

      <title>Controlling Schwinger tunneling via engineering of virtual particle phases in vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An investigation into Schwinger pair production mechanisms is presented, demonstrating that vacuum tunneling processes can be effectively controlled through electromagnetic potential modulation while maintaining the strong ffelds in the interaction region. This challenges the conventional paradigm that attributes exclusive governance of Schwinger processes to localized ffeld intensities. Through comprehensive analysis of particle number, momentum spectra, and spatial distribution of created pairs, we establish that the observed modulation effects originate from electromagnetic potential - induced modiffcations to the quantum phase structure of virtual particles. This phenomenon reveals a profound connection between Schwinger tunneling dynamics and the geometric phase properties of the quantum vacuum state - a vacuum analogue to the Aharonov-Bohm effect in charged particle systems. This discovery not only advances our understanding of electromagnetic interactions in quantum vacuum but also opens up new experimental opportunities for realizing Schwinger tunneling processes with existing facilities.</description>

      <title>Many-Body Quantum Optics in a Bose-Hubbard Waveguide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Waveguide quantum electrodynamics (QED) studies the interaction between quantum emitters and guided photons in one-dimension. When the waveguide hosts interacting photons, it becomes a platform to explore many-body quantum optics. However, the influence of photonic correlations on emitter dynamics remains poorly understood. In this work, we study the collective decay and coherent interactions of quantum emitters coupled to a one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard waveguide, an array of coupled photonic modes with repulsive on-site interactions that supports superfluid and Mott insulating phases. We show that photon-photon interactions alone can trigger a superradiant burst, independent of emitter spacing and transition frequency. In the off-resonant regime, emitters exhibit two distinct types of mediated interactions: delocalized superfluid excitations yield distance-independent couplings, while Mott-insulator quasiparticles generate short-range interactions mediated by doublons and holons. Our work bridges many-body physics and waveguide QED, revealing how photonic many-body states shape emitter dynamics.</description>

      <title>Probing mixed-state phases on a quantum computer via Renyi correlators and variational decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances have defined nontrivial phases of matter in open quantum systems, such as many-body quantum states subject to environmental noise. In this work, we experimentally probe and characterize mixed-state phases on Quantinuum's H1 quantum computer using two measures: Renyi correlators and the coding performance of a quantum error-correcting code associated with the phase. As a concrete example, we probe the low-energy states of the critical transverse field Ising model under different dephasing noise channels. First, we employ shadow tomography to observe a newly proposed Renyi correlator in two distinct phases: one exhibiting power-law decay and the other long-ranged. Second, we investigate the decoding fidelity of the associated quantum error-correcting code using a variational quantum circuit, and we find that a shallow circuit is sufficient to distinguish the above-mentioned two mixed-state phases through the decoding performance quantified by entanglement fidelity. Our work is a proof of concept for the quantum simulation and characterization of mixed-state phases.</description>

      <title>Sequential Generation of Two-dimensional Super-area-law States with Local Parent Hamiltonian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct examples of highly entangled two-dimensional states by exploiting a correspondence between stochastic processes in $d$ dimensions and quantum states in $d+1$ dimensions. The entanglement structure of these states, which we explicitly calculate, can be tuned between area law, sub-volume law, and volume law. This correspondence also enables a sequential generation protocol: the states can be prepared through a series of unitary transformations acting on an auxiliary system. We also discuss the conditions under which these states have local, frustration-free parent Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Fermion-to-qubit encodings with arbitrary code distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a framework which allows to systematically and arbitrarily scale the code distance of local fermion-to-qubit encodings in one and two dimensions without growing the weights of stabilizers. This is achieved by embedding low-distance encodings into the surface code in the form of topological defects. We introduce a family of Ladder Encodings (LE), which is optimal in the sense that the code distance is equal to the weights of density and nearest-neighbor hopping operators of a one-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard model. In two dimensions, we show how to scale the code distance of LE as well as other low-distance encodings such as Verstraete-Cirac and Derby-Klassen. We further introduce Perforated Encodings, which locally encode two fermionic spin modes within the same surface code structure. We show that our strategy is also extendable to other topological codes by explicitly embedding the LE into a 6.6.6 color code.</description>

      <title>Stabilizer-Accelerated Ground-State Estimation of Quantum Many-Body Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how the stabilizer formalism, in particular highly-entangled stabilizer states, can be used to describe the emergence of many-body shape collectivity from individual constituents, in a symmetry-preserving and classically efficient way. The method that we adopt is based on determining an optimal separation of the Hamiltonian into a stabilizer component and a residual part inducing non-stabilizerness. The corresponding stabilizer ground state is efficiently prepared using techniques of graph states and stabilizer tableaux. We demonstrate this technique in context of the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model, a fully-connected spin system presenting a second order phase transition from spherical to deformed state. The resulting stabilizer ground state is found to capture to a large extent both bi-partite and collective multi-partite entanglement features of the exact solution in the region of large deformation. We also explore several methods for injecting non-stabilizerness into the system, including ADAPT-VQE, and imaginary-time evolution (ITE) techniques. Stabilizer ground states are found to accelerate ITE convergence due to a larger overlap with the exact ground state. This study motivates applications of the proposed approach to more realistic quantum many-body systems, whose stabilizer ground states can be used in combinations with powerful classical many-body techniques and/or quantum methods.</description>

      <title>Engineering protected cavity-QED interactions through pulsed dynamical decoupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a generic cavity QED setup under conditions where the coupling between the two-level systems and a single bosonic mode is significantly degraded by low-frequency noise. To overcome this problem, we identify pulsed dynamical decoupling strategies that suppress the effects of noise while still allowing for a coherent exchange of excitations between the individual subsystems. The corresponding pulse sequences can be further designed to realize either Jaynes-Cummings, anti-Jaynes-Cummings, or Rabi couplings, as well as different types of cavity-mediated interactions between the two-level systems. A detailed analysis of the residual imperfections demonstrates that this decoupling strategy can boost the effective cooperativity of the cavity QED system by several orders of magnitude and improve the fidelity of quantum-technologically relevant operations accordingly.</description>

      <title>Orbital Entanglement and The Double $d$-Shell Effect in Binary Transition Metal Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate modeling of transition metal-containing compounds is of great interest due to their wide-ranging and significant applications. These systems present several challenges from an electronic structure perspective, including significant multi-reference character and many chemically-relevant orbitals. A further complication arises from the so-called double $d$-shell effect, which is known to cause a myriad of issues in the treatment of first-row transition metals with both single- and multi-reference methods. While this effect has been well documented for several decades, a comprehensive understanding of its consequences and underlying causes is still evolving. Here, we characterize the second $d$-shell effect by analyzing the information entropy of correlated wavefunctions in a periodic series of $3d$ and $4d$ transition metal molecular hydrides and oxides. These quantum information techniques provide unique insight into the nuanced electronic structure of these species, and are powerful tools for study of weak and strong correlation in the transition metal $d$ manifold.</description>

      <title>Comparing classical and quantum conditional disclosure of secrets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The conditional disclosure of secrets (CDS) setting is among the most basic primitives studied in information-theoretic cryptography. Motivated by a connection to non-local quantum computation and position-based cryptography, CDS with quantum resources has recently been considered. Here, we study the differences between quantum and classical CDS, with the aims of clarifying the power of quantum resources in information-theoretic cryptography. We establish the following results:
  1) For perfectly correct CDS, we give a separation for a promise version of the not-equals function, showing a quantum upper bound of $O(\log n)$ and classical lower bound of $\Omega(n)$.
  2) We prove a $\Omega(\log \mathsf{R}_{0,A\rightarrow B}(f)+\log \mathsf{R}_{0,B\rightarrow A}(f))$ lower bound on quantum CDS where $\mathsf{R}_{0,A\rightarrow B}(f)$ is the classical one-way communication complexity with perfect correctness.
  3) We prove a lower bound on quantum CDS in terms of two round, public coin, two-prover interactive proofs.
  4) We give a logarithmic upper bound for quantum CDS on forrelation, while the best known classical algorithm is linear. We interpret this as preliminary evidence that classical and quantum CDS are separated even with correctness and security error allowed.
  We also give a separation for classical and quantum private simultaneous message passing for a partial function, improving on an earlier relational separation. Our results use novel combinations of techniques from non-local quantum computation and communication complexity.</description>

      <title>Entangled-photon time- and frequency-resolved optical spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical time-resolved optical spectroscopy experiments are performed using sequences of ultrashort light pulses, with photon fluxes incident on the sample which are many orders of magnitude higher than real-world conditions corresponding to sunlight illumination. Here we overcome this paradigm by exploiting quantum correlations to perform time-resolved spectroscopy with entangled photons. Starting from spontaneous parametric down-conversion driven by a continuous-wave laser, we exploit the temporal entanglement between randomly generated signal/idler pairs to obtain temporal resolution, and their spectral entanglement to select the excitation frequency. We also add spectral resolution in detection, using a Fourier transform approach which employs a common-path interferometer. We demonstrate the potential of our entangled-photon streak camera by resolving, at the single-photon level, excitation energy transfer cascades from LH2 to LH1 in the photosynthetic membrane and disentangling the lifetimes of two dyes in a mixture. We show that time-resolved spectroscopy with quantum light can be performed without compromising measurement time, recording a fluorescence time trace in less than a minute even for samples with low quantum yield, which can be reduced to sub-second times with acceptable signal-to-noise ratio. Our results provide a new approach to ultrafast optical spectroscopy, where experiments are performed under conditions comparable to real-world sunlight illumination.</description>

      <title>Geometrical Amplitude factors in the the adiabatic evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a quantum system initially in the n-th eigenstate, an adiabatic evolution of the Hamiltonian ensures that the system remains in the corresponding instantaneous eigenstate while acquiring a phase factor. This phase has two components: one resulting from standard time evolution and another associated with the dependence of the eigenstate on the varying Hamiltonian, known as the Berry phase. In this work, we explore the concept of geometric amplitudes in the context of a Hermitian Hamiltonian with imaginary eigenvalues. We introduce the notion of geometric amplitude and provide a novel derivation of this concept. Our study reveals that a system undergoing cyclic evolution under adiabatic conditions acquires an additional amplitude factor of purely geometric origin. To illustrate this idea, we apply it to a concrete case: a generalized harmonic oscillator.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the open challenges in quantum computing simulations of problems of chemical interest is the proper enforcement of spin symmetry. Efficient quantum circuits implementing unitaries generated by spin-adapted operators remain elusive, while na\"ive Trotterization schemes break spin symmetry. In this work, we analyze the mathematical structure of spin-adapted operators and derive closed-form expressions for unitaries generated by singlet spin-adapted generalized single and double excitations. These results represent significant progress toward the economical enforcement of spin symmetry in quantum simulations.</description>

      <title>Long-Range Interacting Many-Body Systems in the Irrep Basis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin models featuring infinite-range, homogeneous all-to-all interactions can be efficiently described due to the existence of a symmetry-restricted Hilbert subspace and an underlying classical phase space structure. However, when the permutation invariance of the system is weakly broken, such as by long- but finite-range interactions, these tools become mathematically invalid. Here we propose to approximately describe these scenarios by considering additional many-body subspaces according to the hierarchy of their coupling to the symmetric subspace, defined by leveraging the structure of irreducible representations (irreps) of the group $SU(2)$. We put forward a procedure, dubbed ``irrep distillation," which defines these additional subspaces to minimize their dimension at each order of approximation. We discuss the validity of our method in connection with the occurrence of quantum many-body scars, benchmark its utility by analyzing the dynamical and equilibrium phase transitions, outline its phenomenology, and compare its use-cases against other approximations of long-range many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Observation of Lie algebraic invariants in Quantum Linear Optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past few years, various methods have been developed to engineeer and to exploit the dynamics of photonic quantum states as they evolve through linear optical networks. Recent theoretical works have shown that the underlying Lie algebraic structure plays a crucial role in the description of linear optical Hamiltonians, as such formalism identifies intrinsic symmetries within photonic systems subject to linear optical dynamics. Here, we experimentally investigate the role of Lie algebra applied to the context of Boson sampling, a pivotal model to the current understanding of computational complexity regimes in photonic quantum information. Performing experiments of increasing complexity, realized within a fully-reconfigurable photonic circuit, we show that sampling experiments do indeed fulfill the constraints implied by a Lie algebraic structure. In addition, we provide a comprehensive picture about how the concept of Lie algebraic invariant can be interpreted from the point of view of n-th order correlation functions in quantum optics. Our work shows how Lie algebraic invariants can be used as a benchmark tool for the correctness of an underlying linear optical dynamics and to verify the reliability of Boson Sampling experiments. This opens new avenues for the use of algebraic-inspired methods as verification tools for photon-based quantum computing protocols.</description>

      <title>Digital quantum simulations of scattering in quantum field theories using W states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-energy particle collisions can convert energy into matter through the inelastic production of new particles. Quantum computers are an ideal platform for simulating the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of the collision and the formation of the subsequent many-particle state. In this work, evidence for inelastic particle production is observed in one-dimensional Ising field theory using IBM's quantum computers. The scattering experiment is performed on 100 qubits of ibm_marrakesh and uses up to 6,412 two-qubit gates to access the post-collision dynamics. Integral to these simulations is a new quantum algorithm for preparing the initial state (wavepackets) of a quantum field theory scattering simulation. This method efficiently prepares wavepackets by extending recent protocols for creating W states with mid-circuit measurement and feedforward. The required circuit depth is independent of wavepacket size and spatial dimension, representing a superexponential improvement over previous methods. Our wavepacket preparation algorithm can be applied to a wide range of lattice models and is demonstrated in one-dimensional Ising field theory, scalar field theory, the Schwinger model, and two-dimensional Ising field theory.</description>

      <title>HMAE: Self-Supervised Few-Shot Learning for Quantum Spin Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning for spin and molecular systems faces critical challenges of scarce labeled data and computationally expensive simulations. To address these limitations, we introduce Hamiltonian-Masked Autoencoding (HMAE), a novel self-supervised framework that pre-trains transformers on unlabeled quantum Hamiltonians, enabling efficient few-shot transfer learning. Unlike random masking approaches, HMAE employs a physics-informed strategy based on quantum information theory to selectively mask Hamiltonian terms based on their physical significance. Experiments on 12,500 quantum Hamiltonians (60% real-world, 40% synthetic) demonstrate that HMAE achieves 85.3% $\pm$ 1.5% accuracy in phase classification and 0.15 $\pm$ 0.02 eV MAE in ground state energy prediction with merely 10 labeled examples - a statistically significant improvement (p &lt; 0.01) over classical graph neural networks (78.1% $\pm$ 2.1%) and quantum neural networks (76.8% $\pm$ 2.3%). Our method's primary advantage is exceptional sample efficiency - reducing required labeled examples by 3-5x compared to baseline methods - though we emphasize that ground truth values for fine-tuning and evaluation still require exact diagonalization or tensor networks. We explicitly acknowledge that our current approach is limited to small quantum systems (specifically limited to 12 qubits during training, with limited extension to 16-20 qubits in testing) and that, while promising within this regime, this size restriction prevents immediate application to larger systems of practical interest in materials science and quantum chemistry.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Simultaneous Quantum-Classical Communications Under Composable Security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simultaneous quantum-classical communications (SQCC) protocols are a family of continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) protocols which allow for quantum and classical symbols to be integrated concurrently on the same optical pulse and mode. In this work, we present a revised analysis of simultaneous quantum-classical communications in Gaussian-modulated coherent-state CV-QKD protocols. We address security concerns inherently associated with SQCC schemes and provide an updated model of the coupling between the classical and quantum channels. We provide evidence for our model via Monte Carlo simulation. We compute the performance of our revised SQCC protocol in terms of the secret-key generation rate optimised over free parameters and demonstrate improved quantum efficiency for a given classical bit-error rate. Lastly, we extend our analysis into the finite-key regime, where we propose a scheme for composably-secure SQCC under realistic operating conditions and demonstrate that our scheme retains the advantage in quantum performance over previous models.</description>

      <title>Quantum correlations in entangled two-particle non-unitary quantum walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the evolution of quantum correlations in two-particle discrete-time non-unitary quantum walks on a line with gain and loss. The two particles are initially prepared in a maximally entangled state and evolve independently. Using numerically exact calculations of position probability densities, average interparticle distance, entanglement entropy, and concurrence, we examine how dissipation and particle-exchange symmetry of the state (symmetric or antisymmetric) influence the resulting correlations. Notably, we find that the entanglement entropy of the antisymmetric state decays slower than that of the symmetric state at the exceptional point of the model. We also show that, in the antisymmetric state, the concurrence measured on the one-particle reduced density operator is unaffected by dissipation. Furthermore, we discuss how these correlations indicate quantum-to-classical transitions through the appearance of Gaussian position probability densities, sub-linear growth of average interparticle distance after a few steps, and decay of the entanglement entropy. On the other hand, the robustness of the qubit entanglement entropy can differentiate the model's topological phases better than in the one-particle quantum walk scenario.</description>

      <title>Surpassing the Global Heisenberg Limit Using a High-effciency Quantum Switch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Indefinite causal orders have been shown to enable a precision of inverse square N in quantum parameter estimation, where N is the number of independent processes probed in an experiment. This surpasses the widely accepted ultimate quantum precision of the Heisenberg limit, 1/N. While a recent laboratory demonstration highlighted this phenomenon, its validity relies on postselection for it only accounted for a subset of the resources used. Achieving a true violation of the Heisenberg limit-considering photon loss, detection ineffciency, and other imperfections-remains an open challenge. Here, we present an ultrahigh-effciency quantum switch to estimate the geometric phase associated with a pair of conjugate position and momentum displacements embedded in a superposition of causal orders. Our experimental data demonstrate precision surpassing the global Heisenberg limit without artificially correcting for losses or imperfections. This work paves the way for quantum metrology advantages under more general and realistic constraints.</description>

      <title>Understanding Decoherence of the Boron Vacancy Center in Hexagonal Boron Nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has emerged as a significant material for quantum sensing, particularly due to its ability to host spin active defects, such as the negatively charged boron vacancy (V$_\mathrm{B}^-$ center). The optical addressability of the V$_\mathrm{B}^-$ center and hBN's 2D structure enable high spatial resolution and integration into various platforms. However, decoherence due to the strong magnetic noise in hBN imposes fundamental limitations on the sensitivity of V$_\mathrm{B}^-$ center-based applications. Understanding the phenomena behind decoherence and identifying parameter settings that provide the highest performance are essential for advancing V$_\mathrm{B}^-$ sensors. This study employs state-of-the-art computational methods to investigate the decoherence of the V$_\mathrm{B}^-$ center in hexagonal boron nitride across a wide range of magnetic field values from 0 T up to 3 T. The provided in-depth numerical and analytical analysis reveals an intricate interplay of various decoherence mechanisms. This study identifies five distinct magnetic field regions governed by different types of magnetic interactions with and within the abundant nuclear spin bath. In addition to magnetic field, the effects of zero-field splitting, nuclear polarization, and different hyperfine coupling terms are studied, representing an important step forward in utilizing V$_\mathrm{B}^-$ ensembles in sensing. In particular, this study proposes operation in the moderate $180-350$ mT magnetic field range in chemically pure h$^{11}$B$^{15}$N samples, where the coherence time can reach $1-20$ $\mu$s, significantly exceeding the $\mathcal{O}( 100~\text{ns})$ low-field $T_2$ values.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in quantum computing are leading to an era of practical utility, enabling the tackling of increasingly complex problems. The goal of this era is to leverage quantum computing to solve real-world problems in fields such as machine learning, optimization, and material simulation, using revolutionary quantum methods and machines. All this progress has been achieved even while being immersed in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era, characterized by the current devices' inability to process medium-scale complex problems efficiently. Consequently, there has been a surge of interest in quantum algorithms in various fields. Multiple factors have played a role in this extraordinary development, with three being particularly noteworthy: (i) the development of larger devices with enhanced interconnections between their constituent qubits, (ii) the development of specialized frameworks, and (iii) the existence of well-known or ready-to-use hybrid schemes that simplify the method development process. In this context, this manuscript presents and overviews some recent contributions within this paradigm, showcasing the potential of quantum computing to emerge as a significant research catalyst in the fields of machine learning and optimization in the coming years.</description>

      <title>Magnetic-field dependent VB- spin decoherence in hexagonal boron nitrides: A first-principles study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The negatively charged boron vacancy (VB-) in h-BN operates as an optically addressable spin qubit in two-dimensional materials. To further advance the spin into a versatile qubit platform, it is imperative to understand its spin decoherence precisely, which is currently one of the major limiting factors for the VB- spin. In this study, we employ a first-principles quantum many-body simulation to investigate the decoherence of the VB- spin in dense nuclear spin baths as a function of magnetic field from 100 G to 3 T, revealing several unique phenomena and their origin. We found that decoherence mechanism changes at a specific magnetic field, which we refer to as the transition boundary (TB). Below the TB, the decoherence occurs within submicrosecond and it is primarily governed by independent nuclear spin dynamics. Above the TB, pair-wise flip-flop transitions become the dominant decoherence source, leading to the decoherence time of tens of microseconds. Building upon this understanding, we developed a method to predict the TB depending on the isotopic composition of h-BN, leading to TBs at 5020 G for h-10B14N and 2050 G for h-11B14N, which is in excellent agreement with our numerical results. We show that the larger TB in h-10BN derives from the larger nuclear spin of 10B than that of 11B, giving rise to strong nuclear modulation effects over a wider range of magnetic field in 10BN than in 11BN. We also explain the microscopic origin of several unique features in the decoherence, such as magnetic-field insensitive fast modulation found below the TB. Our results provide essential insight on the role of the 100% dense nuclear spin environment with large nuclear spins in the VB- decoherence, opening a new avenue for advancing the spin qubit in h-BN as robust platform in quantum information science.</description>

      <title>Qimax: Efficient quantum simulation via GPU-accelerated extended stabilizer formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulating Clifford and near-Clifford circuits using the extended stabilizer formalism has become increasingly popular, particularly in quantum error correction. Compared to the state-vector approach, the extended stabilizer formalism can solve the same problems with fewer computational resources, as it operates on stabilizers rather than full state vectors. Most existing studies on near-Clifford circuits focus on balancing the trade-off between the number of ancilla qubits and simulation accuracy, often overlooking performance considerations. Furthermore, in the presence of high-rank stabilizers, performance is limited by the sequential property of the stabilizer formalism. In this work, we introduce a parallelized version of the extended stabilizer formalism, enabling efficient execution on multi-core devices such as GPU. Experimental results demonstrate that, in certain scenarios, our Python-based implementation outperforms state-of-the-art simulators such as Qiskit and Pennylane.</description>

      <title>Learning entanglement from tomography data: contradictory measurement importance for neural networks and random forests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the effectiveness of two distinct machine learning techniques, neural networks and random forests, in the quantification of entanglement from two-qubit tomography data. Although we predictably find that neural networks yield better accuracy, we also find that the way that the two methods reach their prediction is starkly different. This is seen by the measurements which arthe most important for the classification. Neural networks follow the intuitive prediction that measurements containing information about non-local coherences are most important for entanglement, but random forests signify the dominance of information contained in occupation measurements. This is because occupation measurements are necessary for the extraction of data about all other density matrix elements from the remaining measurements. The same discrepancy does not occur when the models are used to learn entanglement directly from the elements of the density matrix, so it is the result of the scattering of information and interdependence of measurement data. As a result, the models behave differently when noise is introduced to various measurements, which can be harnessed to obtain more reliable information about entanglement from noisy tomography data.</description>

      <title>Noisy HQNNs: A Comprehensive Analysis of Noise Robustness in Hybrid Quantum Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid Quantum Neural Networks (HQNNs) offer promising potential of quantum computing while retaining the flexibility of classical deep learning. However, the limitations of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices introduce significant challenges in achieving ideal performance due to noise interference, such as decoherence, gate errors, and readout errors. This paper presents an extensive comparative analysis of two HQNN algorithms, Quantum Convolutional Neural Network (QCNN) and Quanvolutional Neural Network (QuanNN), assessing their noise resilience across diverse image classification tasks. We systematically inject noise into variational quantum circuits using five quantum noise channels: Phase Flip, Bit Flip, Phase Damping, Amplitude Damping, and Depolarizing Noise. By varying noise probabilities from 0.1 to 1.0, we evaluate the correlation between noise robustness and model behavior across different noise levels.
  Our findings demonstrate that different noise types and levels significantly influence HQNN performance. The QuanNN shows robust performance across most noise channels for low noise levels (0.1 - 0.4), but succumbs to diverse effects of depolarizing and amplitude damping noise at probabilities between (0.5 - 1.0). However, the QuanNN exhibits robustness to bit flip noise at high probabilities (0.9 - 1.0). On the other hand, the QCNN tends to benefit from the noise injection by outperforming noise-free models for bit flip, phase flip, and phase damping at high noise probabilities. However, for other noise types, the QCNN shows gradual performance degradation as noise increases. These insights aim to guide future research in error mitigation strategies to enhance HQNN models in the NISQ era.</description>

      <title>Quantum Feature Space of a Qubit Coupled to an Arbitrary Bath</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03397v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Qubit control protocols have traditionally leveraged a characterisation of the qubit-bath coupling via its power spectral density. Previous work proposed the inference of noise operators that characterise the influence of a classical bath using a grey-box approach that combines deep neural networks with physics-encoded layers. This overall structure is complex and poses challenges in scaling and real-time operations. Here, we show that no expensive neural networks are needed and that this noise operator description admits an efficient parameterisation. We refer to the resulting parameter space as the \textit{quantum feature space} of the qubit dynamics resulting from the coupled bath. We show that the Euclidean distance defined over the quantum feature space provides an effective method for classifying noise processes in the presence of a given set of controls. Using the quantum feature space as the input space for a simple machine learning algorithm (random forest, in this case), we demonstrate that it can effectively classify the stationarity and the broad class of noise processes perturbing a qubit. Finally, we explore how control pulse parameters map to the quantum feature space.</description>

      <title>Typical Machine Learning Datasets as Low-Depth Quantum Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) is an emerging field that investigates the capabilities of quantum computers for learning tasks. While QML models can theoretically offer advantages such as exponential speed-ups, challenges in data loading and the ability to scale to relevant problem sizes have prevented demonstrations of such advantages on practical problems. In particular, the encoding of arbitrary classical data into quantum states usually comes at a high computational cost, either in terms of qubits or gate count. However, real-world data typically exhibits some inherent structure (such as image data) which can be leveraged to load them with a much smaller cost on a quantum computer. This work further develops an efficient algorithm for finding low-depth quantum circuits to load classical image data as quantum states. To evaluate its effectiveness, we conduct systematic studies on the MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and Imagenette datasets. The corresponding circuits for loading the full large-scale datasets are available publicly as PennyLane datasets and can be used by the community for their own benchmarks. We further analyze the performance of various quantum classifiers, such as quantum kernel methods, parameterized quantum circuits, and tensor-network classifiers, and we compare them to convolutional neural networks. In particular, we focus on the performance of the quantum classifiers as we introduce nonlinear functions of the input state, e.g., by letting the circuit parameters depend on the input state.</description>

      <title>Methods for quantum interference in atomic ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An experimental method for obtaining quantum interference signal in atomic ensemble using a bi-chromatic field is discussed. Here, the quantum interference signal is obtained by scanning the magnetic field rather than conventional method of changing the frequency separation between the light fields. We could simultaneously observe resonances due to population redistribution and quantum superposition between non-degenerate states, which otherwise involves fundamentally different approaches. The method is implemented to Rubidium atoms in buffer gas filled as well as anti-relaxation coated atomic cells. Apart from phenomenological interest, the modified experimental procedure is found to be convenient for in-situ calibration of three axis magnetic coils. The investigation will be useful for high as well as low vector magnetic field sensing.</description>

Abstract: Quantum key distribution enables two remote parties to share encryption keys with information-theoretic security based on physical laws. Side-channel-secure quantum key distribution (SCS-QKD) has attracted considerable attention due to its immunity to both source and detector side-channel attacks. Recently, a demonstration of SCS-QKD over 50 km has been realized. However, practical implementation of this protocol faces significant challenges, including the presence of an imperfect vacuum state and coherent attacks involving a limited number of pulses. Here, based on the theoretical work of Jiang et al. [Phys. Rev. Research 6, 013266 (2024)], we experimentally implemented the practical SCS-QKD protocol using an imperfect whole-space source. This allows us to extend the transmission distance to 200 km using fiber spools, achieving a secure key rate of 1.29E-7 bits per pulse while accounting for finite-key effects. These results establish a new distance record for SCS-QKD and highlight its potential for practical applications. We anticipate that this work will advance the practical implementation and security of quantum key distribution.</description>

      <title>Emergence of a Classical Dirac-Type Spin from On-Shell Factorisation and Liouvillian Evolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While Liouville's theorem is first order in time for the phase-space distribution itself, the relativistic mass-shell constraint $p^\mu p_\mu = m^2$ is naively second order in energy. We argue it is reasonable to unify both energy branches within a single Hamiltonian by factorising $(p^2 - m^2)$ in analogy with Dirac's approach in relativistic quantum mechanics. We show the resulting matrix-based Liouville equation remains first order and naturally yields a $4\times4$ matrix-valued probability density function in phase space as a classical analogue of a relativistic spin-half Wigner function.</description>

      <title>On the non-Markovian quantum stochastic network dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the non-Markovian quantum dynamics based on quantum noise properties in a network of atoms mediated by a waveguide. In such networks, quantum coherent feedback control becomes achievable when coherent fields (or quantum noises) in the form of photons with continuous modes propagate through the waveguide. Different from traditional Markovian quantum systems, the non-Markovian quantum network can be regarded as a quantum system interacting with multiple input quantum noise channels with different time delays, and the \rm{It\={o}} relationships among different quantum noise channels can be represented with a non-Markovian integral process with integral kernels determined by the relative distances among atoms and their coupling methods to the waveguide. Then the non-Markovian dynamics of the quantum network can be modeled with the quantum stochastic differential equation (QSDE), which contains an integral process with integral kernels determined by the \rm{It\={o}} relationships among quantum noises. Utilizing this modeling approach from the perspective of quantum noises, the control dynamics can be clarified according to the noise properties and measurement results of the non-Markovian quantum network can be evaluated at the output end, which can be further used in the filtering of quantum states within Markovian approximations.</description>

      <title>Environmental Quantum States Trigger Emission in Nonlinear Photonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light-matter interactions are traditionally governed by two fundamental paradigms: spontaneous and stimulated radiation. However, in nonlinear multi-photon regimes, these classical mechanisms break down, revealing new possibilities for light emission. Here, we report the discovery of a novel mechanism, termed triggered emission, in which an emitter, largely detuned from single-photon states, is triggered by the quantum state of the environment to emit a highly correlated photon pair, doublon. By identifying two critical conditions, energy matching and wavefunction overlap, we demonstrate that the dynamics of the emitter are profoundly shaped by the environment's quantum state. Using this framework, we construct a novel superposition state comprising a localized single-photon state and a propagating, strongly correlated two-photon wavepacket. Furthermore, we realize the multi-photon unidirectional emission by modulating the emitter and the photon state. Our findings not only deepen the understanding of nonlinear emitter dynamics but also provide a versatile platform for quantum computing and quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Impact and mitigation of Hamiltonian characterization errors in digital-analog quantum computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital-analog is a universal quantum computing paradigm which employs the natural entangling Hamiltonian of the system and single-qubit gates as resources. Here, we study the stability of these protocols against Hamiltonian characterization errors. For this, we bound the maximum separation between the target and the implemented Hamiltonians. Additionally, we obtain an upper bound for the deviation in the expected value of an observable. We further propose a protocol for mitigating calibration errors which resembles dynamical-decoupling techniques. These results open the possibility of scaling digital-analog to intermediate and large scale systems while having an estimation on the errors committed.</description>

      <title>Expedited thermalization dynamics in incommensurate systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the thermalization dynamics of a quantum system embedded in an incommensurate potential and coupled to a Markovian thermal reservoir. The dephasing induced by the bath drives the system toward an infinite-temperature steady state, erasing all initial information-including signatures of localization. We find that initially localized states can relax to the homogeneous steady state faster than delocalized states. Moreover, low-temperature initial states thermalize to infinite temperature more rapidly than high-temperature states-a phenomenon reminiscent of the Mpemba effect, where hotter liquids freeze faster than warmer ones. The slowest relaxation mode in the Liouvillian plays critical role in the expedited thermalization for localized or cold initial states. Our results reveal that the combination of disordered structure and environmental dissipation may lead to non-trivial thermalization behavior, which advances both the conceptual framework of the Mpemba effect and the theoretical understanding of nonequilibrium processes in dissipative disordered systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the response of a quantum system induced by a collision with a quantum particle, using the time-independent framework of scattering theory. After deriving the dynamical map for the quantum system, we show that the unitary contribution to the dynamics defines a non-perturbative response function obeying a general fluctuation-dissipation relation. We show that Kubo's formula emerges autonomously in the Born approximation, where the time-dependent perturbation is determined by particle's evolution through the potential region.</description>

      <title>Variable Frequency Pulse Generation from Breathers in Josephson Transmission Lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single flux quantum technology has the potential to enhance readout and control of superconducting quantum systems due to their low energy consumption, high speed, and cryogenic operating temperatures. Current cryogenic readout and control typically requires microwave pulses of specific frequencies to travel between the room temperature control electronics and the cryogenic setup. Latency in control and readout can be improved by generating pulses within the dilution refrigerator. In this work, we consider a protocol for generating gigahertz frequency microwave tones from trains of DC-centered fluxons and fluxoids in Josephson transmission lines using the dynamics of breather formation, without room temperature synthesis or shunt / bias resistors. Simulations show that pulses with frequencies in the range of 15.2 to 21.5 GHz can be generated with maximal energy efficiency of 97% and bandwidth from 40 to 365 MHz. This protocol can also be used to generate gigahertz frequency Gaussian pulses. We detail metrics relevant to the control and readout of quantum systems such as input power, output power, and footprint.</description>

      <title>Sequential decoding of the XYZ$^2$ hexagonal stabilizer code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum error correction requires accurate and efficient decoding to optimally suppress errors in the encoded information. For concatenated codes, where one code is embedded within another, optimal decoding can be achieved using a message-passing algorithm that sends conditional error probabilities from the lower-level code to a higher-level decoder. In this work, we study the XYZ$^2$ topological stabilizer code, defined on a honeycomb lattice, and use the fact that it can be viewed as a concatenation of a [[2, 1, 1]] phase-flip parity check code and the surface code with $YZZY$ stabilizers, to decode the syndrome information in two steps. We use this sequential decoding scheme to correct errors on data qubits, as well as measurement errors, under various biased error models using both a maximum-likelihood decoder (MLD) and more efficient matching-based decoders. For depolarizing noise we find that the sequential matching decoder gives a threshold of 18.3%, close to optimal, as a consequence of a favorable, effectively biased, error model on the upper-level YZZY code. For phase-biased noise on data qubits, at a bias $\eta = \frac{p_z}{p_x+p_y} = 10$, we find that a belief-matching-based decoder reaches thresholds of 24.1%, compared to 28.6% for the MLD. With measurement errors the thresholds are reduced to 3.4% and 4.3%, for depolarizing and biased noise respectively, using the belief-matching decoder. This demonstrates that the XYZ$^2$ code has thresholds that are competitive with other codes tailored to biased noise. The results also showcase two approaches to taking advantage of concatenated codes: 1) tailoring the upper-level code to the effective noise profile of the decoded lower-level code, and 2) making use of an upper-level decoder that can utilize the local information from the lower-level code.</description>

      <title>Average entanglement entropy of a small subsystem in a constrained pure Gaussian state ensemble</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider ensembles of pure Gaussian states parametrized by single-mode marginals and (optionally) specific mode-mode correlations. Such ensembles provide a model for the final states when isolated quantum systems thermalize, as they can reproduce thermal properties locally, while being globally pure. By an analysis using real replicas and the coherent state representation of Gaussian states we show that the average entanglement entropy of a small subsystem is the same as the von Neumann entropy of a mixed Gaussian state with the same marginals, but no correlations. Finally, we discuss how these ensembles provide a model for Hawking radiation assuming unitary evolution, and discuss some of their properties in relations to the Page curve of Hawking radiation.</description>

      <title>Two-electron quantum walks probe entanglement and decoherence in an electron microscope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical physics is often a good approximation for quantum systems composed of many interacting particles, although wavepacket dispersion and scattering processes continuously induce delocalization and entanglement. According to decoherence theory, an entangled ensemble can appear classical when only a subset of all particles is observed. This emergence of macroscopic phenomena from quantum interactions is, for example, relevant for phase transitions, quantum thermalization, hydrodynamics, spin liquids, or time crystals. However, entanglement and decoherence in free electrons have not yet been explored, although the electron is a fundamental elementary particle with extraordinary technological relevance. Here, we investigate the degree of coherence and entanglement in a free-space electron gas in the beam of an ultrafast electron microscope. Inspired by the strong interaction of free electrons with laser light, we introduce a two-electron quantum walk that enables quantum state tomography of entangled or partially entangled electron-electron pairs. We apply this novel diagnostic to study the creation and loss of entanglement in short pulses of hundreds of electrons. We observe high-contrast two-electron interferences and signs of small electron-electron entanglement that we explain by competition between entangling Coulomb interactions and decoherence effects from unmeasured reservoir electrons. The ability to characterize entangled free-electron quantum states will provide insight into the emergence of classical phenomena from quantum principles in the realm of particles with mass and charge, and will have practical applications in low-dose electron microscopy, ghost imaging, or quantum electron microscopy.</description>

      <title>Probing Vortex Dynamics in 2D Superconductors with Scanning Quantum Microscope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The visualization of the magnetic responses of a two-dimensional (2D) superconducting material on the nanoscale is a powerful approach to unravel the underlying supercurrent behavior and to investigate critical phenomena in reduced dimensions. In this study, scanning quantum microscopy is utilized to explore the local magnetic response of the 2D superconductor 2H-NbSe2. Our technique enables both static and dynamic sensing of superconducting vortices with high sensitivity and a spatial resolution down to 30 nm, unveiling unexpected phenomena linked to the intrinsic 2D nature of the superconductor, which are challenging to detect with more conventional local probes. Vortices do not arrange in a hexagonal lattice, but form a distorted vortex glass with expanding vortex size. A vortex can exhibit strong local dynamics due to thermal excitation. As the critical temperature is approached, a clear melting of the vortex glass is identified, leading to distinct configurations under different cooling conditions. Vortex fluctuations can also be probed through spin Hahn-echo measurements, which reveal the spin decoherence even well below the critical temperature -- and, intriguingly, enhanced decoherence at lower temperatures. Spatiotemporal microscopy of the magnetic dynamics associated with vortex excitations and fluctuations provides direct evidence of 2D superconducting phenomena at the nanoscale.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The geometry of quantum states can be an indicator of criticality, yet it remains less explored under non-Hermitian topological conditions. In this work, we unveil diverse scalings of the quantum geometry over the ground state manifold close to different topological phase transitions in a non-Hermitian long-range extension of the Kitaev chain. The derivative of the geometric phase, as well as its scaling behavior, shows that systems with different long-range couplings can belong to distinct universality classes. Near certain criticalities, we further find that the Wannier state correlation function associated with extended Berry connection of the ground state exhibits spatially anomalous behaviors. Finally, we analyze the scaling of the quantum geometric tensor near phase transitions across exceptional points, shedding light on the emergence of novel universality classes.</description>

      <title>Observation of optical vortex generation via magnon-induced Brillouin light scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exploration of physics involving orbital angular momentum (OAM) of light, first recognized in 1992, is essential for deepening our understanding of the interaction between light and matter and that opens up new applications. In systems with rotational symmetry, it is known that OAM can be exchanged between light and matter. One of the most common applications of such a phenomenon is manipulating the optical OAM through the exchange of OAM between light and a nematic liquid crystal-based spatial light modulator (SLM). It is already being used as a tool in many studies related to the optical OAM. However, the operation bandwidth is limited by the response speed 100 Hz of the liquid crystal, which hinders the applications of the optical OAM to spatial division multiplexing, quantum communication, and optical microscopy. The generation of optical vortex beams with the optical OAM in inelastic scattering by elementary excitations with gigahertz-order resonance may solve this problem, although it has not been studied so far. Here, we demonstrate the generation of the optical vortex beams using magnon-induced Brillouin light scattering. We observe scattering rules in the Brillouin light scattering which can be explained by conservation of total angular momentum including spins and orbits with photons and magnons. This work serves as a starting point for research into the interaction between optical vertices and magnons. It opens up devices with the novel mechanism of optical OAM generation together with high operation bandwidth.</description>

      <title>Towards Improved Quantum Machine Learning for Molecular Force Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores the use of equivariant quantum neural networks (QNN) for generating molecular force fields, focusing on the rMD17 dataset. We consider a QNN architecture based on previous research and point out shortcomings in the parametrization of the atomic environments, that limits its expressivity as an interatomic potential and precludes transferability between molecules. We propose a revised QNN architecture that addresses these shortcomings. While both QNNs show promise in force prediction, with the revised architecture showing improved accuracy, they struggle with energy prediction. Further, both QNNs architectures fail to demonstrate a meaningful scaling law of decreasing errors with increasing training data. These findings highlight the challenges of scaling QNNs for complex molecular systems and emphasize the need for improved encoding strategies, regularization techniques, and hybrid quantum-classical approaches.</description>

      <title>Generalization of Bohmian Mechanics and Quantum Gravity Effective Action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We generalize the de Broglie-Bohm (dBB) formulation of quantum mechanics to the case of quantum gravity (QG) by using the effective action for a QG theory. This is done by replacing the dBB equations of motion with the effective action equations of motion, which is beneficial even in the non-gravitational case, since in this way one avoids the violations of the Heisenberg uncertainity relations and the absence of the classical trajectories for stationary bound states. Another advantage of the effective action formalism is that one can obtain the field configurations in the case of a quantum field theory (QFT). The proposed QG generalization is natural for Bohmiam mechanics because a dBB wavefunction is really a wavefunction of the Universe and in order to define the effective action for an arbitrary initial state one needs a QG path integral. The QG effective action can be constructed by using the piecewise flat quantum gravity (PFQG) theory and the PFQG effective action can be approximated by the QFT effective action for General Relativity coupled to matter, with a cutoff determined by the average edge length of the spacetime triangulation. One can then calculate the corresponding field configurations and from these field configurations one can obtain the trajectories for the corresponding elementary particles.</description>

      <title>Electrically Reconfigurable NbOCl$_2$ Metasurface for Quantum Technologies</title>

Abstract: Entangled photon-pair sources are foundational to advancing quantum technologies, including secure communication, quantum sensing, and imaging. For deployment in space-constrained environments such as satellite-based quantum networks or portable devices, compact, reconfigurable, and efficient entanglement sources are essential. Here, we present an electrically tunable entangled photon-pair source utilizing a nanostructured NbOCl$_2$ crystal, engineered for operation in the telecommunication C-band. The inherent non-centrosymmetric lattice symmetry of NbOCl$_2$ enables direct generation of polarization-entangled Bell states without the need for post-selection, leveraging its exceptional second-order nonlinear susceptibility, which surpasses conventional nonlinear materials. By nanopatterning NbOCl$_2$ into a high-quality-factor metasurface, we achieve three orders of magnitude enhancement in photon-pair generation efficiency via resonant excitation of bound states in the continuum resonance, which intensify light-matter interactions. Furthermore, we demonstrate in situ electrical tunability of the photon-pair emission wavelength over a 250 nm range from 1450 nm to 1700 nm by dynamically modulating surrounding liquid crystal layer. Remarkably, the decoupling of photon-pair generation rate and spectral tunability ensures high brightness, above 10,000 coincidences, under active tuning. The air stability and mechanical robustness of NbOCl$_2$ further enhance its practicality for real-world deployment. This work establishes NbOCl$_2$ as a superior material for scalable, on-chip quantum light sources, paving the way for integrated quantum communication systems, adaptive sensors, and portable quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Design principles of deep translationally-symmetric neural quantum states for frustrated magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep neural network quantum states have emerged as a leading method for studying the ground states of quantum magnets. Successful architectures exploit translational symmetry, but the root of their effectiveness and differences between architectures remain unclear. Here, we apply the ConvNext architecture, designed to incorporate elements of transformers into convolutional networks, to quantum many-body ground states. We find that it is remarkably similar to the factored vision transformer, which has been employed successfully for several frustrated spin systems, allowing us to relate this architecture to more conventional convolutional networks. Through a series of numerical experiments we design the ConvNext to achieve greatest performance at lowest computational cost, then apply this network to the Shastry-Sutherland and J1-J2 models, obtaining variational energies comparable to the state of the art, providing a blueprint for network design choices of translationally-symmetric architectures to tackle challenging ground-state problems in frustrated magnetism.</description>

      <title>Highly squeezed nanophotonic quantum microcombs with broadband frequency tunability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Squeezed light offers genuine quantum advantage in enhanced sensing and quantum computation; yet the level of squeezing or quantum noise reduction generated from nanophotonic chips has been limited. In addition to strong quantum noise reduction, key desiderata for such a nanophotonic squeezer include frequency agility or tunability over a broad frequency range, and simultaneous operation in many distinct, well-defined quantum modes (qumodes). Here we present a strongly overcoupled silicon nitride squeezer based on a below-threshold optical parametric amplifier (OPA) that produces directly detected squeezing of 5.6 dB $\pm$ 0.2 dB, surpassing previous demonstrations in both continuous-wave and pulsed regimes. We introduce a seed-assisted detection technique into such nanophotonic squeezers that reveals a quantum frequency comb (QFC) of 16 qumodes, with a separation of 11~THz between the furthest qumode pair, while maintaining a strong squeezing. Additionally, we report spectral tuning of a qumode comb pair over one free-spectral range of the OPA, thus bridging the spacing between the discrete modes of the QFC. Our results significantly advance both the generation and detection of nanophotonic squeezed light in a broadband and multimode platform, establishing a scalable, chip-integrated path for compact quantum sensors and continuous-variable quantum information processing systems.</description>

      <title>Universal Acceleration of Quantum Relaxation by Reset-Induced Mpemba Effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.11170v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Slow relaxation processes spanning widely separated timescales pose fundamental challenges for probing steady-state properties and engineering functional quantum systems, such as quantum heat engines and quantum computing devices. We introduce a universal quantum reset protocol that enables exponential acceleration of relaxation in general Markovian open quantum systems. The protocol induces a quantum Mpemba effect, wherein systems initialized farther from equilibrium can relax faster than those closer to it, and crucially, this acceleration persists even when the slowest decaying Lindbladian modes form complex-conjugate pairs. Unlike previous approaches, which typically target a single mode, our protocol eliminates multiple relaxation modes simultaneously. This framework provides a versatile and experimentally feasible tool for controlling quantum relaxation timescales, with broad implications for quantum thermodynamics, computation, and state preparation.</description>

      <title>Concatenate codes, save qubits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09606v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The essential requirement for fault-tolerant quantum computation (FTQC) is the total protocol design to achieve a fair balance of all the critical factors relevant to its practical realization, such as the space overhead, the threshold, and the modularity. A major obstacle in realizing FTQC with conventional protocols, such as those based on the surface code and the concatenated Steane code, has been the space overhead, i.e., the required number of physical qubits per logical qubit. Protocols based on high-rate quantum low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes gather considerable attention as a way to reduce the space overhead, but problematically, the existing fault-tolerant protocols for such quantum LDPC codes sacrifice the other factors. Here we construct a new fault-tolerant protocol to meet these requirements simultaneously based on more recent progress on the techniques for concatenated codes rather than quantum LDPC codes, achieving a constant space overhead, a high threshold, and flexibility in modular architecture designs. In particular, under a physical error rate of $0.1\%$, our protocol reduces the space overhead to achieve the logical CNOT error rates $10^{-10}$ and $10^{-24}$ by more than $90 \%$ and $96 \%$, respectively, compared to the protocol for the surface code. Furthermore, our protocol achieves the threshold of $2.5 \%$ under a conventional circuit-level error model, substantially outperforming that of the surface code. The use of concatenated codes also naturally introduces abstraction layers essential for the modularity of FTQC architectures. These results indicate that the code-concatenation approach opens a way to significantly save qubits in realizing FTQC while fulfilling the other essential requirements for the practical protocol design.</description>

      <title>Noiseless Loss Suppression for Entanglement Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00510v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent work by Mi\v{c}uda et al. (arXiv:1206.2852v1) suggests that pairing noiseless amplification with noiseless attenuation can conditionally suppress loss terms in the direct transmission of quantum states. Here we extend this work to entangled states: first, we explore bipartite states, specifically the two-mode squeezed vacuum (TMSV) and NOON states; and second, we examine M-partite states, concentrating on W and Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states. In analogy with the original proposal, our results demonstrate that in each case under consideration, a correct combination of attenuation and amplification techniques before and after transmission through a pure loss channel can restore the initial quantum state. However, we find that for both W and NOON states, the noiseless attenuation is redundant and not required to achieve loss term suppression. This work clarifies the role of noiseless attenuation when paired with noiseless amplification for entanglement distribution and provides an operational example of how GHZ and W state entanglement differs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14396v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The reliable characterization of quantum states as well as any potential noise in various quantum systems is crucial for advancing quantum technologies. In this work we propose the concept of corrupted sensing quantum state tomography which enables the simultaneous reconstruction of quantum states and structured noise with the aid of simple Pauli measurements only. Without additional prior information, we investigate the reliability and robustness of the framework. The power of our algorithm is demonstrated by assuming Gaussian and Poisson sparse noise for low-rank state tomography. In particular, our approach is able to achieve a high quality of the recovery with incomplete sets of measurements and is also suitable for performance improvement of large quantum systems. It is envisaged that the techniques can become a practical tool to greatly reduce the cost and computational effort for quantum tomography in noisy quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Exact Spin Correlators of Integrable Quantum Circuits from Algebraic Geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16070v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We calculate the correlation functions of strings of spin operators for integrable quantum circuits exactly. These observables can be used for calibration of quantum simulation platforms. We use algebraic Bethe Ansatz, in combination with computational algebraic geometry to obtain analytic results for medium-size (around 10-20 qubits) quantum circuits. The results are rational functions of the quantum circuit parameters. We obtain analytic results for such correlation functions both in the real space and Fourier space. In the real space, we analyze the short time and long time limit of the correlation functions. In Fourier space, we obtain analytic results in different parameter regimes, which exhibit qualitatively different behaviors. Using these analytic results, one can easily generate numerical data to arbitrary precision.</description>

      <title>Dictionary-based sparse block encoding with low subnormalization and circuit depth</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18007v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Block encoding is a fundamental access model in quantum computing, serving as a key component in quantum singular value transformation. It encodes a matrix $A$ satisfying $\left\|A/ \alpha \right\|_{\text{op}} \leq 1$ into an enlarged unitary matrix $U_{A}$, where $\alpha$ denotes the \textit{subnormalization factor} that critically determines the query complexity of the block encoding. The \textit{circuit depth} is another crucial parameter that governs the efficiency of block-encoding implementations in quantum algorithms. This work presents a sparse block encoding scheme and its Hermitian variant, based on a novel dictionary data structure, to optimize the trade-off between \textit{subnormalization} and \textit{circuit depth}. The dictionary data structure establishes a unified framework for various sparse block-encoding techniques, with implementations connected to linear combinations of unitaries (LCU) methods. To demonstrate the practical utility of our approach, we provide several applications including Laplacian matrix in graph problems and some kinds of matrix in discrete differential function.</description>

      <title>Machine-Learning Insights into the Entanglement-trainability Correlation of Parameterized Quantum Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01997v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) have emerged as the leading strategy to obtain quantum advantage on the current noisy intermediate-scale devices. However, their entanglement-trainability correlation, as the major reason for the barren plateau (BP) phenomenon, poses a challenge to their applications. In this Letter, we suggest a gate-to-tensor (GTT) encoding method for parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs), with which two long short-term memory networks (L-G networks) are trained to predict both entanglement and trainability. The remarkable capabilities of the L-G networks afford a statistical way to delve into the entanglement-trainability correlation of PQCs within a dataset encompassing millions of instances. This machine-learning-driven method first confirms that the more entanglement, the more possible the BP problem. Then, we observe that there still exist PQCs with both high entanglement and high trainability. Furthermore, the trained L-G networks result in an impressive increase in time efficiency by about one million times when constructing a PQC with specific entanglement and trainability, demonstrating their practical applications in VQAs.</description>

Abstract: An entanglement purification protocol (EPP) aims to transform multiple noisy entangled states into a single entangled state with higher fidelity. In this work we consider EPPs that always yield an output fidelity no worse than each of the original noisy states, a property we call universality. We prove there is no $n$-to-1 EPP implementable by local operations and classical communication that is universal for all two-qubit entangled states, whereas such an EPP is possible using more general positive partial transpose-preserving (PPT) operations. We also show that universality is not possible by bilocal Clifford EPPs even when restricted to states with fidelities above an arbitrarily high threshold.</description>

Abstract: Throughout quantum science and technology, measurement is used as a powerful resource for nonlinear operations and quantum state engineering. In particular, single-photon detection is commonly employed for quantum-information applications and tests of fundamental physics. By contrast, and perhaps counter-intuitively, measurement of the absence of photons also provides useful information, and offers significant potential for a wide range of new experimental directions. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate cooling of a mechanical resonator below its laser-cooled mechanical occupation via zero-photon detection on the anti-Stokes scattered optical field and verify this cooling through heterodyne measurements. Our measurements are well captured by a stochastic master equation and the techniques introduced here open new avenues for cooling, quantum thermodynamics, quantum state engineering, and quantum measurement and control.</description>

      <title>Theoretical framework for enhancing or enabling cooling of a mechanical resonator via the anti-Stokes or Stokes interaction and zero-photon detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01735v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a theoretical framework to describe how zero-photon detection may be utilized to enhance laser cooling via the anti-Stokes interaction and, somewhat surprisingly, enable cooling via the Stokes interaction commonly associated with heating. Our description includes both pulsed and continuous measurements as well as optical detection efficiency and open-system dynamics. For both cases, we discuss how the cooling depends on the system parameters such as detection efficiency and optomechanical cooperativity, and we study the continuous-measurement-induced dynamics, contrasting to single-photon detection events. For the Stokes case, we explore the interplay between cooling and heating via optomechanical parametric amplification, and we find the efficiency required to cool a mechanical oscillator via zero-photon detection. This work serves as a companion article to the recent experiment [E. A. Cryer-Jenkins, K. D. Major, et al., arXiv:2408.01734 (2024)], which demonstrated enhanced laser cooling of a mechanical oscillator via zero-photon detection on the anti-Stokes signal. The framework developed here provides new approaches for cooling mechanical resonators that can be applied to a wide range of areas including nonclassical state preparation, quantum thermodynamics, and avoiding the often unwanted heating effects of parametric amplification.</description>

Abstract: As a core underlying operation in pattern recognition and machine learning, matrix multiplication plays a crucial role in modern machine learning models and constitutes a major contributor to computational expenditure. Hence, researchers have spent decades continuously searching for more efficient matrix multiplication algorithms.This paper firstly introduces an innovative and practical approach to universal quantum matrix multiplication. We designed optimized quantum adders and multipliers based on Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT), which significantly reduced the number of gates used compared to classical adders and multipliers. Subsequently, we construct the basic universal quantum matrix multiplication and extend it to the Strassen algorithm. We conduct comparative experiments to analyze the performance of the quantum matrix multiplication and evaluate the acceleration provided by the optimized quantum adder and multiplier. Finally, we investigate the advantages of the quantum Strassen algorithm and the basic quantum matrix multiplication. Our result opens, for the first time, a reliable pathway for designing universal quantum matrix multiplication. Following this pathway, quantum computing will unlock significantly greater potential for training modern machine learning models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04740v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The lack of information obtained from informationally incomplete quantum measurements can prevent the detection of quantum resources, such as optical nonclassicality. We develop a technique that overcomes this limitation for single-mode quantum states conditionally prepared through measurements on another mode of a two-mode state. This task is performed by testing steering of latent nonclassicality -- a class of correlations beyond quantum entanglement and quantum discord -- for which we introduce a rigorous description.</description>

      <title>Interplay between external driving, dissipation and collective effects in the Markovian and non-Markovian regimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03297v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding how external driving and dissipation jointly influence the dynamics of open quantum systems is essential for advancing the study of non-equilibrium quantum phenomena and developing quantum technologies. The present study addresses the issue by exploring the behavior of open systems in driven optical setups coupled to a bosonic field. Starting from an exact non-Markovian master equation for linear systems, we extend the analysis to an ensemble of quantum emitters and validate the proposed solution. The analytical results unveil a range of intriguing phenomena, including pronounced non-Markovian corrections to the coherent driving and a collective cross-driving effect. These effects are experimentally accessible in platforms such as cavity QED, photonic crystals, and state-dependent optical lattices. In the Markovian limit, comparison with exact solutions reveal short-time non-Markovian effects that endure well beyond the environmental correlation decay time, alongside memory effects triggered by short laser pulses. These findings offer valuable insights into the dynamics of driven open systems, laying the groundwork for precise quantum state control.</description>

      <title>Experimental demonstration of the Bell-type inequalities for four qubit Dicke state using IBM Quantum Processing Units</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20241v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Violation of the Bell-type inequalities is necessary to confirm the existence of nonlocality in nonclassical (entangled) states. We have designed a customized operator which is made of the sum of the Pauli matrices ($\sigma_x$, $\sigma_y$, and $\sigma_z$). We theoretically and experimentally investigate the violation of Bell-type inequalities using two- and four-qubit Dicke states on IBM Quantum Processing Units (QPUs). We compare two different state preparation methods for the four-qubit Dicke state -- gate-based and statevector-based -- and evaluate their performance on two IBM QPUs, \texttt{ibm\_kyiv} and \texttt{ibm\_sherbrook}. For the two-qubit case, we demonstrate clear violations of the CHSH inequality, with the highest observed Bell parameter reaching $2.821 \pm 0.0019$ using M3 error mitigation, which is within $0.7\sigma$ of the theoretical maximum $2\sqrt{2}$. In the four-qubit case, we employ a Bell-type inequality tailored for Dicke states and achieve a maximum violation of $2.607 \pm 0.029$ without the need for additional mitigation when using the statevector-based method. Our results reveal that advanced error mitigation techniques significantly enhance the observed violations in the gate-based method, while the statevector-based approach inherently yields more robust states with lower noise. This study highlights the critical role of state preparation and mitigation techniques in probing fundamental quantum correlations on near-term quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Quantum computing inspired paintings: reinterpreting classical masterpieces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09549v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We aim to apply a quantum computing technique to compose artworks. The main idea is to revisit three paintings of different styles and historical periods: ''Narciso'', painted circa 1597-1599 by Michelangelo Merisi (Caravaggio), ''Les fils de l'homme'', painted in 1964 by Rene Magritte and ''192 Farben'', painted in 1966 by Gerard Richter. We utilize the output of a quantum computation to change the composition in the paintings, leading to a paintings series titled ''Quantum Transformation I, II, III''. In particular, the figures are discretized into square lattices and the order of the pieces is changed according to the result of the quantum simulation. We consider an Ising Hamiltonian as the observable in the quantum computation and its time evolution as the final outcome. From a classical subject to abstract forms, we seek to combine classical and quantum aesthetics through these three art pieces. Besides experimenting with hardware runs and circuit noise, our goal is to reproduce these works as physical oil paintings on wooden panels. With this process, we complete a full circle between classical and quantum techniques and contribute to rethinking Art practice in the era of quantum computing technologies.</description>

      <title>Parametrized multiqubit gate design for neutral-atom based quantum platforms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19785v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A clever choice and design of gate sets can reduce the depth of a quantum circuit, and can improve the quality of the solution one obtains from a quantum algorithm. This is especially important for near-term quantum computers that suffer from various sources of error that propagate with the circuit depth. Parametrized gates in particular have found use in both near-term algorithms and circuit compilation. The one- and two-qubit versions of these gates have been demonstrated on various computing architectures. The neutral atom platform has the capability to implement native $N$-qubit gates (for $N \geq 2$). However, one needs to first find the control functions that implement these gates on the hardware. We study the numerical optimization of neural networks towards obtaining families of controls $-$ laser pulses to excite an atom to Rydberg states $-$ that implement phase gates with one and two controls, the $\mathrm{C_1P}$ and $\mathrm{C_2P}$ gates respectively, on neutral atom hardware. The pulses we obtain have a duration significantly shorter than the loss time scale, set by decay from the Rydberg state. Further, they do not require single-site addressability and are smooth. Hence, we expect our gates to have immediate benefits for quantum algorithms implemented on current neutral atom hardware.</description>

      <title>Partial Wavefunction Collapse Under Repeated Weak Measurement of a non-Conserved Observable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05226v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two hallmarks of quantum non-demolition (QND) measurement are the ensemble-level conservation of the expectation value of the measured observable $A$ and the eventual, inevitable collapse of the system into some eigenstate of $A$. This requires that $A$ commutes with $H$, the system's Hamiltonian. In what we term "Auxiliary Observable QND" measurement, $A$ does not commute with $H$ and the above two characteristics clearly cannot be present as the system's dynamics prevent $\langle A \rangle$ from reaching a definite value. However, in this paper we find that under such a measurement QND behavior still arises, but is seen in the behavior of a secondary "target" observable we call $B$, with the condition that $B$ commutes with both $A$ and $H$. In such cases, the expectation value of $B$ is conserved and the system at least partially collapses with respect to eigenstates of $B$. We show as an example how this surprising result applies to a Heisenberg chain, where we demonstrate that local measurements on a single site can reveal information about the spectrum of an entire system, a finding which may be of practical use in experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20244v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Studying the typical entanglement entropy of a bipartite system when averaging over different ensembles of pure quantum states has been instrumental in different areas of physics, ranging from many-body quantum chaos to black hole evaporation. We extend such analysis to open quantum systems and mixed states, where we compute the typical mutual information in a bipartite system averaged over the ensemble of mixed Gaussian states with a fixed spectrum. Tools from random matrix theory and determinantal point processes allow us to compute arbitrary k-point correlation functions of the singular values of the corresponding complex structure in a subsystem for a given spectrum in the full system. In particular, we evaluate the average von Neumann entropy in a subsystem based on the level density and the average mutual information. Those results are given for finite system size as well as in the thermodynamic limit.</description>

      <title>Genuine quantum non-Gaussianity and metrological sensitivity of Fock states prepared in a mechanical resonator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20971v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fock states of the quantum harmonic oscillator are fundamental to quantum sensing and information processing, serving as key resources for exploiting bosonic degrees of freedom. Here, we prepare high Fock states in a high-overtone bulk acoustic wave resonator (HBAR) by coupling it to a superconducting qubit and applying microwave pulses designed using quantum optimal control. We characterize the experimentally realized states by employing a criterion for genuine quantum non-Gaussianity (QNG) designed to reveal multiphonon contributions. Although energy relaxation and decoherence limit the achievable fidelities, we demonstrate genuine QNG features compatible with Fock state $\vert 6\rangle$, confirming that the prepared states cannot be generated through Gaussian operations on states with up to Fock state $\vert 5\rangle$ contributions. We further investigate the robustness of these QNG features to losses and their utility in sensing displacement amplitudes. In particular, we introduce a hierarchy based on the quantum Fisher information and show that, despite decoherence and measurement imperfections, the prepared states achieve a displacement sensitivity surpassing that of an ideal Fock state $\vert 3\rangle$. Our results have immediate applications in quantum sensing and simulations with HBAR devices.</description>

Abstract: Coupled optical cavities, which support normal modes, play a critical role in optical filtering, sensing, slow-light generation, and quantum state manipulation. Recent theoretical work has proposed incorporating nonlinear materials into these systems to enable novel quantum technologies. Here, we report the first experimental demonstration of squeezing generated in a quantum-enhanced coupled-cavity system, achieving a quantum noise reduction of 3.3 dB around the normal-mode splitting frequency of 7.47 MHz. We provide a comprehensive analysis of the system's loss mechanisms and performance limitations, validating theoretical predictions. Our results underscore the promise of coupled-cavity squeezers for advanced quantum applications, including gravitational wave detection and precision sensing.</description>

      <title>Quantum Codes with Addressable and Transversal Non-Clifford Gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01864v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The development of quantum codes with good error correction parameters and useful sets of transversal gates is a problem of major interest in quantum error-correction. Abundant prior works have studied transversal gates which are restricted to acting on all logical qubits simultaneously. In this work, we study codes that support transversal gates which induce $\textit{addressable}$ logical gates, i.e., the logical gates act on logical qubits of our choice. As we consider scaling to high-rate codes, the study and design of low-overhead, addressable logical operations presents an important problem for both theoretical and practical purposes.
  Our primary result is the construction of an explicit qubit code for which $\textit{any}$ triple of logical qubits across one, two, or three codeblocks can be addressed with a logical $\mathsf{CCZ}$ gate via a depth-one circuit of physical $\mathsf{CCZ}$ gates, and whose parameters are asymptotically good, up to polylogarithmic factors. The result naturally generalizes to other gates including the $\mathsf{C}^{\ell} Z$ gates for $\ell \neq 2$.
  Going beyond this, we develop a formalism for constructing quantum codes with $\textit{addressable and transversal}$ gates. Our framework, called $\textit{addressable orthogonality}$, encompasses the original triorthogonality framework of Bravyi and Haah (Phys. Rev. A 2012), and extends this and other frameworks to study addressable gates. We demonstrate the power of this framework with the construction of an asymptotically good qubit code for which $\textit{pre-designed}$, pairwise disjoint triples of logical qubits within a single codeblock may be addressed with a logical $\mathsf{CCZ}$ gate via a physical depth-one circuit of $\mathsf{Z}$, $\mathsf{CZ}$ and $\mathsf{CCZ}$ gates. In an appendix, we show that our framework extends to addressable and transversal $T$ gates, up to Clifford corrections.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04081v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we experimentally demonstrate an eavesdropper's (Eve's) information gain by exploiting the breakdown flash generated by the single photon avalanche detector (SPAD) used in coherent one-way quantum key distribution (COW-QKD) setup. Unlike prior studies focusing on the device-level characterization of backflash photons, this work quantifies Eve's learning with a QKD system that includes a key distillation engine (KDE). Eve's learning is quantified using the backflash photons emitted by SPAD and the information available on the classical channel. Experimentally observed data are in good agreement with theoretical simulations. Some mitigation strategies against the backflash attack are also discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05767v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply a mixed quantum-classical (MQC) approach to the quantum Rabi model, involving a classical optical field coupled self-consistently to a quantum two-level system. Under the rotating wave approximation, we analytically show this approach to yield persistent yet anharmonic Rabi oscillations, governed by an undamped and unforced Duffing equation. We consider the single-quantum limit, where we find such anharmonic Rabi oscillations to closely follow full-quantum results once zero-point energy is approximately enforced when initializing the optical field coordinate. Our findings provide guidance in the application of MQC dynamics to classes of problems involving small quantum numbers and far away from decoherence.</description>

      <title>Reducing thermal noises by quantum refrigerators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08067v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reducing the thermal noises in microwave (MW) resonators can bring about significant progress in many research fields. In this study, we consider using three-level or four-level systems as "quantum refrigerators" to cool down MW resonators so as to reduce the thermal noises, and investigate their possible cooling limits. In such a quantum refrigerator system, the MW resonator is coupled with many three-level or four-level systems. Proper light pump makes the multilevel systems concentrated into their ground states, which continuously absorb the thermal photons in the MW resonator. By adiabatic elimination, we give a more precise description for this cooling process. For three level systems, though the laser driving can cool down the multilevel systems efficiently, a too strong driving strength also significantly perturbs their energy levels, breaking the resonant interaction between the atom and the resonator, which weakens the cooling effect, and that sets a finite region for cooling parameters. In four level systems, by adopting an indirect pumping approach, such a finite cooling region can be further released. In both cases, we obtain analytical results for the cooling limit of the MW resonator. Based on practical parameters, our estimation shows the cooling limit could reach lower than the liquid helium temperature, without resorting to the traditional cryogenic systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12739v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the problem of routing quantum and classical information from one sender to many possible receivers in a network. By employing the formalism of quantum walks, we describe the dynamics on a discrete structure based on a complete graph, where the sites naturally provide a basis for encoding the quantum state to be transmitted. Upon tuning a single phase or weight in the Hamiltonian, we achieve near-unitary routing fidelity, enabling the selective delivery of information to designated receivers for both classical and quantum data. The structure is inherently scalable, accommodating an arbitrary number of receivers. The routing time is largely independent of the network dimension and input state, and the routing performance is robust under static and dynamic noise, at least for short time.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Atom Loss Errors in Fault Tolerant Quantum Algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20558v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Errors associated with qubit loss constitute an important source of noise in many quantum hardware systems, particularly in neutral atom quantum computers. We develop a theoretical framework to handle these errors in logical algorithms, incorporating decoding techniques and circuit-level optimizations. Focusing on experimentally-motivated error models, we introduce a delayed-erasure decoder which leverages information from state-selective readout to accurately correct loss errors, even when their precise locations are unknown. Our decoding technique is compatible with a wide range of quantum error correction codes and general logical circuits. Using this decoder, we identify strategies for detecting and correcting atom loss based on the logical circuit structure. For deep circuits with a large number of gate layers prior to logical measurements, we explore methods to integrate loss detection into syndrome extraction with minimal overhead, identifying optimal strategies depending on the qubit loss fraction in the noise. In contrast, many algorithmic subroutines involve frequent gate teleportation, shortening the circuit depth before logical measurement and naturally replacing qubits without additional overhead. We simulate such a teleportation-based algorithm, involving a toy model for small-angle synthesis and find a significant improvement in logical error rates as the loss fraction increases, with loss handled solely through teleportation. These results provide a path forward for advancing large-scale fault tolerant quantum computation in systems with loss errors.</description>

      <title>Cooperative squeezing of internal and collective spins in an atomic ensemble</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05446v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Creating highly spin-squeezed states for quantum metrology surpassing the standard quantum limit is a topic of great interest. Spin squeezing has been achieved by either entangling different atoms in an ensemble, or by controlling the multi-level internal spin state of an atom. Here, we experimentally demonstrate combined internal and collective spin squeezing in a hot atomic ensemble with $\sim 10^{11}$ rubidium atoms. By synergistically combining these two types of squeezing and carefully aligning their squeezing quadratures, we have achieved a metrologically relevant spin squeezing of $-6.21\pm0.84$ dB, significantly outperforming the results obtained by utilizing either type of squeezing alone. Our approach provides a new perspective on fully harnessing the degrees of freedom inherent in quantum states of an atomic ensemble.</description>

      <title>Robust entangled photon generation enabled by single-shot Floquet driving</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02753v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum emitters driven by resonant two-photon excitation are a leading source for deterministically generated entangled photon pairs, essential for scalable photonic quantum technologies. However, conventional resonant schemes are highly sensitive to laser power fluctuations and pose additional experimental challenges for emitters with small biexciton binding energies. Here, we demonstrate how biexciton preparation schemes with significantly improved robustness and reduced laser filtering requirements can be identified using a novel design principle beyond resonant and adiabatic driving: ultrafast single-shot Floquet driving. This is achieved by employing two strongly and symmetrically detuned dichromatic pulses, whose superposition generates a stroboscopic Hamiltonian that enables direct coupling between ground and biexciton states. Moreover, a pulse delay serves as a tuning knob, introducing an effective magnetic field that concentrates the Bloch sphere trajectory at the biexciton state for a wide range of parameters, making biexciton preparation particularly robust. Experimentally, we achieve a biexciton occupation exceeding 96% and preserve photon-pair entanglement with a fidelity of 93.4%. Our scheme highlights the great impact of Floquet-engineered multicolour excitation protocols for on-demand quantum light sources.</description>

      <title>Computing Canonical Averages with Quantum and Classical Optimizers: Thermodynamic Reweighting for QUBO Models of Physical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07094v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a general method to compute canonical averages for physical models sampled via quantum or classical quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO). First, we introduce a histogram reweighting scheme applicable to QUBO-based sampling constrained to specific intervals of an order parameter, e.g., physical energy. Next, we demonstrate that the scheme can accurately recover the density of states, which in turn allows for calculating expectation values in the conjugate ensemble, e.g., at a fixed temperature. The method can thus be used to advance the state-of-the-art characterization of physical systems that admit a QUBO-based representation and that are otherwise intractable with real-space sampling methods. A case in point are space-filling melts of lattice ring polymers, recently mapped in QUBO form, for which our method reveals that the ring catenation probability is non-monotonic with the bending rigidity.</description>

Abstract: (i) We point out that every local unitary circuit of depth smaller than the linear system size is easily distinguished from a global Haar random unitary if there is a conserved quantity that is a sum of local operators. This is always the case with a continuous onsite symmetry or with a local energy conservation law. (ii) We explain a simple algorithm for a formulation of the shallow unitary circuit learning problem and relate it to an open question on strictly locality-preserving unitaries (quantum cellular automata). (iii) We show that any translation-invariant quantum cellular automaton in $D$-dimensional lattice of volume $V$ can be implemented using only $O(V)$ local gates in a staircase fashion.</description>

      <title>Fidelity and efficiency analysis for heralded entanglement swapping in lossy channels: linear and nonlinear optical approaches</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16066v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bell state measurements (BSMs) of photonic qubits are used for quantum networking protocols to herald the distribution and transfer of quantum information. However, standard BSMs based on linear optics (LO-BSMs) require identical photons and are susceptible to errors from multiphoton emissions, leading to reduced fidelity of protocols, particularly in the absence of postselection. To overcome these challenges, Bell state measurements based on nonlinear optics (NLO-BSMs) have been proposed and implemented, leveraging sum-frequency generation (SFG) to filter out multiphoton emissions and improve the fidelity without postselection. Here we analyze the fidelity of LO-BSM and NLO-BSM heralded entanglement swapping in lossy channels and compare their performance under realistic conditions. We also explore the impact of state-of-the-art nonlinear photonics platforms on SFG efficiency and highlight how advances in nanophotonics will enable practical, high-fidelity NLO-BSM-based quantum networking applications.</description>

      <title>Advancing Superconducting Qubits: CMOS-Compatible Processing and Room Temperature Characterization for Scalable Quantum Computing beyond 2D Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18173v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on an industry-grade CMOS-compatible qubit fabrication approach using a CMOS pilot line, enabling a yield of functional devices reaching 92.8%, with a resistance spread evaluated across the full wafer 200 mm diameter of 12.4% and relaxation times (T1) approaching 80 us. Furthermore, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of wafer-scale room temperature (RT) characteristics collected from multiple wafers and fabrication runs, focusing on RT measurements and their correlation to low temperature qubit parameters. From defined test structures, a across-wafer junction area variation of 10.1% and oxide barrier variation of 7.2% was calculated. Additionally, we notably show a close-correlation between qubit junction resistance and frequency in accordance with the Ambegaokar-Baratoff relation with a critical temperature Tc of about 0.71 K. This overarching relation sets the stage for pre-cooldown qubit evaluation and sorting. In particular, such early-on device characterization and validation are crucial for increasing the fabrication yield and qubit frequency targeting, which currently represent major scaling challenges. Furthermore, it enables the fabrication of large multichip quantum systems in the future. Our findings highlight the great potential of CMOS-compatible industry-style fabrication of superconducting qubits for scalable quantum computing in a foundry pilot line cleanroom.</description>

      <title>Quantum circuit lower bounds in the magic hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19966v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the magic hierarchy, a quantum circuit model that alternates between arbitrary-sized Clifford circuits and constant-depth circuits with two-qubit gates ($\textsf{QNC}^0$). This model unifies existing circuit models, such as $\textsf{QAC}^0_f$ and models with adaptive intermediate measurements. Despite its generality, we are able to prove nontrivial lower bounds.
  We prove new lower bounds in the first level of the hierarchy, showing that certain explicit quantum states cannot be approximately prepared by circuits consisting of a Clifford circuit followed by $\textsf{QNC}^0$. These states include ground states of some topologically ordered Hamiltonians and nonstabilizer quantum codes. Our techniques exploit the rigid structure of stabilizer codes and introduce an infectiousness property: if even a single state in a high distance code can be approximately prepared by one of these circuits, then the entire subspace must lie close to a perturbed stabilizer code. We also show that proving state preparation lower bounds beyond a certain level of the hierarchy would imply classical circuit lower bounds beyond the reach of current techniques in complexity theory.
  More broadly, our techniques go beyond lightcone-based methods and highlight how the magic hierarchy provides a natural framework for connecting circuit complexity, condensed matter, and Hamiltonian complexity.</description>

Abstract: We report the demonstration of spatially translating a stored optical pulse at room temperature over distances exceeding one optical wavelength. By implementing an interferometric scheme, we further measure the average speed of this linear translation, thus harnessing a stopped-light experiment for a sensing application.

      <title>Black holes, fast scrambling and the breakdown of the equivalence principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.02053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.02053v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Under reasonable assumptions, black holes have been argued to form firewalls, burning up anything crossing their horizons. This argument finds that a firewall would appear very late in a black hole's lifetime, when Hawking radiation has caused the horizon to shrink to one-half its original area. For stellar-mass black holes, this process surpasses the universe's current age and so no such black hole would currently possess a firewall. However, black holes have recently been conjectured to scramble their interior degrees-of-freedom, with a scrambling time scale comparable to the time it takes light to travel a Schwartzschild radius' distance. We prove that local observers will already experience a firewall from the scrambling time onwards after the black hole's formation. Here `local' means that the observer couples to fewer than one-half the black hole's total interior `qubits.' Indeed, for observers to fail to be local in this manner, it would mean that they couple to more `qubits' within such black holes than exist in all the stars of the observable universe. Therefore we find that if black holes are indeed fast scramblers, then every astrophysical black hole in the universe will already have a fully developed firewall for any local physical process.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Resonant and Broadband Detection of Ultralight Dark Matter and High-Frequency Gravitational Waves via Cavities and Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.12387v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electromagnetic resonant systems, such as cavities and LC circuits, are widely used to detect ultralight boson dark matter and high-frequency gravitational waves. However, the narrow bandwidth of single-mode resonators necessitates multiple scan steps to cover broad frequency ranges. By incorporating a network of auxiliary modes via beam-splitter-type and non-degenerate parametric couplings, we enable broadband detection with an effective bandwidth of each scan matching the order of the resonant frequency, while maintaining a strong signal response. In heterodyne upconversion detection, where a background cavity mode transitions into another due to a potential background source, multiple orders of the source frequency can be probed with high sensitivity without tuning the cavity frequency. Consequently, our method allows for significantly deeper exploration of the parameter space within the same integration time compared to single-mode detection.</description>

      <title>Are Colors Quanta of Light for Human Vision? A Quantum Cognition Study of Visual Perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18850v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that colors are light quanta for human visual perception in a similar way as photons are light quanta for physical measurements of light waves. Our result relies on the identification in the quantum measurement process itself of the warping mechanism which is characteristic of human perception. This warping mechanism makes stimuli classified into the same category perceived as more similar, while stimuli classified into different m categories are perceived as more different. In the quantum measurement process, the warping takes place between the pure states, which play the role played for human perception by the stimuli, and the density states after decoherence, which play the role played for human perception by the percepts. We use the natural metric for pure states, namely the normalized Fubini Study metric to measure distances between pure states, and the natural metric for density states, namely the normalized trace-class metric, to measure distances between density states. We then show that when pure states lie within a well-defined region surrounding an eigenstate, the quantum measurement, namely the process of decoherence, contracts the distance between these pure states, while the reverse happens for pure states lying in a well-defined region between two eigenstates, for which the quantum measurement causes a dilation. We elaborate as an example the situation of a two-dimensional quantum measurement described by the Bloch model and apply it to the situation of two colors 'Light' and 'Dark'. We argue that this analogy of warping, on the one hand in human perception and on the other hand in the quantum measurement process, makes colors to be quanta of light for human vision.</description>

      <title>Continuous Transition between Bosonic Fractional Chern Insulator and Superfluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18269v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The properties of fractional Chern insulator (FCI) phases and the phase transitions between FCI and Mott insulators (MI) in bosonic systems are well studied. The continuous transitions between FCI and superfluid (SF), however, despite the inspiring field theoretical predictions, have not been directly verified. The existing numerical results of the FCI-SF transition are either indirect or clearly first-order. Here, by simply tuning the bandwidth of the Haldane honeycomb lattice model, we find direct transitions from a bosonic FCI at $\nu=1/2$ filling of a flat Chern band to two SF states with bosons condensed at momenta M or $\Gamma$, respectively. While the FCI-SF(M) transition is first-order, the FCI-SF($\Gamma$) transition is found continuous, and the bipartite entanglement entropy at the critical point with the area-law scaling is consistent with the critical theories. Through finite size criticality analysis, the obtained critical exponents $\beta\approx$ 0.35(5) and $\nu\approx$ 0.62(12) are both compatible with those of the 3D XY universality class within numerical uncertainty and possibly more exotic beyond-Landau ones. This letter thence presents a direct numerical demonstration of a continuous FCI-SF transition between topologically ordered phase and spontaneous continuous symmetry-breaking phase, and further indicates the zero-field bosonic FCI might be realized from a SF state by gradually flattening the dispersion of the Chern band, through the (quasi)adiabatic preparation in ultracold atom systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20479v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The theory of the set-theoretic Yang-Baxter equation is reviewed from a purely algebraic point of view. We recall certain algebraic structures called shelves, racks and quandles. These objects satisfy a self-distributivity condition and lead to solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation. We also recall that non-involutive solutions of the braid equation are obtained from shelf and rack solutions by a suitable parametric twist, whereas all involutive set-theoretic solutions are reduced to the flip map via a parametric twist. The notion of braces is also presented as the suitable algebraic structure associated to involutive set-theoretic solutions. The quantum algebra as well as the integrability of Baxterized involutive set-theoretic solutions is also discussed. The explicit form of the Drinfel'd twist is presented allowing the derivation of general set-theoretic solutions.</description>

The MPO form enables efficient evaluation of high-dimensional integrals that arise in solving the time-dependent and time-independent Schr\"odinger equation and effectively overcomes the so-called curse of dimensionality. This starkly contrasts with other neural network-based machine learning PES methods, such as multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), where evaluating high-dimensional integrals is not straightforward due to the fully connected topology in their backbone architecture. Nevertheless, the NN-MPO retains the high representational capacity of neural networks. NN-MPO can achieve spectroscopic accuracy with a test mean absolute error (MAE) of 3.03 cm$^{-1}$ for a fully coupled six-dimensional ab initio PES, using only 625 training points distributed across a 0 to 17,000 cm$^{-1}$ energy range. Our Python implementation is available at https://github.com/KenHino/Pompon.</description>

      <title>Modular Autonomous Virtualization System for Two-Dimensional Semiconductor Quantum Dot Arrays</title>

Abstract: Arrays of gate-defined semiconductor quantum dots are among the leading candidates for building scalable quantum processors. High-fidelity initialization, control, and readout of spin qubit registers require exquisite and targeted control over key Hamiltonian parameters that define the electrostatic environment. However, due to the tight gate pitch, capacitive crosstalk between gates hinders independent tuning of chemical potentials and interdot couplings. While virtual gates offer a practical solution, determining all the required cross-capacitance matrices accurately and efficiently in large quantum dot registers is an open challenge. Here, we establish a modular automated virtualization system (MAViS) -- a general and modular framework for autonomously constructing a complete stack of multilayer virtual gates in real time. Our method employs machine learning techniques to rapidly extract features from two-dimensional charge stability diagrams. We then utilize computer vision and regression models to self-consistently determine all relative capacitive couplings necessary for virtualizing plunger and barrier gates in both low- and high-tunnel-coupling regimes. Using MAViS, we successfully demonstrate accurate virtualization of a dense two-dimensional array comprising ten quantum dots defined in a high-quality Ge/SiGe heterostructure. Our work offers an elegant and practical solution for the efficient control of large-scale semiconductor quantum dot systems.</description>

      <title>Accuracy of time-dependent GGE under weak dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01896v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unitary integrable models typically relax to a stationary Generalized Gibbs Ensemble (GGE), but in experimental realizations dissipation often breaks integrability. In this work, we use the recently introduced time-dependent GGE (t-GGE) approach to describe the open dynamics of a gas of bosons subject to atom losses and gains. We employ tensor network methods to provide numerical evidence of the exactness of the t-GGE in the limit of adiabatic dissipation, and of its accuracy in the regime of weak but finite dissipation. That accuracy is tested for two-point functions via the rapidity distribution, and for more complicated correlations through a non-Gaussianity measure. We combine this description with Generalized Hydrodynamics and we show that it correctly captures transport at the Euler scale. Our results demonstrate that the t-GGE approach is robust in both homogeneous and inhomogeneous settings.</description>

      <title>Regularized second-order optimization of tensor-network Born machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18691v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tensor-network Born machines (TNBMs) are quantum-inspired generative models for learning data distributions. Using tensor-network contraction and optimization techniques, the model learns an efficient representation of the target distribution, capable of capturing complex correlations with a compact parameterization. Despite their promise, the optimization of TNBMs presents several challenges. A key bottleneck of TNBMs is the logarithmic nature of the loss function commonly used for this problem. The single-tensor logarithmic optimization problem cannot be solved analytically, necessitating an iterative approach that slows down convergence and increases the risk of getting trapped in one of many non-optimal local minima. In this paper, we present an improved second-order optimization technique for TNBM training, which significantly enhances convergence rates and the quality of the optimized model. Our method employs a modified Newton's method on the manifold of normalized states, incorporating regularization of the loss landscape to mitigate local minima issues. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by training a one-dimensional matrix product state (MPS) on both discrete and continuous datasets, showcasing its advantages in terms of stability and efficiency, and demonstrating its potential as a robust and scalable approach for optimizing quantum-inspired generative models.</description>

      <title>Twist-Induced Effects on Weyl Pairs in Magnetized Graphene Nanoribbons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08789v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an analytical investigation into the dynamics of Weyl pairs within magnetized helicoidal graphene nanoribbons. By embedding a curved surface into flat Minkowski space-time, we derive a fully covariant two-body Dirac equation specific to this system. We begin by formulating a non-perturbative wave equation that governs the relative motion of the Weyl pairs and obtain exact solutions. Our results demonstrate the influence of the uniform magnetic field and the number of twists on the dynamics of Weyl pairs in graphene nanoribbons, providing precise energy values that lay a robust foundation for future research. Furthermore, we examine the material's response to perturbation fields by calculating the polarization function and investigating how twisting and magnetic fields affect this response. Our findings indicate that, in principle, the material's properties, which are crucial for practical applications, can be effectively controlled by precisely tuning the magnetic field and the number of twists in graphene nanoribbons.</description>

      <title>Three-local Conserved Charge Implies Quantum Integrability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17773v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is shown that the conservation of a local charge supported by three neighboring sites, or its local version, Reshetikhin's condition, suffices to guarantee the existence of all higher conserved charges and hence the integrability of a quantum spin chain. This establishes Grabowski and Mathieu's long-standing conjecture as a theorem, ending the folklore that the existence of higher conserved charges imposes additional constraints not implied by the conservation of the three-local charge.</description>
