      <title>Equilibrium stresses in frameworks via symmetric averaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a bar-joint framework $(G,p)$, a subgroup $\Gamma$ of the automorphism group of $G$, and a subgroup of the orthogonal group isomorphic to $\Gamma$, we introduce a symmetric averaging map which produces a bar-joint framework on $G$ with that symmetry. If the original configuration is ``almost symmetric", then the averaged one will be near the original configuration. With a view on structural engineering applications, we then introduce a hierarchy of definitions of ``localised" and ``non-localised" or ``extensive" self-stresses of frameworks and investigate their behaviour under the symmetric averaging procedure. Finally, we present algorithms for finding non-degenerate symmetric frameworks with many states of self-stress, as well as non-symmetric and symmetric frameworks with extensive self-stresses. The latter uses the symmetric averaging map in combination with symmetric Maxwell-type character counts and a procedure based on the pure condition from algebraic geometry. These algorithms provide new theoretical and computational tools for the design of engineering structures such as gridshell roofs.</description>

      <title>Arrangements of circles, the regions surrounded by them and labeled Poincar\'e-Reeb graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We are interested in arrangements of circles and the regions surrounded by them. {\it Poincar\'e-Reeb graphs} have been fundamental and strong tools in studying shapes of regions surrounded by real algebraic curves, since around 2020. They are natural graphs the regions naturally collapse to and were first formulated by Sorea with several researchers. Studying shapes of such regions is one of fundamental studies in real algebraic geometry and combinatorics for example. This is surprisingly new and recently developing.
  Our study introduces labels on vertices and edges of such graphs encoding information of the circles where we concentrate on regions surrounded by circles. The author studied local changes of Poincar\'e-Reeb graphs by addition of circles under certain rules before and we discuss changes of new types. The author has started related studies motivated by singularity theory of real algebraic maps and found first that our regions are the images of natural real algebraic maps, generalizing natural projections of spheres.</description>

      <title>Self-affine quadrangles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A quadrangle in the Euclidean plane is called $n$-self-affine if it has a dissection into $n$ affine images of itself. All convex quadrangles are known to be $n$-self-affine for every $n \ge 5$. The only $2$-self-affine convex quadrangles are trapezoids. Here we characterize all $3$-self-affine convex quadrangles, obtaining $5$ one-parameter families and $13$ singular examples of affine types. This way we reduce the quest for all $n$-self-affine convex quadrangles to the open case $n=4$.
  In addition, we show that there are $n$-self-affine non-convex quadrangles for all $n \ge 3$, but not for $n=2$.</description>

      <title>Coarse cops and robber in graphs and groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: (abstract shortened to meet arxiv's length requirements) We investigate two variants of the classical Cops and robber game in graphs, recently introduced by Lee, Mart\'inez-Pedroza, and Rodr\'iguez-Quinche. The two versions are played in infinite graphs and the goal of the cops is to prevent the robber to visit some ball of finite radius (chosen by the robber) infinitely many times. Moreover the cops and the robber move at a different speed, and the cops can choose a radius of capture before the game starts. Depending on the order in which the parameters are chosen, this naturally defines two games, a weak version and a strong version (in which the cops are more powerful), and thus two variants of the cop number of a graph $G$: the weak cop number and the strong cop number. It turns out that these two parameters are invariant under quasi-isometry and thus we can investigate these parameters in finitely generated groups by considering any of their Cayley graphs; the parameters do not depend on the chosen set of generators.
  We answer a number of questions raised by Lee, Mart\'inez-Pedroza, and Rodr\'iguez-Quinche, and more recently by Cornect and Mart\'inez-Pedroza. This includes a proof that the weak and strong cop numbers are monotone under quasi-isometric embedding, characterizations of graphs of weak cop number 1 and graphs of strong cop number 1, and a proof that the grid has infinite strong cop number. Moreover we tie the weak cop number of a graph $G$ to the existence of asymptotic minors of large tree-width in $G$, and use the result to prove that any finitely presented group has weak cop number 1 or $\infty$.
  We have learned very recently that some of our results have been obtained independently by Appenzeller and Klinge, using fairly different arguments.</description>

      <title>Kinetic Optimal Transport (OTIKIN) -- Part 1: Second-Order Discrepancies Between Probability Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is the first of a series of papers aimed at constructing a general theory of optimal transport to describe the time evolution of complex systems of interacting particles at the kinetic level. We argue that this theory may have applications also to biology (RNA sequencing and cell development), computer vision (continuous interpolation of images), and engineering (optimal steering).
  Firstly, we define our main object: a new second-order discrepancy between probability measures, analogous to the $2$-Wasserstein distance, but based on the minimisation of the squared acceleration.
  Secondly, we prove existence for the associated Kantorovich problem, and, under suitable conditions, of an optimal transport map. We also provide an equivalent time-continuous characterisation (Benamou--Brenier formula), where the admissible curves of measures are solutions to an adapted class of Vlasov's continuity equations.
  Thirdly, we define a class of absolutely continuous curves of measures and prove that they coincide exactly with time reparametrisations of solutions to Vlasov's equations.</description>

      <title>Solving clustered low-rank semidefinite programs arising from polynomial optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.12077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.12077v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a primal-dual interior point method specialized to clustered low-rank semidefinite programs requiring high precision numerics, which arise from certain multivariate polynomial (matrix) programs through sums-of-squares characterizations and sampling. We consider the interplay of sampling and symmetry reduction as well as a greedy method to obtain numerically good bases and sample points. We apply this to the computation of three-point bounds for the kissing number problem, for which we show a significant speedup. This allows for the computation of improved kissing number bounds in dimensions $11$ through $23$. The approach performs well for problems with bad numerical conditioning, which we show through new computations for the binary sphere packing problem.</description>

      <title>Euclidean sets with only one distance modulo a prime ideal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.12331v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a finite set in the Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^d$. If the squared distance between any two distinct points in $X$ is an odd integer, then the cardinality of $X$ is bounded above by $d+2$, as shown by Rosenfeld (1997) or Smith (1995). They proved that there exists a $(d+2)$-point set $X$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$ having only odd integral squared distances if and only if $d+2$ is congruent to $0$ modulo $4$. The distances can be interpreted as an element of the finite field $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$. We generalize this result for a local ring $(A_\mathfrak{p},\mathfrak{p}A_\mathfrak{p})$ as follows. Let $K$ be an algebraic number field that can be embedded into $\mathbb{R}$. Fix an embedding of $K$ into $\mathbb{R}$, and $K$ is interpreted as a subfield of $\mathbb{R}$. Let $A=O_K$ be the ring of integers of $K$, and $\mathfrak{p}$ a prime ideal of $O_K$. Let $(A_\mathfrak{p},\mathfrak{p}A_\mathfrak{p})$ be the local ring obtained from the localization $(A\setminus \mathfrak{p})^{-1} A$, which is interpreted as a subring of $\mathbb{R}$. If the squared distances of $X\subset \mathbb{R}^d$ are in $A_\mathfrak{p}$ and each squared distance is congruent to some constant $k \not\equiv 0 $ modulo $\mathfrak{p} A_\mathfrak{p}$, then $|X| \leq d+2$, as shown by Nozaki (2023). In this paper, we prove that there exists a set $X\subset \mathbb{R}^d$ attaining the upper bound $|X| \leq d+2$ if and only if $d+2$ is congruent to $0$ modulo $4$ when the finite field $A_\mathfrak{p}/ \mathfrak{p} A_\mathfrak{p}$ is of characteristic 2, and $d+2$ is congruent to $0$ modulo $p$ when $A_\mathfrak{p}/ \mathfrak{p} A_\mathfrak{p}$ is of characteristic $p$ odd. We also provide examples attaining this upper bound.</description>

      <title>Sphere Packings in Euclidean Space with Forbidden Distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.03925v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the sphere packing problem in Euclidean space where we impose additional constraints on the separations of the center points. We prove that any sphere packing in dimension $48$, with spheres of radii $r$, such that no two centers $x_1$ and $x_2$ satisfy $\sqrt{\tfrac{4}{3}} &lt; \frac{1}{2r}|x_1-x_2| &lt;\sqrt{\tfrac{5}{3}}$, has center density less or equal than $(3/2)^{24}$. Equality occurs for periodic packings if and only if the packing is given by a $48$-dimensional even unimodular extremal lattice. This shows that any of the lattices $P_{48p},P_{48q},P_{48m}$ and $P_{48n}$ are optimal for this constrained packing problem, and gives evidence towards the conjecture that extremal lattices are optimal unconstrained sphere packings in $48$ dimensions. We also provide results for packings up to dimension $d\leq 1200$, where we impose constraints on the distance between centers and on the minimal norm of the spectrum, showing that even unimodular extremal lattices are again uniquely optimal. Moreover, in the one-dimensional case, where it is not at all clear that periodic packings are among those with largest density, we nevertheless give a condition on the set of constraints that allows this to happen, and we develop an algorithm to find these periodic configurations by relating the problem to a question about dominos.</description>
