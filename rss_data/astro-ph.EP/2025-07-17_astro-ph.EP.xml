      <title>A water-rich interior in the temperate sub-Neptune K2-18 b revealed by JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temperate sub-Neptunes are compelling targets for detecting liquid-water oceans beyond the Solar System. If water-rich and lacking massive hydrogen-helium envelopes, these planets could sustain liquid layers beneath their atmospheres despite sizes larger than Earth. Previous observations of the temperate sub-Neptune K2-18 b revealed an H2-dominated atmosphere rich in CH4, with moderate evidence for CO2 and tentative signs of dimethyl sulfide (DMS). Here we present four new JWST/NIRSpec transit observations of K2-18 b. The resulting high-precision transmission spectrum robustly detects both CH4 and CO2, precisely measuring their abundances and firmly establishing the planet's water-rich nature: either a thick envelope with &gt;10% H2O by volume or a thin atmosphere above a liquid-water ocean. The spectrum reveals no detectable H2O, NH3, or CO. The absence of atmospheric water vapor suggests an efficient cold trap, while the nondetections of NH3 and CO support the scenario of a small H2-rich atmosphere overlying a liquid reservoir. However, alternative models that include these gases can also reproduce the spectrum within uncertainties, highlighting the need for deeper observations. The spectrum only contains marginal signals of DMS, methyl mercaptan (CH3SH), and nitrous oxide (N2O), with none exceeding 3 sigma in model preference and all falling below ~2 sigma without imposing a strong super-Rayleigh haze. Meanwhile, our self-consistent photochemical models show that DMS and CH3SH may form abiotically in massive H2-rich atmospheres of high metallicity, making it important to consider additional indicators for their potential use as biosignatures. K2-18 b, a cool, water-rich world, stands out as one of the most promising temperate sub-Neptunes for exploring the emergence of liquid-water environments in non-Earth-like planets, motivating further characterization of its atmosphere and interior.</description>

      <title>A multi-frequency global view of Callisto's thermal properties from ALMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present thermal observations of Callisto's leading and trailing hemispheres obtained using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) at 0.87 mm (343 GHz), 1.3 mm (233 GHz), and 3 mm (97 GHz). The angular resolution achieved for these observations ranged from 0.09-0.24 arcseconds, corresponding to ~420-1100 km at Callisto. Global surface properties were derived from the observations using a thermophysical model (de Kleer et al. 2021) constrained by spacecraft data. We find that Callisto's millimeter emissivities are high, with representative values of 0.85-0.97, compared to 0.75-0.85 for Europa and Ganymede at these wavelengths. It is clear that models parameterized by a single thermal inertia are not sufficient to model Callisto's thermal emission, and clearly deviate from the temperature distributions in the data in systematic ways. Rather, more complex models that adopt either two thermal inertia components or that treat electrical skin depth as a free parameter fit the data more accurately than single thermal inertia models. Residuals from the global best-fit models reveal thermal anomalies; in particular, brightness temperatures that are locally 3-5 K colder than surrounding terrain are associated with impact craters. We identify the Valhalla impact basin and a suite of large craters, including Lofn, as key cold anomalies (~3-5 K) and geologic features of interest in these data. These data provide context for Callisto JWST results (Cartwright et al. 2024) as well as the other ALMA Galilean moon observations (de Kleer et al. 2021, Trumbo et al. 2017, 2018, Thelen et al. 2024), and may be useful ground-based context for upcoming Galilean satellite missions (JUICE, Europa Clipper).</description>

      <title>Physical properties of newly active asteroid 2010 LH15</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Main-belt asteroid 2010 LH$_{15}$ has been classified as an active asteroid, based on the recent discovery of dust activity from the archival images observed in 2010 and 2019. In this study, we perform measurements and dynamical modeling of the dust tail of the active asteroid 2010 LH$_{15}$ using ZTF archival data from July 26 to August 31, 2019, with the derived physical properties from these relatively independent methods being compatible. The photometric results show that the radius of the nucleus is $1.11\pm0.02$ km with assumed geometric albedo of $p_r = 0.05$, and the color index of the nucleus is relatively close to that of the ejecta around the nucleus, with a value of $H_g - H_r = 0.44\pm0.07$. The effective scattering cross-section increases at an average rate of $0.28\pm0.02$ km$^2$ day$^{-1}$ throughout the observation period, indicating that the activity of LH$_{15}$ is likely driven by mechanisms capable of causing a sustained process like sublimation. Further dust dynamics modeling indicates that the dust activity initiates as early as about 26 June 2019, with the ejected dust particles having a radius ranging from 0.03 mm to 3 mm. The dependence of the terminal velocity on dust size is consistent with a sublimation-driven mechanism. If the orbit of LH$_{15}$ is stable, its sublimation origin will extend the inner boundary of the water-ice-bearing region in the main asteroid belt inward by approximately 0.1 AU.</description>

      <title>Great comet C/2023 A3 (Tsuchinshan-ATLAS): dust loss before perihelion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, the dust loss of comet C/2023 A3 (Tsuchinshan-ATLAS) is investigated through the analysis of archival images. By measuring the surface brightness profile of the coma, we determined that the comet maintained nearly in a steady state during the observations. Analysis of the dust distribution perpendicular to the orbital plane reveals that the ejection velocity is $v_{\perp}\sim(65\pm5)\,\beta^{1/2}$ m s$^{-1}$, where $\beta$ is inversely proportional to the size of the dust grains. From the dust scattering cross-section measurement, we estimated the upper limit of the nucleus radius to be $\sim\!5.9\pm0.2$ km, assuming a geometric albedo of 0.04. Based on the extrapolation of the scattering cross-section over time, the onset time of significant dust activity is estimated to be 25 July 2022, corresponding to a heliocentric distance of 9.1 au, with the activity mechanism at this distance likely being the phase transition from amorphous to crystalline ice. Our simulation reveals that the minimum dust size is \SI{20}{\micro\meter} and the size distribution index is $s = 3.4$ in tail. The dust loss rate is determined to be $(1.7 \pm 0.8) \times 10^2$ kg s$^{-1}$, based on the derived average size of the particles and the rate of change of the scattering cross-section over time. Through a simplistic model, we evaluate that the nucleus of the comet remains stable against tidal effects, sublimation, and rotational instability, and disfavour the fate of disintegration. The result is consistent with observations that the nucleus has survived.</description>

      <title>How does the chemical composition of solids influence the formation of planetesimals?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation of planetesimals is a necessary step in the formation of planets. While several mechanisms have been proposed, a local dust-to-gas ratio above unity is a strong requirement to trigger the collapse of pebble clouds into planetesimals. A prime location for this is the water-ice line, where large water-rich pebbles evaporate and release their smaller silicate cores. This enhances the local dust-to-gas ratio due to the different inward drift speeds of large and small pebbles. Previous work suggested that planetesimal formation becomes difficult at overall dust-to-gas ratios below 0.6\%, consistent with the occurrence of close-in super Earths. However, the influence of disc composition on planetesimal formation remains unclear. Observations of stellar abundances show both a decrease and a wide spread in C/O ratios for low-metallicity stars. Using the C/O ratio as a proxy to determine water ice abundance in discs, we use the 1D disc evolution code chemcomp to simulate protoplanetary discs with varying C/O and dust-to-gas ratios over 3 Myr. Planetesimal formation is modeled using conditions based on dust-gas dynamics and pebble fragmentation. Our results confirm that planetesimal formation strongly depends on disc metallicity, with lower metallicity discs forming significantly fewer planetesimals. A lower carbon fraction generally promotes planetesimal formation by increasing water ice, while higher carbon fractions suppress it. The opposite is seen for oxygen: higher oxygen content leads to more efficient planetesimal formation at the same dust-to-gas ratio. We thus predict that planets around low-metallicity stars should be more common when their C/O ratio is low and oxygen is enhanced, a trend that can be tested observationally. Our simulations thus open a pathway to understand if the composition of the planet forming material influences the growth of planets.</description>

      <title>Assessing interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS with the 10.4 m Gran Telescopio Canarias and the Two-meter Twin Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Theories of the formation and evolution of small bodies in planetary systems predict that they may escape into interstellar space at any time. After having characterized just two such interlopers -1I/2017 U1 (Oumuamua) and 2I/Borisov more questions were raised than answered. Assessing the recently discovered interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS will only broaden our understanding of this complex topic.
  Aims. Here, we investigate the spectral, cometary, and rotational properties of 3I/ATLAS as well as its dynamical context.
  Methods. We identified the spectral type of 3I/ATLAS from the visible reflectance spectrum and used photometric observations to derive its level of activity and rotational properties. Observational data were obtained with the OSIRIS camera spectrograph at the 10.4 m Gran Telescopio Canarias and the Two-meter Twin Telescope. We used N-body simulations and statistical analyses of Gaia DR3 data to investigate the origin of 3I/ATLAS and its Galactic background.
  Results. Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has a visible spectrum consistent with that of a D-type asteroid, and has a spectral slope of 14.6%/1000 A in the 5000-9000 A range, which is similar to the one of Oumuamua but redder than that of 2I/Borisov and most solar system comets. It has a conspicuous coma and its rotation period is 16.79 h. The heliocentric components of its Galactic velocity were (U, V, W) = (-51.25, -19.466, 18.94) km/s with a radiant in Sagittarius. The analysis of a sample of kinematic analogs of 3I/ATLAS extracted from Gaia DR3 suggests that its parent system is part of the Galactic thin disk and includes a solar-like star with slightly sub-solar metallicity.</description>

      <title>Beyond monoculture: Polydisperse moment methods for sub-stellar atmosphere cloud microphysics II. A three-moment gamma distribution formulation for GCM applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Understanding how the shape of cloud particle size distributions affects the atmospheric properties of sub-stellar atmospheres is a key area to explore, particularly in the JWST era of broad wavelength coverage, where observations are sensitive to particle size distributions. It is therefore important to elucidate how underlying cloud microphysical processes influence the size distribution, in order to better understand how clouds affect observed atmospheric properties. Aims. In this follow-up paper, we aim to extend our sub-stellar atmosphere microphysical cloud formation framework from Paper I to include effects of assuming a polydisperse gamma particle size distribution, requiring a three-moment solution set of equations. Methods. We develop a three-moment framework for sub-stellar mineral cloud particle microphysical nucleation, condensation, evaporation and collisional growth assuming a gamma distribution. As in Paper I, we demonstrate the effects of polydispersity using a simple one-dimensional Y-dwarf KCl cloud formation scenario, and compare the results with the monodisperse case. Results. Our three-moment scheme provides a generalised framework applicable to any size distribution with a defined moment generation expression. In our test case, we show that the gamma distribution evolves with altitude, initially broad at the cloud base and narrowing at lower pressures. We find that differences between the gamma and monodisperse cloud structures can be significant, depending on the surface gravity of the atmosphere. Conclusions. We present a self-consistent framework for including the effects of polydispersity for sub-stellar microphysical cloud studies using the moment method.</description>

      <title>CubeSat Orbit Insertion Maneuvering Using J2 Perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The precise insertion of CubeSats into designated orbits is a complex task, primarily due to the limited propulsion capabilities and constrained fuel reserves onboard, which severely restrict the scope for large orbital corrections. This limitation necessitates the development of more efficient maneuvering techniques to ensure mission success. In this paper, we propose a maneuvering sequence that exploits the natural J2 perturbation caused by the Earth's oblateness. By utilizing the secular effects of this perturbation, it is possible to passively influence key orbital parameters such as the argument of perigee and the right ascension of the ascending node, thereby reducing the need for extensive propulsion-based corrections. The approach is designed to optimize the CubeSat's orbital insertion and minimize the total fuel required for trajectory adjustments, making it particularly suitable for fuel-constrained missions. The proposed methodology is validated through comprehensive numerical simulations that examine different initial orbital conditions and perturbation environments. Case studies are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the J2-augmented strategy in achieving accurate orbital insertion, showing a major reduction in fuel consumption compared to traditional methods. The results underscore the potential of this approach to extend the operational life and capabilities of CubeSats, offering a viable solution for future low-Earth orbit missions.</description>

      <title>A dynamical dichotomy in large binary asteroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: No less than 15% of large (diameter greater than 140 km) asteroids have satellites. The commonly accepted mechanism for their formation is post-impact reaccumulation. However, the detailed physical and dynamical properties of these systems are not well understood, and many of them have not been studied in detail. We aim to study the population of large binary asteroid systems. To do so, we compare the gravitational fields predicted from the shape of the primary body with the non-Keplerian gravitational components identified in orbital models of the satellites of each system. We also aim to contextualize these systems in the greater population of large binary systems, providing clues to asteroid satellite formation. We reduce all historical high-angular-resolution adaptive-optics (AO) images from ground-based telescopes to conduct astrometric and photometric measurements of each system's components. We then determine orbital solutions for each system using the genoid algorithm. We model the shapes of the system primaries using lightcurve-inversion techniques scaled with stellar occultations and AO images, and we develop internal structure models using SHTOOLS. Finally, we compare the distribution of the physical and orbital properties of the known binary asteroid systems. We find that differences between studies binary systems reflect an overall dichotomy within the population of large binary systems, with a strong correlation between primary elongation and satellite eccentricity observed in one group. We determine that there may be two distinct formation pathways influencing the end-state dichotomy in these binary systems, and that (762) Pulcova and (283) Emma belong to the two separate groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Small bodies are the remnant building blocks from the time when the planets formed and migrated to their current positions. Their volatile composition and relative abundances serve as time capsules for the formation conditions in the protosolar nebula. By constraining the volatile composition of Centaurs, we can fill in important gaps in understanding the history of our solar system. We review here the state of knowledge for volatiles in small bodies, processes that influence volatile composition and activity in small bodies, and future capabilities that can be leveraged to advance our understanding of volatiles in Centaurs.</description>

      <title>Planetary Edge Trends (PET). I. The Inner Edge-Stellar Mass Correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02215v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The position of the innermost planet (i.e., the inner edge) in a planetary system provides important information about the relationship of the entire system to its host star properties, offering potentially valuable insights into planetary formation and evolution processes. In this work, based on the Kepler Data Release 25 (DR25) catalog combined with LAMOST and Gaia data, we investigate the correlation between stellar mass and the inner edge position across different populations of small planets in multi-planetary systems, such as super-Earths and sub-Neptunes. By correcting for the influence of stellar metallicity and analyzing the impact of observational selection effects, we confirm the trend that as stellar mass increases, the position of the inner edge shifts outward. Our results reveal a stronger correlation between the inner edge and stellar mass with a power-law index of 0.6-1.1, which is larger compared to previous studies. The stronger correlation in our findings is primarily attributed to two factors: first, the metallicity correction applied in this work enhances the correlation; second, the previous use of occurrence rates to trace the inner edge weakens the observed correlation. Through comparison between observed statistical results and current theoretical models, we find that the pre-main-sequence (PMS) dust sublimation radius of the protoplanetary disk best matches the observed inner edge stellar mass. Therefore, we conclude that the inner dust disk likely limits the innermost orbits of small planets, contrasting with the inner edges of hot Jupiters, which are associated with the magnetospheres of gas disks, as suggested by previous studies. This highlights that the inner edges of different planetary populations are likely regulated by distinct mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Stellar Models Also Limit Exoplanet Atmosphere Studies in Emission</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19585v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stellar contamination has long been recognized as a major bottleneck in transmission spectroscopy, limiting our ability to accurately characterize exoplanet atmospheres-particularly for terrestrial worlds. In response, significant observational efforts have shifted toward emission spectroscopy as a potentially more robust alternative, exemplified by initiatives such as the 500-hour JWST Rocky Worlds Director's Discretionary Time (DDT) program. However, the extent to which emission spectroscopy may be affected by stellar effects remains mostly unexplored, in stark contrast with the extensiveexploration and mitigation work for transmission spectroscopy. In this study, we assess the impact of imperfect knowledge of stellar spectra on exoplanet atmospheric retrievals from emission spectroscopy. At 12.8 um, none of the considered bare surface types-basalt, ultramafic, Fe-oxidized, and granitoid-can be reliably distinguished when accounting for the 3 sigma model precision between SPHINX and PHOENIX. At 15.0 um, only the granitoid surface is distinguishable from all others above this threshold. These results show that stellar model uncertainty alone substantially limits our ability to constrain surface composition from photometric data, even before including other sources of uncertainty such as stellar radius. Also, we find that current 15 um eclipse depth estimations using different stellar models introduce a 60 ppm difference for M8 and 20 ppm for M5 stars. This model discrepancy leads to a degeneracy in retrieved planetary albedos and weakens constraints on the presence of an atmosphere. We therefore recommend that future JWST secondary eclipse observations systematically include stellar mid-infrared spectroscopy to mitigate these uncertainties.</description>

      <title>The Gap-Giant Association: Are Planets Hiding in the Gaps?</title>

Abstract: A handful of stars are known to host both an inner system of multiple transiting planets and an outer giant planet. These systems all feature a prominent gap between the orbits of two of the transiting planets, distinguishing them from typical multiplanet systems with more uniform orbital spacings. The reason for the association between inner gaps and outer giants is unknown. In this paper, we assess whether undiscovered planets might occupy these gaps in systems with outer giants. For each of the four relevant systems - Kepler-48, Kepler-65, Kepler-90, and Kepler-139 - we found that a typical small planet ($\sim 1 - 20 M_\oplus$) could reside in the gap without inducing dynamical instability. However, in each case, the gravitational influence of the outer giant planet is insufficient to tilt the orbit of the hypothetical planet by enough to prevent transits, strongly disfavoring a proposed theory for the observed gap-giant association. The gaps might instead contain smaller, undetected planets ($\lesssim 1 R_\oplus$), or be entirely devoid of planets.</description>

Abstract: We describe the physical characteristics of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, discovered on 2025 July 1 by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System. The comet has eccentricity, $e$ $\simeq$ 6.08 and velocity at infinity, v$_{\infty}$ $\simeq$ 57 km/s, indicating an interstellar origin. \textbf{We obtained B,V, R, I, g, r, i, and z photometry with the Kottamia Astronomical Observatory 1.88-m telescope, the Palomar 200-inch telescope, and the Astrophysical Research Consortium 3.5-m telescope on 2025 July 2, 3, and 6. We measured colour indices B-V=0.98$\pm$0.23, V-R=0.71$\pm$0.09, R-I=0.14$\pm$0.10, g-r=0.84$\pm$0.05 mag, r-i=0.16$\pm$0.03 mag, i-z=-0.02$\pm$0.07 mag, and g-i=1.00$\pm$0.05 mag and a spectral slope of 16.0$\pm$1.9 $\%$/100 nm.} We calculate the dust cross-section within 10,000 km of the comet to be 184.6$\pm$4.6 km$^2$, assuming an albedo of 0.10. 3I/ATLAS's coma has FWHM$\simeq$2.2 arcsec and A(0$^\circ$)f$\rho$=280.8$\pm$3.2 cm. \textbf{We estimate that 3I/ATLAS's \textmu m-scale to mm-scale dust is ejected at $\sim$0.01-1 m/s, implying a dust production of $\sim$0.1 - 1.0 kg/s.</description>

      <title>Tidal Synchronization of TESS Eclipsing Binaries</title>

Abstract: Tidal synchronization plays a fundamental role in the evolution of binary star systems. However, key details such as the timescale of synchronization, efficiency of tidal dissipation, rotational period, and dependence on stellar mass are not well constrained. We present a catalog of rotation periods, orbital periods, and eccentricities from eclipsing binaries (EBs) that can be used to study the role of tides in the rotational evolution of low-mass dwarf (FGKM spectral type) binaries. This study presents the largest catalog of EB orbital and rotational periods (Porb and Prot) measured from the Transiting Exoplanet Satellite Survey (TESS). We first classify 4584 light curves from the TESS Eclipsing Binary Catalog according to out-of-eclipse stellar variability type: starspot modulation, ellipsoidal variability, non-periodic variability, and "other" variability (e.g. pulsations). We then manually validate each light curve classification, resulting in a sample of 1039 candidates with 584 high-confidence EBs that exhibit detectable star-spot modulation. From there, we measure and compare the rotation period of each starspot-modulated EB using three methods: Lomb-Scargle periodograms, autocorrelation function, and phase dispersion minimization. We find that our period distributions are consistent with previous work that used a sample of 816 starspot EBs from Kepler to identify two populations: a synchronous population (with Porb~Prot) and a subsynchronous population (with 8Porb~7Prot). Using Bayesian model comparison, we find that a bimodal distribution is a significantly better fit than a unimodal distribution for Kepler and TESS samples, both individually or combined, confirming that the subsynchronous population is statistically significant.</description>

      <title>Interplay between tidal flows and magnetic fields in nonlinear simulations of stellar and planetary convective envelopes</title>

Abstract: Stars and planets in close systems are magnetised but the influence of magnetic fields on their tidal responses (and vice versa) and dissipation rates has not been well explored. We present exploratory nonlinear magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) simulations of tidally-excited inertial waves in convective envelopes. These waves probably provide the dominant contribution to tidal dissipation in several astrophysical settings, including tidal circularisation of solar-type binary stars and hot Jupiters, and orbital migration of the moons of Jupiter and Saturn. We model convective envelopes as incompressible magnetised fluids in spherical shells harbouring an initially (rotationally-aligned) dipolar magnetic field. We find that depending on its strength (quantified by its Lehnert number Le) and the magnetic Prandtl number Pm, the magnetic field can either deeply modify the tidal response or be substantially altered by tidal flows. Simulations with small Le exhibit strong tidally-generated differential rotation (zonal flows) for sufficiently large tidal amplitudes, such that both the amplitude and topology of the initial magnetic field are tidally impacted. In contrast, strong magnetic fields can inhibit these zonal flows through large-scale magnetic torques, and by Maxwell stresses arising from magneto-rotational instability, which we identify and characterise in our simulations, along with the role of torsional Alfv\'en waves. Without tidally-driven zonal flows, the resulting tidal dissipation is close to the linear predictions. We quantify the transition Le as a function of Pm, finding it to be comparable to realistic values found in solar-like stars, such that we predict complex interactions between tidal flows and magnetic fields.</description>

Abstract: Energetic particles in interplanetary space are normally measured at time scales that are long compared to the ion gyroperiod. Such observations by necessity average out the microphysics associated with the acceleration and transport of 10s - 100s keV particles. We investigate previously unseen non-equilibrium features that only become observable at very high time resolution, and discuss possible explanations of these features. We use unprecedentedly high-time-resolution data that were acquired by the in situ instruments on Solar Orbiter in the vicinity of two interplanetary shocks observed on 2023-11-29 07:51:17 UTC and 2023-11-30 10:47:26 UTC at $\sim 0.83$ astronomical units from the Sun. The solar-wind proton beam population follows the magnetic field instantaneously, on time scales which are significantly shorter than a gyro-period. Energetic particles, despite sampling large volumes of space, vary on remarkably short time scales, typically on the order of the convection time of their gyro-radius. Non-equilibrium features such as bump-on-tail distributions of energetic particles are formed by small-scale magnetic structures in the IMF. High-time-resolution observations show previously unobserved microphysics in the vicinity of two traveling interplanetary shocks, including ion reflection at a current sheet, which may explain where ions are reflected in shock acceleration.</description>
