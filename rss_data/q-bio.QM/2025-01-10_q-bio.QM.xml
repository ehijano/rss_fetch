      <title>Collective inference of the truth of propositions from crowd probability judgments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Every day, we judge the probability of propositions. When we communicate graded confidence (e.g. "I am 90% sure"), we enable others to gauge how much weight to attach to our judgment. Ideally, people should share their judgments to reach more accurate conclusions collectively. Peer-to-peer tools for collective inference could help debunk disinformation and amplify reliable information on social networks, improving democratic discourse. However, individuals fall short of the ideal of well-calibrated probability judgments, and group dynamics can amplify errors and polarize opinions. Here, we connect insights from cognitive science, structured expert judgment, and crowdsourcing to infer the truth of propositions from human probability judgments. In an online experiment, 376 participants judged the probability of each of 1,200 general-knowledge claims for which we have ground truth (451,200 ratings). Aggregating binary judgments by majority vote already exhibits the "wisdom of the crowd"--the superior accuracy of collective inferences relative to individual inferences. However, using continuous probability ratings and accounting for individual accuracy and calibration significantly improves collective inferences. Peer judgment behavior can be modeled probabilistically, and individual parameters capturing each peer's accuracy and miscalibration can be inferred jointly with the claim probabilities. This unsupervised approach can be complemented by supervised methods relying on truth labels to learn models that achieve well-calibrated collective inference. The algorithms we introduce can empower groups of collaborators and online communities to pool their distributed intelligence and jointly judge the probability of propositions with a well-calibrated sense of uncertainty.</description>

      <title>SyNPar: Synthetic Null Data Parallelism for High-Power False Discovery Rate Control in High-Dimensional Variable Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Balancing false discovery rate (FDR) and statistical power to ensure reliable discoveries is a key challenge in high-dimensional variable selection. Although several FDR control methods have been proposed, most involve perturbing the original data, either by concatenating knockoff variables or splitting the data into two halves, both of which can lead to a loss of power. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach called Synthetic Null Parallelism (SyNPar), which controls the FDR in high-dimensional variable selection while preserving the original data. SyNPar generates synthetic null data from a model fitted to the original data and modified to reflect the null hypothesis. It then applies the same estimation procedure in parallel to both the original and synthetic null data to estimate coefficients that indicate feature importance. By comparing the coefficients estimated from the null data with those from the original data, SyNPar effectively identifies false positives, functioning as a numerical analog of a likelihood ratio test. We provide theoretical guarantees for FDR control at any desired level while ensuring that the power approaches one with high probability asymptotically. SyNPar is straightforward to implement and can be applied to a wide range of statistical models, including high-dimensional linear regression, generalized linear models, Cox models, and Gaussian graphical models. Through extensive simulations and real data applications, we demonstrate that SyNPar outperforms state-of-the-art methods, including knockoffs and data-splitting methods, in terms of FDR control, power, and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Recovery of activation propagation and self-sustained oscillation abilities in stroke brain networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Healthy brain networks usually show highly efficient information communication and self-sustained oscillation abilities. However, how the brain network structure affects these dynamics after an injury (stroke) is not very clear. The recovery of structure and dynamics of stroke brain networks over time is still not known precisely. Based on the analysis of a large number of strokes' brain network data, we show that stroke changes the network properties in connection weights, average degree, clustering, community, etc. Yet, they will recover gradually over time to some extent. We then adopt a simplified reaction-diffusion model to investigate stroke patients' activation propagation and self-sustained oscillation abilities. Our results reveal that the stroke slows the adoption time across different brain scales, indicating a weakened brain's activation propagation ability. In addition, we show that the lifetime of self-sustained oscillatory patterns at three months post-stroke patients' brains significantly departs from the healthy one. Finally, we examine the properties of core networks of self-sustained oscillatory patterns, in which the directed edges denote the main pathways of activation propagation. Our results demonstrate that the lifetime and recovery of self-sustaining patterns are related to the properties of core networks, and the properties in the post-stroke greatly vary from those in the healthy group. Most importantly, the strokes' activation propagation and self-sustained oscillation abilities significantly improve at one year post-stroke, driven by structural connection repair. This work may help us to understand the relationship between structure and function in brain disorders.</description>

      <title>Foundations of Adaptive High-Level Tight Control of Prostate Cancer: A Path from From Terminal Disease to Chronic Condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16005v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Metastatic prostate cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related morbidity and mortality worldwide. It is characterized by a high mortality rate and a poor prognosis. In this work, we explore how a clinical oncologist can apply a Stackelberg game-theoretic framework to prolong metastatic prostate cancer survival, or even make it chronic in duration. We utilize a Bayesian optimization approach to identify the optimal adaptive chemotherapeutic treatment policy for a single drug (Abiraterone) to maximize the time before the patient begins to show symptoms. We show that, with precise adaptive optimization of drug delivery, it is possible to significantly prolong the cancer suppression period, potentially converting metastatic prostate cancer from a terminal disease to a chronic disease for most patients, as supported by clinical and analytical evidence. We suggest that clinicians might explore the possibility of implementing a high-level tight control (HLTC) treatment, in which the trigger signals (i.e. biomarker levels) for drug administration and cessation are both high and close together, typically yield the best outcomes, as demonstrated through both computation and theoretical analysis. This simple insight could serve as a valuable guide for improving current adaptive chemotherapy treatments in other hormone-sensitive cancers.</description>

      <title>Cross-Attention Graph Neural Networks for Inferring Gene Regulatory Networks with Skewed Degree Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16220v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inferencing Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) from gene expression data is a pivotal challenge in systems biology, and several innovative computational methods have been introduced. However, most of these studies have not considered the skewed degree distribution of genes. Specifically, some genes may regulate multiple target genes while some genes may be regulated by multiple regulator genes. Such a skewed degree distribution issue significantly complicates the application of directed graph embedding methods. To tackle this issue, we propose the Cross-Attention Complex Dual Graph Embedding Model (XATGRN). Our XATGRN employs a cross-attention mechanism to effectively capture intricate gene interactions from gene expression profiles. Additionally, it uses a Dual Complex Graph Embedding approach to manage the skewed degree distribution, thereby ensuring precise prediction of regulatory relationships and their directionality. Our model consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across various datasets, underscoring its efficacy in elucidating complex gene regulatory mechanisms. Our codes used in this paper are publicly available at: https://github.com/kikixiong/XATGRN.</description>

      <title>Beyond Boolean networks: new tools for the steady state analysis of multivalued networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16760v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Boolean networks can be viewed as functions on the set of binary strings of a given length, described via logical rules. They were introduced as dynamic models into biology, in particular as logical models of intracellular regulatory networks involving genes, proteins, and metabolites. Since genes can have several modes of action depending on their expression levels, binary variables are often not sufficiently rich, requiring the use of multivalued networks instead.
  In this paper, we explore the multivalued generalization of Boolean networks by writing the standard $(\wedge, \vee, \lnot)$ operations on $\{0, 1\}$ in terms of the operations $(\odot, \oplus, \neg)$ on $\big\{0,\frac{1}{m}, \frac{2}{m}, \dots, \frac{m-1}{m}, 1\big\}$ from multivalued logic. We recall the basic theory of this mathematical framework, and give a novel algorithm for computing the fixed points that in many cases has essentially the same complexity as in the binary case. Our approach provides a biologically intuitive representation of the network. Furthermore, it uses tools to compute lattice points in rational polytopes, tapping a rich area of algebraic combinatorics as a source for combinatorial algorithms for network analysis. An implementation of the algorithm is provided.</description>
