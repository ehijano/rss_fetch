      <title>Kinetically Consistent Coarse Graining using Kernel-based Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we show how kernel-based approximation to the Koopman generator -- the kgEDMD algorithm -- can be used to identify implied timescales and meta stable sets in stochastic dynamical systems, and to learn a coarse-grained dynamics on reduced variables, which retains the essential kinetic properties of the full model. The centerpiece of this study is a learning method to identify an effective diffusion in coarse-grained space by leveraging the kgEMD model for the Koopman generator. By combining this method with force matching, a complete model for the effective dynamics can be inferred. Using a two-dimensional model system and molecular dynamics simulation data of alanine dipeptide, we demonstrate that the proposed method successfully and robustly recovers the essential theormodynamic and kinetic properties of the full model. The parameters of the method can be determined using standard model validation techniques.</description>

      <title>Efficient computation of topological order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the computational aspects of detecting topological order in a quantum many-body system. We contrast the widely used topological entanglement entropy with a recently introduced operational definition for topological order based on error correction properties, finding exponential scaling with the system size for the former and polynomial scaling for the latter. We exemplify our approach for a variant of the paradigmatic toric code model with mobile particles, finding that the error correction method allows to treat substantially larger system sizes. In particular, the phase diagram of the model can be successfully computed using error correction, while the topological entanglement entropy is too severely limited by finite size effects to obtain conclusive results. While we mainly focus on one-dimensional systems whose ground states can be expressed in terms of matrix product states, our strategy can be readily generalized to higher dimensions and systems out of equilibrium, even allowing for an efficient detection of topological order in current quantum simulation experiments.</description>

      <title>A novel emulator for fission event generators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A wide variety of emulators have been developed for nuclear physics, particularly for use in quantifying and propagating parametric uncertainties to observables. Most of these methods have been used to emulate structure observables, such as energies, masses, or separation energies, or reaction observables, such as cross sections. Rarely, if ever, have event generators for theory models been emulated. Here, we describe one such novel emulator for the fission fragment decay code, $\texttt{CGMF}$, which calculates the emission of prompt neutrons and $\gamma$ rays from fission fragments. The emulator described in this work uses a combination of a noisy emission model and mixture density network to model the neutron and $\gamma$-ray multiplicities and energies. In this manuscript, we display the power of this type of emulator for not only modeling average prompt fission observables but also correlations between fission fragment initial conditions and these observables, using both neutron-induced and spontaneous fission reactions.</description>

      <title>Efficient and generalizable nested Fourier-DeepONet for three-dimensional geological carbon sequestration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Geological carbon sequestration (GCS) involves injecting CO$_2$ into subsurface geological formations for permanent storage. Numerical simulations could guide decisions in GCS projects by predicting CO$_2$ migration pathways and the pressure distribution in storage formation. However, these simulations are often computationally expensive due to highly coupled physics and large spatial-temporal simulation domains. Surrogate modeling with data-driven machine learning has become a promising alternative to accelerate physics-based simulations. Among these, the Fourier neural operator (FNO) has been applied to three-dimensional synthetic subsurface models. Here, to further improve performance, we have developed a nested Fourier-DeepONet by combining the expressiveness of the FNO with the modularity of a deep operator network (DeepONet). This new framework is twice as efficient as a nested FNO for training and has at least 80% lower GPU memory requirement due to its flexibility to treat temporal coordinates separately. These performance improvements are achieved without compromising prediction accuracy. In addition, the generalization and extrapolation ability of nested Fourier-DeepONet beyond the training range has been thoroughly evaluated. Nested Fourier-DeepONet outperformed the nested FNO for extrapolation in time with more than 50% reduced error. It also exhibited good extrapolation accuracy beyond the training range in terms of reservoir properties, number of wells, and injection rate.</description>

      <title>Theory and Atomistic Simulation of Electrodeposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electrodeposition is a fundamental process in electrochemistry, and has applications in numerous industries, such as corrosion protection, decorative finishing, energy storage, catalysis, and electronics. While there is a long history of using electrodeposition, its application for controlled nanostructure growth is limited. The establishment of an atomic-scale understanding of the electrodeposition process and dynamics is crucial to enable the controlled fabrication of metal nanoparticles and other nanostructures. Significant advancements in molecular simulation capabilities and the electronic structure theory of electrified solid-liquid interfaces bring theory closer to realistic applications, but a gap remains between realistic applications, theoretical understanding of dynamics, and atomistic simulation. In this review we briefly summarize the current state-of-the-art computational techniques available for the simulation of electrodeposition and electrochemical growth on surfaces, and identify the remaining open challenges.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent study of viscoelastic amorphous oxychloride electrolytes has opened up a new field of research for solid-state electrolytes. In this work, we chose Li-Al-O-Cl system containing disordered structures with varying O/Cl ratio and Li$^+$ content to study their structural characteristics and ion transport mechanism using ab-initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulation and machine learning interatomic potential based molecular dynamics (MLIP-based MD) simulation. It is found that O-doping results in the presence of a skeleton of Al-chains formed by AlOCl tetrahedra and the increase of glass forming ability, causing Cl atoms' rotation around centered-Al within the tetrahedron thus facilitating the motion of Li$^+$ ions. However, further increase of O/Cl ratio decreases the number of rotating Cl atoms, weakening the transport of Li$^+$. So increasing glass forming ability without reducing Cl content or by methods through controlling synthesis conditions, are useful to promote Li$^+$ ion conducting of oxychloride electrolytes.</description>

      <title>On the band gap variation in CH$_3$NH$_3$Pb(I$_{1-x}$Br$_x$)$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The electronic structure and the band gap behavior of CH$_3$NH$_3$Pb(I$_{1-x}$Br$_x$)$_3$ for $x$=0.25, 0.33, 0.50, 0.67, 0.75, 1.00 were studied using the full-relativistic density-functional-theory calculations. A combination of the parameter-free Armiento-K\"{u}mmel generalized gradient approximation exchange functional with the nonseparable gradient approximation Minnesota correlation functional was employed. The calculated band gap sizes for the CH$_3$NH$_3$Pb(I$_{1-x}$Br$_x$)$_3$ series were found to be similar to the experimentally measured values. While the change of the optimized lattice parameter with an increasing Br content can be described by a linear fit, the calculated band gap variation exhibits rather a quadratic-like behavior over the $x$ region of the cubic crystal structure. While the experimental reports are divided on whether the bowing parameter value is being very small or significant, our calculated results support the latter case.</description>

      <title>Parton Distribution Functions in the Schwinger Model with Tensor Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parton distribution functions (PDFs) describe universal properties of bound states and allow us to calculate scattering amplitudes in processes with large momentum transfer. Calculating PDFs involves the evaluation of matrix elements with a Wilson line in a light-cone direction. In contrast to Monte Carlo methods in Euclidean spacetime, these matrix elements can be directly calculated in Minkowski-space using the Hamiltonian formalism. The necessary spatial- and time-evolution can be efficiently applied using established tensor network methods. We present PDFs in the Schwinger model calculated with matrix product states.</description>

      <title>What do clever algorithms for glasses do? Time reparametrization at work</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ultraslow dynamics of glass-formers has been explained by two views considered as mutually exclusive: one invokes locally hindered mobility, the other rests on the complexity of the configuration space. Here we demonstrate that the evolution responds strongly to the details of the dynamics by changing the speed of time-flow: it has time-reparametrization softness. This finding reconciles both views: while local constraints reparametrize the flow of time, the global landscape determines relationships between different correlations at the same times. We show that modern algorithms developed to accelerate the relaxation to equilibrium act by changing the time reparametrization. Their success thus relies on their ability to exploit reparametrization softness. We conjecture that these results extend beyond the realm of glasses to the optimization of more general constraint satisfaction problems and to broader classes of algorithms.</description>

      <title>HamLib: A library of Hamiltonians for benchmarking quantum algorithms and hardware</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.13126v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In order to characterize and benchmark computational hardware, software, and algorithms, it is essential to have many problem instances on-hand. This is no less true for quantum computation, where a large collection of real-world problem instances would allow for benchmarking studies that in turn help to improve both algorithms and hardware designs. To this end, here we present a large dataset of qubit-based quantum Hamiltonians. The dataset, called HamLib (for Hamiltonian Library), is freely available online and contains problem sizes ranging from 2 to 1000 qubits. HamLib includes problem instances of the Heisenberg model, Fermi-Hubbard model, Bose-Hubbard model, molecular electronic structure, molecular vibrational structure, MaxCut, Max-$k$-SAT, Max-$k$-Cut, QMaxCut, and the traveling salesperson problem. The goals of this effort are (a) to save researchers time by eliminating the need to prepare problem instances and map them to qubit representations, (b) to allow for more thorough tests of new algorithms and hardware, and (c) to allow for reproducibility and standardization across research studies.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium Model with Anisotropy for Model-Based Reconstruction in Magnetic Particle Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00602v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetic particle imaging is a tracer-based tomographic imaging technique that allows the concentration of magnetic nanoparticles to be determined with high spatio-temporal resolution. To reconstruct an image of the tracer concentration, the magnetization dynamics of the particles must be accurately modeled. A popular ensemble model is based on solving the Fokker-Plank equation, taking into account either Brownian or N\'eel dynamics. The disadvantage of this model is that it is computationally expensive due to an underlying stiff differential equation. A simplified model is the equilibrium model, which can be evaluated directly but in most relevant cases it suffers from a non-negligible modeling error. In the present work, we investigate an extended version of the equilibrium model that can account for particle anisotropy. We show that this model can be expressed as a series of Bessel functions, which can be truncated based on a predefined accuracy, leading to very short computation times, which are about three orders of magnitude lower than equivalent Fokker-Planck computation times. We investigate the accuracy of the model for 2D Lissajous magnetic particle imaging sequences and show that the difference between the Fokker-Planck and the equilibrium model with anisotropy is sufficiently small so that the latter model can be used for image reconstruction on experimental data with only marginal loss of image quality, even compared to a system matrix-based reconstruction.</description>

      <title>A finite element method for anisotropic crystal growth on surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14206v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Phase transition problems on curved surfaces can lead to a panopticon of fascinating patterns. In this paper we consider finite element approximations of phase field models with a spatially inhomogeneous and anisotropic surface energy density. The problems are either posed in $\mathbb R^3$ or on a two-dimensional hypersurface in $\mathbb R^3$. In the latter case, a fundamental choice regarding the anisotropic energy density has to be made. One possibility is to use a density defined in the ambient space $\mathbb R^3$. However, we propose and advocate for an alternative, where a density is defined on a fixed chosen tangent space, and is then moved along geodesics to the other tangent spaces. Our numerical method can be employed in all of the above situations, where for the problems on hypersurfaces the algorithm uses parametric finite elements. We prove an unconditional stability result for our schemes and present several numerical experiments, including for the modelling of ice crystal growth on a sphere.</description>

      <title>Force-Guided Bridge Matching for Full-Atom Time-Coarsened Dynamics of Peptides</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15126v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Molecular Dynamics (MD) is crucial in various fields such as materials science, chemistry, and pharmacology to name a few. Conventional MD software struggles with the balance between time cost and prediction accuracy, which restricts its wider application. Recently, data-driven approaches based on deep generative models have been devised for time-coarsened dynamics, which aim at learning dynamics of diverse molecular systems over a long timestep, enjoying both universality and efficiency. Nevertheless, most current methods are designed solely to learn from the data distribution regardless of the underlying Boltzmann distribution, and the physics priors such as energies and forces are constantly overlooked. In this work, we propose a conditional generative model called Force-guided Bridge Matching (FBM), which learns full-atom time-coarsened dynamics and targets the Boltzmann-constrained distribution. With the guidance of our delicately-designed intermediate force field, FBM leverages favourable physics priors into the generation process, giving rise to enhanced simulations. Experiments on two datasets consisting of peptides verify our superiority in terms of comprehensive metrics and demonstrate transferability to unseen systems.</description>

      <title>Higher-order-ReLU-KANs (HRKANs) for solving physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) more accurately, robustly and faster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14248v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finding solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs) is an important and essential component in many scientific and engineering discoveries. One of the common approaches empowered by deep learning is Physics-informed Neural Networks (PINNs). Recently, a new type of fundamental neural network model, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), has been proposed as a substitute of Multilayer Perceptions (MLPs), and possesses trainable activation functions. To enhance KANs in fitting accuracy, a modification of KANs, so called ReLU-KANs, using "square of ReLU" as the basis of its activation functions, has been suggested. In this work, we propose another basis of activation functions, namely, Higherorder-ReLU (HR), which is simpler than the basis of activation functions used in KANs, namely, Bsplines; allows efficient KAN matrix operations; and possesses smooth and non-zero higher-order derivatives, essential to physicsinformed neural networks. We name such KANs with Higher-order-ReLU (HR) as their activations, HRKANs. Our detailed experiments on two famous and representative PDEs, namely, the linear Poisson equation and nonlinear Burgers' equation with viscosity, reveal that our proposed Higher-order-ReLU-KANs (HRKANs) achieve the highest fitting accuracy and training robustness and lowest training time significantly among KANs, ReLU-KANs and HRKANs. The codes to replicate our experiments are available at https://github.com/kelvinhkcs/HRKAN.</description>
