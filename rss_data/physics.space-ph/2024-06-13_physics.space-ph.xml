      <title>Satellite Drag Analysis During the May 2024 Geomagnetic Storm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Between May 10-12, 2024, Earth saw its largest geomagnetic storm in over 20 years. Since the last major storm in 2003, the population of satellites in low Earth orbit has surged following the commercialization of space services and the ongoing establishment of proliferated LEO constellations. In this note, we investigate the various impacts of the geomagnetic storm on satellite operations. A forecast performance assessment of the geomagnetic index ap shows that the magnitude and duration of the storm were poorly predicted, even one day in advance. Total mass density enhancements in the thermosphere are identified by tracking satellite drag decay characteristics. A history of two-line element (TLE) data from the entire NORAD catalog in LEO is used to observe large-scale trends. Better understanding how geomagnetic storms impact satellite operations is critical for maintaining satellite safety and ensuring long-term robust sustainability in LEO.</description>

      <title>Modelling the magnetic vectors of ICMEs at different heliocentric distances with INFROS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The INterplanetary Flux ROpe Simulator (INFROS) is an observationally constrained analytical model dedicated for forecasting the strength of the southward component (Bz) of the magnetic field embedded in interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs). In this work, we validate the model for six ICMEs sequentially observed by two radially-aligned spacecraft positioned at different heliocentric distances. The six selected ICMEs in this study comprise of cases associated with isolated CME evolution as well as those interacting with high-speed streams (HSS) and high-density streams (HDS). For the isolated CMEs, our results show that the model outputs at both the spacecraft are in good agreement with in-situ observations. However, for most of the interacting events, the model correctly captures the CME evolution only at the inner spacecraft. Due to the interaction with HSS and HDS, which in most cases occurred at heliocentric distances beyond the inner spacecraft, the ICME evolution no longer remains self-similar. Consequently, the model underestimates the field strength at the outer spacecraft. Our findings indicate that constraining the INFROS model with inner spacecraft observations significantly enhances the prediction accuracy at the outer spacecraft for the three events undergoing self-similar expansion, achieving a 90 % correlation between observed and predicted Bz profiles. This work also presents a quantitative estimation of the ICME magnetic field enhancement due to interaction which may lead to severe space weather. We conclude that the assumption of self-similar expansion provides a lower limit to the magnetic field strength estimated at any heliocentric distance, based on the remote sensing observations.</description>
