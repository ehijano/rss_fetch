      <title>Design of a System for Analyzing Cell Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately measuring cell stiffness is challenging due to the invasiveness of traditional methods like atomic force microscopy (AFM) and optical stretching. We introduce a non-invasive off-axis system using holographic imaging and acoustic stimulation. This system features an off-axis Mach-Zehnder interferometer and bulk acoustic waves to capture cell mechanics. It employs high-resolution components to create detailed interferograms and allows continuous imaging of cell deformation. Unlike conventional techniques, our method provides high-throughput, label-free measurements while preserving cell integrity. Polyacrylamide beads are tested for high precision, highlighting the potential of the system in early cancer detection, disease monitoring, and mechanobiological research.</description>

      <title>Air-blood interface engineered microfluidic device to mimic shear rate gradient induced human bleeding model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microfluidic technology has emerged as a powerful tool for studying complex biological processes with enhanced precision and control. A microfluidic chip was designed to emulate human-like microvascular networks with precise control over channel geometry and flow conditions. By simulating blood flow dynamics during bleeding events, we successfully observed the real-time interactions of platelets and their aggregation induced by shear rate gradient at the wound site. Platelet dynamics is primarily influenced by physico-mechanical condition of blood vessels with pathophysiological condition of blood at close proximity of vascular injury site. This microfluidic platform facilitated the investigation of platelet adhesion, activation, and clot formation, providing a unique opportunity to study the spatiotemporal dynamics of platelet aggregation and blood clot. Our findings shed light on the intricate mechanisms underlying thrombus formation and platelet-mediated aggregation, offering a more accurate and dynamic representation of human haemostasis compared to traditional animal models. In the conventional approach, the human bleeding model is tried on mouse due to anatomy and pathological similarities between mouse and humans. This study will simplify and standardize the blood and vasculature conditions. The microfluidic-based replication of the bleeding model holds significant promise in advancing our understanding of clotting disorders and wound healing processes. Furthermore, it paves the way for targeted therapeutic interventions in managing bleeding disorders and enhancing clinical strategies for promoting efficient wound closure. Ultimately, this study demonstrates the potential of microfluidics to revolutionize haemostasis research and opens up new avenues for the development of personalized medicine approaches in the field of clotting disorders.</description>

      <title>Fragmentation and aggregation of cyanobacterial colonies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fluid flow has a major effect on the aggregation and fragmentation of bacterial colonies. Yet, a generic framework to understand and predict how hydrodynamics affects colony size remains elusive. This study investigates how fluid flow affects the formation and maintenance of large colonial structures in cyanobacteria. We performed experiments on laboratory cultures and lake samples of the cyanobacterium Microcystis, while their colony size distribution was measured simultaneously by direct microscopic imaging. We demonstrate that EPS-embedded cells formed by cell division exhibit significant mechanical resistance to shear forces. However, at elevated hydrodynamic stress levels (exceeding those typically generated by surface wind mixing) these colonies experience fragmentation through an erosion process. We also show that single cells can aggregate into small colonies due to fluid flow. However, the structural integrity of these flow-induced colonies is weaker than that of colonies formed by cell division. We provide a mathematical analysis to support the experiments and demonstrate that a population model with two categories of colonies describes the measured size distributions. Our results shed light on the specific conditions wherein flow-induced fragmentation and aggregation of cyanobacteria are decisive and indicate that colony formation under natural conditions is mainly driven by cell division, although flow-induced aggregation could play a role in dense bloom events. These findings can be used to improve prediction models and mitigation strategies for toxic cyanobacterial blooms and also offer potential applications in other areas such as algal biotechnology or medical settings where the dynamics of biological aggregates play a significant role.</description>

      <title>SSPACE Astrobiology Payload-1 (SAP-1)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The SSPACE Astrobiology Payload (SAP) series, starting with the SAP-1 project is designed to conduct in-situ microbiology experiments in low earth orbit. This payload series aims to understand the behaviour of microbial organisms in space, particularly those critical for human health, and the corresponding effects due to microgravity and solar/galactic radiation. SAP-1 focuses on studying Bacillus clausii and Bacillus coagulans, bacteria beneficial to humans. It aims to provide a space laboratory for astrobiology experiments under microgravity conditions. The hardware developed for these experiments is indigenous and tailored to meet the unique requirements of autonomous microbiology experiments by controlling pressure, temperature, and nutrition flow to bacteria. A rotating platform, which forms the core design, is innovatively utilised to regulate the flow and mixing of nutrients with dormant bacteria. The technology demonstration models developed at SSPACE have yielded promising results, with ongoing efforts to refine, adapt for space conditions, and prepare for integration with nanosatellites or space modules. The anticipated payload will be compact, approximately 1U in size (10cm x 10cm x 10cm), consume less than 5W power, and offer flexibility for various microbiological studies.</description>

      <title>Microscopic model for aging of biocondensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biomolecular condensates are membraneless compartments in the cell that are involved in a wide diversity of biological processes. These phase-separated droplets usually exhibit a viscoelastic mechanical response. A behavior rationalized by modeling the complex molecules that make up a condensate as stickers and spacers, which assemble into a network-like structure. The proper functioning of biocondensates requires precise control over their composition, size, and mechanical response. For example, several neurodegenerative diseases are associated with dysfunctional condensates that solidify over a long period of time (days) until they become solid. A phenomenon usually described as aging. The emergence of such a long timescale of evolution from microscopic events, as well as the associated microscopic reorganization leading to aging, remains mostly an open question. In this article, we explore the connection between the mechanical properties of the condensates and their microscopic structure. We propose a minimal model for the dynamic of stickers and spacers, and show that entropy minimization of spacers leads to an attractive force between stickers. Our system displays a surprisingly slow relaxation toward equilibrium, reminiscent of glassy systems and consistent with the liquid-to-solid transition observed. To explain this behavior, we study the clustering dynamic of stickers and successfully explain the origin of glassy relaxation.</description>
