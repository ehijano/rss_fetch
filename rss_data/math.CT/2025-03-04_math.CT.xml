      <title>Multiplicative structures on comodules in higher categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study multiplicative structures on comodules over bialgebras in the setting of $\infty$-categories. We show that the $\infty$-category of comodules over an $(\mathcal{O},\mathbf{Ass})$-bialgebra in a mixed $(\mathcal{O},\mathbf{Ass})$-duoidal $\infty$-category has the structure of an $\mathcal{O}$-monoidal $\infty$-category for any $\infty$-operad $\mathcal{O}$.</description>

      <title>Wakamatsu-tilting subcategories in extriangulated categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathscr{C}$ be an extriangulated category with enough projectives and injectives. We give the definitions of Wakamatsu-tilting subcategories and Wakamatsu-cotilting subcategories of $\mathscr{C}$ and show that they coincide with each other. Moreover, the definitions of $\infty$-tilting subcategories and $\infty$-cotilting subcategories given by Zhang, Wei and Wang also coincide with them. As a result, Wakamatsu-tilting subcategories success all properties of $\infty$-tilting subcategories and $\infty$-cotilting subcategories. On the other hand, we glue the Wakamatsu-tilting subcategories in a special recollement and show that the converse of the gluing holds under certain conditions.</description>

      <title>A Bayesian Interpretation of the Internal Model Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The internal model principle, originally proposed in the theory of control of linear systems, nowadays represents a more general class of results in control theory and cybernetics. The central claim of these results is that, under suitable assumptions, if a system (a controller) can regulate against a class of external inputs (from the environment), it is because the system contains a model of the system causing these inputs, which can be used to generate signals counteracting them. Similar claims on the role of internal models appear also in cognitive science, especially in modern Bayesian treatments of cognitive agents, often suggesting that a system (a human subject, or some other agent) models its environment to adapt against disturbances and perform goal-directed behaviour. It is however unclear whether the Bayesian internal models discussed in cognitive science bear any formal relation to the internal models invoked in standard treatments of control theory. Here, we first review the internal model principle and present a precise formulation of it using concepts inspired by categorical systems theory. This leads to a formal definition of `model' generalising its use in the internal model principle. Although this notion of model is not a priori related to the notion of Bayesian reasoning, we show that it can be seen as a special case of possibilistic Bayesian filtering. This result is based on a recent line of work formalising, using Markov categories, a notion of `interpretation', describing when a system can be interpreted as performing Bayesian filtering on an outside world in a consistent way.</description>

      <title>Quillen equivalence for chain homotopy categories induced by balanced pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a balanced pair $(\mathcal{X},\mathcal{Y})$ in an abelian category, we investigate when the chain homotopy categories ${\bf K}(\mathcal{X})$ and ${\bf K}(\mathcal{Y})$ are triangulated equivalent. To this end, we realize these chain homotopy categories as homotopy categories of certain model categories and give conditions that ensure the existence of a Quillen equivalence between the model categories in question. We further give applications to cotorsion triples, Gorenstein projective and Gorenstein injective modules, as well as pure projective and pure injective objects.</description>

      <title>Augmented virtual double categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.11189</link>
      <description>arXiv:1910.11189v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article the notion of virtual double category (also known as fc-multicategory) is extended as follows. While cells in a virtual double category classically have a horizontal multi-source and single horizontal target, the notion of augmented virtual double category introduced here extends the latter notion by including cells with empty horizontal target as well.
  Any augmented virtual double category comes with a built-in notion of "locally small object" and we describe advantages of using augmented virtual double categories as a setting for formal category rather than 2-categories, which are classically equipped with a notion of "admissible object" by means of a yoneda structure in the sense of Street and Walters.
  An object is locally small precisely if it admits a horizontal unit, and we show that the notions of augmented virtual double category and virtual double category coincide in the presence of all horizontal units. Without assuming the existence of horizontal units we show that most of the basic theory for virtual double categories, such as that of restriction and composition of horizontal morphisms, extends to augmented virtual double categories. We introduce and study in augmented virtual double categories the notion of "pointwise" composition of horizontal morphisms, which formalises the classical composition of profunctors given by the coend formula.</description>

      <title>Classification of fully dualizable linear categories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.16337v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that if $R$ is a G-ring then every fully dualizable $R$-linear cocomplete category is equivalent to a twist by a $\mathbb{G}_m$-gerbe of the category of modules over a finite \'etale $R$-algebra. We also show that this holds more generally over an arbitrary commutative ring under an additional compact generation hypothesis. We include variants of these results that apply to $R$-linear graded categories, and to the context of $\infty$-categories linear over connective commutative ring spectra.</description>

      <title>Cubical Approximation for Directed Topology II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16619v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The paper establishes an equivalence between directed homotopy categories of (diagrams of) cubical sets and (diagrams of) directed topological spaces. This equivalence both lifts and extends an equivalence between classical homotopy categories of cubical sets and topological spaces. Some simple applications include combinatorial descriptions and subsequent calculations of directed homotopy monoids and directed singular $1$-cohomology monoids. Another application is a characterization of isomorphisms between small categories up to zig-zags of natural transformations as directed homotopy equivalences between directed classifying spaces. Cubical sets throughout the paper are taken to mean presheaves over the minimal symmetric monoidal variant of the cube category. Along the way, the paper characterizes morphisms in this variant as the interval-preserving lattice homomorphisms between finite Boolean lattices.</description>

      <title>Frobenius subalgebra lattices in tensor categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19876v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper examines Frobenius subalgebra posets in abelian monoidal categories and shows that they form lattices under certain conditions, including all fusion categories. It then extends Watatani's theorem on the finiteness of intermediate subfactors, proving that these lattices are finite under specific positivity constraints, encompassing all pseudo-unitary fusion categories. The primary tools employed in this study are semisimplification and a concept of formal angle. Additionally, we have broadened several intermediate results, such as the exchange relation theorem and Landau's theorem, to apply to abelian monoidal categories.
  Key applications of our findings include a stronger version of the Ino-Watatani result: we show that the finiteness of intermediate C*-algebras holds in a finite-index unital irreducible inclusion of C*-algebras without requiring the simple assumption. Moreover, for a finite-dimensional semisimple Hopf algebra H, we demonstrate that H* contains a finite number of Frobenius subalgebra objects in Rep(H). Finally, we explore a range of applications, including abstract spin chains, vertex operator algebras, and speculations on quantum arithmetic involving the generalization of Ore's theorem, Euler's totient and sigma functions, and RH.</description>
