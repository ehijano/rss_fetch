      <title>The ALICE 3 detector concept for LHC Runs 5 and 6 and its physics performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The LHC Run 5 and 6 data taking phases will bring unprecedented luminosity in high-energy proton-proton and in heavy-ion collisions. The ALICE Collaboration proposes a next-generation experiment, ALICE 3, specifically designed to operate with the future LHC. ALICE 3 will feature a large pixel-based tracking system covering eight units of pseudorapidity, complemented by advanced particle identification systems. These include silicon time-of-flight layers, a ring-imaging Cherenkov detector, a muon identification system, and an electromagnetic calorimeter. By placing the vertex detector on a retractable plate inside the beam pipe, a track pointing resolution better than 10 microns can be achieved for the transverse momentum range $p_T$&gt;200 MeV/c. ALICE 3 will be capable of innovative measurements of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) and explore new frontiers in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). The detailed study of thermal and dynamical properties of QGP will be made possible by measuring low-$p_T$ heavy-flavour production, including beauty hadrons, multi-charm baryons, and charm-charm correlations. Precise multi-differential measurements of dielectron emission will allow for the exploration of chiral-symmetry restoration and the time-evolution of QGP temperature. In addition to QGP studies, ALICE 3 will make unique contributions to the physics of the hadronic phase, through femtoscopic studies of charm meson interaction potentials and searches for nuclei containing charm. This contribution covers the detector design, expected physics performance, and the current status of detector research and development.</description>

      <title>Limitations from charge quantization on the parallel temperature diagnostic of nonneutral plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a new algorithm to estimate the temperature of a nonneutral plasma in a Penning-Malmberg trap. The algorithm analyzes data obtained by slowly lowering a voltage that confines one end of the plasma and collecting escaping charges, and is a maximum likelihood estimator based on a physically-motivated model of the escape protocol presented in Beck [1990]. Significantly, our algorithm may be used on single-count data, allowing for improved fits with low numbers of escaping electrons. This is important for low-temperature plasmas such as those used in antihydrogen trapping. We perform a Monte Carlo simulation of our algorithm, and assess its robustness to intrinsic shot noise and external noise. Approximately 100 particle counts are needed for an accuracy of +/-10% -- this provides a lower bound for measurable plasma temperatures of approximately 3 K for plasmas of length 1 cm.</description>

      <title>Proportional scintillation in liquid xenon: demonstration in a single-phase liquid-only time projection chamber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10687v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The largest direct dark matter search experiments to date employ dual-phase time projection chambers (TPCs) with liquid noble gas targets. These detect both the primary photons generated by particle interactions in the liquid target, as well as proportional secondary scintillation light created by the ionization electrons in a strong electric field in the gas phase between the liquid-gas interface and the anode. In this work, we describe the detection of charge signals in a small-scale single-phase liquid-xenon-only TPC, that features the well-established TPC geometry with light readout above and below a cylindrical target. In the single-phase TPC, the proportional scintillation light (S2) is generated in liquid xenon in close proximity to 10 {\mu}m diameter anode wires. The detector was characterized and the proportional scintillation process was studied using the 32.1 keV and 9.4 keV signals from 83mKr decays. A charge gain factor g2 of up to (1.9 $\pm$ 0.3) PE/electron was reached at an anode voltage 4.4 kV higher than the gate electrode 5 mm below it, corresponding to (29 $\pm$ 6) photons emitted per ionization electron. The duration of S2 signals is dominated by electron diffusion and approaches the xenon de-excitation timescale for very short electron drift times. The electron drift velocity and the longitudinal diffusion constant were measured at a drift field of 470 V/cm. The results agree with the literature and demonstrate that a single-phase TPC can be operated successfully.</description>

      <title>Modeling of surface-state induced inter-electrode isolation of $n$-on-$p$ devices in mixed-field and $\gamma$-irradiation environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18415v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the HEP-experiments of High Luminosity upgrade of the Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC), the application of isolation implants like $p$-stop between $n^+$-electrodes of position sensitive $n$-on-$p$ sensors has been typically considered to counter the detrimental effect on position resolution of the accumulation of positive net oxide charge with radiation. In addition to the positively charged layer close to the Si/SiO$_2$-interface, surface damage introduced by radiation in SiO$_2$-passivated silicon particle detectors includes the accumulation of trapped-oxide-charge and interface traps. A previous study of either n/$\gamma$ (mixed field)- or $\gamma$-irradiated Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (MOS) capacitors showed evidence of substantially higher introduction rates of acceptor- and donor-type deep interface traps ($N_\textrm{it,acc/don}$) in mixed-field environment. In this work, an inter-electrode resistivity ($\rho_\textrm{int}$) TCAD-simulation study of $n$-on-$p$ sensors with and without $p$-stop isolation implants was conducted for both irradiation types. Higher levels of $\rho_\textrm{int}$ showed correlation to higher densities of deep $N_\textrm{it,acc/don}$, with the isolation performance of the mixed-field irradiated sensors becoming independent of the presence of $p$-stop implant between the $n^+$-electrodes throughout the investigated dose range up to about 100 kGy. The low introduction rates of deep $N_\textrm{it,acc/don}$ in $\gamma$-irradiated sensors resulted in high sensitivity of $\rho_\textrm{int}$ to the presence and peak doping of $p$-stop above the lowest dose of 7 kGy in the study. Because of the advantageous influence of radiation-induced accumulation of deep $N_\textrm{it}$ on the inter-electrode isolation, position sensitive $n$-on-$p$ sensors without isolation implants may be considered for future HEP-experiments where the radiation is largely due to hadrons.</description>
