      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The joint work of European target laboratories in the ChETEC-INFRA project is presented, to face the new experimental challenges of nuclear astrophysics. In particular, results are presented on innovative targets of 12,13C, 16O, and 19F that were produced, characterized, and, in some cases, tested under beam irradiation. STAR (Solid Targets for Astrophysics Research) is already acting to increase collaboration among laboratories, to achieve shared protocols for target production, and to offer a characterization service to the entire nuclear astrophysics community.</description>

      <title>Development of the Beam Monitor Detectors for the Low-E Beamline at the CERN SPS H2 Line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A series of beam tests were conducted at the KEK AR test beamline in ordet to investigate the performance of a prototype detector for instrumentation in the low-E beamline at the CERN H2 line. For the silicon strip detector, the simultaneous readout of all strips of the X-Y detector was evaluated, in addition to the detection efficiency being assessed through coincidences with the trigger scintillators. The results demonstrated the successful acquisition of data with full strip readout and the reconstruction of the two-dimensional beam profile. Furthermore, we are contemplating the incorporation of GAGG crystals, an inorganic scintillator characterized by a high light yield ($\sim$$5 \times 10^{4}$ photons/MeV) and a brief time constant ($\sim$60 ns), within the newly developed time-of-flight detector. We assessed the resolution of time-of-flight based on the data, with the objective of achieving the required performance benchmarks through future improvements to the time-of-tlight detector.</description>

      <title>Next Generation Multi-element monolithic Germanium detectors for Spectroscopy: First integration at ESRF facility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The XAFS-DET work package of the European LEAPS-INNOV project is developing a high-purity Germanium detectors for synchrotron applications requiring spectroscopic-grade response. The detectors integrate three key features: (1) newly designed monolithic Germanium sensors optimised to mitigate charge-sharing events, (2) an improved cooling and mechanical design structure supported by thermal simulations, and (3) complete electronic chain featuring a low-noise CMOS technology-based preamplifier. enabling high X-ray count rate capability over a broad energy range (5-100 keV). This paper discusses the first integration and characterization of one of the two multi-element Ge detectors at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF). The integration phase included validating high-throughput front-End electronics, integrating them with the Ge sensor, and operating them at liquid nitrogen temperature, in addition to the experimental characterization, which consists of electronics noise study and spectroscopic performance evaluation.</description>

      <title>A novel method for measuring the attenuation length and the group velocity of transparent liquids in a variable length cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transparency of liquid scintillators or water is an important parameter for many detectors in particle and astroparticle physics. In this work, the Cavity Enhanced Long Light Path Attenuation Length Screening (CELLPALS) method for the determination of the attenuation length is presented for the first time. The method is based on an experimental setup similar to a Fabry-P\'erot interferometer but adding up multiple-reflected intensities of a modulated light source. CELLPALS was developed to measure the attenuation length of highly transparent liquids (&gt; 10 m) with significantly lower uncertainties than with UV-Vis spectroscopy, which is a standard method for determining the attenuation length. In addition to the attenuation length, the group velocity of light in the sample can also be derived from the free spectral range of the cavity, which is not provided by any conventional method for determining the attenuation length. In this work, the CELLPALS method, its achievable precision and an experimental setup to demonstrate its feasibility are discussed. The attenuation lengths and group velocities of several transparent liquids were measured at wavelengths between 420 nm and 435 nm. In addition, the attenuation length and group velocity of linear alkylbenzene (LAB) samples after different purification stages and a purified LAB-based liquid scintillator were measured at a wavelength of 425 nm. The results confirmed the potential of CELLPALS to determine the attenuation length with an uncertainty of ~ 2 %. The group velocity of light in the sample can be determined with an uncertainty of ~ 0.03 %.</description>

      <title>Characterization of a GAGG detector for neutron measurements in underground laboratories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In rare events experiments, such as those devoted to the direct search of dark matter, a precise knowledge of the environmental gamma and neutron backgrounds is crucial for reaching the design experiment sensitivity. The neutron component is often poorly known due to the lack of a scalable detector technology for the precise measurement of low-flux neutron spectra. Gd$_3$Al$_2$Ga$_3$O$_{12}$ (GAGG) is a newly developed, high-density scintillating crystal with a high gadolinium content, which could allow to exploit the high $(n,\gamma)$ cross section of $^{155}$Gd and $^{157}$Gd for neutron measurements in underground environments. GAGG crystals feature a high scintillation light yield, good timing performance, and the capability of particle identification via pulse-shape discrimination. In a low-background environment, the distinctive signature produced by neutron capture on gadolinium, namely a $\beta/\gamma$ cascade releasing up to 9 MeV of total energy, and the efficient particle identification provided by GAGG could yield a background-free neutron capture signal. In this work, we present the characterization of a first GAGG detector prototype in terms of particle discrimination performance, intrinsic radioactive contamination, and neutron response.</description>

      <title>MOSAIC: Magnonic Observations of Spin-dependent Axion-like InteraCtions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce an array-scalable, magnon-based detector (MOSAIC) to search for the spin-dependent interactions of electron-coupled axion dark matter. These axions can excite single magnons in magnetic targets, such as the yttrium iron garnet (YIG) spheres used here, which are subsequently sensed by the detector. For MOSAIC, this sensing is implemented by coupling the magnons in the YIG spheres to magnetic-field-resilient single-electron charge-qubits, whose state is then interrogated with a quantum non-demolition measurement. Using standard superconducting fabrication techniques, MOSAIC can integrate many YIG sphere-qubit sensors, forming a large detector array. We outline the detector design and operation, and determine its sensitivity to axion dark matter. We find that a detector built with available technology will exceed the sensitivity of previous ferromagnetic haloscopes, and provides a platform where further improvements in performance would search for electron-coupled axion dark matter in unexplored parameter space.</description>

      <title>Maximizing NMR Sensitivity: A Guide to Receiver Gain Adjustment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16411v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Novel methods and technology drive the rapid advances of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The primary objective of developing novel hardware is to improve sensitivity and reliability (and possibly to reduce cost). Automation has made NMR much more convenient, but it may lead to trusting the algorithms without regular checks. In this contribution, we analyzed the signal and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as a function of the receiver gain (RG) for 1H, 2H, 13C, and 15N nuclei on five spectrometers. On a 1 T benchtop spectrometer (Spinsolve, Magritek), the SNR showed the expected increase as a function of RG. Still, the 1H and 13C signal amplitudes deviated by up to 50% from supposedly RG-independent signal intensities. On 7, 9.4, 11.7, and 14.1 T spectrometers (Avance Neo, Bruker), the signal intensity increases linearly with RG as expected, but surprisingly a drastic drop of SNR is observed for some X-nuclei and fields. For example, while RG = 18 provided a 13C SNR similar to that at a maximum RG of 101 at 9.4 T, at RG = 20.2 the determined SNR was 32% lower. The SNR figures are strongly system and resonance frequency dependent. Our findings suggest that NMR users should test the specific spectrometer behavior to obtain optimum SNR for their experiments, as automatic RG adjustment does not account for the observed characteristics. In addition, we provide a method to estimate optimal settings for thermally and hyperpolarized samples of a chosen concentration, polarization, and flip angle, which provide a high SNR and avoid ADC-overflow artefacts.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Timing Residuals: Advancing PET Detectors with Explicit TOF Corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07630v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: PET is a functional imaging method that visualizes metabolic processes. TOF information can be derived from coincident detector signals and incorporated into image reconstruction to enhance the SNR. PET detectors are typically assessed by their CTR, but timing performance is degraded by various factors. Research on timing calibration seeks to mitigate these degradations and restore accurate timing information. While many calibration methods use analytical approaches, machine learning techniques have recently gained attention due to their flexibility. We developed a residual physics-based calibration approach that combines prior domain knowledge with the power of machine learning models. This approach begins with an initial analytical calibration addressing first-order skews. The remaining deviations, regarded as residual effects, are used to train machine learning models to eliminate higher-order skews. The key advantage is that the experimenter guides the learning process through the definition of timing residuals. In earlier studies, we developed models that directly predicted the expected time difference, which offered corrections only implicitly (implicit correction models). In this study, we introduce a new definition for timing residuals, enabling us to train models that directly predict correction values (explicit correction models). The explicit correction approach significantly simplifies data acquisition, improves linearity, and enhances timing performance from $371 \pm 6$ ps to $281 \pm 5$ ps for coincidences from 430 keV to 590 keV. Additionally, the new definition reduces model size, making it suitable for high-throughput applications like PET scanners. Experiments were conducted using two detector stacks composed of $4 \times 4$ LYSO:Ce,Ca crystals ($3.8\times 3.8\times 20$ mm$^{3}$) coupled to $4 \times 4$ Broadcom NUV-MT SiPMs and digitized with the TOFPET2 ASIC.</description>

      <title>KOMPASS: the new cold neutron triple-axis-spectrometer specialized for polarization analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15811v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: KOMPASS is a polarized triple-axis cold neutron spectrometer recently installed at the FRM II neutron source. The instrument is designed to operate exclusively with polarized neutrons and is specialized in longitudinal polarization analysis using Helmholtz coils and spherical zero-field neutron polarimetry using a Cryopad device. The advanced guide system polarizes and focuses flexibly in the scattering plane. A first, fixed parabolic focusing part contains a series of three polarizing supermirror V-cavities that produce a highly polarized beam. By exchanging straight and parabolic front-end guide sections, the resolution of the instrument can be optimized to meet experimental requirements. Large, double-focusing monochromator and analyzer units with pyrolytic graphite crystals enable efficient and adaptive energy selection, and a compact supermirror cavity analyzes the final neutron polarization. Alternatively, or in combination with this cavity, a Heusler polarization analyzer can be used. KOMPASS offers full- and half-polarized configurations with or without secondary energy analysis and provides a wide range of polarization options. Therefore, KOMPASS is well suited for various studies of static and dynamic magnetic correlations with energy transfers on the neutron energy loss side up to ~12 meV.</description>

      <title>Demonstration and frequency noise characterization of a 17 $\mu$m quantum cascade laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16460v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We evaluate the spectral performance of a novel continuous-wave room-temperature distributed feedback quantum cascade laser operating at the long wavelength of 17 $\mu$m. By demonstrating broadband laser absorption spectroscopy of the $\nu$2 fundamental vibrational mode of N2O molecules, we have determined the spectral range and established the spectroscopic potential of this laser. We have characterized the frequency noise and measured the line width of this new device, uncovering a discrepancy with the current consensus on the theoretical modeling of quantum cascade lasers. Our results confirm the potential of such novel narrow-line-width sources for vibrational spectroscopy. Extending laser spectroscopy to longer wavelength is a fascinating prospect that paves the way for a wide range of opportunities from chemical detection, to frequency metrology as well as for exploring light-matter interaction with an extended variety of molecules, from ultra-cold diatomic species to increasingly complex molecular systems.</description>
