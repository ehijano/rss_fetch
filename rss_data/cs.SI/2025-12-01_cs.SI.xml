      <title>Evaluating Global Measures of Network Centralization: Axiomatic and Numerical Assessments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Network centralization, driven by hub nodes, impacts communication efficiency, structural integration, and dynamic processes such as diffusion and synchronization. Although numerous centralization measures exist, a major challenge lies in determining measures that are both theoretically sound and empirically reliable across different network contexts. To resolve this challenge, we normalize 11 measures of network centralization and assess them systematically using an axiomatic framework and numerical simulations. Our axiomatic assessment tests each measure against the six postulates of centralization, ensuring consistency with minimal theoretical requirements. In addition, our numerical assessment examines the behavior of normalized centralization measures over different random graphs. Our results indicate major differences among the measures, despite their common aim of quantifying centralization. Together, our assessments point to the relative suitability of three measures: normalized betweenness centralization, normalized closeness centralization, and normalized degree centralization. Applying these three measures to real-world networks from diverse domains reveals meaningful variation in the organization of the networks with respect to hubs. Normalized betweenness centralization highlights path-based dominance; normalized closeness centralization reflects accessibility and efficiency of reach; and normalized degree centralization captures degree-based hub concentration. When used jointly, the three measures demonstrate the required sensitivity to varying levels of centralization and provide complementary aspects of network centralization that no single measure can offer alone. Our dual evaluation framework clarifies conceptual differences among existing measures and offers practical guidance for selecting reliable centralization metrics.</description>

      <title>WET -- Weighted Ensemble Transformer for Identifying Psychiatric Stressors Related to Suicide X (formerly Twitter)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Suicide remains one of the leading causes of death worldwide, particularly among young people, and psychological stressors are consistently identified as proximal drivers of suicidal ideation and behavior. In recent years, social media platforms such as X have become critical environments where individuals openly disclose emotional distress and conditions associated with suicidality, creating new opportunities for early detection and intervention. Existing approaches, however, predominantly rely on raw textual content and often neglect auxiliary emotional and contextual signals embedded in user metadata. To address this limitation, we propose a Weighted Ensemble Transformer (WET), a dual branch deep learning architecture designed to identify psychiatric stressors associated with suicide in X posts. Our model integrates semantic representations extracted through Transformer encoders with an engineered feature vector capturing sentiment, subjectivity, polarity, and user engagement characteristics. We collected, filtered, and annotated 125,754 English tweets for suicide-related psychological stressors and evaluated the proposed model under two configurations. Extensive comparative experiments against traditional machine learning methods, advanced recurrent networks, and transformer baselines demonstrate that WET achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching 0.9901 accuracy in binary classification. These findings show that hybridizing deep semantic signals with auxiliary emotional and behavioral features substantially improves suicidality detection accuracy.</description>

      <title>HW-GNN: Homophily-Aware Gaussian-Window Constrained Graph Spectral Network for Social Network Bot Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social bots are increasingly polluting online platforms by spreading misinformation and engaging in coordinated manipulation, posing severe threats to cybersecurity. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become mainstream for social bot detection due to their ability to integrate structural and attribute features, with spectral-based approaches demonstrating particular efficacy due to discriminative patterns in the spectral domain. However, current spectral GNN methods face two limitations: (1) their broad-spectrum fitting mechanisms degrade the focus on bot-specific spectral features, and (2) certain domain knowledge valuable for bot detection, e.g., low homophily correlates with high-frequency features, has not been fully incorporated into existing methods.
  To address these challenges, we propose HW-GNN, a novel homophily-aware graph spectral network with Gaussian window constraints. Our framework introduces two key innovations: (i) a Gaussian-window constrained spectral network that employs learnable Gaussian windows to highlight bot-related spectral features, and (ii) a homophily-aware adaptation mechanism that injects domain knowledge between homophily ratios and frequency features into the Gaussian window optimization process. Through extensive experimentation on multiple benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that HW-GNN achieves state-of-the-art bot detection performance, outperforming existing methods with an average improvement of 4.3% in F1-score, while exhibiting strong plug-in compatibility with existing spectral GNNs.</description>

      <title>Community Detection in Multilayer Networks: Challenges, Opportunities and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Community detection is a fascinating and rapidly evolving field, but when it comes to analyzing networks with multiple types of interactions, referred to as multilayer networks, there is still a lot of untapped potential. Despite the wide array of methods developed to identify community structures in such networks, this area remains underexplored, leaving plenty of room for innovation. A systematic review of recent advancements is essential to understand where the field stands and where it is headed. While significant strides have been made across various disciplines, many questions remain unanswered, and new opportunities are waiting to be uncovered. In this paper, we explore the different types of multilayer networks, community detection techniques, and how they are applied in real world scenarios. We also dive into the key challenges researchers face and suggest potential directions for future work, aiming to refine community detection techniques and boost their effectiveness in multilayer networks.</description>

      <title>DeXposure: A Dataset and Benchmarks for Inter-protocol Credit Exposure in Decentralized Financial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We curate the DeXposure dataset, the first large-scale dataset for inter-protocol credit exposure in decentralized financial networks, covering global markets of 43.7 million entries across 4.3 thousand protocols, 602 blockchains, and 24.3 thousand tokens, from 2020 to 2025. A new measure, value-linked credit exposure between protocols, is defined as the inferred financial dependency relationships derived from changes in Total Value Locked (TVL). We develop a token-to-protocol model using DefiLlama metadata to infer inter-protocol credit exposure from the token's stock dynamics, as reported by the protocols. Based on the curated dataset, we develop three benchmarks for machine learning research with financial applications: (1) graph clustering for global network measurement, tracking the structural evolution of credit exposure networks, (2) vector autoregression for sector-level credit exposure dynamics during major shocks (Terra and FTX), and (3) temporal graph neural networks for dynamic link prediction on temporal graphs. From the analysis, we observe (1) a rapid growth of network volume, (2) a trend of concentration to key protocols, (3) a decline of network density (the ratio of actual connections to possible connections), and (4) distinct shock propagation across sectors, such as lending platforms, trading exchanges, and asset management protocols. The DeXposure dataset and code have been released publicly. We envision they will help with research and practice in machine learning as well as financial risk monitoring, policy analysis, DeFi market modeling, amongst others. The dataset also contributes to machine learning research by offering benchmarks for graph clustering, vector autoregression, and temporal graph analysis.</description>

      <title>A lasso-alternative to Dijkstra's algorithm for identifying short paths in networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of finding the shortest path between two selected vertices of a graph and formulate this as an $\ell_1$-regularized regression -- Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (lasso). We draw connections between a numerical implementation of this lasso-formulation, using the so-called LARS algorithm, and a more established algorithm known as the bi-directional Dijkstra. Appealing features of our formulation include the applicability of the Alternating Direction of Multiplier Method (ADMM) to the problem to identify short paths, and a relatively efficient update to topological changes.</description>

      <title>The impact of anticonformity on the diffusion of innovation -- insights from the q-voter model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anticonformity, behaving in deliberate opposition to the group of influence, has long been recognized as a distinct social response, differing both from conformity and from independence. While often treated as a source of noise or contrarianism, anticonformity can play a constructive role in social dynamics by counterbalancing majority pressure and influencing collective outcomes. Recently, it was shown in laboratory experiments that evaluation may induce strategic anticonformity when rewards are anticipated. Moreover, using agent-based modeling, it has been demonstrated that anticonformity can depolarize highly polarized social groups and prevent social hysteresis. These findings encouraged us to extend the q-voter model with asymmetric independence, an agent-based model of the diffusion of innovation, by introducing anticonformity, so that agents can act independently, follow the group, or oppose it. Using a mean-field approximation (MFA), we investigate how these behavioral tendencies influence the diffusion of innovation. Our results show that anticonformists can accelerate early adoption and enable successful diffusion even in cases where diffusion would otherwise fail. The model exhibits two stable adoption levels separated by an unstable branch, giving rise to hysteresis and a critical mass effect. We also demonstrate that increasing independence lowers the threshold of anticonformity needed for widespread adoption. These results highlight how anticonformist behavior can facilitate innovation diffusion, with practical implications for decision-makers and policy design.</description>

      <title>An Improved and Generalised Analysis for Spectral Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the theoretical performances of Spectral Clustering, a classical algorithm for graph partitioning that relies on the eigenvectors of a matrix representation of the graph. Informally, we show that Spectral Clustering works well as long as the smallest eigenvalues appear in groups well separated from the rest of the matrix representation's spectrum. This arises, for example, whenever there exists a hierarchy of clusters at different scales, a regime not captured by previous analyses. Our results are very general and can be applied beyond the traditional graph Laplacian. In particular, we study Hermitian representations of digraphs and show Spectral Clustering can recover partitions where edges between clusters are oriented mostly in the same direction. This has applications in, for example, the analysis of trophic levels in ecological networks. We demonstrate that our results accurately predict the performances of Spectral Clustering on synthetic and real-world data sets.</description>

      <title>Predicting Startup-VC Fund Matches with Structural Embeddings and Temporal Investment Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study proposes a method for predicting startup inclusion, estimating the probability that a venture capital fund will invest in a given startup. Unlike general recommendation systems, which typically rank multiple candidates, our approach formulates the problem as a binary classification task tailored to each fund-startup pair. Each startup is represented by integrating textual, numerical, and structural features, with Node2Vec capturing network context and multihead attention enabling feature fusion. Fund investment histories are encoded as LSTM based sequences of past investees.
  Experiments on Japanese startup data demonstrate that the proposed method achieves higher accuracy than a static baseline. The results indicate that incorporating structural features and modeling temporal investment dynamics are effective in capturing fund-startup compatibility.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01718v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a dynamic epidemic model for successive opinion diffusion in social networks, extending the SHIMR model. It incorporates dynamic decision-making influenced by social distances and captures accumulative opinion diffusion caused by interrelated rumors. The model reflects the impact of rumor spread on social network structures. Simulations validate its effectiveness in explaining phenomena like the echo chamber effect and provide insights into opinion diffusion dynamics, with implications for understanding social polarization and network evolution.</description>

      <title>Topic and Sentiment Trends in Semaglutide Discussions on X: Subpopulation-Based Longitudinal Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18432v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Background: User experience strongly influences pharmaceutical drug effectiveness. Social media platforms like X have become major spaces where people share medication-related experiences, especially for widely marketed drugs such as semaglutide. Despite high activity online, how different user groups engage in semaglutide discussions remains unclear.
  Objective: This study examines how semaglutide is perceived and discussed across X user groups by analyzing (1) changes in sentiment over time and (2) key discussion topics.
  Methods: We collected 859,751 posts about semaglutide from July 2021 to April 2024, along with metadata. We performed sentiment analysis and topic modeling to evaluate patterns across user subpopulations and time periods.
  Results: The overall mean sentiment was -0.24, with all groups showing declines over time. Discussions focused on weight loss, side effects, costs, and celebrity or political influence. Organizational accounts expressed less negative sentiment (mean = -0.04) than individuals (mean = -0.28), a statistically significant difference (P &lt; .001). An interrupted time-series analysis showed a sentiment drop between Nov 2022 and Jan 2023, coinciding with regulatory announcements. We also found gender differences: posts by female users contained more discussions of celebrities and politicians (21 percent) compared to male users (17 percent), while male users expressed more positive sentiment.
  Conclusions: This study highlights how diverse user groups perceive and discuss semaglutide. Although sentiment was broadly negative, important differences emerged across subpopulations. These findings have implications for health communication and pharmacovigilance.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Complexities of Responsibly Sharing NSFW Content Online</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15726v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reddit is in the minority of mainstream social platforms that permit posting content that may be considered to be at the edge of what is permissible, including so-called Not Safe For Work (NSFW) content. However, NSFW is becoming more common on mainstream platforms, with X now allowing such material. We examine the top 15 NSFW-restricted subreddits by size to explore the complexities of responsibly sharing adult content, aiming to balance ethical and legal considerations with monetization opportunities. We find that users often use NSFW subreddits as a social springboard, redirecting readers to private or specialized adult social platforms such as Telegram, Kik or OnlyFans for further interactions. They also directly negotiate image "trades" through credit cards or payment platforms such as PayPal, Bitcoin or Venmo. Disturbingly, we also find linguistic cues linked to non-consensual content sharing. To help platforms moderate such behavior, we trained a RoBERTa-based classification model, which outperforms GPT-4 and traditional classifiers such as logistic regression and random forest in identifying non-consensual content sharing, showing better performance in this specific task. The source code and model weights are publicly available at https://github.com/socsys/15NSFWsubreddits.</description>

      <title>Displacement and disconnection: the impact of violence on migration networks and highway traffic in Mexico</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.12743v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine how violence affects migration flows and, crucially, how it reshapes the strength of migration networks -- measured by the intensity of migration between areas, accounting for the fact that some routes become more prominent or fade over time -- an aspect traditional studies overlook. Using a novel network algorithm and Mexican census data from 2005 to 2020, we first quantify changes in the strength of domestic and international migration networks across all Mexican municipalities. We exploit variation in local homicide rates, using exogenous fuel price increases and municipalities' proximity to oil pipelines as instruments, to estimate the causal impact of violence on migration. During our study period, following intensified government crackdowns on drug trafficking organizations, many criminal groups fragmented and turned toward large-scale oil theft, driving sharp increases in violence in areas with oil pipelines, particularly when fuel prices rose. The findings show that rising violence increased emigration flows, predominantly within Mexico, and strengthened the intensity of emigration networks both domestically and toward the United States. Although violent municipalities continued to receive new residents, the rise in emigration was larger. Increasing homicide rates led to at least an additional 1.12 million people emigrating domestically and 50,200 fewer Mexicans returning from the United States. Violence also eroded regional connectivity, causing a long-term decline in daily vehicle traffic on highways linking violent areas to the rest of the country.</description>

      <title>Public sentiments on the fourth industrial revolution: An unsolicited public opinion poll from Twitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14230v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper establishes an empirical baseline of public sentiment toward Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) technologies across six European countries during the period 2006--2019, prior to the widespread adoption of generative AI systems. Employing transformer-based natural language processing models on a corpus of approximately 90,000 tweets and news articles, I document a European public sphere increasingly divided in its assessment of technological change: neutral sentiment declined markedly over the study period as citizens sorted into camps of enthusiasm and concern, a pattern that manifests distinctively across national contexts and technology domains. Approximately 6\% of users inhabit echo chambers characterized by sentiment-aligned networks, with privacy discourse exhibiting the highest susceptibility to such dynamics. These findings provide a methodologically rigorous reference point for evaluating how the introduction of ChatGPT and subsequent generative AI systems has transformed public discourse on automation, employment, and technological change. The results carry implications for policymakers seeking to align technological governance with societal values in an era of rapid AI advancement.</description>

Abstract: Today, social media platforms hold sole power to study the effects of feed ranking algorithms. We developed a platform-independent method that reranks participants' feeds in real-time and used this method to conduct a preregistered 10-day field experiment with 1,256 participants on X during the 2024 U.S. presidential campaign. Our experiment used a large language model to rerank posts that expressed antidemocratic attitudes and partisan animosity (AAPA). Decreasing or increasing AAPA exposure shifted out-party partisan animosity by two points on a 100-point feeling thermometer, with no detectable differences across party lines, providing causal evidence that exposure to AAPA content alters affective polarization. This work establishes a method to study feed algorithms without requiring platform cooperation, enabling independent evaluation of ranking interventions in naturalistic settings.</description>
