      <title>Hydrodynamic instabilities in long-term three-dimensional simulations of neutrino-driven supernovae of 13 red supergiant progenitors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present long-term three-dimensional (3D) simulations of Type-IIP supernovae (SNe) for 13 non-rotating, single-star, red-supergiant (RSG) progenitors with zero-age-main-sequence masses between 12.5 M$_{\odot}$ and 27.3 M$_{\odot}$. The explosions were modelled with a parametric treatment of neutrino heating to obtain defined energies, ${}^{56}$Ni yields, and neutron-star properties in agreement with previous results. Our 3D SN models were evolved from core bounce until 10 days to study how the large-scale mixing of chemical elements depends on the progenitor structure. Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities (RTIs), which grow at the (C+O)/He and He/H interfaces and interact with the reverse shock forming after the SN shock has passed the He/H interface, play a crucial role in the outward mixing of ${}^{56}$Ni into the hydrogen envelope. We find most extreme ${}^{56}$Ni mixing and the highest maximum ${}^{56}$Ni velocities in lower-mass (LM) explosions despite lower explosion energies, and the weakest ${}^{56}$Ni mixing in the 3D explosions of the most massive RSGs. The efficiency of radial ${}^{56}$Ni mixing anti-correlates linearly with the helium-core mass and correlates positively with the magnitude of a local maximum of $\rho r^3$ in the helium shell. This maximum causes shock deceleration and therefore facilitates high growth factors of RTI at the (C+O)/He interface in the LM explosions. Therefore fast-moving ${}^{56}$Ni created by the asymmetric neutrino-heating mechanism is carried into the ubiquitous RT-unstable region near the He/H interface and ultimately far into the envelopes of the exploding RSGs. Our correlations may aid improving mixing prescriptions in 1D SN models and deducing progenitor structures from observed SN properties.</description>

      <title>Modeling X-ray photon pile-up with a normalizing flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamic range of imaging detectors flown on-board X-ray observatories often only covers a limited flux range of extrasolar X-ray sources. The analysis of bright X-ray sources is complicated by so-called pile-up, which results from high incident photon flux. This nonlinear effect distorts the measured spectrum, resulting in biases in the inferred physical parameters, and can even lead to a complete signal loss in extreme cases. Piled-up data are commonly discarded due to resulting intractability of the likelihood. As a result, a large number of archival observations remain underexplored. We present a machine learning solution to this problem, using a simulation-based inference framework that allows us to estimate posterior distributions of physical source parameters from piled-up eROSITA data. We show that a normalizing flow produces better-constrained posterior densities than traditional mitigation techniques, as more data can be leveraged. We consider model- and calibration-dependent uncertainties and the applicability of such an algorithm to real data in the eROSITA archive.</description>

      <title>Disk mass predictions for binary neutron star mergers: limitations of proposed symbolic regression models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling disk formation and mass ejection in binary neutron star systems is an important component in the construction of models for the electromagnetic signals powered by these events. Most models rely on analytical formulae for the disk mass and dynamical ejecta that are fitted to the results of numerical simulations, yet these fits have large uncertainties that significantly limit our ability to extract information from merger observations. In a recent manuscript, Darc et al claim that disk mass formulae constructed using symbolic regression outperform existing formulae and robustly extend to regions of the parameter space outside of the fitting region. I show here that the improvement over the most directly comparable existing model comes mostly from the use of different error measures in optimizing the fitting parameters. For the limited training data used so far, that existing fitting formula has a performance similar to symbolic regression models when optimized over the same error measure. More importantly, I show that many of the formulae obtained through symbolic regression provide unphysical results when used over the whole range of parameters relevant to the modeling of binary neutron star mergers, making them dangerous to use within parameter estimation pipelines. I conclude that fitting formulae with more physics input (e.g. Lund et al 2025), albeit certainly imperfect, remain safer to use in data analysis than these symbolic regression results. Symbolic regression results used in conjunction with careful physics-based vetting may however outperform them in the future.</description>

      <title>Through the Heliospheric Lens: Directional Deflection of High-Energy Cosmic-Ray Electrons and Positrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how the large-scale heliosphere alters the arrival directions of high-energy cosmic-ray electrons and positrons and ask if and when this "heliospheric lens" can be ignored for anisotropy and source-association studies - an especially timely topic given, for instance, the persistent cosmic-ray positron fraction and its unknown origin. Using a modular back-tracing framework, we explore a set of widely used magnetic-field descriptions - from a Parker spiral baseline to more structured configurations that include latitudinal wind contrasts, Smith-Bieber-type azimuthal strengthening, and tilted or wavy heliospheric current sheets. Across these models the picture is consistent: most bending is accumulated within the inner tens of astronomical units and decreases rapidly with energy. Field choices and solar-cycle geometry set the overall normalization, with stronger spiral winding or a more highly tilted current sheet producing larger deflections at the same energy. Differences between electrons and positrons are most apparent at lower energies, where drift histories and current-sheet encounters diverge, and become increasingly small at multi-TeV energies. We summarize these trends with a practical threshold energy describing when heliospheric bending falls below an instrument's angular resolution, and we verify that our conclusions are robust to numerical settings. For current instruments, heliospheric effects can usually be treated as a small correction at the highest energies, while sub-TeV analyses benefit from a calibrated envelope that accounts for plausible field configurations during the observing epoch.</description>

      <title>Characterization of type Ibn SNe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Type Ibn supernovae (SNe) are characterized by narrow helium (He I) lines from photons produced by the unshocked circumstellar material (CSM). About 80 SNe Ibn have been discovered to date, and only a handful have extensive observational records. Thus, many open questions regarding the progenitor system and the origin of the CSM remain. Here we investigate potential correlations between the spectral features of the prominent He I $\lambda$5876 line and the optical and X-ray light curve properties of SNe Ibn. We compile the largest sample of 61 SNe Ibn to date, of which 24 SNe have photometric and spectroscopic data from the Young Supernova Experiment and 37 SNe have archival data sets. We fit 24 SNe Ibn with sufficient photometric coverage ($B$ to $z$ bands) using semi-analytical models from MOSFiT. We demonstrate that the light curves of SNe Ibn are more diverse than previous analyses suggest, with absolute $r$-band peak magnitudes of $-19.4\pm0.6$~mag and rise (from $-10$ days to peak) and decay-rates (from peak to +10 days) of $-0.08\pm0.06$ and $0.08\pm0.03$ mag/day, respectively. We find that the majority of SNe Ibn in the sub-sample are consistent with a low-energy explosion ($&lt;10^{51}$ erg) of a star with a compact envelope surrounded by $\sim$0.1 M$_{\odot}$ of helium-rich CSM. The inferred ejecta masses are small ($\sim 1$ M$_{\odot}$) and expand with a velocity of $\sim$5000 km/s. Our spectroscopic analysis shows that the mean velocity of the narrow component of the He I lines, associated to the CSM, peaks at $\sim1100$ km/s. The mean CSM and ejecta masses inferred for a sub-sample of SNe Ibn indicate that their progenitors are not massive ($\sim10$ M$_{\odot}$), single stars at the moment of explosion, but are likely binary systems. This agrees with the detection of potential companion stars of SNe Ibn progenitors, and the inferred CSM properties from stellar evolution models.</description>

      <title>Spectral-Timing Evolution of a Black hole X-ray binary Swift J1727.8-1613: Linking Disk Reflection and Type-C QPO Frequency During the 2023 Outburst</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive spectral-timing analysis of a BHXB Swift J1727.8$-$1613 during its 2023 outburst, using five pointed \textit{NuSTAR} observations sampling the luminous hard-intermediate state. Broadband 3-79 keV spectroscopy employs a physically motivated model combining a cool truncated disk (\texttt{diskbb}), relativistic reflection (\texttt{relxill} in reflection-only mode), and Comptonized continuum (\texttt{nthComp}) to probe the inner accretion geometry around a rapidly spinning black hole ($a_\ast\!=\!0.98$) at moderate inclination. Simultaneous timing analysis reveals type-C quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) with novel coherence evolution: the quality factor ($Q$) exhibits a striking non-monotonic dependence on both QPO frequency and luminosity, peaking near $\nu_{\rm QPO}\!\sim\!1.2$~Hz and declining at both lower and higher frequencies. This turnover directly constrains Lense-Thirring precession geometry, implying optimal coherence at intermediate truncation radius. A tight photon-index-QPO-frequency correlation demonstrates that spectral softening and frequency rise are concurrent signatures of inward truncation-radius motion. The triadic luminosity evolution-rising disk and Compton, declining reflection-traces precession-driven geometry changes and corona beaming effects. Interpreting disk-normalization variability as apparent-area changes rather than physical radius swings provides new insight into disk-corona boundary layers. These quantitative results provide strong evidence for global Lense-Thirring precession regulation of both timing and spectral properties, establishing Swift J1727.8$-$1613 as a benchmark source for understanding accretion-geometry physics during black hole state transitions.</description>

      <title>Detection of disk-jet co-precession in a tidal disruption event</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Theories and simulations predict that intense spacetime curvature near black holes bends the trajectories of light and matter, driving disk and jet precession under relativistic torques. However, direct observational evidence of disk-jet co-precession remains elusive. Here, we report the most compelling case to date: a tidal disruption event (TDE) exhibiting unprecedented 19.6-day quasi-periodic variations in both X-rays and radio, with X-ray amplitudes exceeding an order of magnitude. The nearly synchronized X-ray and radio variations suggest a shared mechanism regulating the emission regions. We demonstrate that a disk-jet Lense-Thirring precession model successfully reproduces these variations while requiring a low-spin black hole. This study uncovers previously uncharted short-term radio variability in TDEs, highlights the transformative potential of high-cadence radio monitoring, and offers profound insights into disk-jet physics.</description>

      <title>Pulsar B1237+25 Aberration/Retardation Analysis from Decimeter to Decameter Wavelength: Challenge to "Radius-to-Frequency Mapping"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: PSR B1237+25 is perhaps the canonical example of a pulsar with a core/double cone profile. Moreover, it is bright with little spectral turnover, and its profile perhaps uniquely remains undistorted by scattering far into the decametric band. Here we assemble more than a dozen of the highest quality profiles (30 MHz to 5 GHz) from half a dozen observatories, where possible polarimetric. The pulsar's 2.6$^{\circ}$ core component marks the magnetic axis longitude, and we confirm that this point coincides both with the linear polarization angle inflection point and the zero-crossing of its antisymmetric circular signature -- thus providing the possibility to estimate emission heights over a very broad band using aberration/retardation (A/R). We then carefully fit the profile components with Gaussians to identify and study the subtle asymmetries produced by A/R. We find a consistent A/R in the pulsar's profiles of some 0.5$^{\circ}$ longitude or 2 ms -- corresponding to a putative conal emission height of 200-400 km -- with a formal error of about 100 km. Our analysis finds no evidence whatsoever for an emission height increase with wavelength, the so-called ``radius-to-frequency mapping''. Nor do we find any significant difference in A/R effect between the outer and inner cones.</description>

      <title>Helical Magnetic Field in the Acceleration--Collimation Zone of the M87 Jet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relativistic jets from supermassive black holes are expected to be magnetically launched and guided, with magnetic energy systematically converted to bulk kinetic energy throughout an extended acceleration-collimation zone (ACZ). A key prediction of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models is a transition from poloidally dominated fields near the engine to toroidally dominated fields downstream, yet direct tests within the ACZ are hampered by weak polarization and strong Faraday rotation. We report quasi-simultaneous, high-sensitivity, multifrequency very long baseline interferometric polarimetry of M87 spanning 1.4-24.4GHz. We present high-fidelity, Faraday rotation-corrected maps of intrinsic linear polarization that continuously resolve the ACZ in the de-projected distance range of ~9e3 to ~3.6e5 gravitational radii from the black hole. The maps reveal pronounced north-south asymmetries in fractional linear polarization and electric vector position angle (EVPA), peaking in the inner ACZ at a projected distance of ~20mas along the jet and remaining prominent out to ~100mas. These signatures are best reproduced by models with a large-scale, ordered helical field that retains a substantial poloidal component-contrary to the rapid toroidal dominance expected under steady, ideal MHD. This tension implies ongoing magnetic dissipation that limits toroidal buildup over the ACZ. The handedness of the helix provides an independent constraint on the black hole's spin direction, supporting a spin vector oriented away from the observer, consistent with the orientation inferred from horizon-scale imaging. Farther downstream, the asymmetries diminish, and the EVPA and fractional polarization distributions become more symmetric; we tentatively interpret this as evolution toward a more poloidally dominated configuration, while noting current sensitivity and dynamic-range limits.</description>

      <title>Prospects for detecting periodic or sharp fast-time features in the supernova neutrino lightcurve with IceCube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutrinos produced in core-collapse supernova offer a direct probe into the hydrodynamics and energy transport mechanisms during the collapse and play a pivotal role in the shock revival and success of the supernova explosion. Fast-time features of the neutrino luminosity and energy spectrum encode information about phenomena such as turbulence, convection, shock revival and potential quark-hadron phase transitions. In this study, we explore the detection capabilities of large-volume neutrino telescopes with a focus on IceCube and the planned extension IceCube-Gen2. Furthermore, we consider the effect on the detection sensitivity from wavelength shifters through enhanced light collection.
  A variety of models predict periodic fast-time features in supernova light curves; to quantify their detectability without relying on specific models, we investigate the detector response to a generic parameterisation of such features. We find that independent of feature frequency, IceCube-Gen2 instrumented with wavelength shifters has sensitivity to weaker modulations ($&gt;25\%$ amplitude) as compared to only the strongest modulations ($&gt;50\%$ amplitude) with IceCube. In addition, we examine the sensitivity of the neutrino lightcurve to sharp features from a quark-hadron phase transition. Phase transitions leading to a quark star remnant are detectable with IceCube at $5\sigma$ up to the edge of the Galaxy, and throughout the Small Magellanic Cloud with IceCube-Gen2 equipped with wavelength-shifters. In contrast, models collapsing into a black hole are observable only within the Galaxy, covering $41\%$ of the CCSNe population for IceCube and nearly all ($91\%$) for IceCube-Gen2 complemented by wavelength shifters. These results highlight the potential of IceCube-Gen2 for detecting Galactic sources more reliably and with greater reach.</description>

      <title>Observational properties of a Schwarzschild black hole surrounded by a Dehnen-type dark matter halo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the accretion process and observational signatures of thin accretion disks around a Schwarzschild black hole (BH) embedded in a Dehnen-type dark matter (DM) halo. We examine the influence of the density {\rho}_{s} and radius r_{s} of the DM halo on key disk properties, including the energy flux, temperature distribution, and emission spectrum. Our results show that all three of these quantities decrease with increasing {\rho}_{s} or r_{s}. Furthermore, by generating and analyzing both direct and secondary images of the accretion disk, we explore how the observational inclination angle and the DM halo parameters {\rho}_{s} and rs affect image profiles. Finally, the observed flux distributions are presented for different inclination angles. Our findings indicate that the accretion disk becomes colder and dimmer as the DM halo parameters increase, highlighting the significant role of DM in shaping BH observables.</description>

Abstract: Old, thermally bright neutron stars imply internal heating at late times. Among candidate mechanisms, vortex creep heating (VCH) provides a robust link between spin-down and frictional dissipation in the pinned inner-crust superfluid, yet its interplay with fast DUrca cooling in massive stars remains insufficiently explored.
  We (i) implement VCH in our cooling code and validate it; (ii) identify the physically consistent domain where the steady-state form $L_{\text{h}}=J|\dot\Omega_\infty|$ applies; (iii) quantify how $(B,P_0)$ regulate observable VCH signatures under DUrca cooling; and (iv) introduce a 3D representation that resolves degeneracies hidden in standard 2D projections.
  Cooling is computed with BSk24 and APR EoS, standard pairing gaps, and iron/carbon envelopes. VCH is modeled with $J\simeq10^{42.9\text{--}43.8}$ erg s, and a quantum-creep coverage fraction $f_{\text{Q}}(t)$ diagnoses when steady-state heating is valid. We survey $B=10^{10\text{--}13}$ G and $P_0=10$--$570$ ms for $1.4$ and $2.0\,M_\odot$, and compare with a curated set of ordinary pulsars with measured $(P,\dot P)$.
  Results: (1) Our implementation reproduces published VCH bands. (2) The $(B,P_0)$ validity boundary follows magnetic-dipole spin-down, confirming consistency with $|\dot\Omega|$. (3) DUrca+VCH maintains $T_{\text{s}}^\infty\gtrsim10^5$ K for $B\gtrsim10^{11-12}$ G up to $P_0\sim10^2$ ms. (4) The 3D representation shows that sources appearing coincident in $(t,T_{\text{s}}^\infty)$ occupy distinct $B$-layers, removing degeneracies.
  VCH can substantially reshape late-time thermal states when spin-down power remains high; its observability depends chiefly on $(B,P_0)$ rather than on mass alone. We provide a practical $(B,P_0)$ validity map for $L_{\text{h}}=J|\dot\Omega_\infty|$ and advocate treating $B$ as a co-equal axis in cooling analyses.

      <title>TransFit-CSM: A Fast, Physically Consistent Framework for Interaction-Powered Transients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present TransFit-CSM, a fast and physically consistent framework for modeling interaction-powered transients. The method self-consistently couples the ejecta circumstellar medium (CSM) shock dynamics to radiative diffusion from a moving heating boundary tied to the shocks, so that both the photon escape path and the effective diffusion time evolve with radius and time. We solve the mass and momentum equations for the forward and reverse shocks together with the diffusion equation in the unshocked CSM. TransFit-CSM reproduces the canonical sequence of an early dark phase, a diffusion-mediated rise and peak, and a post-interaction cooling tail, and it clarifies why Arnett-like peak scalings break down in optically thick CSM. The framework is well suited for Bayesian inference and constrains physical parameters of the ejecta and CSM from bolometric or joint multi-band light curves. Applications to SN 2006gy and SN 2010jl yield accurate fits and physically interpretable posteriors, highlighting the dominant role of pre-supernova mass loss in shaping the observables. Because it is both computationally efficient and physically grounded, TransFit-CSM bridges simple analytic prescriptions and radiation-hydrodynamic simulations, enabling population-level inference for current and future time-domain surveys.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the nature of the Einstein Probe transient EP 241021a</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a multi-wavelength analysis of the fast X-ray transient EP 241021a, discovered by the Wide-field X-ray Telescope aboard the \emph{Einstein Probe} satellite on 2024 October 21. The event was not detected in gamma-rays. Follow-up observations from $\sim$1.5 to 100 days post-trigger were obtained across X-ray, UV, optical, near-infrared, and radio bands with ground- and space-based facilities. The redshift is constrained to $z = 0.7485$ from prominent optical spectral features. The optical light curve shows complex evolution: an initial $\sim t^{-0.7}$ decay, followed by a rapid re-brightening peaking at day 7.7 with $\sim t^{-1.7}$ decay, and a third phase peaking near day 19 with $\sim t^{-1.3}$ decay. The spectral energy distribution (SED) and its temporal evolution are consistent with a mix of non-thermal and thermal components. Early optical-to-X-ray spectral indices agree with optically thin synchrotron emission, while steepening of the optical SED after $\sim$20 days indicates either a shift in emission mechanism or the emergence of an additional component. Although broad-lined absorption features are absent, comparisons with type Ic-BL supernovae suggest a SN contribution at late times, suggesting a collapsar origin for EP 241021a. The likely SN in EP 241021a appears to require an additional energy source beyond $^{56}$Ni decay. These results support the view that some fast X-ray transients detected by the \emph{Einstein Probe} arise from massive stellar explosions.</description>

      <title>Multiple Components and Spectral Evolution of BL Lacertae as Revealed by Multiwavelength Variability and SED Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: BL Lac has entered an active state since 2020, with multiwavelength observations revealing intense flares. In this study, we conducted 12-night multicolor optical monitoring using an 85 cm telescope from 2020 September to 2024 June and collected long-term broad-band archived data from radio to $\gamma$-rays. Intraday variabilities were detected on four nights, and most of them exhibited a bluer-when-brighter behavior. Both clockwise and counterclockwise spectral hysteresis loops were found within a single night. However, no reliable intraband time lag was detected for the intranight variabilities. On long timescales, the cross-correlation analysis shows that the variations of the optical, X-ray, and $\gamma$-ray bands do not reveal an obvious time delay, while the variations in the radio bands lagged them by about 370 days. The measured time lags suggest two distinct emission regions respectively responsible for the optical to $\gamma$-ray radiation and for the radio radiation, with a spatial separation of approximately $4.50\times10^{19}\ \rm cm$. We modeled the broad-band spectral energy distributions during four flaring epochs and one quiescent epoch, and found evidence for the possible persistent existence of a very high energy emission region. We also confirmed a spectral evolution of the source from an intermediate synchrotron peaked BL Lac object to a low synchrotron peaked BL Lac object.</description>

      <title>Multi Messenger Study of GRB 221009A with VHE Gamma-ray and Neutrino Afterglow from a Gaussian Structured Jet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent detections of very-high-energy (VHE; $\gtrsim 100$~GeV) emission from GRB afterglows, notably the unprecedented brightness of GRB~221009A observed by LHAASO, reveal emission components beyond the standard electron synchrotron model. Multi-TeV photons motivate synchrotron self-Compton and possibly hadronic contributions, while the non-detection of coincident neutrinos by IceCube/KM3NeT/GRAND200k constrains the microphysical parameters, jet kinetic energy and ambient medium density. We model the VHE afterglow of GRB 221009A with an external forward shock from a Gaussian structured jet in a uniform density medium. This angular structure reproduces the extreme TeV output at an off-axis angle but without demanding large energies as in a top-hat jet. We also compute the corresponding $p\gamma$ neutrino flux in the PeV-EeV energies and derive a time-integrated upper limit based on the effective areas of IceCube Gen2 and GRAND200k, providing the contributions of individual GRBs to the neutrino events. The predicted neutrino flux for GRB 221009A with model parameters inferred from multi-wavelength spectral energy distribution lies below the sensitivities of these detectors. Even under highly optimistic microphysical conditions, our correlation analysis infers that the events from this GRB are of order $\sim 0.1$ for upcoming GRAND200k. We also compare neutrino fluxes for on-axis and off-axis viewing geometries and find that jet orientation alone can introduce nearly an order of magnitude variation in the signal. Thus, our studies imply that a GRB both brighter and closer than GRB 221009A would be crucial for any neutrino detections by upcoming neutrino telescopes. Future GRB detections by the CTA will provide important constraints on their geometry, radiation mechanisms, and any potential associated neutrino signals.</description>

      <title>The hard ultraluminous state of NGC 5055 ULX X-1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results of the first broadband X-ray analysis of the ultraluminous X-ray source NGC 5055 ULX X-1, combining simultaneous data from XMM$-$Newton and NuSTAR missions, with a combined exposure time of $\sim$100 ks across the $0.3-20$ keV energy range. The source exhibits a stable flux across the entire exposure with no detectable pulsations by any instrument on their X-ray light curves, placing pulsed-fraction upper limits of 10% and 32% for XMM$-$Newton and NuSTAR, respectively. The X-ray spectrum is dominated by two thermal components consistent with the emission from an accretion disk, and shows a weak high-energy tail above 10 keV, with no statistical requirement for an additional nonthermal component. The unabsorbed $0.3-20$ keV luminosity is ${\sim}2\times10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$, evidencing the ULX nature of the source. The parameters obtained from spectral modeling are consistent with the hard ultraluminous state. Despite the fact that a neutron-star accretor cannot be ruled out by the available data, under the assumption that the compact object in NGC 5055 ULX X-1 is a black hole accreting through a geometrically thick, radiation-pressure-supported disk that drives an optically thick wind, we constrained its putative mass to $11-26$ M$_{\odot}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.11792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a recent study [1], authors introduced a new class of exact space-times in Einstein's gravity, which are Kerr black holes immersed in an external uniform magnetic field that is oriented along the rotational axis. Motivated by this work, we investigate a Kerr-like black hole solution with a cloud of strings surrounded by a uniform magnetic field. For the zero rotation case, the space-time reduces to the Schwarzschild-Bertotti-Robinson black hole with a cloud of strings. Moreover, for zero magnetic field, the metrics simplify to a Kerr-like black hole surrounded by a cloud of strings, and its static counterpart reduces to the Schwarzschild black hole with a cloud of strings.</description>

      <title>Infrared Signatures of Dusty Tori Formed by MHD-Driven Outflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We aim to probe the physical structure and conditions of the central regions of active galactic nuclei (AGN) by interpreting their mid-infrared observational spectra. We constructed a sophisticated three-dimensional radiative transfer model of the AGN source and dusty torus, built upon a physically motivated framework that includes a comprehensive dust grain model. To investigate the properties of the circumnuclear medium, we performed model fitting to a sample of 20 observational spectra from Spitzer Space Telescope's IRS Enhanced Data Products, testing two distinct dust density laws: a steep $r^{-2}$ profile, characteristic of a radiation pressure-driven wind, and a shallower $r^{-1}$ profile, which is a key prediction of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models. Our model successfully reproduces fundamental observational phenomena, such as the transition from 9.7\,$\mu$m silicate emission at low inclinations to deep absorption at high inclinations, with absorption features becoming more pronounced for higher accretion rates, dust-to-gas ratios, and black hole masses. Most importantly, a direct comparison of the fitting results revealed that the $r^{-1}$ density law provided a significantly better fit ($\chi^2$) than the $r^{-2}$ density law for 18 of the 20 observational spectra. These results confirm the physical consistency of our advanced radiative model and provide compelling evidence that an $r^{-1}$ density law is a more accurate representation of the AGN dusty torus.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.11861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive relativistic Maxwell-Bloch equations for potential applications in astronomical environments, where various radiative processes are known to occur, including the maser action and Dicke's superradiance. We show that for both phenomena a radiating system's response is preserved at different relative velocities between the system's rest frame and the observer, while the relevant timescales and the radiation intensity transform as expected from relativistic considerations. We verify that the level of coherence between groups of emitters travelling at different speeds is unchanged in all reference frames. We also derive relativistic versions of the maser equations applicable in the steady-state regime.</description>

      <title>Spin precession effects in the phasing formula of eccentric compact binary inspirals till the second post-Newtonian order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Compact binary systems emitting gravitational waves (GWs) can exhibit orbital eccentricity, along with generic spin orientations, leading to the precession of the orbital angular momentum, individual spins, and the orbital plane. While eccentric binaries with aligned spins are well studied, closed form post Newtonian (PN) expressions that simultaneously include eccentricity and precessing spin effects have remained unavailable. Eccentricity complicates orbital evolution because solving the coupled differential equations typically requires numerical integration, which slows down the generation of waveforms. We exploit the separation of timescales between orbital motion, spin precession, and radiation reaction, applying the precession averaging method of Morras et al. (2025) to remove explicit time dependence from the spin orbit and spin spin dynamics through the second PN order. Using this framework, we derive analytic phasing formulae from the evolution equations for orbital frequency and eccentricity, treating eccentricity as a small parameter. Closed form solutions for the eccentricity evolution and GW phase are obtained up to eighth order in the initial eccentricity. We also generalize the TaylorT2 approximant to include spin precession effects and compute the orbital phase in both time and frequency domains. To improve accuracy for moderate to high initial eccentricities, we perform a resummation of the TaylorT2 phasing. These results offer efficient, closed form phasing expressions that capture the coupled dynamics of eccentricity and precession, enabling more accurate and computationally tractable GW waveform modeling for data analysis.</description>

      <title>Thermal Quarkyonic Matter and Its Implications for Neutron Star Structure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.12669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The structure and basic properties of dense nuclear matter still remain one of the open problems of Physics. In particular, the composition of the matter that composes neutron stars is under theoretical and experimental investigation. Among the theories that have been proposed, apart from the classical one where the composition is dominated by hadrons, the existence or coexistence of deconfined quark matter is a dominant guess. An approach towards this solution is the phenomenological view according to which the existence of quarkyonic matter plays a dominant role in the construction of the equation of state (EOS). According to it the structure of the EOS is based on the existence of the quarkyonic particle which is a hybrid state of a particle that combines properties of hadronic and quark matter with a corresponding representation in momentum space. In this paper we propose a phenomenological model for hot quarkyonic matter, borrowed from corresponding applications in hadronic models, where the interaction in the quarkyonic matter depends not only on the position but also on the momentum of the quarkyonic particles. This consideration, as we demonstrate, can have a remarkable consequence on the shape of the EOS and thus on the properties of neutron stars, especially in those for which the effect of temperature is significant, offering a sufficiently flexible model. Comparison with recent observational data can place constraints on the parameterization of the particular model and help improve its reliability.</description>

      <title>SN 2016iog: A fast declining Type II-L supernova with an ultra-faint tail, persistently interacting with circumstellar material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12929v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present optical photometric and spectroscopic observations of the rapidly declining Type IIL supernova (SN) 2016iog. SN 2016iog reached its peak $\sim$ 14 days after explosion, with an absolute magnitude in the $V$ band of $-18.64 \pm 0.15$ mag, followed by a steep decline of $8.85 \pm 0.15$~mag~(100\,d)$^{-1}$ post-peak. Such a high decline rate makes SN~2016iog one of the fastest declining Type~IIL SNe observed to date. The rapid rise in the light curve, combined with the nearly featureless continuum observed in the spectrum at +9.3 days, suggests the presence of interaction. In the recombination phase, we observed broad H$\alpha$ lines that persist at all epochs. In addition, the prominent double-peaked H$\alpha$ feature observed in the late-time spectrum (+190.8 days) is likely attributable either to significant dust formation within a cool dense shell or to asymmetric circumstellar material. These features suggest the presence of sustained interaction around SN~2016iog. We propose that the observed characteristics of SN~2016iog can be qualitatively explained by assuming a low-mass H-rich envelope surrounding a red supergiant progenitor star with low-density circumstellar material.</description>

      <title>Sub-Solar Mass Intermediate Mass Ratio Inspirals: Waveform Systematics and Detection Prospects with Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the detectability and waveform systematics of sub-solar mass intermediate mass-ratio inspirals (SSM-IMRIs), characterized by mass ratios $q \sim 10^2-10^4$. Using the black hole perturbation theory surrogate model \textsc{BHPTNRSur1dq1e4} as a reference, we assess the performance of the \textsc{IMRPhenomX} phenomenological family in the high-mass-ratio regime. We find that the inclusion of higher-order gravitational wave modes is critical; their exclusion may degrade the signal-to-noise ratio by factors of $\sim3-5$ relative to quadrupole-only templates. With optimal mode inclusion, SSM-IMRIs are observable out to luminosity distances of $\sim575$ Mpc ($z\sim0.12$) with Advanced LIGO and $\sim10.5$ Gpc ($z\sim1.4$) with the Einstein Telescope. However, we identify substantial systematic uncertainties in current phenomenological approximants. Matches between \textsc{IMRPhenomX} and the reference surrogate model \textsc{BHPTNRSur1dq1e4} degrade to values as low as 0.2 for edge-on inclinations, and fitting factors consistently fall below 0.9, indicating a significant loss of effectualness in template-bank searches. Bayesian parameter estimation reveals that these modeling discrepancies induce systematic biases that exceed statistical errors by multiple standard deviations, underscoring the necessity for waveform models calibrated to perturbation theory in the intermediate mass-ratio regime for robust detection and inference.</description>

      <title>Constraining r-process nucleosynthesis with multi-objective Galactic chemical evolution models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The astrophysical site(s) of the r-process are uncertain, with candidates such as neutron star mergers and magneto-rotational supernovae predicting different event rates, delay times, and heavy-element yields. Galactic chemical evolution models constrain these properties by comparing model predictions with observed abundances. We explore, in a systematic and data-driven way, the astrophysical conditions under which r-process enrichment can reproduce the observed trends of multiple neutron-capture elements in the Milky Way. Rather than assuming a fixed site, we adopt a flexible, parametric approach to test whether a common set of r-process parameters can explain the chemical evolution of several heavy elements. We compute a grid of one-infall, homogeneous models varying: Eu yield per event, r-process event rate, enrichment delay time, and progenitor mass range. For each of the $\sim 1.5 \times 10^5$ models, we predict [X/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] trends by scaling Eu yields with the solar r-process pattern. A multi-objective optimisation based on Pareto fronts identifies models that best reproduce the abundance trends. Best-fitting models favour short delay times ($\leq 30\ \rm Myr$), low-mass progenitors ($\sim 20-25\ \rm M_\odot$), and an effective Eu injection of $\sim 2 \times 10^{-7}\ \rm M_\odot$ per event. Stars more massive than $\sim 80\ \rm M_\odot$ are too rare to dominate the enrichment. While heavy elements can be reproduced, lighter ones show stronger conflicts with Eu, reflecting that the solar r-process scaling relation becomes less valid toward lighter elements. No single class of r-process events, under solar-scaled yields, can explain light and heavy neutron-capture elements; at least two components are required: a main r-process consistent with solar and r-rich stars, and a weaker component producing enhanced light r-process elements, similar to that observed in r-poor stars.</description>

      <title>Gravitational--Electromagnetic Coupling on Kerr Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13642v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend previous metric-based Schwarzschild studies of gravitational--electromagnetic (GEM) coupling to rotating black holes by working directly in a curvature-based Newman--Penrose/Teukolsky framework on Kerr spacetime. Within a minimally coupled Einstein--Maxwell system, we derive explicit quadratic electromagnetic source terms for the spin-$-2$ Teukolsky equation, providing a foundation for future numerical studies of GEM interactions in the framework of black-hole spectroscopy. Moreover, we give order-of-magnitude arguments showing that GEM quadratic quasinormal modes (QQNMs) can become relevant in a range of charged and magnetized astrophysical scenarios. Finally, we show through a brief dilaton-theory example that the GEM QQNM spectrum is sensitive to how gravity couples to electromagnetism, thereby providing a model-based way to test minimal coupling and to constrain hidden $U(1)$ sectors with gravitational-wave observations.</description>

      <title>Discovering High-$z$ BL Lacs Using Swift/UVOT and SARA Observations with the Dropout Technique</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16236v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Measuring spectroscopic redshifts for BL Lacertae (BL Lac) objects, a class of blazar, is challenging because their optical spectrum lacks, or has weak, emission lines ( equivalent width $\leqslant5\AA$). In this situation, alternative techniques are necessary for the estimation of distances to these sources. In this paper, we estimate the redshift by the photometric dropout technique for a sample of 64 blazars (59 BL Lacs and five blazar candidates of uncertain type). Two telescopes are utilized to observe the sample. The Ultraviolet/Optical Telescope (UVOT) on board {\it Swift} ({\it Swift}/UVOT) observes sources in $uvw2,\ uvm2,\ uvw1,\ u,\ b,\ v$ filters, while the ground-based telescopes SARA-CT/RM observed sources in $g',\ r,' \ i',\ z'$ filters. We fit the photometric data with the LePHARE package and report four new high-$z$ ($z&gt;1.3$) BL Lacs at $2.03^{+0.07}_{-0.05}$, $1.84^{+0.10}_{-0.03}$, $2.04^{+0.16}_{-0.14}$, and $2.93^{+0.01}_{-0.04}$ as well as upper limits for 50 sources. This work increased the number of high-$z$ BL Lacs found by this method up to 23. The high-$z$ sources are discussed in the context of the cosmic gamma-ray horizon, blazar sequence, Fermi blazar divide, and masquerading BL Lacs.</description>

      <title>Ultrahigh-Energy Gamma-ray Emission Associated with Black Hole-Jet Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08988v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Black holes (BH), one of the most intriguing objects in the universe, can manifest themselves through electromagnetic radiation initiated by the accretion flow. Some stellar-mass BHs drive relativistic jets when accreting matter from their companion stars, forming microquasars. Non-thermal emission from the radio to tera-electronvolt (TeV) gamma-ray band has been observed from microquasars, indicating the acceleration of relativistic particles. Here we report detection of four microquasars (SS 433, V4641 Sgr, GRS 1915+105, MAXI J1820+070) of spectrum extending to the ultrahigh-energy (UHE; photon energy $E&gt;100$ TeV) band and one microquasar (Cygnus X-1) of spectrum approaching 100 TeV, using the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO). Notably, the total emission associated with SS 433 cannot be interpreted with a single leptonic component. In the UHE band, its emission is in spatial coincidence with a giant atomic cloud, which is consistent with a hadronic origin. An elongated source is discovered from V4641 Sgr with the spectrum continuing up to 800 TeV. The detection of UHE gamma rays demonstrates that accreting BHs and their environments can operate as extremely efficient accelerators of particles out of 1 peta-electronvolt (PeV), suggesting microquasars to be important contributors to Galactic cosmic rays especially around the `knee' region.</description>

      <title>The 3D pulsar magnetosphere with machine learning: first results</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10716v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: All numerical solutions of the pulsar magnetosphere over the past 25 years show closed-line regions that end a significant distance inside the light cylinder, and manifest thick strongly dissipative separatrix surfaces instead of thin current sheets, with a tip that has a distinct pointed Y shape instead of a T shape. We need to understand the origin of these results which were not predicted by our early theories of the pulsar magnetosphere. In order to gain new intuition on this problem, we set out to obtain the theoretical steady-state solution of the 3D ideal force-free magnetosphere with zero dissipation along the separatrix and equatorial current sheets. In order to achieve our goal, we needed to develop a novel numerical method. We solve two independent magnetospheric problems without current sheet discontinuities in the domains of open and closed field lines, and adjust the shape of their interface (the separatrix) to satisfy pressure balance between the two regions. The solution is obtained with meshless Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). In this paper we present our first results for an inclined dipole rotator using the new methodology. We are able to zoom-in around the Y-point and inside the closed-line region, and we observe new interesting features. This is the first time the steady-state 3D problem is addressed directly, and not through a time-dependent simulation that eventually relaxes to a steady-state. We have trained a Neural Network that instantaneously yields the three components of the magnetic field and their spatial derivatives at any given point. Our results demonstrate the potential of the new method to generate new solutions of the ideal pulsar magnetosphere.</description>

      <title>Precision cross-sections for advancing cosmic-ray physics and other applications: a comprehensive programme for the next decade</title>

Abstract: Cosmic-ray physics in the GeV-to-TeV energy range has entered a precision era thanks to recent data from space-based experiments. However, the poor knowledge of nuclear reactions, in particular for the production of antimatter and secondary nuclei, limits the information that can be extracted from these data, such as source properties, transport in the Galaxy and indirect searches for particle dark matter. The Cross-Section for Cosmic Rays at CERN workshop series has addressed the challenges encountered in the interpretation of high-precision cosmic-ray data, with the goal of strengthening emergent synergies and taking advantage of the complementarity and know-how in different communities, from theoretical and experimental astroparticle physics to high-energy and nuclear physics. In this paper, we present the outcomes of the third edition of the workshop that took place in 2024. We present the current state of cosmic-ray experiments and their perspectives, and provide a detailed road map to close the most urgent gaps in cross-section data, in order to efficiently progress on many open physics cases, which are motivated in the paper. Finally, with the aim of being as exhaustive as possible, this report touches several other fields -- such as cosmogenic studies, space radiation protection and hadrontherapy -- where overlapping and specific new cross-section measurements, as well as nuclear code improvement and benchmarking efforts, are also needed. We also briefly highlight further synergies between astroparticle and high-energy physics on the question of cross-sections.</description>

      <title>Displacement of ultra-high-energy cosmic ray source images by the intergalactic magnetic field: the cases of Cen A and M83</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14344v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The standard assumption about the influence of the turbulent intergalactic magnetic field (IGMF) on the images of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECR) sources is that the latter are formed in a random walk mode in the deflection angle. As a result, the images are symmetrically broadened to angular scales proportional to the IGMF strength and the square root of its correlation length. We demonstrate that when the size of the emitting region is smaller than the correlation length of the IGMF, a new focusing regime emerges. In this regime, significant deviations from the standard random walk approximation occur even when the distance between the source and the observer exceeds several tens of IGMF correlation lengths. The angular size of the resulting images is typically smaller than predicted by random walk, and the IGMF causes a systematic shift of the entire image away from the true source direction. This introduces additional uncertainty in the search for UHECR sources. We show that the excess observed by Pierre Auger Observatory in the direction of Cen A can be explained by the contribution of M83, provided that the image shift occurs as predicted by some models of the Galactic magnetic field (GMF) and that the IGMF plays a minor role due to its low strength and short coherence length. Alternatively, Cen A may indeed be the true source of the excess, as certain realizations of the IGMF can compensate the deflection caused by the GMF.</description>

      <title>2D End-to-End Modeling of Kilonovae from Binary Neutron Star Merger Remnants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00062v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the kilonova emission resulting from outflows produced in a three-dimensional (3D) general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulation of a hypermassive neutron star (HMNS) remnant. We map the outflows into the FLASH hydrodynamics code to model their expansion in axisymmetry, and study the effects of employing different $r$-process heating rates. Except for the highest heating rate prescription, we find no significant differences with respect to overall ejecta dynamics and morphology compared to the simulation without heating. Once homologous expansion is attained, typically after $\sim$ 2s for these ejecta, we map the outflows to the Sedona radiative transfer code and compute the spectral evolution of the kilonova and broadband light curves in various Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) bands. The kilonova properties depend on the remnant lifetime, with peak luminosities and peak timescales increasing for longer-lived remnants that produce more massive ejecta. For all models, there is a strong dependence of both the bolometric and broadband light curves on the viewing angle. While the short-lived (12ms) remnant produces higher luminosities when viewed from angles closer to the pole, longer-lived remnants (240ms and 2.5s) are more luminous when viewed from angles closer to the equator. Our results highlight the importance of self-consistent, long-term modeling of merger ejecta, and taking viewing-angle dependence into account when interpreting observed kilonova light curves. We find that magnetized outflows from a HMNS -- if it survives long enough -- could explain blue kilonovae, such as the blue emission seen in AT2017gfo.</description>

      <title>Radio Observations of a Candidate Redback Millisecond Pulsar: 1FGL J0523.5-2529</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15435v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Redback pulsars are a subclass of millisecond pulsar system with a low-mass non-degenerate companion star being ablated by the pulsar. They are of interest due to the insights they can provide for late-stage pulsar evolution during the recycling process. J0523.5-2529 is one such candidate where redback-like emission has been seen at multiple wavelengths except radio. It is a system with a binary orbit of 16.5 hours and a low-mass non-degenerate companion of approximately 0.8 solar masses. The aim of this work was to conduct follow-up radio observations to search for any exhibited radio pulsar emission from J0523.5-2529. This work employs a periodicity and single burst search across 74 percent of the system's orbital phase using a total of 34.5 hours of observations. Observations were carried out using the Murriyang Telescope at Parkes and the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope (GBT). Despite extensive orbital phase coverage, no periodic or single-pulse radio emission was detected above a signal-to-noise threshold of 7. A comprehensive search for radio pulsations from J0523.5-2529 using Parkes and GBT yielded no significant emission, likely due to intrinsic faintness, scattering, or eclipses by the companion's outflow. The results demonstrate the elusiveness of the pulsar component in some redback systems and highlight the need for multi-wavelength follow-up and higher-frequency radio observations to constrain the source nature and binary dynamics.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Framework for the E1 and E2 Astrophysical Factors at 300 keV from Subthreshold and Ground-State Asymptotic Normalization Coefficients</title>

Abstract: The $^{12}\mathrm{C}(\alpha,\gamma)^{16}\mathrm{O}$ reaction governs the carbon-to-oxygen ratio set during helium burning, shaping white-dwarf structure and Type~Ia supernova yields. At the astrophysical energy $E \approx 300~\mathrm{keV}$, the cross section is controlled by the subthreshold $1^{-}$ (7.12~MeV) and $2^{+}$ (6.92~MeV) states, whose contributions depend on their asymptotic normalization coefficients (ANCs) $C_{1}$ and $C_{2}$, respectively. We perform a Bayesian analysis of the $S_{E1}(300~\mathrm{keV})$ and $S_{E2}(300~\mathrm{keV})$ factors using calibrated $R$-matrix mappings and experimental ANC constraints for the $1^{-}$, $2^{+}$, and $0^{+}$ ground state. For $S_{E1}(300~\mathrm{keV})$, flat prior on the $1^{-}$ ANC lead to broad posterior with $68\%$ credible interval spanning $ [71.4,\,93.4]$~keV\,b, while Gaussian priors concentrate weight near the reported ANC values and yield narrower posteriors. For $S_{E2}(300~\mathrm{keV})$, the analysis includes the interference of the radiative transition through the subthreshold resonance with the direct capture to the ground-state, which depends on the ground-state ANC $C_{0}$, giving broad posterior with $68\%$ credible interval spanning $[30.7,\,50.5]$~keV\,b. The Gaussian priors centered near anchor values. The resulting posteriors quantify both correlations and uncertainties: despite incorporating the published ANC constraints, the $68\%$ intervals remain broad, showing that present ANC determinations do not yet reduce the astrophysical uncertainty. Overall, the Bayesian framework provides statistically robust posteriors for $S_{E1}(300~\mathrm{keV})$ and $S_{E2}(300~\mathrm{keV})$, improving the reliability of extrapolations for stellar modeling and nucleosynthesis.</description>

      <title>New Evidence for Extragalactic Einstein Probe Transients associated with Long Gamma-ray Bursts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.10267v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The origin of extragalactic fast X-ray transients (EFXTs) remains a fundamental open question in high-energy astrophysics. The Einstein Probe (EP) mission provides a transformative opportunity to investigate their nature. While mounting observations of EP-discovered EFXTs (EP-EFXTs) suggest a possible connection to long gamma-ray bursts (lGRBs), an in-depth comparative analysis between them remains lacking. Here, we present a comparative analysis of their cosmic formation histories, revealing that EP-EFXTs and lGRBs share a similar evolutionary trend-showing a marked decline at $z&lt;1.0$ and a plateau beyond $1.0&lt;z&lt;5$-which clearly distinguishes them from short GRBs. This result is derived from a rigorously selected sample of EP-EFXTs, using Lynden-Bell's $c^{-}$ method to reconstruct, for the first time, the luminosity function and formation rate of EP-EFXTs without any assumptions. Our findings provide independent evidence that EP-EFXTs and lGRBs may originate from a common progenitor channel.</description>

Abstract: The connection between compact object mergers and some extragalactic fast X-ray transients (FXRTs) has long been hypothesized, but never ultimately established. In this work, we investigate two FXRTs, the LEIA X-ray Transient LXT 240402A and the Einstein Probe EP250207b, whose precise positions lie close to nearby ($z\!\lesssim\!0.1$) quiescent galaxies with negligible probability of chance coincidence, identifying them as particularly promising cases of merger-driven explosions in the local Universe. We used Chandra to derive accurate localizations for both events and secure otherwise ambiguous associations with their optical counterparts. Deep optical and near-infrared observations with VLT, GTC, and LBT were performed to characterize the surrounding environment and search for kilonova emission, the hallmark of neutron star mergers. Complementary early-time X-ray monitoring with Swift and Einstein Probe was used to constrain the non-thermal afterglow. We find that both FXRTs remain compatible with a compact binary merger progenitor, which produced low-mass ejecta and kilonova emission subdominant to the afterglow. However, alternative explanations such as a distant ($z\!\gtrsim\!1$) core-collapse supernova cannot be conclusively ruled out.</description>

      <title>Towards a unified hadron-quark equation of state for neutron stars within the relativistic mean-field model</title>

Abstract: The equation of state of dense matter remains a central challenge in astrophysics and high-energy physics, particularly at supra-nuclear densities where exotic degrees of freedom like hyperons or deconfined quarks are expected to appear. Neutron stars provide a unique natural laboratory to probe this regime. In this work, we present EVA--01, a novel equation of state that provides a unified description of dense matter by incorporating both hadron and quark degrees of freedom within a single relativistic mean-field Lagrangian, from which the equation of state is derived at finite temperature. The model extends the density-dependent formalism by introducing a Polyakov-loop-inspired scalar field to dynamically govern the hadron-quark phase transition, following the approach of chiral mean-field models. The resulting model is consistent with a wide range of theoretical and observational constraints, including those from chiral effective field theory, massive pulsars, gravitational-wave events, and NICER data. We analyze its thermodynamic properties by constructing the QCD phase diagram, identifying the deconfinement, chiral, and nuclear liquid-gas transitions. As a first application, we model the evolution of proto-neutron stars using isentropic snapshots and explore the implications of the slow stable hybrid star hypothesis. Our findings establish EVA--01 as a robust and versatile framework for exploring dense matter, bridging the gap between microphysical models and multimessenger astrophysical observations.</description>

      <title>Tests of General Relativity with GWTC-3</title>

Abstract: The ever-increasing number of detections of gravitational waves (GWs) from compact binaries by the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo detectors allows us to perform ever-more sensitive tests of general relativity (GR) in the dynamical and strong-field regime of gravity. We perform a suite of tests of GR using the compact binary signals observed during the second half of the third observing run of those detectors. We restrict our analysis to the 15 confident signals that have false alarm rates $\leq 10^{-3}\, {\rm yr}^{-1}$. In addition to signals consistent with binary black hole (BH) mergers, the new events include GW200115_042309, a signal consistent with a neutron star--BH merger. We find the residual power, after subtracting the best fit waveform from the data for each event, to be consistent with the detector noise. Additionally, we find all the post-Newtonian deformation coefficients to be consistent with the predictions from GR, with an improvement by a factor of ~2 in the -1PN parameter. We also find that the spin-induced quadrupole moments of the binary BH constituents are consistent with those of Kerr BHs in GR. We find no evidence for dispersion of GWs, non-GR modes of polarization, or post-merger echoes in the events that were analyzed. We update the bound on the mass of the graviton, at 90% credibility, to $m_g \leq 2.42 \times 10^{-23} \mathrm{eV}/c^2$. The final mass and final spin as inferred from the pre-merger and post-merger parts of the waveform are consistent with each other. The studies of the properties of the remnant BHs, including deviations of the quasi-normal mode frequencies and damping times, show consistency with the predictions of GR. In addition to considering signals individually, we also combine results from the catalog of GW signals to calculate more precise population constraints. We find no evidence in support of physics beyond GR.</description>

      <title>In-orbit background and sky survey simulation study of POLAR-2/LPD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.00801v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Low-Energy X-ray Polarization Detector (LPD) is one of the payloads in the POLAR-2 experiment, designed as an external payload for the China Space Station (CSS) deployment in early 2024. LPD is specifically designed to observe the polarization of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) prompt emission in the energy range of 2-10 keV, with a wide field of view (FoV) of 90 degrees in preliminary design. This observation is achieved using an array of X-ray photoelectric polarimeters based on gas pixel detectors. Due to the wide FoV configuration, the in-orbit background count rate in the soft X-ray range is high, while GRBs themselves also exhibit a high flux in this energy band. In order to assess the contribution of various background components to the total count rate, we conducted detailed simulations using the GEANT4 C++ package. Our simulations encompassed the main interactions within the instrument materials and provided insights into various background components within the wide FoV scheme. The simulation results reveal that among the background components, the primary contributors are the cosmic X-ray background (CXB) and bright X-ray sources. The total background count rate of LPD, after applying the charged particle background rejection algorithm, is approximately 0.55 counts/cm^2/s on average, and it varies with the detector's orbit and pointing direction. Furthermore, we performed comprehensive simulations and comparative analyses of the CXB and X-ray bright sources under different FoVs and detector pointings. These analyses provide valuable insights into the background characteristic for soft X-ray polarimeter with wide FoV.</description>

      <title>Korteweg-de Vries Integrals for Modified Black Hole Potentials: Instabilities and other Questions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09918v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quasi-normal modes (QNMs) and greybody factors are some of the most characteristic features of the dynamics of black holes (BHs) and represent the basis for a number of fundamental physics tests with gravitational wave observations. It is therefore important to understand the properties of these quantities, naturally introduced within BH perturbation theory, in particular the stability properties under modifications of the BH potential. Instabilities in the QNMs have been recently shown to appear in the BH pseudospectrum under certain circumstances. In this work, we give a novel point of view based on the existence of some recently discovered hidden symmetries in BH dynamics and the associated infinite series of conserved quantities, the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) integrals. We provide different motivations to use the KdV integrals as indicators of some crucial BH spectral properties. In particular, by studying them in different scenarios described by modified BH barriers, we find strong evidence that the KdV conserved quantities represent a useful tool to look for instabilities in the BH spectrum of QNMs and in their greybody factors.</description>

      <title>Black hole quasinormal mode resonances</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06072v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Black hole quasinormal mode frequencies can be very close to each other ("avoided crossings") or even completely degenerate ("exceptional points") when the system is characterized by more than one parameter. We investigate this resonant behavior and demonstrate that near exceptional points, the two modes are just different covers of the same complex function on a Riemann surface. We also study the characteristic time domain signal due to the resonance in the frequency domain, illustrating the analogy between black hole signals at resonance and harmonic oscillators driven by a resonant external force. We consider a specific toy model displaying a resonance between the fundamental mode and the first overtone, and we find that taking into account the linear growth in time due to the resonance is necessary to accurately recover the quasinormal mode frequencies.</description>

      <title>A weak Ly$\alpha$ halo for an extremely bright Little Red Dot: Indications of enshrouded SMBH growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09542v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The abundant population of "Little Red Dots" (LRDs)-compact objects with red UV to optical colors and broad Balmer lines at high redshift-is unveiling new insights into the properties of early active galactic nuclei (AGN). Perhaps the most surprising features of this population are the presence of Balmer absorption and ubiquitous strong Balmer breaks. Recent models link these features to an active supermassive black hole (SMBH) cocooned in very dense gas ($N_{\rm H}\sim10^{24}\,\rm cm^{-2}$). We present a stringent test of such models using VLT/MUSE observations of A2744-45924, the most luminous LRD known to date ($L_{\rm H\alpha}\approx10^{44}~\rm erg\,s^{-1}$), located behind the Abell-2744 lensing cluster at $z=4.464$ ($\mu=1.8$). We detect a moderately extended Ly$\alpha$ nebula ($h\approx5.7$ pkpc), spatially offset from the point-like H$\alpha$ seen by JWST. The Ly$\alpha$ emission is narrow ($\rm FWHM=270\pm 15~km\,s^{-1}$), spatially offset to H$\alpha$, and faint ($\rm Ly\alpha=0.07H\alpha$) compared to Ly$\alpha$ nebulae typically observed around quasars of similar luminosity. We detect compact N$\,$IV]$\lambda$1486 emission, spatially aligned with H$\alpha$, and a spatial shift in the far-UV continuum matching the Ly$\alpha$ offset. We discuss that H$\alpha$ and Ly$\alpha$ have distinct physical origins: H$\alpha$ originates from the AGN, while Ly$\alpha$ is powered by star formation. In the environment of A2744-45924, we identify four extended Ly$\alpha$ halos ($\Delta z&lt;0.02$, $\Delta r&lt;100$ pkpc). Their Ly$\alpha$ luminosities match expectations based on H$\alpha$ emission, indicating no evidence for radiation from A2744-45924 affecting its surroundings. The lack of strong, compact, and broad Ly$\alpha$ and the absence of a luminous extended halo, suggest that the UV AGN light is obscured by dense gas cloaking the SMBH with covering factor close to unity.</description>

      <title>The Fast and the Frame-Dragging: Efficient waveforms for asymmetric-mass eccentric equatorial inspirals into rapidly-spinning black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09470v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Observations of gravitational-wave signals emitted by compact binary inspirals provide unique insights into their properties, but their analysis requires accurate and efficient waveform models. Intermediate- and extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (I/EMRIs), with mass ratios $q \gtrsim 10^2$, are promising sources for future detectors such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). Modelling waveforms for these asymmetric-mass binaries is challenging, entailing the tracking of many harmonic modes over thousands to millions of cycles. The FastEMRIWaveforms (FEW) modelling framework addresses this need, leveraging precomputation of mode data and interpolation to rapidly compute adiabatic waveforms for eccentric inspirals into zero-spin black holes. In this work, we extend FEW to model eccentric equatorial inspirals into black holes with spin magnitudes $|a| \leq 0.999$. Our model supports eccentricities $e &lt; 0.9$ and semi-latus recta $p &lt; 200$, enabling the generation of long-duration IMRI waveforms, and produces waveforms in $\sim 100$ ms with hardware acceleration. Characterising systematic errors, we estimate that our model attains mismatches of $\sim 10^{-5}$ (for LISA sensitivity) with respect to error-free adiabatic waveforms over most of parameter space. We find that kludge models introduce errors in signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) as great as $^{+60\%}_{-40\%}$ and induce marginal biases of up to $\sim 1\sigma$ in parameter estimation. We show LISA's horizon redshift for I/EMRI signals varies significantly with $a$, reaching a redshift of $3$ ($15$) for EMRIs (IMRIs) with only minor $(\sim10\%)$ dependence on $e$ for an SNR threshold of 20. For signals with SNR $\sim 50$, spin and eccentricity-at-plunge are measured with uncertainties of $\delta a \sim 10^{-7}$ and $\delta e_f \sim 10^{-5}$. This work advances the state-of-the-art in waveform generation for asymmetric-mass binaries.</description>

      <title>Self-Interacting Dark-Matter Spikes and the Final-Parsec Problem: Bayesian constraints from the NANOGrav 15-Year Gravitational-Wave Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18153v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A self-interacting dark-matter (SIDM) density spike around merging supermassive black holes (SMBHs) may be able to supply the dynamical friction needed to shrink binaries from $\sim 1\, \mathrm{pc}$ to $\sim 10^{-2} \,\mathrm{pc}$, thereby resolving the long-standing ''final-parsec problem''. Embedding the binary-halo system in a cosmological population model, we evolve the inspiral under the combined influence of gravitational-wave (GW) emission and SIDM drag, compute the resulting nanohertz GW background, and confront it with the NANOGrav 15-year pulsar-timing data. A six-parameter Bayesian analysis, performed with a Gaussian-process-accelerated Markov chain Monte Carlo, yields posterior constraints on the cross-section per unit mass and maximum circular velocity values that were consistent with independent galaxy-rotation and cluster-lensing limits. Within this parameter space, the SIDM spike remains intact, supplies sufficient friction to overcome the stellar depletion barrier, and produces a characteristic-strain spectrum that matches the NANOGrav signal as well as phenomenological astrophysical models.</description>

      <title>Automated Algorithmic Discovery for Scientific Computing through LLM-Guided Evolutionary Search: A Case Study in Gravitational-Wave Detection</title>

Abstract: Automated algorithm discovery in scientific computing faces fundamental challenges: vast design spaces with expensive evaluations, domain-specific physical constraints requiring expert knowledge, and the necessity for interpretable solutions that scientists can validate and understand. We present the Evo-MCTS (Evolutionary Monte Carlo Tree Search) framework, integrating large language models (LLMs) with tree-structured evolutionary search for interpretable algorithm discovery. Evo-MCTS combines reflective code synthesis leveraging LLM domain knowledge, multi-scale evolutionary operations on structured code representations, and interpretable algorithmic pathways emerging from tree-guided exploration. When applied to gravitational wave detection-a challenging domain with continuous parameter spaces and strict physical constraints-Evo-MCTS achieves 20.2% improvement over domain-specific methods and 59.1% over LLM-based optimization frameworks. This improvement arises from its ability to consistently converge toward interpretable algorithmic structures that integrate multiple functional components. Our domain-agnostic architecture establishes a generalizable methodology for automated algorithm discovery in scientific computing, where algorithmic transparency and physical validity are as essential as performance optimization.</description>

      <title>Modified Black Hole Potentials and Their Korteweg-de Vries Integrals: Instabilities and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01500v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Black Hole (BH) Quasi-Normal Modes (QNMs) and Greybody Factors (GBFs) are key signatures of BH dynamics that are crucial for testing fundamental physics via gravitational waves. Recent studies of the BH pseudospectrum have revealed instabilities in QNMs. Here, we introduce a new perspective using hidden symmetries in the BH dynamics, specifically the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) integrals - an infinite series of conserved quantities. By analyzing modified BH potentials, we find strong evidence that KdV integrals are valuable indicators for detecting instabilities in QNMs and GBFs.</description>

      <title>Imaging and polarization patterns of various thick disks around Kerr-MOG black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09379v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the imaging and polarization properties of Kerr-MOG black holes surrounded by geometrically thick accretion flows. The MOG parameter $\alpha$ introduces deviations from the Kerr metric, providing a means to test modified gravity in the strong field regime. Two representative accretion models are considered: the phenomenological radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF) and the analytical ballistic approximation accretion flow (BAAF). Using general relativistic radiative transfer, we compute synchrotron emission and polarization maps under different spins, MOG parameters, inclinations, and observing frequencies. In both models, the photon ring and central dark region expand with increasing $\alpha$, whereas frame dragging produces pronounced brightness asymmetry. The BAAF model predicts a narrower bright ring and distinct polarization morphology near the event horizon. By introducing the net polarization angle $\chi_{\text{net}}$ and the second Fourier mode $\angle\beta_2$, we quantify inclination- and frame-dragging-induced polarization features. Our results reveal that both $\alpha$ and spin significantly influence the near-horizon polarization patterns, suggesting that high-resolution polarimetric imaging could serve as a promising probe of modified gravity in the strong field regime.</description>
