      <title>WISER: multimodal variational inference for full-waveform inversion without dimensionality reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a semi-amortized variational inference framework designed for computationally feasible uncertainty quantification in 2D full-waveform inversion to explore the multimodal posterior distribution without dimensionality reduction. The framework is called WISER, short for full-Waveform variational Inference via Subsurface Extensions with Refinements. WISER leverages the power of generative artificial intelligence to perform approximate amortized inference that is low-cost albeit showing an amortization gap. This gap is closed through non-amortized refinements that make frugal use of acoustic wave physics. Case studies illustrate that WISER is capable of full-resolution, computationally feasible, and reliable uncertainty estimates of velocity models and imaged reflectivities.</description>

      <title>Absolute quantum gravimeters and gradiometers for field measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10844</link>

Abstract: Gravity measurements provide valuable information on the mass distribution below the earth surface relevant to various areas of geosciences such as hydrology, geodesy, geophysics, volcanology, and natural resources management. During the past decades, the needs for sensitivity, robustness, compactness, and transportability of instruments measuring the gravitational acceleration have constantly increased. Today, applications typically call for 1 $\mu \mathrm{Gal} = 10 \mathrm{nm.s}^{-2}$ ~ $10^{-9}$ g resolution on time scales ranging from minutes to years. Absolute Quantum Gravimeters (AQGs) based on matter-wave interferometry with laser-cooled atoms address all these challenges at once, even in uncontrolled environments. Furthermore, to date, quantum gravimeters are the only technology capable of providing continuous absolute gravity data over long measurement durations (~1 day to months or more). In this paper we recall the AQG working principle and present the reproducible high performance at the {\mu}Gal level on all 16 units fabricated so far. We also describe recent progress on the Differential Quantum Gravimeter (DQG) which measures simultaneously the mean gravitational acceleration and its vertical gradient at the level of $10 \mathrm{nm.s}^{-2}$ and $1$ E (1 E[eotvos] = $10^{-9}$ s$^{-2}$) respectively.</description>

      <title>Quantifying risk of a noise-induced AMOC collapse from northern and tropical Atlantic Ocean variability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) exerts a major influence on global climate. There is much debate about whether the current strong AMOC may collapse as a result of anthropogenic forcing and/or internal variability. Increasing the noise in simple salt-advection models can change the apparent AMOC tipping threshold. However, it's not clear if 'present-day' variability is strong enough to induce a collapse. Here, we investigate how internal variability affects the likelihood of AMOC collapse. We examine internal variability of basin-scale salinities and temperatures in four CMIP6 pre-industrial simulations. We fit this to an empirical, process-based AMOC box model, and find that noise-induced AMOC collapse (defined as a decade in which the mean AMOC strength falls below 5 Sv) is unlikely for pre-industrial CMIP6 variability unless external forcing shifts the AMOC closer to a threshold. However, CMIP6 models seem to underestimate present-day Atlantic Ocean variability, and stronger variability substantially increases the likelihood of noise-induced collapse, especially if forcing brings the AMOC close to a stability threshold. Surprisingly, we find a case where forcing temporarily overshoots a stability threshold but noise decreases the probability of collapse. Accurately modelling internal decadal variability is essential for understanding the increased uncertainty in AMOC projections.</description>
