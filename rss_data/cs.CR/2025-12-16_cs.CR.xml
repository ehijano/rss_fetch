      <title>Adversarial Attacks Against Deep Learning-Based Radio Frequency Fingerprint Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio frequency fingerprint identification (RFFI) is an emerging technique for the lightweight authentication of wireless Internet of things (IoT) devices. RFFI exploits deep learning models to extract hardware impairments to uniquely identify wireless devices. Recent studies show deep learning-based RFFI is vulnerable to adversarial attacks. However, effective adversarial attacks against different types of RFFI classifiers have not yet been explored. In this paper, we carried out a comprehensive investigations into different adversarial attack methods on RFFI systems using various deep learning models. Three specific algorithms, fast gradient sign method (FGSM), projected gradient descent (PGD), and universal adversarial perturbation (UAP), were analyzed. The attacks were launched to LoRa-RFFI and the experimental results showed the generated perturbations were effective against convolutional neural networks (CNNs), long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, and gated recurrent units (GRU). We further used UAP to launch practical attacks. Special factors were considered for the wireless context, including implementing real-time attacks, the effectiveness of the attacks over a period of time, etc. Our experimental evaluation demonstrated that UAP can successfully launch adversarial attacks against the RFFI, achieving a success rate of 81.7% when the adversary almost has no prior knowledge of the victim RFFI systems.</description>

      <title>MVP-ORAM: a Wait-free Concurrent ORAM for Confidential BFT Storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that encryption alone is not enough to protect data privacy. Access patterns, revealed when operations are performed, can also be leveraged in inference attacks. Oblivious RAM (ORAM) hides access patterns by making client requests oblivious. However, existing protocols are still limited in supporting concurrent clients and Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT). We present MVP-ORAM, the first wait-free ORAM protocol that supports concurrent fail-prone clients. In contrast to previous works, MVP-ORAM avoids using trusted proxies, which require additional security assumptions, and concurrency control mechanisms based on inter-client communication or distributed locks, which limit overall throughput and the capability of tolerating faulty clients. Instead, MVP-ORAM enables clients to perform concurrent requests and merge conflicting updates as they happen, satisfying wait-freedom, i.e., clients make progress independently of the performance or failures of other clients. Since wait and collision freedom are fundamentally contradictory goals that cannot be achieved simultaneously in an asynchronous concurrent ORAM service, we define a weaker notion of obliviousness that depends on the application workload and number of concurrent clients, and prove MVP-ORAM is secure in practical scenarios where clients perform skewed block accesses. By being wait-free, MVP-ORAM can be seamlessly integrated into existing confidential BFT data stores, creating the first BFT ORAM construction. We implement MVP-ORAM on top of a confidential BFT data store and show our prototype can process hundreds of 4KB accesses per second in modern clouds.</description>

      <title>Scalable IP Mimicry: End-to-End Deceptive IP Blending to Overcome Rectification and Scale Limitations of IP Camouflage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semiconductor intellectual property (IP) theft incurs estimated annual losses ranging from $225 billion to $600 billion. Despite initiatives like the CHIPS Act, many semiconductor designs remain vulnerable to reverse engineering (RE). IP Camouflage is a recent breakthrough that expands beyond the logic gate hiding of traditional camouflage through "mimetic deception," where an entire module masquerades as a different IP. However, it faces key limitations: requires a high-overhead post-generation rectification step, is not easily scalable, and uses an AIG logic representation that is mismatched with standard RE analysis flows. This paper addresses these shortcommings by introducing two novel, end-to-end models. We propose a Graph-Matching algorithm to solve the representation problem and a DNAS-based NAND Array model to achieve scalability. To facilitate this, we also introduce a mimicry-aware partitioning method, enabling a divide-and-conquer approach for large-scale designs. Our results demonstrate that these models are resilient to SAT and GNN-RE attacks, providing efficient and scalable paths for end-to-end deceptive IP design.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Jailbreak Detection of Large Vision Language Models with Representational Contrastive Scoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are vulnerable to a growing array of multimodal jailbreak attacks, necessitating defenses that are both generalizable to novel threats and efficient for practical deployment. Many current strategies fall short, either targeting specific attack patterns, which limits generalization, or imposing high computational overhead. While lightweight anomaly-detection methods offer a promising direction, we find that their common one-class design tends to confuse novel benign inputs with malicious ones, leading to unreliable over-rejection. To address this, we propose Representational Contrastive Scoring (RCS), a framework built on a key insight: the most potent safety signals reside within the LVLM's own internal representations. Our approach inspects the internal geometry of these representations, learning a lightweight projection to maximally separate benign and malicious inputs in safety-critical layers. This enables a simple yet powerful contrastive score that differentiates true malicious intent from mere novelty. Our instantiations, MCD (Mahalanobis Contrastive Detection) and KCD (K-nearest Contrastive Detection), achieve state-of-the-art performance on a challenging evaluation protocol designed to test generalization to unseen attack types. This work demonstrates that effective jailbreak detection can be achieved by applying simple, interpretable statistical methods to the appropriate internal representations, offering a practical path towards safer LVLM deployment. Our code is available on Github https://github.com/sarendis56/Jailbreak_Detection_RCS.</description>

      <title>Towards Channel-Robust and Receiver-Independent Radio Frequency Fingerprint Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio frequency fingerprint identification (RFFI) is an emerging method for authenticating Internet of Things (IoT) devices. RFFI exploits the intrinsic and unique hardware imperfections for classifying IoT devices. Deep learning-based RFFI has shown excellent performance. However, there are still remaining research challenges, such as limited public training datasets as well as impacts of channel and receive effects. In this paper, we proposed a three-stage RFFI approach involving contrastive learning-enhanced pretraining, Siamese network-based classification network training, and inference. Specifically, we employed spectrogram as signal representation to decouple the transmitter impairments from channel effects and receiver impairments. We proposed an unsupervised contrastive learning method to pretrain a channel-robust RFF extractor. In addition, the Siamese network-based scheme is enhanced by data augmentation and contrastive loss, which is capable of jointly mitigating the effects of channel and receiver impairments. We carried out a comprehensive experimental evaluation using three public LoRa datasets and one self-collected LoRa dataset. The results demonstrated that our approach can effectively and simultaneously mitigate the effects of channel and receiver impairments. We also showed that pretraining can significantly reduce the required amount of the fine-tuning data. Our proposed approach achieved an accuracy of over 90% in dynamic non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios when there are only 20 packets per device.</description>

      <title>The Procedural Semantics Gap in Structured CTI: A Measurement-Driven STIX Analysis for APT Emulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cyber threat intelligence (CTI) encoded in STIX and structured according to the MITRE ATT&amp;CK framework has become a global reference for describing adversary behavior. However, ATT&amp;CK was designed as a descriptive knowledge base rather than a procedural model. We therefore ask whether its structured artifacts contain sufficient behavioral detail to support multi-stage adversary emulation. Through systematic measurements of the ATT&amp;CK Enterprise bundle, we show that campaign objects encode just fragmented slices of behavior. Only 35.6% of techniques appear in at least one campaign, and neither clustering nor sequence analysis reveals any reusable behavioral structure under technique overlap or LCS-based analyses. Intrusion sets cover a broader portion of the technique space, yet omit the procedural semantics required to transform behavioral knowledge into executable chains, including ordering, preconditions, and environmental assumptions. These findings reveal a procedural semantic gap in current CTI standards: they describe what adversaries do, but not exactly how that behavior was operationalized.
  To assess how far this gap can be bridged in practice, we introduce a three-stage methodology that translates behavioral information from structured CTI into executable steps and makes the necessary environmental assumptions explicit. We demonstrate its viability by instantiating the resulting steps as operations in the MITRE Caldera framework. Case studies of ShadowRay and Soft Cell show that structured CTI can enable the emulation of multi-stage APT campaigns, but only when analyst-supplied parameters and assumptions are explicitly recorded. This, in turn, exposes the precise points at which current standards fail to support automation. Our results clarify the boundary between descriptive and machine-actionable CTI for adversary emulation.</description>

      <title>Verification of Lightning Network Channel Balances with Trusted Execution Environments (TEE)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Verifying the private liquidity state of Lightning Network (LN) channels is desirable for auditors, service providers, and network participants who need assurance of financial capacity. Current methods often lack robustness against a malicious or compromised node operator. This paper introduces a methodology for the verification of LN channel balances. The core contribution is a framework that combines Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) with Zero-Knowledge Transport Layer Security (zkTLS) to provide strong, hardware-backed guarantees. In our proposed method, the node's balance-reporting software runs within a TEE, which generates a remote attestation quote proving the software's integrity. This attestation is then served via an Application Programming Interface (API), and zkTLS is used to prove the authenticity of its delivery. We also analyze an alternative variant where the TEE signs the report directly without zkTLS, discussing the trade-offs between transport-layer verification and direct enclave signing. We further refine this by distinguishing between \enquote{Hot Proofs} (verifiable claims via TEEs) and \enquote{Cold Proofs} (on-chain settlement), and discuss critical security considerations including hardware vulnerabilities, privacy leakage to third-party APIs, and the performance overhead of enclaved operations.</description>

      <title>BRIDG-ICS: AI-Grounded Knowledge Graphs for Intelligent Threat Analytics in Industry~5.0 Cyber-Physical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Industry 5.0's increasing integration of IT and OT systems is transforming industrial operations but also expanding the cyber-physical attack surface. Industrial Control Systems (ICS) face escalating security challenges as traditional siloed defences fail to provide coherent, cross-domain threat insights. We present BRIDG-ICS (BRIDge for Industrial Control Systems), an AI-driven Knowledge Graph (KG) framework for context-aware threat analysis and quantitative assessment of cyber resilience in smart manufacturing environments. BRIDG-ICS fuses heterogeneous industrial and cybersecurity data into an integrated Industrial Security Knowledge Graph linking assets, vulnerabilities, and adversarial behaviours with probabilistic risk metrics (e.g. exploit likelihood, attack cost). This unified graph representation enables multi-stage attack path simulation using graph-analytic techniques. To enrich the graph's semantic depth, the framework leverages Large Language Models (LLMs): domain-specific LLMs extract cybersecurity entities, predict relationships, and translate natural-language threat descriptions into structured graph triples, thereby populating the knowledge graph with missing associations and latent risk indicators. This unified AI-enriched KG supports multi-hop, causality-aware threat reasoning, improving visibility into complex attack chains and guiding data-driven mitigation. In simulated industrial scenarios, BRIDG-ICS scales well, reduces potential attack exposure, and can enhance cyber-physical system resilience in Industry 5.0 settings.</description>

      <title>Keep the Lights On, Keep the Lengths in Check: Plug-In Adversarial Detection for Time-Series LLMs in Energy Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate time-series forecasting is increasingly critical for planning and operations in low-carbon power systems. Emerging time-series large language models (TS-LLMs) now deliver this capability at scale, requiring no task-specific retraining, and are quickly becoming essential components within the Internet-of-Energy (IoE) ecosystem. However, their real-world deployment is complicated by a critical vulnerability: adversarial examples (AEs). Detecting these AEs is challenging because (i) adversarial perturbations are optimized across the entire input sequence and exploit global temporal dependencies, which renders local detection methods ineffective, and (ii) unlike traditional forecasting models with fixed input dimensions, TS-LLMs accept sequences of variable length, increasing variability that complicates detection. To address these challenges, we propose a plug-in detection framework that capitalizes on the TS-LLM's own variable-length input capability. Our method uses sampling-induced divergence as a detection signal. Given an input sequence, we generate multiple shortened variants and detect AEs by measuring the consistency of their forecasts: Benign sequences tend to produce stable predictions under sampling, whereas adversarial sequences show low forecast similarity, because perturbations optimized for a full-length sequence do not transfer reliably to shorter, differently-structured subsamples. We evaluate our approach on three representative TS-LLMs (TimeGPT, TimesFM, and TimeLLM) across three energy datasets: ETTh2 (Electricity Transformer Temperature), NI (Hourly Energy Consumption), and Consumption (Hourly Electricity Consumption and Production). Empirical results confirm strong and robust detection performance across both black-box and white-box attack scenarios, highlighting its practicality as a reliable safeguard for TS-LLM forecasting in real-world energy systems.</description>

      <title>EIP-7702 Phishing Attack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: EIP-7702 introduces a delegation-based authorization mechanism that allows an externally owned account (EOA) to authenticate a single authorization tuple, after which all subsequent calls are routed to arbitrary delegate code. We show that this design enables a qualitatively new class of phishing attacks: instead of deceiving users into signing individual transactions, an attacker can induce a victim to sign a single authorization tuple that grants unconditional and persistent execution control over the account.
  Through controlled experiments, we identify three reliable trigger pathways: user-driven, attacker-driven, and protocol-triggered. Each can lead to full account takeover and complete asset drainage. We further propose two extended attack surfaces. First, ERC-4337's EntryPoint pipeline enables remote and repeated activation of the delegated code without further victim involvement. Second, the chain-agnostic authorization mode permits replay-like compromises across independent networks.
  We also present the first empirical measurement of EIP-7702 usage across major EVM chains. Analyzing over 150k authorization and execution events involving 26k addresses and hundreds of delegator contracts, we assess the protocol's real-world footprint. Our findings show that EIP-7702 authorizations are highly centralized, dominated by a small number of contract families linked to criminal activity and repeatedly reused across incidents. Corresponding loss data reveals substantial theft of ETH, ERC-20 tokens, and NFTs. These results provide practical evidence that the attack surface we identify is not merely theoretical, but is already being exploited at scale. We conclude by proposing protocol-level defenses to mitigate the delegation-based phishing vector introduced by EIP-7702.</description>

      <title>Taint-Based Code Slicing for LLMs-based Malicious NPM Package Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing sophistication of malware attacks in the npm ecosystem, characterized by obfuscation and complex logic, necessitates advanced detection methods. Recently, researchers have turned their attention from traditional detection approaches to Large Language Models (LLMs) due to their strong capabilities in semantic code understanding. However, while LLMs offer superior semantic reasoning for code analysis, their practical application is constrained by limited context windows and high computational cost. This paper addresses this challenge by introducing a novel framework that leverages code slicing techniques for an LLM-based malicious package detection task. We propose a specialized taintbased slicing technique for npm packages, augmented by a heuristic backtracking mechanism to accurately capture malicious data flows across asynchronous, event-driven patterns (e.g., callbacks and Promises) that elude traditional analysis. An evaluation on a dataset of more than 5000 malicious and benign npm packages demonstrates that our approach isolates security-relevant code, reducing input volume by over 99% while preserving critical behavioral semantics. Using the DeepSeek-Coder-6.7B model as the classification engine, our approach achieves a detection accuracy of 87.04%, substantially outperforming a naive token-splitting baseline (75.41%) and a traditional static-analysis-based approach. These results indicate that semantically optimized input representation via code slicing not only mitigates the LLM context-window bottleneck but also significantly enhances reasoning precision for security tasks, providing an efficient and effective defense against evolving malicious open-source packages.</description>

      <title>UniMark: Artificial Intelligence Generated Content Identification Toolkit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid proliferation of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content has precipitated a crisis of trust and urgent regulatory demands. However, existing identification tools suffer from fragmentation and a lack of support for visible compliance marking. To address these gaps, we introduce the \textbf{UniMark}, an open-source, unified framework for multimodal content governance. Our system features a modular unified engine that abstracts complexities across text, image, audio, and video modalities. Crucially, we propose a novel dual-operation strategy, natively supporting both \emph{Hidden Watermarking} for copyright protection and \emph{Visible Marking} for regulatory compliance. Furthermore, we establish a standardized evaluation framework with three specialized benchmarks (Image/Video/Audio-Bench) to ensure rigorous performance assessment. This toolkit bridges the gap between advanced algorithms and engineering implementation, fostering a more transparent and secure digital ecosystem.</description>

      <title>Mage: Cracking Elliptic Curve Cryptography with Cross-Axis Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the advent of machine learning and quantum computing, the 21st century has gone from a place of relative algorithmic security, to one of speculative unease and possibly, cyber catastrophe.
  Modern algorithms like Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) are the bastion of current cryptographic security protocols that form the backbone of consumer protection ranging from Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) in the modern internet browser, to cryptographic financial instruments like Bitcoin.
  And there's been very little work put into testing the strength of these ciphers. Practically the only study that I could find was on side-channel recognition, a joint paper from the University of Milan, Italy and King's College, London\cite{battistello2025ecc}.
  These algorithms are already considered bulletproof by many consumers, but exploits already exist for them, and with computing power and distributed, federated compute on the rise, it's only a matter of time before these current bastions fade away into obscurity, and it's on all of us to stand up when we notice something is amiss, lest we see such passages claim victims in that process.
  In this paper, we seek to explore the use of modern language model architecture in cracking the association between a known public key, and its associated private key, by intuitively learning to reverse engineer the public keypair generation process, effectively solving the curve.
  Additonally, we attempt to ascertain modern machine learning's ability to memorize public-private secp256r1 keypairs, and to then test their ability to reverse engineer the public keypair generation process.
  It is my belief that proof-for would be equally valuable as proof-against in either of these categories.
  Finally, we'll conclude with some number crunching on where we see this particular field heading in the future.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Malicious Logic: Towards a Statement-Level Taxonomy and Dataset for Securing Python Packages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The widespread adoption of open-source ecosystems enables developers to integrate third-party packages, but also exposes them to malicious packages crafted to execute harmful behavior via public repositories such as PyPI. Existing datasets (e.g., pypi-malregistry, DataDog, OpenSSF, MalwareBench) label packages as malicious or benign at the package level, but do not specify which statements implement malicious behavior. This coarse granularity limits research and practice: models cannot be trained to localize malicious code, detectors cannot justify alerts with code-level evidence, and analysts cannot systematically study recurring malicious indicators or attack chains. To address this gap, we construct a statement-level dataset of 370 malicious Python packages (833 files, 90,527 lines) with 2,962 labeled occurrences of malicious indicators. From these annotations, we derive a fine-grained taxonomy of 47 malicious indicators across 7 types that capture how adversarial behavior is implemented in code, and we apply sequential pattern mining to uncover recurring indicator sequences that characterize common attack workflows. Our contribution enables explainable, behavior-centric detection and supports both semantic-aware model training and practical heuristics for strengthening software supply-chain defenses.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Adaptive Federated Byzantine Agreement for Robust Blockchain Consensus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Federated Byzantine Agreement (FBA) achieves rapid consensus by relying on overlapping quorum slices. But this architecture leads to a high dependence on the availability of validators when about one fourth of validators go down, the classical FBA can lose liveness or fail to reach agreement. We thus come up with an Adaptive FBA architecture that can reconfigure quorum slices intelligently based on real time validator reputation to overcome this drawback. Our model includes trust scores computed from EigenTrust and a sliding window behavioral assessment to determine the reliability of validators.
  We have built the intelligent adaptive FBA model and conducted tests in a Stellar based setting. Results of real life experiments reveal that the system is stable enough to keep consensus when more than half of the validators (up to 62 percent) are disconnected, which is a great extension of the failure threshold of a classical FBA. A fallback mode allows the network to be functional with as few as three validators, thus showing a significant robustness enhancement. Besides, a comparative study with the existing consensus protocols shows that Adaptive FBA can be an excellent choice for the next generation of blockchain systems, especially for constructing a resilient blockchain infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Cryptographic transformations over polyadic rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article introduces a novel cryptographic paradigm based on nonderived polyadic algebraic structures. Traditional cryptosystems rely on binary operations within groups, rings, or fields, whose well-understood properties can be exploited in cryptanalysis. To overcome these vulnerabilities, we propose a shift to polyadic rings, which generalize classical rings by allowing operations of higher arity: an $m$-ary addition and an $n$-ary multiplication. The foundation of our approach is the construction of polyadic integers -- congruence classes of ordinary integers endowed with such $m$-ary and $n$-ary operations. A key innovation is the parameter-to-arity mapping $\Phi(a,b)=(m,n)$, which links the parameters $(a,b)$ defining a congruence class to the specific arities required for algebraic closure. This mapping is mathematically intricate: it is non-injective, non-surjective, and multivalued. This complex, non-unique relationship forms the core of the proposed cryptosystem's security. We present two concrete encryption procedures that leverage this structure by encoding plaintext within the parameters of polyadic rings and transmitting information via polyadically quantized analog signals. In one method, plaintext is linked to the additive arity $m_{i}$ and secured using the summation of such signals; in the other, it is linked to a ring parameter $a_{i}$ and secured using their multiplication. In both cases, the "quantized" nature of polyadic operations generates systems of equations that are straightforward for a legitimate recipient with the correct key but exceptionally difficult for an attacker without it. The resulting framework promises a substantial increase in cryptographic security. This work establishes the theoretical foundation for this new class of encryption schemes and highlights their potential for constructing robust, next-generation cryptographic protocols.</description>

      <title>ceLLMate: Sandboxing Browser AI Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Browser-using agents (BUAs) are an emerging class of autonomous agents that interact with web browsers in human-like ways, including clicking, scrolling, filling forms, and navigating across pages. While these agents help automate repetitive online tasks, they are vulnerable to prompt injection attacks that can trick an agent into performing undesired actions, such as leaking private information or issuing state-changing requests. We propose ceLLMate, a browser-level sandboxing framework that restricts the agent's ambient authority and reduces the blast radius of prompt injections. We address two fundamental challenges: (1) The semantic gap challenge in policy enforcement arises because the agent operates through low-level UI observations and manipulations; however, writing and enforcing policies directly over UI-level events is brittle and error-prone. To address this challenge, we introduce an agent sitemap that maps low-level browser behaviors to high-level semantic actions. (2) Policy prediction in BUAs is the norm rather than the exception. BUAs have no app developer to pre-declare sandboxing policies, and thus, ceLLMate pairs website-authored mandatory policies with an automated policy-prediction layer that adapts and instantiates these policies from the user's natural-language task. We implement ceLLMate as an agent-agnostic browser extension and demonstrate how it enables sandboxing policies that effectively block various types of prompt injection attacks with negligible overhead.</description>

      <title>RunPBA -- Runtime attestation for microcontrollers with PACBTI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The widespread adoption of embedded systems has led to their deployment in critical real-world applications, making them attractive targets for malicious actors. These devices face unique challenges in mitigating vulnerabilities due to intrinsic constraints, such as low energy consumption requirements and limited computational resources. This paper presents RunPBA, a hardware-based runtime attestation system designed to defend against control flow attacks while maintaining minimal performance overhead and adhering to strict power consumption constraints. RunPBA leverages PACBTI, a new processor extension tailored for the Arm Cortex M processor family, allowing robust protection without requiring hardware modifications, a limitation present in similar solutions. We implemented a proof-of-concept and evaluated it using two benchmark suites. Experimental results indicate that RunPBA imposes a geometric mean performance overhead of only 1% and 4.7% across the benchmarks, underscoring its efficiency and suitability for real-world deployment.</description>

      <title>Towards a Systematic Taxonomy of Attacks against Space Infrastructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Space infrastructures represent an emerging domain that is critical to the global economy and society. However, this domain is vulnerable to attacks. To enhance the resilience of this domain, we must understand the attacks that can be waged against it. The status quo is that there is no systematic understanding of attacks against space infrastructures, despite their importance in guiding systematic analysis of space cybersecurity and future research. In this paper, we fill the void by proposing the first systematic taxonomy of attacks against space infrastructures. We hope this paper will inspire a community effort at refining the taxonomy towards a widely used taxonomy.</description>

      <title>OptHQC: Optimize HQC for High-Performance Post-Quantum Cryptography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As post-quantum cryptography (PQC) becomes increasingly critical for securing future communication systems, the performance overhead introduced by quantum-resistant algorithms presents a major computing challenge. HQC (Hamming Quasi-Cyclic) is a newly standardized code-based PQC scheme designed to replace classical key exchange methods. In this paper, we propose OptHQC, an optimized implementation of the HQC scheme to deliver high-performance cryptographic operations. Our approach provides a comprehensive analysis of each computational blocks in HQC and introduces optimizations across all three stages: key generation, encryption, and decryption. We first exploit data-level sparsity in vector multiplication to accelerate polynomial operations during vector generation. We then leverage instruction-level acceleration (e.g., AVX2) in hash computation to further improve performance. Last, we transform multiplication into lookup table indexing and optimize memory access patterns in syndrome computation and error vector recovery, which are the most computationally intensive operations in HQC. Overall, OptHQC achieves an average 55% speedup over the reference HQC implementation on CPU.</description>

      <title>CTIGuardian: A Few-Shot Framework for Mitigating Privacy Leakage in Fine-Tuned LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are often fine-tuned to adapt their general-purpose knowledge to specific tasks and domains such as cyber threat intelligence (CTI). Fine-tuning is mostly done through proprietary datasets that may contain sensitive information. Owners expect their fine-tuned model to not inadvertently leak this information to potentially adversarial end users. Using CTI as a use case, we demonstrate that data-extraction attacks can recover sensitive information from fine-tuned models on CTI reports, underscoring the need for mitigation. Retraining the full model to eliminate this leakage is computationally expensive and impractical. We propose an alternative approach, which we call privacy alignment, inspired by safety alignment in LLMs. Just like safety alignment teaches the model to abide by safety constraints through a few examples, we enforce privacy alignment through few-shot supervision, integrating a privacy classifier and a privacy redactor, both handled by the same underlying LLM. We evaluate our system, called CTIGuardian, using GPT-4o mini and Mistral-7B Instruct models, benchmarking against Presidio, a named entity recognition (NER) baseline. Results show that CTIGuardian provides a better privacy-utility trade-off than NER based models. While we demonstrate its effectiveness on a CTI use case, the framework is generic enough to be applicable to other sensitive domains.</description>

      <title>Efficient Quantum-resistant Delegable Data Analysis Scheme with Revocation and Keyword Search in Mobile Cloud Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid growth of smart devices and mobile internet, large-scale data processing is becoming increasingly important, while mobile devices remain resource-constrained. Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC) addresses this limitation by offloading tasks to the cloud. Nevertheless, the widespread adoption of MCC also raises challenges such as data privacy, selective computation, efficient revocation, and keyword search. Additionally, the development of quantum computers also threatens data security in MCC. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient quantum-resistant delegable data analysis scheme with revocation and keyword search (EQDDA-RKS) for MCC. In the proposed scheme, an authorised mobile device can perform keyword searches and compute inner product values over encrypted data without disclosing any additional information. Meanwhile, if a user's function key is compromised, it can be revoked. To alleviate the burden on mobile devices, most of the computation which should be executed by the mobile device is outsourced to a cloud server, and the mobile device only needs to interact with a central authority once. Furthermore, an authorised mobile device can temporarily delegate its keyword search and function computation rights to a delegatee in case the device becomes unavailable due to power depletion, going offline, etc. Our scheme is formally proven secure in the standard model against quantum attacks, chosen plaintext attacks, chosen keyword attacks, and outside keyword guessing attacks. Furthermore, the analysis demonstrates that the number of interactions between a mobile device and the central authority is $O(1)$ in our scheme, rather than growing linearly with the number of functions, which is well-suited for MCC scenarios.</description>

      <title>Cisco Integrated AI Security and Safety Framework Report</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems are being readily and rapidly adopted, increasingly permeating critical domains: from consumer platforms and enterprise software to networked systems with embedded agents. While this has unlocked potential for human productivity gains, the attack surface has expanded accordingly: threats now span content safety failures (e.g., harmful or deceptive outputs), model and data integrity compromise (e.g., poisoning, supply-chain tampering), runtime manipulations (e.g., prompt injection, tool and agent misuse), and ecosystem risks (e.g., orchestration abuse, multi-agent collusion). Existing frameworks such as MITRE ATLAS, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) AI 100-2 Adversarial Machine Learning (AML) taxonomy, and OWASP Top 10s for Large Language Models (LLMs) and Agentic AI Applications provide valuable viewpoints, but each covers only slices of this multi-dimensional space.
  This paper presents Cisco's Integrated AI Security and Safety Framework ("AI Security Framework"), a unified, lifecycle-aware taxonomy and operationalization framework that can be used to classify, integrate, and operationalize the full range of AI risks. It integrates AI security and AI safety across modalities, agents, pipelines, and the broader ecosystem. The AI Security Framework is designed to be practical for threat identification, red-teaming, risk prioritization, and it is comprehensive in scope and can be extensible to emerging deployments in multimodal contexts, humanoids, wearables, and sensory infrastructures. We analyze gaps in prevailing frameworks, discuss design principles for our framework, and demonstrate how the taxonomy provides structure for understanding how modern AI systems fail, how adversaries exploit these failures, and how organizations can build defenses across the AI lifecycle that evolve alongside capability advancements.</description>

      <title>Less Is More: Sparse and Cooperative Perturbation for Point Cloud Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most adversarial attacks on point clouds perturb a large number of points, causing widespread geometric changes and limiting applicability in real-world scenarios. While recent works explore sparse attacks by modifying only a few points, such approaches often struggle to maintain effectiveness due to the limited influence of individual perturbations. In this paper, we propose SCP, a sparse and cooperative perturbation framework that selects and leverages a compact subset of points whose joint perturbations produce amplified adversarial effects. Specifically, SCP identifies the subset where the misclassification loss is locally convex with respect to their joint perturbations, determined by checking the positivedefiniteness of the corresponding Hessian block. The selected subset is then optimized to generate high-impact adversarial examples with minimal modifications. Extensive experiments show that SCP achieves 100% attack success rates, surpassing state-of-the-art sparse attacks, and delivers superior imperceptibility to dense attacks with far fewer modifications.</description>

      <title>Towards Secure Decentralized Applications and Consensus Protocols in Blockchains (on Selfish Mining, Undercutting Attacks, DAG-Based Blockchains, E-Voting, Cryptocurrency Wallets, Secure-Logging, and CBDC)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rise of cryptocurrencies, many new applications built on decentralized blockchains have emerged. Blockchains are full-stack distributed systems where multiple sub-systems interact. While many deployed blockchains and decentralized applications need better scalability and performance, security is also critical. Due to their complexity, assessing blockchain and DAPP security requires a more holistic view than for traditional distributed or centralized systems.
  In this thesis, we summarize our contributions to blockchain and decentralized application security. We propose a security reference architecture to support standardized vulnerability and threat analysis. We study consensus security in single-chain Proof-of-Work blockchains, including resistance to selfish mining, undercutting, and greedy transaction selection, as well as related issues in DAG-based systems. We contribute to wallet security with a new classification of authentication schemes and a two-factor method based on One-Time Passwords. We advance e-voting with a practical boardroom voting protocol, extend it to a scalable version for millions of participants while preserving security and privacy, and introduce a repetitive voting framework that enables vote changes between elections while avoiding peak-end effects. Finally, we improve secure logging using blockchains and trusted computing through a centralized ledger that guarantees non-equivocation, integrity, and censorship evidence, then build on it to propose an interoperability protocol for central bank digital currencies that ensures atomic transfers.</description>

      <title>Security and Detectability Analysis of Unicode Text Watermarking Methods Against Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Securing digital text is becoming increasingly relevant due to the widespread use of large language models. Individuals' fear of losing control over data when it is being used to train such machine learning models or when distinguishing model-generated output from text written by humans. Digital watermarking provides additional protection by embedding an invisible watermark within the data that requires protection. However, little work has been taken to analyze and verify if existing digital text watermarking methods are secure and undetectable by large language models. In this paper, we investigate the security-related area of watermarking and machine learning models for text data. In a controlled testbed of three experiments, ten existing Unicode text watermarking methods were implemented and analyzed across six large language models: GPT-5, GPT-4o, Teuken 7B, Llama 3.3, Claude Sonnet 4, and Gemini 2.5 Pro. The findings of our experiments indicate that, especially the latest reasoning models, can detect a watermarked text. Nevertheless, all models fail to extract the watermark unless implementation details in the form of source code are provided. We discuss the implications for security researchers and practitioners and outline future research opportunities to address security concerns.</description>

Abstract: As quantum computing advances toward practical deployment, it threatens a wide range of classical cryptographic mechanisms, including digital signatures, key exchange protocols, public-key encryption, and certain hash-based constructions that underpin modern network infrastructures. These primitives form the security backbone of most blockchain platforms, raising serious concerns about the long-term viability of blockchain systems in a post-quantum world. Although migrating to post-quantum cryptography may appear straightforward, the substantially larger key sizes and higher computational costs of post-quantum primitives can introduce significant challenges and, in some cases, render such transitions impractical for blockchain environments.
  In this paper, we examine the implications of adopting post-quantum cryptography in blockchain systems across four key dimensions. We begin by identifying the cryptographic primitives within blockchain architectures that are most vulnerable to quantum attacks, particularly those used in consensus mechanisms, identity management, and transaction validation. We then survey proposed post-quantum adaptations across existing blockchain designs, analyzing their feasibility within decentralized and resource-constrained settings. Building on this analysis, we evaluate how replacing classical primitives with post-quantum alternatives affects system performance, protocol dynamics, and the incentive and trust structures that sustain blockchain ecosystems. Our study demonstrates that integrating post-quantum signature schemes into blockchain systems is not a simple drop-in replacement; instead, it requires careful architectural redesign, as naive substitutions risk undermining both security guarantees and operational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Weak Enforcement and Low Compliance in PCI~DSS: A Comparative Security Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although credit and debit card data continue to be a prime target for attackers, organizational adherence to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) remains surprisingly low. Despite prior work showing that PCI DSS can reduce card fraud, only 32.4% of organizations were fully compliant in 2022, suggesting possible deficiencies in enforcement mechanisms. This study compares PCI DSS with three data security frameworks, HIPAA, NIS2, and GDPR, to examine how enforcement mechanisms relate to implementation success. The analysis reveals that PCI DSS significantly lags far behind these security frameworks and that its sanctions are orders of magnitude smaller than those under GDPR and NIS2. The findings indicate a positive association between stronger, multi-modal enforcement (including public disclosure, license actions, and imprisonment) and higher implementation rates, and highlights the structural weakness of PCI DSS's bank-dependent monitoring model. Enhanced non-monetary sanctions and the creation of an independent supervisory authority are recommended to increase transparency, reduce conflicts of interest, and improve PCI DSS compliance without discouraging card acceptance.</description>

      <title>Behavior-Aware and Generalizable Defense Against Black-Box Adversarial Attacks for ML-Based IDS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning based intrusion detection systems are increasingly targeted by black box adversarial attacks, where attackers craft evasive inputs using indirect feedback such as binary outputs or behavioral signals like response time and resource usage. While several defenses have been proposed, including input transformation, adversarial training, and surrogate detection, they often fall short in practice. Most are tailored to specific attack types, require internal model access, or rely on static mechanisms that fail to generalize across evolving attack strategies. Furthermore, defenses such as input transformation can degrade intrusion detection system performance, making them unsuitable for real time deployment.
  To address these limitations, we propose Adaptive Feature Poisoning, a lightweight and proactive defense mechanism designed specifically for realistic black box scenarios. Adaptive Feature Poisoning assumes that probing can occur silently and continuously, and introduces dynamic and context aware perturbations to selected traffic features, corrupting the attacker feedback loop without impacting detection capabilities. The method leverages traffic profiling, change point detection, and adaptive scaling to selectively perturb features that an attacker is likely exploiting, based on observed deviations.
  We evaluate Adaptive Feature Poisoning against multiple realistic adversarial attack strategies, including silent probing, transferability based attacks, and decision boundary based attacks. The results demonstrate its ability to confuse attackers, degrade attack effectiveness, and preserve detection performance. By offering a generalizable, attack agnostic, and undetectable defense, Adaptive Feature Poisoning represents a significant step toward practical and robust adversarial resilience in machine learning based intrusion detection systems.</description>

      <title>QoeSiGN: Towards Qualified Collaborative eSignatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: eSignatures ensure data's authenticity, non-repudiation, and integrity. EU's eIDAS regulation specifies, e.g., advanced and qualified (QES) eSignatures. While eSignatures' concrete legal effects depend on the individual case, QESs constitute the highest level of technical protection and authenticity under eIDAS. QESs are based on a qualified certificate issued by a qualified trust service provider (QTSP). Despite legal requirements, technically, a QTSP represents a single point of failure. Contrary, privacy-preserving collaborative computations (P2C2s) have become increasingly practical in recent years; yet lacking an extensive investigation on potential integrations in the QES landscape.
  We perform a threat analysis on the QES-creation process of Austria's national eID, using STRIDE and a DREAD-like model to extract requirement challenges (RCs) primarily related to: (1) Distributed Service Robustness, (2) Agile Crypto Deployment, and (3) Active User Involvement. To address these RCs, we present QoeSiGN, utilizing novel P2C2 technologies. While currently no P2C2 addresses all RCs, legal aspects, and practical efficiency simultaneously, QoeSiGN gives instantiation possibilities for different needs. For instance, "Multi-Party HSMs" for distributed hardware-secured computations; or secure multi-party computation (software) for highest crypto agility and user involvement, where the user participates in the QES computation.
  Deployment-wise, QTSPs would need to adapt the signing process and setup trusted communication channels. Legal-wise, QoeSiGN's implementation appears permissible, needing further analysis for realization. Technically, QoeSiGN addresses some regulation requirements better than the current solution, such as "sole control" or crypto agility. Our identified threats and extracted requirements can be transferred to the general QES ecosystem.</description>

      <title>SEDULity: A Proof-of-Learning Framework for Distributed and Secure Blockchains with Efficient Useful Work</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The security and decentralization of Proof-of-Work (PoW) have been well-tested in existing blockchain systems. However, its tremendous energy waste has raised concerns about sustainability. Proof-of-Useful-Work (PoUW) aims to redirect the meaningless computation to meaningful tasks such as solving machine learning (ML) problems, giving rise to the branch of Proof-of-Learning (PoL). While previous studies have proposed various PoLs, they all, to some degree, suffer from security, decentralization, or efficiency issues. In this paper, we propose a PoL framework that trains ML models efficiently while maintaining blockchain security in a fully distributed manner. We name the framework SEDULity, which stands for a Secure, Efficient, Distributed, and Useful Learning-based blockchain system. Specifically, we encode the template block into the training process and design a useful function that is difficult to solve but relatively easy to verify, as a substitute for the PoW puzzle. We show that our framework is distributed, secure, and efficiently trains ML models. We further demonstrate that the proposed PoL framework can be extended to other types of useful work and design an incentive mechanism to incentivize task verification. We show theoretically that a rational miner is incentivized to train fully honestly with well-designed system parameters. Finally, we present simulation results to demonstrate the performance of our framework and validate our analysis.</description>

      <title>A Technical Policy Blueprint for Trustworthy Decentralized AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decentralized AI systems, such as federated learning, can play a critical role in further unlocking AI asset marketplaces (e.g., healthcare data marketplaces) thanks to increased asset privacy protection. Unlocking this big potential necessitates governance mechanisms that are transparent, scalable, and verifiable. However current governance approaches rely on bespoke, infrastructure-specific policies that hinder asset interoperability and trust among systems. We are proposing a Technical Policy Blueprint that encodes governance requirements as policy-as-code objects and separates asset policy verification from asset policy enforcement. In this architecture the Policy Engine verifies evidence (e.g., identities, signatures, payments, trusted-hardware attestations) and issues capability packages. Asset Guardians (e.g. data guardians, model guardians, computation guardians, etc.) enforce access or execution solely based on these capability packages. This core concept of decoupling policy processing from capabilities enables governance to evolve without reconfiguring AI infrastructure, thus creating an approach that is transparent, auditable, and resilient to change.</description>

      <title>Hyper model checking for high-level relational models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many properties related to security or concurrency must be encoded as so-called hyperproperties, temporal properties that allow reasoning about multiple traces of a system. However, despite recent advances on model checking hyperproperties, there is still a lack of higher-level specification languages that can effectively support software engineering practitioners in verifying properties of this class at early stages of system design.
  Alloy is a lightweight formal method with a high-level specification language that is supported by automated analysis procedures, making it particularly well-suited for the verification of design models at early development stages. It does not natively support, however, the verification of hyperproperties.
  This work proposes HyperPardinus, a new model finding procedure that extends Pardinus -- the temporal logic backend of the Alloy language -- to automatically verify hyperproperties over relational models by relying on existing low-level model checkers for hyperproperties. It then conservatively extends Alloy to support the specification and automatic verification of hyperproperties over design models, as well as the visualization of (counter-)examples at a higher-level of abstraction. Evaluation shows that our approach enables modeling and finding (counter-)examples for complex hyperproperties with alternating quantifiers, making it feasible to address relevant scenarios from the state of the art.</description>

      <title>CLOAK: Contrastive Guidance for Latent Diffusion-Based Data Obfuscation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data obfuscation is a promising technique for mitigating attribute inference attacks by semi-trusted parties with access to time-series data emitted by sensors. Recent advances leverage conditional generative models together with adversarial training or mutual information-based regularization to balance data privacy and utility. However, these methods often require modifying the downstream task, struggle to achieve a satisfactory privacy-utility trade-off, or are computationally intensive, making them impractical for deployment on resource-constrained mobile IoT devices. We propose Cloak, a novel data obfuscation framework based on latent diffusion models. In contrast to prior work, we employ contrastive learning to extract disentangled representations, which guide the latent diffusion process to retain useful information while concealing private information. This approach enables users with diverse privacy needs to navigate the privacy-utility trade-off with minimal retraining. Extensive experiments on four public time-series datasets, spanning multiple sensing modalities, and a dataset of facial images demonstrate that Cloak consistently outperforms state-of-the-art obfuscation techniques and is well-suited for deployment in resource-constrained settings.</description>

      <title>SPDMark: Selective Parameter Displacement for Robust Video Watermarking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advent of high-quality video generation models has amplified the need for robust watermarking schemes that can be used to reliably detect and track the provenance of generated videos. Existing video watermarking methods based on both post-hoc and in-generation approaches fail to simultaneously achieve imperceptibility, robustness, and computational efficiency. This work introduces a novel framework for in-generation video watermarking called SPDMark (pronounced `SpeedMark') based on selective parameter displacement of a video diffusion model. Watermarks are embedded into the generated videos by modifying a subset of parameters in the generative model. To make the problem tractable, the displacement is modeled as an additive composition of layer-wise basis shifts, where the final composition is indexed by the watermarking key. For parameter efficiency, this work specifically leverages low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to implement the basis shifts. During the training phase, the basis shifts and the watermark extractor are jointly learned by minimizing a combination of message recovery, perceptual similarity, and temporal consistency losses. To detect and localize temporal modifications in the watermarked videos, we use a cryptographic hashing function to derive frame-specific watermark messages from the given base watermarking key. During watermark extraction, maximum bipartite matching is applied to recover the correct frame order, even from temporally tampered videos. Evaluations on both text-to-video and image-to-video generation models demonstrate the ability of SPDMark to generate imperceptible watermarks that can be recovered with high accuracy and also establish its robustness against a variety of common video modifications.</description>

      <title>Cluster-guided LLM-Based Anonymization of Software Analytics Data: Studying Privacy-Utility Trade-offs in JIT Defect Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing use of machine learning (ML) for Just-In-Time (JIT) defect prediction raises concerns about privacy leakage from software analytics data. Existing anonymization methods, such as tabular transformations and graph perturbations, often overlook contextual dependencies among software metrics, leading to suboptimal privacy-utility tradeoffs. Leveraging the contextual reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs), we propose a cluster-guided anonymization technique that preserves contextual and statistical relationships within JIT datasets. Our method groups commits into feature-based clusters and employs an LLM to generate context-aware parameter configurations for each commit cluster, defining alpha-beta ratios and churn mixture distributions used for anonymization. Our evaluation on six projects (Cassandra, Flink, Groovy, Ignite, OpenStack, and Qt) shows that our LLM-based approach achieves privacy level 2 (IPR &gt;= 80 percent), improving privacy by 18 to 25 percent over four state-of-the-art graph-based anonymization baselines while maintaining comparable F1 scores. Our results demonstrate that LLMs can act as adaptive anonymization engines when provided with cluster-specific statistical information about similar data points, enabling context-sensitive and privacy-preserving software analytics without compromising predictive accuracy.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Homophily with Imperfect Recall: Modeling Resilience in Adversarial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this study is to investigate how homophily, memory constraints, and adversarial disruptions collectively shape the resilience and adaptability of complex networks. To achieve this, we develop a new framework that integrates explicit memory decay mechanisms into homophily-based models and systematically evaluate their performance across diverse graph structures and adversarial settings. Our methods involve extensive experimentation on synthetic datasets, where we vary decay functions, reconnection probabilities, and similarity measures, primarily comparing cosine similarity with traditional metrics such as Jaccard similarity and baseline edge weights. The results show that cosine similarity achieves up to a 30\% improvement in stability metrics in sparse, convex, and modular networks. Moreover, the refined value-of-recall metric demonstrates that strategic forgetting can bolster resilience by balancing network robustness and adaptability. The findings underscore the critical importance of aligning memory and similarity parameters with the structural and adversarial dynamics of the network. By quantifying the tangible benefits of incorporating memory constraints into homophily-based analyses, this study offers actionable insights for optimizing real-world applications, including social systems, collaborative platforms, and cybersecurity contexts.</description>

      <title>SHERLOCK: A Deep Learning Approach To Detect Software Vulnerabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing reliance on software in various applications has made the problem of software vulnerability detection more critical. Software vulnerabilities can lead to security breaches, data theft, and other negative outcomes. Traditional software vulnerability detection techniques, such as static and dynamic analysis, have been shown to be ineffective at detecting multiple vulnerabilities.
  To address this issue, this study employed a deep learning approach, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), to solve the software vulnerability detection problem. A 5-split cross-validation approach was used to train and evaluate the CNN model, which takes tokenized source code as input.
  The findings indicated that Sherlock successfully detected multiple vulnerabilities at the function level, and its performance was particularly strong for CWE-199, CWE-120, and CWE-Other, with an overall high accuracy rate and significant true positive and true negative values. However, the performance was less reliable for some vulnerabilities due to the lack of a standardized dataset which will be a future research direction. The results suggest that compared to current techniques, the proposed deep learning approach has the potential to substantially enhance the accuracy of software vulnerability detection.</description>

      <title>GradID: Adversarial Detection via Intrinsic Dimensionality of Gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite their remarkable performance, deep neural networks exhibit a critical vulnerability: small, often imperceptible, adversarial perturbations can lead to drastically altered model predictions. Given the stringent reliability demands of applications such as medical diagnosis and autonomous driving, robust detection of such adversarial attacks is paramount. In this paper, we investigate the geometric properties of a model's input loss landscape. We analyze the Intrinsic Dimensionality (ID) of the model's gradient parameters, which quantifies the minimal number of coordinates required to describe the data points on their underlying manifold. We reveal a distinct and consistent difference in the ID for natural and adversarial data, which forms the basis of our proposed detection method. We validate our approach across two distinct operational scenarios. First, in a batch-wise context for identifying malicious data groups, our method demonstrates high efficacy on datasets like MNIST and SVHN. Second, in the critical individual-sample setting, we establish new state-of-the-art results on challenging benchmarks such as CIFAR-10 and MS COCO. Our detector significantly surpasses existing methods against a wide array of attacks, including CW and AutoAttack, achieving detection rates consistently above 92\% on CIFAR-10. The results underscore the robustness of our geometric approach, highlighting that intrinsic dimensionality is a powerful fingerprint for adversarial detection across diverse datasets and attack strategies.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic Criminal Liability in Greenwashing: Comparing India, United States, and European Union</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AI-powered greenwashing has emerged as an insidious challenge within corporate sustainability governance, exacerbating the opacity of environmental disclosures and subverting regulatory oversight. This study conducts a comparative legal analysis of criminal liability for AI-mediated greenwashing across India, the US, and the EU, exposing doctrinal lacunae in attributing culpability when deceptive claims originate from algorithmic systems. Existing statutes exhibit anthropocentric biases by predicating liability on demonstrable human intent, rendering them ill-equipped to address algorithmic deception. The research identifies a critical gap in jurisprudential adaptation, as prevailing fraud statutes remain antiquated vis-\`a-vis AI-generated misrepresentation. Utilising a doctrinal legal methodology, this study systematically dissects judicial precedents and statutory instruments, yielding results regarding the potential expansion of corporate criminal liability. Findings underscore the viability of strict liability models, recalibrated governance frameworks for AI accountability, and algorithmic due diligence mandates under ESG regimes. Comparative insights reveal jurisdictional disparities, with the EU Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD) offering a potential transnational model. This study contributes to AI ethics and environmental jurisprudence by advocating for a hybrid liability framework integrating algorithmic risk assessment with legal personhood constructs, ensuring algorithmic opacity does not preclude liability enforcement.</description>

      <title>Quantigence: A Multi-Agent AI Framework for Quantum Security Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cryptographically Relevant Quantum Computers (CRQCs) pose a structural threat to the global digital economy. Algorithms like Shor's factoring and Grover's search threaten to dismantle the public-key infrastructure (PKI) securing sovereign communications and financial transactions. While the timeline for fault-tolerant CRQCs remains probabilistic, the "Store-Now, Decrypt-Later" (SNDL) model necessitates immediate migration to Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC). This transition is hindered by the velocity of research, evolving NIST standards, and heterogeneous deployment environments. To address this, we present Quantigence, a theory-driven multi-agent AI framework for structured quantum-security analysis. Quantigence decomposes research objectives into specialized roles - Cryptographic Analyst, Threat Modeler, Standards Specialist, and Risk Assessor - coordinated by a supervisory agent. Using "cognitive parallelism," agents reason independently to maintain context purity while execution is serialized on resource-constrained hardware (e.g., NVIDIA RTX 2060). The framework integrates external knowledge via the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and prioritizes vulnerabilities using the Quantum-Adjusted Risk Score (QARS), a formal extension of Mosca's Theorem. Empirical validation shows Quantigence achieves a 67% reduction in research turnaround time and superior literature coverage compared to manual workflows, democratizing access to high-fidelity quantum risk assessment.</description>

      <title>Bi-Erasing: A Bidirectional Framework for Concept Removal in Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Concept erasure, which fine-tunes diffusion models to remove undesired or harmful visual concepts, has become a mainstream approach to mitigating unsafe or illegal image generation in text-to-image models.However, existing removal methods typically adopt a unidirectional erasure strategy by either suppressing the target concept or reinforcing safe alternatives, making it difficult to achieve a balanced trade-off between concept removal and generation quality. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Bidirectional Image-Guided Concept Erasure (Bi-Erasing) framework that performs concept suppression and safety enhancement simultaneously. Specifically, based on the joint representation of text prompts and corresponding images, Bi-Erasing introduces two decoupled image branches: a negative branch responsible for suppressing harmful semantics and a positive branch providing visual guidance for safe alternatives. By jointly optimizing these complementary directions, our approach achieves a balance between erasure efficacy and generation usability. In addition, we apply mask-based filtering to the image branches to prevent interference from irrelevant content during the erasure process. Across extensive experiment evaluations, the proposed Bi-Erasing outperforms baseline methods in balancing concept removal effectiveness and visual fidelity.</description>

      <title>Investigation of a Bit-Sequence Reconciliation Protocol Based on Neural TPM Networks in Secure Quantum Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The article discusses a key reconciliation protocol for quantum key distribution (QKD) systems based on Tree Parity Machines (TPM). The idea of transforming key material into neural network weights is presented. Two experiments were conducted to study how the number of synchronization iterations and the amount of leaked information depend on the quantum bit error rate (QBER) and the range of neural network weights. The results show a direct relationship between the average number of synchronization iterations and QBER, an increase in iterations when the weight range is expanded, and a reduction in leaked information as the weight range increases. Based on these results, conclusions are drawn regarding the applicability of the protocol and the prospects for further research on neural cryptographic methods in the context of key reconciliation.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Adversarial Attacks on Federated Learning for Temperature Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning and federated learning (FL) are becoming powerful partners for next-generation weather forecasting. Deep learning enables high-resolution spatiotemporal forecasts that can surpass traditional numerical models, while FL allows institutions in different locations to collaboratively train models without sharing raw data, addressing efficiency and security concerns. While FL has shown promise across heterogeneous regions, its distributed nature introduces new vulnerabilities. In particular, data poisoning attacks, in which compromised clients inject manipulated training data, can degrade performance or introduce systematic biases. These threats are amplified by spatial dependencies in meteorological data, allowing localized perturbations to influence broader regions through global model aggregation. In this study, we investigate how adversarial clients distort federated surface temperature forecasts trained on the Copernicus European Regional ReAnalysis (CERRA) dataset. We simulate geographically distributed clients and evaluate patch-based and global biasing attacks on regional temperature forecasts. Our results show that even a small fraction of poisoned clients can mislead predictions across large, spatially connected areas. A global temperature bias attack from a single compromised client shifts predictions by up to -1.7 K, while coordinated patch attacks more than triple the mean squared error and produce persistent regional anomalies exceeding +3.5 K. Finally, we assess trimmed mean aggregation as a defense mechanism, showing that it successfully defends against global bias attacks (2-13\% degradation) but fails against patch attacks (281-603\% amplification), exposing limitations of outlier-based defenses for spatially correlated data.</description>

      <title>On the Effectiveness of Membership Inference in Targeted Data Extraction from Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to memorizing training data, which poses serious privacy risks. Two of the most prominent concerns are training data extraction and Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs). Prior research has shown that these threats are interconnected: adversaries can extract training data from an LLM by querying the model to generate a large volume of text and subsequently applying MIAs to verify whether a particular data point was included in the training set. In this study, we integrate multiple MIA techniques into the data extraction pipeline to systematically benchmark their effectiveness. We then compare their performance in this integrated setting against results from conventional MIA benchmarks, allowing us to evaluate their practical utility in real-world extraction scenarios.</description>

      <title>Automated User Identification from Facial Thermograms with Siamese Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The article analyzes the use of thermal imaging technologies for biometric identification based on facial thermograms. It presents a comparative analysis of infrared spectral ranges (NIR, SWIR, MWIR, and LWIR). The paper also defines key requirements for thermal cameras used in biometric systems, including sensor resolution, thermal sensitivity, and a frame rate of at least 30 Hz. Siamese neural networks are proposed as an effective approach for automating the identification process. In experiments conducted on a proprietary dataset, the proposed method achieved an accuracy of approximately 80%. The study also examines the potential of hybrid systems that combine visible and infrared spectra to overcome the limitations of individual modalities. The results indicate that thermal imaging is a promising technology for developing reliable security systems.</description>

      <title>Certified-Everlasting Quantum NIZK Proofs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs (NIZKs) for NP satisfying: 1) statistical soundness, 2) computational zero-knowledge and 3) certified-everlasting zero-knowledge (CE-ZK). The CE-ZK property allows a verifier of a quantum proof to revoke the proof in a way that can be checked (certified) by the prover. Conditioned on successful certification, the verifier's state can be efficiently simulated with only the statement, in a statistically indistinguishable way. Our contributions regarding these certified-everlasting NIZKs (CE-NIZKs) are as follows:
  - We identify a barrier to obtaining CE-NIZKs in the CRS model via generalizations of known interactive proofs that satisfy CE-ZK.
  - We circumvent this by constructing CE-NIZK from black-box use of NIZK for NP satisfying certain properties, along with OWFs. As a result, we obtain CE-NIZKs for NP in the CRS model, based on polynomial hardness of the learning with errors (LWE) assumption.
  - In addition, we observe that the aforementioned barrier does not apply to the shared EPR model. Consequently, we present a CE-NIZK for NP in this model based on any statistical binding hidden-bits generator, which can be based on LWE. The only quantum computation in this protocol involves single-qubit measurements of the shared EPR pairs.</description>

Abstract: In the age of digital music streaming, playlists on platforms like Spotify have become an integral part of individuals' musical experiences. People create and publicly share their own playlists to express their musical tastes, promote the discovery of their favorite artists, and foster social connections. In this work, we aim to address the question: can we infer users' private attributes from their public Spotify playlists? To this end, we conducted an online survey involving 739 Spotify users, resulting in a dataset of 10,286 publicly shared playlists comprising over 200,000 unique songs and 55,000 artists. Then, we utilize statistical analyses and machine learning algorithms to build accurate predictive models for users' attributes.</description>

      <title>Taint Analysis for Graph APIs Focusing on Broken Access Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08947v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first systematic approach to static and dynamic taint analysis for Graph APIs focusing on broken access control. The approach comprises the following. We taint nodes of the Graph API if they represent data requiring specific privileges in order to be retrieved or manipulated, and identify API calls which are related to sources and sinks. Then, we statically analyze whether a tainted information flow between API source and sink calls occurs. To this end, we model the API calls using graph transformation rules. We subsequently use Critical Pair Analysis to automatically analyze potential dependencies between rules representing source calls and rules representing sink calls. We distinguish direct from indirect tainted information flow and argue under which conditions the Critical Pair Analysis is able to detect not only direct, but also indirect tainted flow. The static taint analysis (i) identifies flows that need to be further reviewed, since tainted nodes may be created by an API call and used or manipulated by another API call later without having the necessary privileges, and (ii) can be used to systematically design dynamic security tests for broken access control. The dynamic taint analysis checks if potential broken access control risks detected during the static taint analysis really occur. We apply the approach to a part of the GitHub GraphQL API. The application illustrates that our analysis supports the detection of two types of broken access control systematically: the case where users of the API may not be able to access or manipulate information, although they should be able to do so; and the case where users (or attackers) of the API may be able to access/manipulate information that they should not.</description>

      <title>SoK: Can Fully Homomorphic Encryption Support General AI Computation? A Functional and Cost Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11604v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) increasingly powers sensitive applications in domains such as healthcare and finance, relying on both linear operations (e.g., matrix multiplications in large language models) and non-linear operations (e.g., sorting in retrieval-augmented generation). Fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) has emerged as a promising tool for privacy-preserving computation, but it remains unclear whether existing methods can support the full spectrum of AI workloads that combine these operations.
  In this SoK, we ask: Can FHE support general AI computation? We provide both a functional analysis and a cost analysis. First, we categorize ten distinct FHE approaches and evaluate their ability to support general computation. We then identify three promising candidates and benchmark workloads that mix linear and non-linear operations across different bit lengths and SIMD parallelization settings. Finally, we evaluate five real-world, privacy-sensitive AI applications that instantiate these workloads. Our results quantify the costs of achieving general computation in FHE and offer practical guidance on selecting FHE methods that best fit specific AI application requirements. Our codes are available at https://github.com/UCF-ML-Research/FHE-AI-Generality.</description>

      <title>Oracle-Based Multistep Strategy for Solving Polynomial Systems Over Finite Fields and Algebraic Cryptanalysis of the Aradi Cipher</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09950v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The multistep solving strategy consists in a divide-and-conquer approach: when a multivariate polynomial system is computationally infeasible to solve directly, one variable is assigned over the elements of the base finite field, and the procedure is recursively applied to the resulting simplified systems. In a previous work by the same authors (among others), this approach proved effective in the algebraic cryptanalysis of the Trivium cipher.
  In this paper, we present a new recursive formulation of the corresponding algorithm based on a Depth-First Search strategy, along with a novel complexity analysis leveraging tree structures. We also introduce the notion of an "oracle function", which is intended to determine whether evaluating a new variable is required to simplify the current polynomial system. This notion allows us to unify all previously proposed variants of the multistep strategy, including the classical hybrid approach, by appropriately selecting the oracle function.
  Finally, we employ the multistep solving strategy in the cryptanalysis of the NSA's recently introduced low-latency block cipher Aradi, achieving a first full-round algebraic attack that exposes structural features in its symbolic model.</description>

      <title>From Prompt Injections to Protocol Exploits: Threats in LLM-Powered AI Agents Workflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23260v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Autonomous AI agents powered by large language models (LLMs) with structured function-calling interfaces enable real-time data retrieval, computation, and multi-step orchestration. However, the rapid growth of plugins, connectors, and inter-agent protocols has outpaced security practices, leading to brittle integrations that rely on ad-hoc authentication, inconsistent schemas, and weak validation. This survey introduces a unified end-to-end threat model for LLM-agent ecosystems, covering host-to-tool and agent-to-agent communications. We systematically categorize more than thirty attack techniques spanning input manipulation, model compromise, system and privacy attacks, and protocol-level vulnerabilities. For each category, we provide a formal threat formulation defining attacker capabilities, objectives, and affected system layers. Representative examples include Prompt-to-SQL injections and the Toxic Agent Flow exploit in GitHub MCP servers. We analyze attack feasibility, review existing defenses, and discuss mitigation strategies such as dynamic trust management, cryptographic provenance tracking, and sandboxed agent interfaces. The framework is validated through expert review and cross-mapping with real-world incidents and public vulnerability repositories, including CVE and NIST NVD. Compared to prior surveys, this work presents the first integrated taxonomy bridging input-level exploits and protocol-layer vulnerabilities in LLM-agent ecosystems, offering actionable guidance for designing secure and resilient agentic AI systems.</description>

      <title>DATABench: Evaluating Dataset Auditing in Deep Learning from an Adversarial Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05622v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The widespread application of Deep Learning across diverse domains hinges critically on the quality and composition of training datasets. However, the common lack of disclosure regarding their usage raises significant privacy and copyright concerns. Dataset auditing techniques, which aim to determine if a specific dataset was used to train a given suspicious model, provide promising solutions to addressing these transparency gaps. While prior work has developed various auditing methods, their resilience against dedicated adversarial attacks remains largely unexplored. To bridge the gap, this paper initiates a comprehensive study evaluating dataset auditing from an adversarial perspective. We start with introducing a novel taxonomy, classifying existing methods based on their reliance on internal features (IF) (inherent to the data) versus external features (EF) (artificially introduced for auditing). Subsequently, we formulate two primary attack types: evasion attacks, designed to conceal the use of a dataset, and forgery attacks, intending to falsely implicate an unused dataset. Building on the understanding of existing methods and attack objectives, we further propose systematic attack strategies: decoupling, removal, and detection for evasion; adversarial example-based methods for forgery. These formulations and strategies lead to our new benchmark, DATABench, comprising 17 evasion attacks, 5 forgery attacks, and 9 representative auditing methods. Extensive evaluations using DATABench reveal that none of the evaluated auditing methods are sufficiently robust or distinctive under adversarial settings. These findings underscore the urgent need for developing a more secure and reliable dataset auditing method capable of withstanding sophisticated adversarial manipulation.

      <title>Can Large Language Models Automate Phishing Warning Explanations? A Controlled Experiment on Effectiveness and User Perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07916v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Phishing has become a prominent risk in modern cybersecurity, often used to bypass technological defences by exploiting predictable human behaviour. Warning dialogues are a standard mitigation measure, but the lack of explanatory clarity and static content limits their effectiveness. In this paper, we report on our research to assess the capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate clear, concise, and scalable explanations for phishing warnings. We carried out a large-scale between-subjects user study (N = 750) to compare the influence of warning dialogues supplemented with manually generated explanations against those generated by two LLMs, Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Llama 3.3 70B. We investigated two explanatory styles (feature-based and counterfactual) for their effects on behavioural metrics (click-through rate) and perceptual outcomes (e.g., trust, risk, clarity). The results provide empirical evidence that LLM-generated explanations achieve a level of protection statistically comparable to expert-crafted messages, effectively automating a high-cost task. While Claude 3.5 Sonnet showed a trend towards reducing click-through rates compared to manual baselines, Llama 3.3, despite being perceived as clearer, did not yield the same behavioral benefits. Feature-based explanations were more effective for genuine phishing attempts, whereas counterfactual explanations diminished false-positive rates. Other variables, such as workload, gender, and prior familiarity with warning dialogues, significantly moderated the effectiveness of warnings. These results indicate that LLMs can be used to automatically build explanations for warning users against phishing, and that such solutions are scalable, adaptive, and consistent with human-centred values.</description>

      <title>Counterfactual Evaluation for Blind Attack Detection in LLM-based Evaluation Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23453v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates defenses for LLM-based evaluation systems against prompt injection. We formalize a class of threats called blind attacks, where a candidate answer is crafted independently of the true answer to deceive the evaluator. To counter such attacks, we propose a framework that augments Standard Evaluation (SE) with Counterfactual Evaluation (CFE), which re-evaluates the submission against a deliberately false ground-truth answer. An attack is detected if the system validates an answer under both standard and counterfactual conditions. Experiments show that while standard evaluation is highly vulnerable, our SE+CFE framework significantly improves security by boosting attack detection with minimal performance trade-offs.</description>

      <title>MalFlows: Context-aware Fusion of Heterogeneous Flow Semantics for Android Malware Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03588v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Static analysis, a fundamental technique in Android app examination, enables the extraction of control flows, data flows, and inter-component communications (ICCs), all of which are essential for malware detection. However, existing methods struggle to leverage the semantic complementarity across different types of flows for representing program behaviors, and their context-unaware nature further hinders the accuracy of cross-flow semantic integration. We propose and implement MalFlows, a novel technique that achieves context-aware fusion of heterogeneous flow semantics for Android malware detection. Our goal is to leverage complementary strengths of the three types of flow-related information for precise app profiling. We adopt a heterogeneous information network (HIN) to model the rich semantics across these program flows. We further propose flow2vec, a context-aware HIN embedding technique that distinguishes the semantics of HIN entities as needed based on contextual constraints across different flows and learns accurate app representations through the joint use of multiple meta-paths. The representations are finally fed into a channel-attention-based deep neural network for malware classification. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to comprehensively aggregate the strengths of diverse flow-related information for assessing maliciousness within apps. We evaluate MalFlows on a large-scale dataset comprising over 20 million flow instances extracted from more than 31,000 real-world apps. Experimental results demonstrate that MalFlows outperforms representative baselines in Android malware detection, and meanwhile, validate the effectiveness of flow2vec in accurately learning app representations from the HIN constructed over the heterogeneous flows.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Agent LLM Defense Pipeline Against Prompt Injection Attacks</title>

Abstract: Prompt injection attacks represent a major vulnerability in Large Language Model (LLM) deployments, where malicious instructions embedded in user inputs can override system prompts and induce unintended behaviors. This paper presents a novel multi-agent defense framework that employs specialized LLM agents in coordinated pipelines to detect and neutralize prompt injection attacks in real-time. We evaluate our approach using two distinct architectures: a sequential chain-of-agents pipeline and a hierarchical coordinator-based system. Our comprehensive evaluation on 55 unique prompt injection attacks, grouped into 8 categories and totaling 400 attack instances across two LLM platforms (ChatGLM and Llama2), demonstrates significant security improvements. Without defense mechanisms, baseline Attack Success Rates (ASR) reached 30% for ChatGLM and 20% for Llama2. Our multi-agent pipeline achieved 100% mitigation, reducing ASR to 0% across all tested scenarios. The framework demonstrates robustness across multiple attack categories including direct overrides, code execution attempts, data exfiltration, and obfuscation techniques, while maintaining system functionality for legitimate queries.</description>

      <title>SoK: Preconfirmations</title>

Abstract: In recent years, significant research efforts have focused on improving blockchain throughput and confirmation speeds without compromising security. While decreasing the time it takes for a transaction to be included in the blockchain ledger enhances user experience, a fundamental delay still remains between when a transaction is issued by a user and when its inclusion is confirmed in the blockchain ledger. This delay limits user experience gains through the confirmation uncertainty it brings for users. This inherent delay in conventional blockchain protocols has led to the emergence of preconfirmation protocols -- protocols that provide users with early guarantees of eventual transaction confirmation.
  This article presents a Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) on preconfirmations. We present the core terms and definitions needed to understand preconfirmations, outline a general framework for preconfirmation protocols, and explore the economics and risks of preconfirmations. Finally, we survey and apply our framework to several implementations of real-world preconfirmation protocols, bridging the gap between theory and practice.</description>

      <title>Approximate Gaussian Mapping for Generative Image Steganography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07219v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ordinary differential equation (ODE)-based diffusion models enable deterministic image synthesis, establishing a reversible mapping suitable for generative steganography. While prevailing methods strictly adhere to a standard normal prior, empirical evidence indicates that controlled deviations from this distribution reduce numerical inversion errors without compromising perceptual quality. Leveraging this observation, the Approximate Gaussian Mapping (AGM) is proposed as a linear transformation strategy that embeds secrets by modulating noise scale and variance. To balance retrieval numerical consistence and security, a two-stage decoupled optimization strategy is introduced to minimize the Kullback-Leibler divergence subject to target bit accuracy constraints. Beyond the proposed method, we conduct a mechanistic analysis of the divergent behaviors between pixel-space and latent-space architectures. The experimental results reveal that the VAE encoder enhances robustness by filtering external perturbations, whereas the structural regularization of the VAE decoder and the semantic variance introduced by text prompts jointly mask embedding artifacts to improve security. Experimental results confirm that pixel-space mplementations maximize embedding capacity for lossless channels, while latent-space approaches offer superior robustness and security suitable for adversarial environments</description>

      <title>BreakFun: Jailbreaking LLMs via Schema Exploitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17904v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The proficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs) in processing structured data and adhering to syntactic rules is a capability that drives their widespread adoption but also makes them paradoxically vulnerable. In this paper, we investigate this vulnerability through BreakFun, a jailbreak methodology that weaponizes an LLM's adherence to structured schemas. BreakFun employs a three-part prompt that combines an innocent framing and a Chain-of-Thought distraction with a core "Trojan Schema"--a carefully crafted data structure that compels the model to generate harmful content, exploiting the LLM's strong tendency to follow structures and schemas. We demonstrate this vulnerability is highly transferable, achieving an average success rate of 89% across 13 foundational and proprietary models on JailbreakBench, and reaching a 100% Attack Success Rate (ASR) on several prominent models. A rigorous ablation study confirms this Trojan Schema is the attack's primary causal factor. To counter this, we introduce the Adversarial Prompt Deconstruction guardrail, a defense that utilizes a secondary LLM to perform a "Literal Transcription"--extracting all human-readable text to isolate and reveal the user's true harmful intent. Our proof-of-concept guardrail demonstrates high efficacy against the attack, validating that targeting the deceptive schema is a viable mitigation strategy. Our work provides a look into how an LLM's core strengths can be turned into critical weaknesses, offering a fresh perspective for building more robustly aligned models.</description>

      <title>PrivaDE: Privacy-preserving Data Evaluation for Blockchain-based Data Marketplaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18109v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Evaluating the usefulness of data before purchase is essential when obtaining data for high-quality machine learning models, yet both model builders and data providers are often unwilling to reveal their proprietary assets.
  We present PrivaDE, a privacy-preserving protocol that allows a model owner and a data owner to jointly compute a utility score for a candidate dataset without fully exposing model parameters, raw features, or labels. PrivaDE provides strong security against malicious behavior and can be integrated into blockchain-based marketplaces, where smart contracts enforce fair execution and payment. To make the protocol practical, we propose optimizations to enable efficient secure model inference, and a model-agnostic scoring method that uses only a small, representative subset of the data while still reflecting its impact on downstream training. Evaluation shows that PrivaDE performs data evaluation effectively, achieving online runtimes within 15 minutes even for models with millions of parameters.
  Our work lays the foundation for fair and automated data marketplaces in decentralized machine learning ecosystems.</description>

      <title>AI Agents with Decentralized Identifiers and Verifiable Credentials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02841v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A fundamental limitation of current LLM-based AI agents is their inability to build differentiated trust among each other at the onset of an agent-to-agent dialogue. However, autonomous and interoperable trust establishment becomes essential once agents start to operate beyond isolated environments and engage in dialogues across individual or organizational boundaries. A promising way to fill this gap in Agentic AI is to equip agents with long-lived digital identities and introduce tamper-proof and flexible identity-bound attestations of agents, provisioned by commonly trusted third parties and designed for cross-domain verifiability. This article presents a conceptual framework and a prototypical multi-agent system, where each agent is endowed with a self-sovereign digital identity. It combines a unique and ledger-anchored W3C Decentralized Identifier (DID) of an agent with a set of third-party issued W3C Verifiable Credentials (VCs). This enables agents at the start of a dialog to prove ownership of their self-controlled DIDs for authentication purposes and to establish various cross-domain trust relationships through the spontaneous exchange of their self-hosted DID-bound VCs. A comprehensive evaluation of the prototypical implementation demonstrates technical feasibility but also reveals limitations once an agent's LLM is in sole charge to control the respective security procedures.</description>

      <title>Trusted AI Agents in the Cloud</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05951v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: AI agents powered by large language models are increasingly deployed as cloud services that autonomously access sensitive data, invoke external tools, and interact with other agents. However, these agents run within a complex multi-party ecosystem, where untrusted components can lead to data leakage, tampering, or unintended behavior. Existing Confidential Virtual Machines (CVMs) provide only per binary protection and offer no guarantees for cross-principal trust, accelerator-level isolation, or supervised agent behavior. We present Omega, a system that enables trusted AI agents by enforcing end-to-end isolation, establishing verifiable trust across all contributing principals, and supervising every external interaction with accountable provenance. Omega builds on Confidential VMs and Confidential GPUs to create a Trusted Agent Platform that hosts many agents within a single CVM using nested isolation. It also provides efficient multi-agent orchestration with cross-principal trust establishment via differential attestation, and a policy specification and enforcement framework that governs data access, tool usage, and inter-agent communication for data protection and regulatory compliance. Implemented on AMD SEV-SNP and NVIDIA H100, Omega fully secures agent state across CVM-GPU, and achieves high performance while enabling high-density, policy-compliant multi-agent deployments at cloud scale.</description>

      <title>Privacy Loss of Noise Perturbation via Concentration Analysis of A Product Measure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06253v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Noise perturbation is one of the most fundamental approaches for achieving $(\epsilon,\delta)$-differential privacy (DP) guarantees when releasing the result of a query or function $f(\cdot)\in\mathbb{R}^M$ evaluated on a sensitive dataset $\mathbf{x}$. In this approach, calibrated noise $\mathbf{n}\in\mathbb{R}^M$ is used to obscure the difference vector $f(\mathbf{x})-f(\mathbf{x}')$, where $\mathbf{x}'$ is known as a neighboring dataset. A DP guarantee is obtained by studying the tail probability bound of a privacy loss random variable (PLRV), defined as the Radon-Nikodym derivative between two distributions. When $\mathbf{n}$ follows a multivariate Gaussian distribution, the PLRV is characterized as a specific univariate Gaussian. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme to generate $\mathbf{n}$ by leveraging the fact that the perturbation noise is typically spherically symmetric (i.e., the distribution is rotationally invariant around the origin). The new noise generation scheme allows us to investigate the privacy loss from a geometric perspective and express the resulting PLRV using a product measure, $W\times U$; measure $W$ is related to a radius random variable controlling the magnitude of $\mathbf{n}$, while measure $U$ involves a directional random variable governing the angle between $\mathbf{n}$ and the difference $f(\mathbf{x})-f(\mathbf{x}')$. We derive a closed-form moment bound on the product measure to prove $(\epsilon,\delta)$-DP. Under the same $(\epsilon,\delta)$-DP guarantee, our mechanism yields a smaller expected noise magnitude than the classic Gaussian noise in high dimensions, thereby significantly improving the utility of the noisy result $f(\mathbf{x})+\mathbf{n}$. To validate this, we consider convex and non-convex empirical risk minimization (ERM) problems in high dimensional space and apply the proposed product noise to achieve privacy.</description>

      <title>Systematization of Knowledge: Security and Safety in the Model Context Protocol Ecosystem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08290v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Model Context Protocol (MCP) has emerged as the de facto standard for connecting Large Language Models (LLMs) to external data and tools, effectively functioning as the "USB-C for Agentic AI." While this decoupling of context and execution solves critical interoperability challenges, it introduces a profound new threat landscape where the boundary between epistemic errors (hallucinations) and security breaches (unauthorized actions) dissolves. This Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) aims to provide a comprehensive taxonomy of risks in the MCP ecosystem, distinguishing between adversarial security threats (e.g., indirect prompt injection, tool poisoning) and epistemic safety hazards (e.g., alignment failures in distributed tool delegation). We analyze the structural vulnerabilities of MCP primitives, specifically Resources, Prompts, and Tools, and demonstrate how "context" can be weaponized to trigger unauthorized operations in multi-agent environments. Furthermore, we survey state-of-the-art defenses, ranging from cryptographic provenance (ETDI) to runtime intent verification, and conclude with a roadmap for securing the transition from conversational chatbots to autonomous agentic operating systems.</description>

      <title>ObliInjection: Order-Oblivious Prompt Injection Attack to LLM Agents with Multi-source Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.09321v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Prompt injection attacks aim to contaminate the input data of an LLM to mislead it into completing an attacker-chosen task instead of the intended task. In many applications and agents, the input data originates from multiple sources, with each source contributing a segment of the overall input. In these multi-source scenarios, an attacker may control only a subset of the sources and contaminate the corresponding segments, but typically does not know the order in which the segments are arranged within the input. Existing prompt injection attacks either assume that the entire input data comes from a single source under the attacker's control or ignore the uncertainty in the ordering of segments from different sources. As a result, their success is limited in domains involving multi-source data.
  In this work, we propose ObliInjection, the first prompt injection attack targeting LLM applications and agents with multi-source input data. ObliInjection introduces two key technical innovations: the order-oblivious loss, which quantifies the likelihood that the LLM will complete the attacker-chosen task regardless of how the clean and contaminated segments are ordered; and the orderGCG algorithm, which is tailored to minimize the order-oblivious loss and optimize the contaminated segments. Comprehensive experiments across three datasets spanning diverse application domains and twelve LLMs demonstrate that ObliInjection is highly effective, even when only one out of 6-100 segments in the input data is contaminated. Our code and data are available at: https://github.com/ReachalWang/ObliInjection.</description>

      <title>Chasing Shadows: Pitfalls in LLM Security Research</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.09549v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly prevalent in security research. Their unique characteristics, however, introduce challenges that undermine established paradigms of reproducibility, rigor, and evaluation. Prior work has identified common pitfalls in traditional machine learning research, but these studies predate the advent of LLMs. In this paper, we identify nine common pitfalls that have become (more) relevant with the emergence of LLMs and that can compromise the validity of research involving them. These pitfalls span the entire computation process, from data collection, pre-training, and fine-tuning to prompting and evaluation.
  We assess the prevalence of these pitfalls across all 72 peer-reviewed papers published at leading Security and Software Engineering venues between 2023 and 2024. We find that every paper contains at least one pitfall, and each pitfall appears in multiple papers. Yet only 15.7% of the present pitfalls were explicitly discussed, suggesting that the majority remain unrecognized. To understand their practical impact, we conduct four empirical case studies showing how individual pitfalls can mislead evaluation, inflate performance, or impair reproducibility. Based on our findings, we offer actionable guidelines to support the community in future work.</description>

      <title>Defining Cost Function of Steganography with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09769v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we make the first attempt towards defining cost function of steganography with large language models (LLMs), which is totally different from previous works that rely heavily on expert knowledge or require large-scale datasets for cost learning. To achieve this goal, a two-stage strategy combining LLM-guided program synthesis with evolutionary search is applied in the proposed method. In the first stage, a certain number of cost functions in the form of computer programs are synthesized from LLM responses to structured prompts. These cost functions are then evaluated with pretrained steganalysis models so that candidate cost functions suited to steganography can be collected. In the second stage, by retraining a steganalysis model for each candidate cost function, the optimal cost function(s) can be determined according to the detection accuracy. This two-stage strategy is performed by an iterative fashion so that the best cost function can be collected at the last iteration. Experiments show that the proposed method enables LLMs to design new cost functions of steganography that significantly outperform existing works in terms of resisting steganalysis tools, which verifies the superiority of the proposed method. To the best knowledge of the authors, this is the first work applying LLMs to the design of advanced cost function of steganography, which presents a novel perspective for steganography design and may shed light on further research.</description>

      <title>Phishing Email Detection Using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10104v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Email phishing is one of the most prevalent and globally consequential vectors of cyber intrusion. As systems increasingly deploy Large Language Models (LLMs) applications, these systems face evolving phishing email threats that exploit their fundamental architectures. Current LLMs require substantial hardening before deployment in email security systems, particularly against coordinated multi-vector attacks that exploit architectural vulnerabilities. This paper proposes LLMPEA, an LLM-based framework to detect phishing email attacks across multiple attack vectors, including prompt injection, text refinement, and multilingual attacks. We evaluate three frontier LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet 4, and Grok-3) and comprehensive prompting design to assess their feasibility, robustness, and limitations against phishing email attacks. Our empirical analysis reveals that LLMs can detect the phishing email over 90% accuracy while we also highlight that LLM-based phishing email detection systems could be exploited by adversarial attack, prompt injection, and multilingual attacks. Our findings provide critical insights for LLM-based phishing detection in real-world settings where attackers exploit multiple vulnerabilities in combination.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Intrusion Detection System Leveraging Dynamic Neural Models with Adversarial Learning for 5G/6G Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10637v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are critical components in safeguarding 5G/6G networks from both internal and external cyber threats. While traditional IDS approaches rely heavily on signature-based methods, they struggle to detect novel and evolving attacks. This paper presents an advanced IDS framework that leverages adversarial training and dynamic neural networks in 5G/6G networks to enhance network security by providing robust, real-time threat detection and response capabilities. Unlike conventional models, which require costly retraining to update knowledge, the proposed framework integrates incremental learning algorithms, reducing the need for frequent retraining. Adversarial training is used to fortify the IDS against poisoned data. By using fewer features and incorporating statistical properties, the system can efficiently detect potential threats. Extensive evaluations using the NSL- KDD dataset demonstrate that the proposed approach provides better accuracy of 82.33% for multiclass classification of various network attacks while resisting dataset poisoning. This research highlights the potential of adversarial-trained, dynamic neural networks for building resilient IDS solutions.</description>

      <title>We Can Always Catch You: Detecting Adversarial Patched Objects WITH or WITHOUT Signature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.05261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.05261v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, object detection has proven vulnerable to adversarial patch attacks. The attackers holding a specially crafted patch can hide themselves from state-of-the-art detectors, e.g., YOLO, even in the physical world. This attack can bring serious security threats, such as escaping from surveillance cameras. How to effectively detect this kind of adversarial examples to catch potential attacks has become an important problem. In this paper, we propose two detection methods: the signature-based method and the signature-independent method. First, we identify two signatures of existing adversarial patches that can be utilized to precisely locate patches within adversarial examples. By employing the signatures, a fast signature-based method is developed to detect the adversarial objects. Second, we present a robust signature-independent method based on the \textit{content semantics consistency} of model outputs. Adversarial objects violate this consistency, appearing locally but disappearing globally, while benign ones remain consistently present. The experiments demonstrate that two proposed methods can effectively detect attacks both in the digital and physical world. These methods each offer distinct advantage. Specifically, the signature-based method is capable of real-time detection, while the signature-independent method can detect unknown adversarial patch attacks and makes defense-aware attacks almost impossible to perform.</description>

      <title>Why quantum state verification cannot be both efficient and secure: a categorical approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04767v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The advantage of quantum protocols lies in the inherent properties of the shared quantum states. These states are sometimes provided by sources that are not trusted, and therefore need to be verified. Finding secure and efficient quantum state verification protocols remains a big challenge, and recent works illustrate trade-offs between efficiency and security for different groups of states in restricted settings. However, whether a universal trade-off exists for all quantum states and all verification strategies remains unknown. In this work, we instantiate the categorical composable cryptography framework to show a fundamental limit for quantum state verification for all cut-and-choose approaches used to verify arbitrary quantum states. Our findings show that the prevailing cut-and-choose techniques cannot lead to quantum state verification protocols that are both efficient and secure.</description>

      <title>Trojan Cleansing with Neural Collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12914v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Trojan attacks are sophisticated training-time attacks on neural networks that embed backdoor triggers which force the network to produce a specific output on any input which includes the trigger. With the increasing relevance of deep networks which are too large to train with personal resources and which are trained on data too large to thoroughly audit, these training-time attacks pose a significant risk. In this work, we connect trojan attacks to Neural Collapse, a phenomenon wherein the final feature representations of over-parameterized neural networks converge to a simple geometric structure. We provide experimental evidence that trojan attacks disrupt this convergence for a variety of datasets and architectures. We then use this disruption to design a lightweight, broadly generalizable mechanism for cleansing trojan attacks from a wide variety of different network architectures and experimentally demonstrate its efficacy.</description>

      <title>Backdoors in DRL: Four Environments Focusing on In-distribution Triggers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17248v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Backdoor attacks, or trojans, pose a security risk by concealing undesirable behavior in deep neural network models. Open-source neural networks are downloaded from the internet daily, possibly containing backdoors, and third-party model developers are common. To advance research on backdoor attack mitigation, we develop several trojans for deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents. We focus on in-distribution triggers, which occur within the agent's natural data distribution, since they pose a more significant security threat than out-of-distribution triggers due to their ease of activation by the attacker during model deployment. We implement backdoor attacks in four reinforcement learning (RL) environments: LavaWorld, Randomized LavaWorld, Colorful Memory, and Modified Safety Gymnasium. We train various models, both clean and backdoored, to characterize these attacks. We find that in-distribution triggers can require additional effort to implement and be more challenging for models to learn, but are nevertheless viable threats in DRL even using basic data poisoning attacks.</description>

      <title>Time Entangled Quantum Blockchain with Phase Encoding for Classical Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14839v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With rapid advancements in quantum computing, it is widely believed that there will be quantum hardware capable of compromising classical cryptography and hence, the internet and the current information security infrastructure in the coming decade. This is mainly due to the operational realizations of quantum algorithms such as Grover and Shor, to which the current classical encryption protocols are vulnerable. Blockchains, i.e., blockchain data structures and their data, rely heavily on classical cryptography. One approach to secure blockchain is to attempt to achieve information theoretical security by defining blockchain on quantum technologies. There have been two conceptualizations of blockchains on quantum registers: the time-entangled Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state blockchain and the quantum hypergraph blockchain. On our part, an attempt is made to conceptualize a new quantum blockchain combining features of both these schemes to achieve the absolute security of the time-temporal GHZ blockchain and the scalability and efficiency of the quantum hypergraph blockchain in the proposed quantum blockchain protocol.</description>

      <title>Non-Linear Trajectory Modeling for Multi-Step Gradient Inversion Attacks in Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22082v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative training while preserving privacy, yet Gradient Inversion Attacks (GIAs) pose severe threats by reconstructing private data from shared gradients. In realistic FedAvg scenarios with multi-step updates, existing surrogate methods like SME rely on linear interpolation to approximate client trajectories for privacy leakage. However, we demonstrate that linear assumptions fundamentally underestimate SGD's nonlinear complexity, encountering irreducible approximation barriers in non-convex landscapes with only one-dimensional expressiveness. We propose Non-Linear Surrogate Model Extension (NL-SME), the first framework introducing learnable quadratic B\'ezier curves for trajectory modeling in GIAs against FL. NL-SME leverages $|w|+1$-dimensional control point parameterization combined with dvec scaling and regularization mechanisms to achieve superior approximation accuracy. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100 and FEMNIST demonstrate NL-SME significantly outperforms baselines across all metrics, achieving 94\%--98\% performance gaps and order-of-magnitude improvements in cosine similarity loss while maintaining computational efficiency. This work exposes critical privacy vulnerabilities in FL's multi-step paradigm and provides insights for robust defense development.</description>

      <title>Stealthy Yet Effective: Distribution-Preserving Backdoor Attacks on Graph Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26032v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated strong performance across tasks such as node classification, link prediction, and graph classification, but remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks that implant imperceptible triggers during training to control predictions. While node-level attacks exploit local message passing, graph-level attacks face the harder challenge of manipulating global representations while maintaining stealth. We identify two main sources of anomaly in existing graph classification backdoor methods: structural deviation from rare subgraph triggers and semantic deviation caused by label flipping, both of which make poisoned graphs easily detectable by anomaly detection models. To address this, we propose DPSBA, a clean-label backdoor framework that learns in-distribution triggers via adversarial training guided by anomaly-aware discriminators. DPSBA effectively suppresses both structural and semantic anomalies, achieving high attack success while significantly improving stealth. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets validate that DPSBA achieves a superior balance between effectiveness and detectability compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <title>When Reject Turns into Accept: Quantifying the Vulnerability of LLM-Based Scientific Reviewers to Indirect Prompt Injection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10449v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The landscape of scientific peer review is rapidly evolving with the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs). This shift is driven by two parallel trends: the widespread individual adoption of LLMs by reviewers to manage workload (the "Lazy Reviewer" hypothesis) and the formal institutional deployment of AI-powered assessment systems by conferences like AAAI and Stanford's Agents4Science. This study investigates the robustness of these "LLM-as-a-Judge" systems (both illicit and sanctioned) to adversarial PDF manipulation. Unlike general jailbreaks, we focus on a distinct incentive: flipping "Reject" decisions to "Accept," for which we develop a novel evaluation metric which we term as WAVS (Weighted Adversarial Vulnerability Score). We curated a dataset of 200 scientific papers and adapted 15 domain-specific attack strategies to this task, evaluating them across 13 Language Models, including GPT-5, Claude Haiku, and DeepSeek. Our results demonstrate that obfuscation strategies like "Maximum Mark Magyk" successfully manipulate scores, achieving alarming decision flip rates even in large-scale models. We will release our complete dataset and injection framework to facilitate more research on this topic.</description>
