      <title>Possible evidences for physics beyond $\Lambda$CDM from DESI DR2 data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze DESI DR2 data with a model-independent method and find that: (a) the expansion of the universe may speed up with a confidence level more than 2.3 $\sigma$ at redshift $z_{51}\in (0.51, 0.955)$; (b) the expansion of the universe may speed down with a confidence level greater than 1.7 $\sigma$ at redshift $z_{75}\in (0.955, 1.484)$; (c) $w_{\rm{x}}\leq w_{\rm{t}}&lt;-1$ with confidence level exceeding 1.6 $\sigma$ at redshift $z_{53}\in (0.922, 0.955)$.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter Surrounded Quartic Square-root Horndeski Black Hole: Thermodynamics, Optical Properties and Quasinormal Oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study a special form of Horndeski solutions, viz. quartic "square-root" Horndeski black hole immersed in a perfect-fluid dark-matter halo, by examining its thermodynamics, null geodesic shape, optical shadow, and quasinormal ringdown spectrum. The model is characterized by three parameters, namely $\beta$, $\eta$ (non-minimal Horndeski coupling parameters), and $b$ (perfect fluid dark matter parameter), which collectively determine horizon properties and observational effects. To study thermodynamic stability, we used the specific heat and free energy arguments, with which we demonstrated that small horizon states are locally stable but are never globally preferred. Analytic solutions of null geodesics reveal the radius of the photon sphere and the critical impact parameter, proving that increases in the dark matter parameters and the Horndeski parameter $\beta$ enlarge both the photon sphere and the subsequent shadow, whereas increase in the Horndeski coupling $\eta$ causes a mild diminishing in the shadow radius. Numerical ray tracing verifies these qualitative trends in the apparent shadow. Using the 6$^{th}$ - order WKB approximation method, we also calculate the scalar quasinormal modes and determine that oscillation frequencies and damping rates behave oppositely according to the sign and magnitude of each parameter. By comparing the shadow radius with the recent Event Horizon Telescope constraints on the Sgr A*, we find a narrow window of parameter space that agrees with observed data. In other words, the coupling parameters should be very small. These measurements restrict modified gravity impacts within realistic astrophysical contexts.</description>

      <title>Bound-state resonances of the Schwarzschild black hole: Analytic treatment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by an earlier idea of Mashhoon, who suggested to relate the discrete quasinormal resonant modes of a black hole to the bound-state resonances of the corresponding inverted black-hole potential, V\"olkel [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 134}, 241401 (2025)] has recently computed numerically, for the first time, the bound-state energy spectrum of the inverted Schwarzschild potential. Motivated by this intriguing work, in the present work we use {\it analytical} techniques in order to explore the physical and mathematical properties of the Schwarzschild bound-state resonances. In particular, we derive closed-form compact analytical formulas for the infinite spectrum $\{E_n\}_{n=0}^{n=\infty}$ of energy eigenvalues that characterize the inverted (binding) black-hole potential. Interestingly, it is explicitly shown that our analytically derived energy spectrum of the black-hole inverted potential agrees remarkably well with the corresponding numerical data that recently appeared in the physics literature.</description>

      <title>Accelerated expansion of the universe model with parametrization of $q(z)$ in $f(R,L_m)$ theory of gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this research work, we explore the late-time accelerated expansion of the universe within the framework of modified gravity, specifically $f(R, L_m)$ theory, by considering two non-linear models: $f(R, L_{m}) = \frac{R}{2}+(1+\eta R) L_{m}$ and $f(R, L_{m}) = \frac{R}{2}+ L_{m}^{\eta}$, where $\eta$ is a free parameter. Adopting a parametric form of the deceleration parameter $q(z)$, we derive a quadratic expression for the normalized Hubble parameter. By use of Bayesian statistical analysis with the $\chi^{2}$-minimization approach, we determine the median values of the model parameters for both the cosmic chronometer (CC) and the joint (CC+Pantheon) dataset. Furthermore, we examine the fundamental cosmological parameters: energy density, pressure, the equation of state (EoS) parameter and energy conditions. The cosmographic parameters are thoroughly analyzed and the present age of the universe is estimated based on this model.</description>

      <title>Charged, rotating black holes in Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The asymptotically flat, electrically charged, rotating black holes (BHs) in Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton (EMd) theory are known in closed form for \textit{only} two particular values of the dilaton coupling constant $\gamma$: the Einstein-Maxwell coupling ($\gamma=0$), corresponding to the Kerr-Newman (KN) solution, and the Kaluza-Klein coupling ($\gamma=\sqrt{3}$). Rotating solutions with arbitrary $\gamma$ are known only in the slow-rotation or weakly charged limits. In this work, we numerically construct such EMd BHs with arbitrary $\gamma$. We present an overview of the parameter space of the solutions for illustrative values of $\gamma$ together with a study of their basic properties. The solutions are in general KN-like; there are however, new features. The data suggest that the spinning solutions with $0&lt;\gamma&lt;\sqrt{3}$ possess a zero temperature limit, which, albeit regular in terms of curvature invariants, exhibits a $pp$-singularity. A different limiting behaviour is found for $\gamma&gt;\sqrt{3}$, in which case, moreover, we have found hints of BH non-uniqueness for the same global charges.</description>

      <title>Novel Mechanism for Production of Planck Relics in Third Order Effective Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel mechanism for the formation of black hole remnants arising from a third order effective field theory correction to general relativity. We first calculate the corresponding modifications to the Schwarzschild metric and the Hawking temperature and use these to derive a modified evaporation law that deviates significantly from the classical prediction for sufficiently small black holes. Notably, the rate of mass loss vanishes at a critical mass $M_{crit}$, while the Hawking temperature remains finite. This leads to a freeze-out in the evaporation process, naturally producing stable black hole remnants of Planck scale called Planck relics. We also identify a local maximum in the evaporation rate for a certain mass $M_{*} &gt; M_{crit}$, and compute the corresponding heat capacities which differ from Hawking's predictions. Our results show that higher-order curvature corrections in effective field theory can provide a physical mechanism for the production of black hole remnants, although the validity of such predictions near the Planck scale remains limited by the breakdown of semiclassical approximations.</description>

      <title>Effects of acceleration on interatomic interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Unruh effect establishes a fundamental equivalence between acceleration and thermality by demonstrating that a uniformly accelerated ground-state detector undergoes excitation as if immersed in a thermal bath. In this paper, we investigate how acceleration influences the interaction between two ground-state atoms that are synchronously and uniformly accelerated in vacuum with proper acceleration $a$ and coupled to a fluctuating electromagnetic field. We find that the resulting interaction potential comprises both diagonal components $(\delta E)^{jk}$ with $j=k$, which are present in both inertial and acceleration cases, and off-diagonal components $(\delta E)^{jk}$ with $j\neq k$, which arise exclusively due to acceleration and vanish in the inertial case. The dependence of each component on acceleration and interatomic separation $L$ generally differs. For small accelerations, the leading-order diagonal components of the van der Waals (vdW) and Casimir-Polder (CP) interaction potentials remain unchanged from their inertial counterparts, exhibiting the standard scaling behaviors $\sim L^{-6}$ and $\sim L^{-7}$, respectively. In contrast, the off-diagonal components scale as $\sim a^2L^{-4}$ in the vdW subregions and $\sim a^2L^{-5}$ in the CP subregion. However, when the acceleration becomes sufficiently large, both diagonal and off-diagonal components of the vdW and CP interaction potentials are significantly modified, giving rise to entirely new interaction behaviors that deviate from those observed in the inertial case, whether in vacuum or thermal environments, indicating a breakdown of the acceleration-thermality equivalence established by the Unruh effect for single detectors.</description>

      <title>Quasi-normal modes and shadows of scale-dependent regular black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate how a regular scale-dependent black hole, characterized by a single extra parameter $\epsilon$, behaves under perturbations by a test field (quasi-normal modes) and under light imaging (shadows) in a four-dimensional space-time background. On the quasi-normal modes side, we study how it responds to scalar and Dirac perturbations. To do this, we implement the well known WKB semi-analytic method of 6th order for obtaining the quasi-normal frequencies. We discuss the behavior of the real and imaginary parts of the quasi-normal modes for different values of the parameter $\epsilon$ and the overtone $n$ and multipole $\ell$ numbers. On the black hole imaging side, we ray-trace the geometry and illuminate it with a thin-accretion disk. Choosing $\epsilon=1.0$ we compute the size of the central brightness depression and generate full images of the black hole. We discuss the features (i.e. luminosity) of successive photon rings through the Lyapunov exponent of nearly-bound, unstable geodesics. Furthermore we use the correspondence (in the limit $\ell \gg n$) between quasi-normal mode frequencies and unstable bound light orbits to infer the numerical values of the latter using the former and find a remarkable accuracy of the correspondence in providing the right numbers. Our results support the usefulness of this correspondence in order to perform cross-tests of black holes using these two messengers.</description>

      <title>Impact of Detector Calibration Accuracy on Black Hole Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Systematic errors in detector calibration can bias signal analyses and potentially lead to incorrect interpretations suggesting violations of general relativity. In this study, we investigate how calibration systematics affect black hole (BH) spectroscopy, a technique that uses the quasinormal modes (QNMs) emitted during the ringdown phase of gravitational waves (GWs) to study remnant BHs formed in compact binary coalescences. We simulate a series of physically motivated, tunable calibration errors and use them to intentionally miscalibrate numerical relativity waveforms. We then apply a QNM extraction method -- the rational QNM filter -- to quantify the impact of these calibration errors. We find that current calibration standards (errors within $10\%$ in magnitude and $10^\circ$ in phase across the most sensitive frequency range of 20--2000 Hz) are adequate for BH ringdown analyses with existing observations, but insufficient for the accuracy goals of future upgraded and next-generation observatories. Specifically, we show that for events with a high ringdown signal-to-noise ratio of $\sim 120$, calibration errors must remain $\lesssim 6\%$ in magnitude and $\lesssim 4^\circ$ in phase to avoid introducing biases. While this analysis addresses a particular aspect of BH spectroscopy, the results offer broadly applicable quantitative benchmarks for calibration standards crucial to fully realizing the potential of precision GW astrophysics in the next-generation detector era.</description>

      <title>Observational viability of fractional holographic dark energy in LRS Bianchi type-I cosmological model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We scrutinized the Locally Rotational Symmetry (LRS) Bianchi type-I cosmological model in the presence of fractional holographic dark energy. We calculate the value of the Hubble parameter $H(z)$ using the field equations. After that, we fit the model by employing the MCMC techniques to observational data, which includes Hubble, Hubble+BAO, Hubble+Pantheon+Shoes, and Hubble+BAO+Pantheon+Shoes datasets. With the help of these datasets, we calculate the model parameters, viz. $H_{0}(z), \alpha,$ and $\Omega_{m_{0}}$. The value of $H_{0}(z),\alpha$ and $\Omega_{m_{0}}$ lies in the range $67.688^{+1.246}_{-1.197}- 67.80^{+1.23}_{-1.23}, 0.86^{+0.14}_{-0.15}- 0.885^{+0141}_{-0.149}$ and $0.264^{+0.018}_{-0.018}- 0.27^{+0.02}_{-0.02}$ respectively. Our results indicate that the evolution of the density parameters corresponding to dark energy (DE) and dark matter (DM), particularly for $\alpha=1.01$, along with the transition at $z_{t} = 0.55$ of the deceleration parameter $q$ from positive values to $-1$, reflects a phase of accelerated expansion that closely resembles the $\Lambda$CDM model. The behavior of the equation of state (EoS) parameter further demonstrates that the Universe's evolution aligns well with the framework of the fractional holographic dark energy (FHDE) model, suggesting its compatibility with scenarios of late-time cosmology. Moreover, the analysis of the statefinder diagnostics ${(r,s)}$ and the present value of ${(r,s)} = (0.74,0.07)$ reveal characteristics that converge towards the $\Lambda$CDM fixed point. A comparison between the observational constraints on our model parameters and those of the $\Lambda$CDM model exhibits a strong degree of agreement, thereby reinforcing the physical plausibility and consistency of the proposed cosmological model.</description>

      <title>Formation of multiple Black Holes from Cauchy data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a family of asymptotically flat Cauchy initial data for the Einstein vacuum equations that contain no trapped surfaces, yet whose future development admits multiple causally independent trapped surfaces. Assuming the weak cosmic censorship conjecture, this implies the formation of multiple black holes in finite time. The initial data are obtained by surgically modifying a vacuum geometrostatic manifold equipped with the Brill-Lindquist metric: the data agree exactly with the Brill-Lindquist metric outside a collection of balls centered at its multiple poles, and each ball is replaced by a constant-time slice of a well-prepared dynamical spacetime. The construction is based on Christodoulou's short-pulse framework, a stability analysis in the finite future of the short-pulse region, the geometry of geometrostatic manifolds with small mass and large separation, and the obstruction-free annular gluing method developed by Mao-Oh-Tao. The absence of trapped surfaces in the initial data is verified via a standard mean curvature comparison argument.</description>

      <title>Kaluza-Klein inspired a model of the inflation with the inversed power law potential in Bianchi type-I universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work considers the dynamics of the gauge vector and inflaton (dilaton) fields inspired by Kaluza-Klein theory in an inflationary universe with Bianchi type-I spacetime. The inverse power-law potential of the inflaton field is used to study dynamical system analysis. As a result, all fixed points in the autonomous system are non-hyperbolic fixed points, and one cannot determine their stability. Therefore, a center manifold theory is required to analyze the stability of the dynamical system properly. Interestingly, we found an isotropic attractor point which means that the universe undergoes accelerated expansion (inflation) from an anisotropic phase to an isotropic phase of the universe. According to the dynamical system analysis of the anisotropic Bianchi type-I universe with the inspired Kaluza-Klein model, our results supported the isotropization of the observed universe.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal modes and grey-body factors of axial gravitational perturbations of regular black holes in asymptotically safe gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a detailed study of axial gravitational perturbations of the regular black hole solution in asymptotically safe gravity, as proposed in \cite{Bonanno:2023rzk}. We analyze the quasinormal mode (QNM) spectrum of this black hole using two numerical techniques: the Bernstein spectral method and the asymptotic iteration method (AIM). These approaches allow us to compute QNM frequencies with high accuracy, even for higher overtones. Our results show that the fundamental mode is only weakly affected by the deviation parameter, whereas notable deviations from the Schwarzschild case emerge for higher overtones. Additionally, we examine the correspondence between grey-body factors and QNMs using the sixth-order WKB approximation, finding excellent agreement, especially for larger multipole numbers l.</description>

      <title>Observational Constraints on Scalar Field--Matter Interaction in Weyl Integrable Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We test an analytic cosmological solution within the framework of Weyl Integrable Spacetime using current observational data. In this model, dark energy is described by a pressureless fluid, while a scalar field arises naturally through the definition of the connection. This gravitational theory reveals a Chameleon Mechanism leading to a nonzero interaction between the scalar field and the matter sector. This model extends the standard $\Lambda $CDM cosmology by introducing one additional degree of freedom, allowing for deviations from $\Lambda$CDM dynamics. For the observational constraints we consider the Supernova data of Pantheon+ collaboration, the Cosmic Chronometers, the Baryonic Acoustic Oscillators of DESI DR2 collaboration and the gamma-ray bursts. We find that Weyl Integrable Spacetime fits the data in a better way than the $\Lambda$CDM. When all datasets are considered, the statistical comparison indicates a weak to moderate preference for Weyl Integrable Spacetime according to the Akaike Information Criterion and Jeffrey's scale for the Bayesian evidence.</description>

Abstract: In this short note we perform canonical analysis of Eddington gravity using L. Faddeev and Jackiw formalism. We demonstrate that resulting canonical action has the same form as General Relativity canonical action which proves an equivalence of Eddington gravity and General Relativity in Hamiltonian formalism.</description>

      <title>Constraining parameters of spinor field dark energy: An alternative to $\Lambda$CDM model under the spherically symmetric FLRW space-time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study constrains the cosmological parameters within the scope of a spherically symmetric FLRW cosmological model, the role of a nonlinear spinor field in the universe's evolution. To test this approach, we incorporate the recent Cosmic chronometers, Supernova, and Sloan Digital Sky Survey data. It is found that if spherical coordinates give the FLRW model, the energy-momentum tensor (EMT) of the spinor field possesses nontrivial non-diagonal components. These non-diagonal components of EMT neither depend on the spinor field nonlinearity nor the value of the parameter $k$ defining the type of curvature of the FLRW model. In this context, we construct a dark energy model and perform an MCMC simulation to obtain the best-fit values of the parameters. The results are well comparable to the present Hubble parameter and deceleration parameter, indicating the accelerated expansion of the universe.</description>

      <title>Testing Quantum-Corrected Black Holes with QPOs Observations: A Study of Particle Dynamics and Accretion Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the epicyclic oscillations of test particles around rotating quantum-corrected black holes (QCBHs), characterized by mass $M$, spin $a$, and quantum deformation parameter $b$. By deriving the radial ($\Omega_r$) and vertical ($\Omega_\theta$) oscillation frequencies, we explore their dependence on spacetime parameters and show that quantum corrections ($b \neq 0$) significantly modify the dynamics compared to the classical Kerr case. Through numerical modelling of accretion around QCBHs, we further examine how $b$ influences strong-field phenomena, comparing the results with test-particle dynamics and observational data. Our analysis reveals: 1. Quantum corrections shift the ISCOs outward, with $b$ altering the effective potential and conditions for stable circular motion. 2. The curvature of the potential and thus the epicyclic frequencies change $\Omega_r$ shows up to 25% deviation for typical $b$ values, underscoring sensitivity to quantum effects. 3. Precession behavior is modified: while Lense-Thirring precession ($\Omega_{LT}$) remains primarily governed by $a$, periastron precession ($\Omega_P$) is notably affected by $b$, especially near the black hole. 4. Accretion disk simulations confirm the physical effects of $b$, aligning well with the test particle analysis. Moreover, quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) frequencies obtained via both approaches agree with observed low-frequency QPOs from sources like GRS $1915+105$, GRO $J1655{-}40$, XTE $J1550{-}564$, and $H1743{-}322$. The distinct frequency profiles and altered ratios offer observational signatures that may distinguish QCBHs from classical black holes. Our findings present testable predictions for X-ray timing and a new avenue to constrain quantum gravity parameters.</description>

      <title>One Membrane to Love them all: Tidal deformations of compact objects from the membrane paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The tidal deformability is a key observable to test the nature of compact objects in a binary coalescence. Within vacuum General Relativity, the tidal Love numbers of a four-dimensional black hole are strictly zero, while they are non-zero and model-dependent for material objects, matter distributions around black holes, or in alternative theories of gravity. Here, we develop a model-agnostic framework based on the membrane paradigm, where the tidal properties of a spherically symmetric object are encoded in the response of a fictitious membrane in terms of viscosity coefficients. We show that both neutron stars and exotic compact objects (in particular, we provide an explicit example for thin-shell gravastars) are included in this framework, provided that the bulk and shear viscosity coefficients of the membrane have a nontrivial frequency dependence. We derive a general result for the electric and magnetic tidal Love numbers for non-rotating and spherically symmetric compact objects in terms of the viscosity coefficients, discussing their behavior with the compactness of the object, and identifying the conditions for the logarithmic behavior found in previous literature for various ultracompact objects. Finally, we show that the membrane shear viscosity coefficients associated with neutron star models feature novel quasi-universal relations, which depend only mildly on the neutron-star equation of state.</description>

      <title>Weak Field Limit of the Nonminimally Coupled Weyl Connection Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The true nature of gravity is a remarkable open problem in Gravitation. Theoretical and observational motivations open the avenue of alternative theories of gravity. One possibility resorts to nonminimal couplings and non-metricity properties of spacetime, and is dubbed as nonminimally coupled Weyl connection gravity. It has the advantage of leading to metric field equations of second order together with a constraint equation for the Weyl vector, and has well behaved space-form. We analyse this model by exploring its weak regime and its implications for astrophysics and cosmology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A detailed Hamilton-Jacobi analysis for linearized $\lambda R$ gravity is developed. The model is constructed by rewriting linearized gravity in terms of a parameter $\lambda$ and new variables. The set of all hamiltonians is identified successfully, and the fundamental differential is established. The non-involutive hamiltonians are eliminated, and the Hamilton-Jacobi generalized brackets are calculated. Such brackets are used to report the characteristic equations, and the counting of the number of degrees of freedom is performed. We fixed the gauge to indicate an intimate closeness between the model under study and linearized gravity.</description>

      <title>Weak null singularity for the Einstein-Euler system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the behavior of a self-gravitating perfect relativistic fluid satisfying the Einstein-Euler system in the presence of a weak null terminal spacetime singularity. This type of singularities is expected in the interior of generic dynamical black holes. In the vacuum case, weak null singularities have been constructed locally by Luk, where the metrics extend continuously to the singularities while the Christoffel symbols fail to be square integrable in any neighborhood of any point on the singular boundaries. We prove that this type of singularities persists in the presence of a self-gravitating fluid. Moreover, using the fact that the speed of sound is strictly less than the speed of light, we prove that the fluid variables also extend continuously to the singularity.</description>

      <title>Jeans analysis in modified gravity: A general formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Jeans instability of a self-gravitating fluid in the context of alternative gravitational theories. Our formulation accommodates arbitrary corrections to the Newtonian potential, providing a versatile approach to analyzing a wide range of gravity theories in the weak-field limit. As concrete examples, we explore in detail three specific modifications: the Maneff potential, a logarithmic correction, and a Yukawa-type correction to Newtonian gravity. These three cases serve as representative examples of the range of functional forms -- power-law, logarithmic, and exponential -- that one might expect to arise in alternative theories of gravity. We determine the conditions for instability and the growth rate of perturbations for these potentials. To evaluate their validity, we compare the established stability criteria with the observed stability data from Bok globules, thereby enabling us to place constraints on the parameters of these alternative gravitational theories. Additionally, we extend our analysis to the quantum regime, offering a broader perspective on the interplay between gravity and quantum effects in the context of alternative theories of gravity.</description>

      <title>Theories of the gravity+gauge type in de Sitter space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study theories of the "General Relativity + Yang-Mills" type in 4d spacetime with cosmological constant, focusing on formulations where the basic variables are connections and curvatures (but no metric). We present a new Lagrangian for GR coupled to Yang-Mills, which uses the same kind of variables for both sectors, and has a manifest double-copy structure. This Lagrangian comes in both non-chiral (real) and chiral (complex) versions. The chiral version makes it easy to isolate the self-dual sector. The latter lends itself to a higher-spin (HS) generalization, which combines the HS Self-Dual GR and HS Self-Dual Yang-Mills of Krasnov, Skvortsov and Tran. We then descend from the covariant formulation to lightcone gauge, and construct a cubic-exact lightcone action. For HS Self-Dual Yang-Mills, we solve the lightcone field equations to all orders in perturbation theory. Finally, we discuss the relation between lightcone foliations that share a lightray -- a setup relevant for the scattering problem in the de Sitter static patch. We derive this relation at the linearized level, and argue from causality+symmetry that it cannot receive non-linear corrections. We explore the associated gauge transformations in the non-linear covariant theory.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal splitting of the Riemann curvature tensor and its implications in modeling compact stellar structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although the interpretation of complexity in extended theories of gravity is available in the literature, its illustration in $f(R,L_{m},\mathcal{T})$ theory is still ambiguous. The orthogonal decomposition of the Riemann tensor results in the emergence of complexity factor as recently proposed by Herrera [1]. We initiate the analysis by contemplating the interior spacetime as a static spherical anisotropic composition under the presence of charge. The modified field equations are derived along with the establishment of association between the curvature and conformal tensors that have significant relevance in evaluating complexity of the system. Furthermore, the generalized expressions for two different masses are calculated, and their link with conformal tensor is also analyzed. Moreover, we develop a particular relation between predetermined quantities and evaluate the complexity in terms of a certain scalar $Y_{TF}$. Several interior solutions admitting vanishing complexity are also determined. Interestingly, compact objects having anisotropic matter configuration along with the energy density inhomogeneity possess maximum complexity. It is concluded that the spherical distribution of matter might not manifest complexity or admitting minimal value of this factor in the framework of $f(R,L_{m},\mathcal{T})$ theory due to the appearance of dark source terms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theory of gravitationally induced adiabatic particle production offers an alternative approach to exploring the accelerating expansion of the universe. However, existing models generally lack a well-defined field-action formulation. This article aims to establish a suitable Lagrangian formulation consistent with the framework of particle creation. A general form of action is considered for this purpose. The corresponding field equations in comparison with those commonly used in the particle creation formalism leads to some specific form of the Lagrangian, which further restricts the form of the particle creation models. We perform a phase space stability analysis of the constrained model in hand and show that our model is capable of explaining the cosmic evolution from the radiation dominated era to the late-time cosmic acceleration if the model parameter has the bound $1/3 &lt; \beta &lt; 2/3$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work, quasilocal Brown-York charges are derived that coincide in the large sphere limit with the conserved supertranslation hair and superrotation charges introduced by Hawking, Perry and Strominger in [45, 46]. Given these charges, a general scenario is outlined in which a non-rotating black hole completely evaporates after its collapse due to particle creation effects, whereby a genuine one-way traversable event horizon is never formed, but merely a two-way traversable dynamical (resp. future trapping) horizon. The formation of such a dynamical horizon has the consequence, as is demonstrated, that quasilocal energy transported by the considered charges, and thus information, can continuously escape through the black hole horizon to infinity; a mechanism which, as is argued, could possibly prevent information loss once the black hole formation and evaporation process comes to an end.</description>

      <title>Cosmology of Cubic Poincar\'e Gauge gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study flat FLRW cosmology for a Poincar\'e gauge theory containing cubic invariants that is free from ghosts in arbitrary backgrounds in the axial and vector sectors of the torsion tensor. The new degrees of freedom can be related to hypermomentum but continue to be dynamical even in vacuum. These extra degrees of freedom open a more natural way in which to construct potential gravitational models that provide possible ways to modify astrophysical and cosmological physics. In this framework, we study two particular branches of the theory where preliminary routes of exploring these new variables are exposed. The first is the branch where the hypermomentum vanishes, while the second branch involves the setting where the perfect fluid and hypermomentum parts of the sources are independently conserved. In both settings, we find generically faster expanding cosmologies with similar estimates of the cosmic matter content as in the standard model of cosmology. Cubic Poincar\'e Gauge gravity offers an interesting theoretical basis on which to study cosmology, and indicates some preliminary positive constraints when compared with observational constraints.</description>

      <title>Optical Appearance and Shadow of Kalb-Ramond Black Hole: Effects of Plasma and Accretion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the effect of the presence of plasma and different accretion models on the shadow and optical appearance of static spherically symmetric black holes containing the Kalb-Ramond field. We derive the motion equations for photons around the Kalb-Ramond black hole and constrain the Lorentz symmetry breaking parameters $\lambda$ and $\gamma$ using observational data released by the Event Horizon Telescope collaboration. The results indicate that, under the static spherical accretion model, as $\lambda$ or $\gamma$ increase, the peak value of the observed intensity for Kalb-Ramond black holes is enhanced and consistently exceeds that of the corresponding Schwarzschild black holes. In the presence of plasma, we find that as the plasma frequency increases, the photon sphere radius increases, whereas the black hole shadow radius decreases. In addition, compared to inhomogeneous plasma, the effect of homogeneous plasma on these features is more significant. Specifically, when the plasma is homogeneous, an increase in plasma frequency further enhances the observed intensity peaks. This suggests that the shadow of the Kalb-Ramond black hole is brighter due to the presence of plasma. Additionally, for the same Kalb-Ramond black hole model parameters and plasma frequency, the shadow of the Kalb-Ramond black hole in inhomogeneous plasma is larger than in the case of homogeneous plasma. Under the thin disk accretion model, an increase in the Lorentz symmetry breaking parameters decreases the observed intensity peak and increases the thickness of the photon ring and the lensed ring. The presence of plasma significantly alters the optical appearance of Kalb-Ramond black hole, providing a possible way to distinguish Kalb-Ramond black hole from Schwarzschild black hole.</description>

      <title>Can an Extra Degree of Freedom in Scalar-Tensor Non-Metricity Gravity Account for the Evolution of the Universe?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate whether the extra scalar degree of freedom that arises in the second connection class of scalar-tensor non-metricity gravity can accurately replicate and potentially enrich the cosmic expansion history. Focusing on a spatially flat FLRW background, we introduce Hubble-normalized variables and recast the field equations into an autonomous dynamical system. Four representative scenarios are analyzed comprehensively. Phase-space research reveals a rich hierarchy of critical points: matter-dominated, stiff-fluid, and de Sitter solutions, together with asymptotic trajectories leading to Big-Crunch/Rip singularities and transient, unstable matter epochs. With suitable parameter choices, the standard $\Lambda$CDM sequence is reinstated; however, novel late-time and high-curvature regimes arise exclusively from the non-metricity sector. A systematic comparison of metric scalar-tensor and teleparallel scalar-torsion theories reveals unique stability characteristics and potential observational discriminants. Our findings indicate that the additional time-dependent function inherent to scalar-tensor non-metricity gravity can effectively explain the Universe's evolution while providing new phenomenology that can be tested by upcoming surveys.</description>

Abstract: A theory of quantum gravity consists of a gravitational framework which, unlike general relativity, takes into account the quantum character of matter. In spite of impressive advances, no fully satisfactory, self-consistent and empirically viable theory with those characteristics has ever been constructed. A successful semiclassical gravity model, in which the classical Einstein tensor couples to the expectation value of the energy-momentum tensor of quantum matter fields, would, at the very least, constitute a useful stepping stone towards quantum gravity. However, not only no empirically viable semiclassical theory has ever been proposed, but the self-consistency of semiclassical gravity itself has been called into question repeatedly over the years. Here, we put forward a fully self-consistent, empirically viable semiclassical gravity framework, in which the expectation value of the energy-momentum tensor of a quantum field, evolving via a relativistic objective collapse dynamics, couples to a fully classical Einstein tensor. We present the general framework, a concrete example, and briefly explore possible empirical consequences of our model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate light propagation in self-gravitating systems composed of an axially symmetric, stationary, rotating dust fluid. These configurations are intrinsically relativistic, sustained entirely by their rotation, since no compact or finite dust distribution can exist under the same symmetry conditions in Newtonian gravity. In such systems, rotational effects arise from off-diagonal components of the spacetime metric, which are not negligible compared to their Newtonian counterparts. We analyze how these components affect the deflection angle of light, showing that they can be interpreted as contributing an additional effective mass. Moreover, their presence can, in principle, be detected through the characteristic asymmetry they induce in the images of background sources.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical constraints on gravitational waves from horizonless compact objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the data of several promising gravitational wave observations to obtain increasingly stringent bounds on near-horizon deviations of their sources from the Kerr geometry. A range of horizonless compact objects proposed as alternatives to black holes of general relativity would possess a modified gravitational wave emission after the merger. Modelling these objects by introducing reflection of gravitational waves near the horizon, we can measure deviations from Kerr in terms of a single additional parameter, the location of the reflection. We quote bounds on deviations for 5 events in addition to previous results obtained for GW150914. Additionally, we improve upon previous results by hierarchically combining information from all analysed events, yielding a bound on deviations of less than $1.3 \times 10^{-26}$ meters above the horizon.</description>

Abstract: There is an error in the proof (but not the truth) of Theorem 3.2 in the author's 1985 paper "The Double-Wedge Algebra for Quantum Fields on Schwarzschild and Minkowski Spacetimes" in "Communications in Mathematical Physics". The author became aware of that error and of how it may be corrected soon after it went to print, and two companion papers published soon afterwards (in Helvetica Physica Acta) refer to an "erratum to appear". This is that erratum. We also take the opportunity to note a few (unrelated and minor) corrections to those two companion papers and also to very briefly mention related more recent work.</description>

      <title>How to Count States in Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gibbons and Hawking proposed that the Euclidean gravity path integral with periodic boundary conditions in time computes the thermal partition sum of gravity. As a corollary, they argued that a derivative of the associated free energy with respect to the Euclidean time period computes gravitational entropy. Why is this interpretation is correct? That is, why does this path integral compute a trace over the Hilbert space? Here, we show that the quantity computed by the Gibbons-Hawking path integral is equal to an {\it a priori} different object -- an explicit thermal trace over the Hilbert space spanned by states produced by the Euclidean gravity path integral. This follows in two ways: (a) if the Hilbert space with two boundaries factorizes into a product of two single boundary Hilbert spaces, as we have previously shown; and (b) via explicit resolution of the trace by a spanning basis of states. We similarly show how a replicated Euclidean gravity path integral with a single periodic boundary computes a Hilbert space trace of powers of the density matrix, explaining why this approach computes the entropy of states entangled between two universes.</description>

      <title>Observing Leptogenesis in Action with Gravitational Waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Leptogenesis is arguably the best motivated theory of baryogenesis given the discovery of finite neutrino masses, yet its experimental test is elusive given its high energy scale. We discuss gravitational waves (GWs) produced via graviton bremsstrahlung in right-handed neutrino decays during leptogenesis. The presence of right-handed neutrinos in the early universe can lead to a period of early matter domination. In this context, the resultant GW spectrum scales quadratically with the right-handed neutrino mass, while its peak frequency scales inversely with the Yukawa coupling. Detecting such a spectrum would provide strong evidence for leptogenesis and the existence of heavy right-handed neutrinos. We also discuss how the GW spectrum emitted from the thermal plasma is altered by an era of early matter domination. We show that it can mimic the effects of additional relativistic degrees of freedom and a higher reheating temperature, and that information from the graviton bremsstrahlung GW spectrum can break this degeneracy.</description>

      <title>The Komar charge in presence of the Holst term and the gravitational Witten effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the first-order formalism, the Einstein--Hilbert action can be modified by the addition of a Holst term multiplied by the Barbero parameter $\alpha$. This modification breaks parity although it does not affect the equations of motion. We show that the standard Komar charge is also modified by the addition of a topological term multiplied by the Barbero parameter $\alpha$. For the Killing vector that generates time translations, the value of the Komar integral at infinity is modified by the addition of a term proportional to the NUT charge $N$ and the parity-breaking Barbero parameter. Thus, as in the standard Witten effect, a non-vanishing NUT charge $N$ induces a non-vanishing mass $\alpha N$.</description>

      <title>A Photon Cloud Induced from an Axion Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is known that the axion-photon coupling can lead to quantum stimulated emission of photons and classic exponential amplification of electromagnetic (EM) fields at half the axion mass frequency, when the axion density or the coupling constant is sufficiently large. In this work, we studied the EM photon cloud induced from an axion cloud around a Kerr black hole in the first order of the coupling constant classically. In the presence of a static EM background (like Wald extended solution) valid in realistic astrophysical environment, we found that an EM photon cloud emerges, oscillating at the same frequency as the axion cloud and growing exponentially in accordance with the axion cloud when the superradiant condition for the axion field is satisfied. Notably, the first-order study indicates that this photon cloud exists with no threshold for the coupling constant. The evolution of the EM photon cloud with time and azimuthal angle is obtained analytically while the cross-sectional distribution is solved numerically. Intriguingly, the induced EM field exhibits significantly different symmetries in contrast to the background EM field, which may serve as an indication of the existence of both an axion cloud and axion-photon coupling. Furthermore, in the near horizon region, the induced EM field has some overlap with the photon region as expected.</description>

      <title>Observer Time from Causality in Perturbative Quantum Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is unclear whether an observable notion of time exists in quantum gravity even in principle because spacetime itself fluctuates. We propose a form of observable time in perturbative quantum gravity. First, we define an elapsed proper time in curved space using intersections of worldlines and future light cones. Here, time arises from causality via the dependence on light cones. We then propose that performing the gravitational path integral describes quantum gravity corrections to this notion of proper time at all orders in $G_N$. Using this prescription, we compute the leading quantum gravity corrections to two-point correlation functions of elapsed time. We find that the commutators can be nonzero, showing this notion of time is a quantum operator in quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>The Carrollian Kaleidoscope</title>

Abstract: The Carroll group arises in the vanishing speed of light limit of the Poincar\'{e} group and was initially discarded as just a mathematical curiosity. However, recent developments have proved otherwise. Carroll and conformal Carroll symmetries are now ubiquitous, appearing in diverse physical phenomena starting from condensed matter physics to quantum gravity. This review aims to provide the reader a gateway into this fast-developing field. After an introduction and setting the stage with basics of the symmetry in question, we detail the construction of Carrollian and Carrollian Conformal field theories (CCFT).
  We then focus on applications. By far the most popular of these applications is in the context of the construction of holography in asymptotically flat spacetimes (AFS) in terms of a co-dimension one dual CCFT. We review the early work on AFS$_3$ /CCFT$_2$ before delving into an in-depth analysis for the construction of the dual to 4D AFS.
  Two other important sets of applications are in hydrodynamics and in condensed matter physics, which we discuss in detail. Carroll hydrodynamics is introduced as the $c\to 0$ limit of relativistic hydrodynamics first and then reconstructed from a symmetry based approach. Relations to ultrarelativistic flows and connections to the quark-gluon plasma are discussed with concrete examples of the Bjorken and Gubser flow models. In condensed matter applications, we cover connections to fractons, flat bands, and phase separation in Luttinger liquid models. To conclude, we give very brief outlines of other topics of interest including string theory and black hole horizons.</description>

      <title>Frequency Differences between Clocks on the Earth and the Moon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on general relativity, clock comparisons enable the determination of the gravity potential relative to a stable reference. Lunar surface clocks, owing to the Moon's low-noise conditions, high orbital stability, and broad Earth visibility, are promising reference clocks for global-scale comparisons between terrestrial clocks. Meanwhile, the need for an independent lunar time system-driven by future lunar navigation-requires maintaining links to terrestrial standards. This Letter simulates fractional frequency differences between Earth (E) and Moon (L) clocks by modeling three key time transformations: proper-to-coordinate time for E-clocks and for L-clocks (both linked to the local gravity potential), and the coordinate time relation between Earth and Moon. Signal propagation effects are not addressed. Gravity potential differences impact observations at the 10^-10 level, and the coordinate time ratio at 10^-11. Contributions from static, tidal, and non-tidal potentials, body self-rotation, and different celestial bodies are evaluated.</description>

      <title>Black holes as telescopes: Discovering supermassive binaries through quasi-periodic lensed starlight</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supermassive black hole (SMBH) binary systems are unavoidable outcomes of galaxy mergers. Their dynamics encode information about their formation and growth, the composition of their host galactic nuclei, the evolution of galaxies, and the nature of gravity. Many SMBH binaries with separations pc-kpc have been found, but closer (sub-parsec) binaries remain to be confirmed. Identifying these systems may elucidate how binaries evolve past the ``final parsec'' until gravitational radiation drives them to coalescence. Here we show that SMBH binaries in non-active galactic nuclei can be identified and characterized by the gravitational lensing of individual bright stars, located behind them in the host galaxy. The rotation of `caustics' -- regions where sources are hugely magnified due to the SMBH binary's orbit and inspiral -- leads to Quasi-Periodic Lensing of Starlight (QPLS). The extreme lensing magnification of individual bright stars produces a significant variation in the host galaxies' luminosity; their lightcurve traces the orbit of the SMBH binary and its evolution. QPLS probes the population of sources observable by pulsar timing arrays and space detectors (LISA, TianQin), offering advance warning triggers for merging SMBHs for coincident or follow-up GW detections. SMBH population models predict $1-50\; [190-5,000] \left({n_\star}/{\rm pc}^{-3}\right)$ QPLS binaries with period less than $10\; [40]$ yr with comparable masses and $z&lt;0.3$, where $n_\star$ is the stellar number density. Additionally, stellar and orbital motion will lead to frequent instances of single/double flares caused by SMBHBs with longer periods. This novel signature can be searched for in a wealth of existing and upcoming time-domain photometric data: identifying quasi-periodic variability in galactic lightcurves will reveal an ensemble of binary systems and illuminate outstanding questions around them.</description>

      <title>Bounds on PBH fraction in a stimulated axion/ALP decay scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we show that stimulated decay of axions or axion-like particles (ALP) in black hole superradiance is an efficient way to find and hunt primordial black holes (PBH). When de Broglie's wavelength of the axion/ ALP is comparable or larger than the black hole horizon radius, a large population of them accumulates in the surroundings of the black hole. When these axions or ALPs couple to photons, the bosonic cloud decays into radiation that contributes to the X-ray, visible light, and radio wave background flux that can exceed current observational limits measured at Earth. If the masses are in the interval of $10^{-3}\mathrm{eV}&lt;\mu &lt;1\mathrm{eV}$, to be consistent with current observations of microwave background light, we found that the fraction of primordial black holes should be smaller than $f_{PBH} &lt; 10^{-17}$ for primordial black holes with masses within $10^{-19} M_{\odot}&lt;M_{BH}&lt;10^{-7} M_\odot$.</description>

Abstract: General Relativity (GR) was created in November 1915 and since its creation and up to now this theory has undergone many tests. The first realistic cosmological models were proposed in the works of Friedman, written in the 1920s. For a long time Friedman's cosmological works were actually banned in Soviet Union due to philosophical reasons, since the models where the birth and evolution of the Universe occurs were considered ideologically unacceptable. Due to great achievements in relativity and cosmology and due to increasing interest to these branches of of science in last decades we recall a development of relativistic astrophysics and contribution of Russian researchers in these studies. Since one of the world leaders in physical cosmology A. A. Friedman passed away in September 1925, it is reasonable to outline the main achievements of physical cosmology over the past 100 years. We discuss also observational and theoretical achievements in confirmations of relativistic observational predictions for black holes, including the closest supermassive black hole in our Galactic Center. We outline an evolution of black hole shadow from the purely theoretical concept to observable quantities for supermassive black holes in Sgr A* and M87*.</description>

      <title>GW200208_222617 as an eccentric black-hole binary merger: properties and astrophysical implications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting orbital eccentricity in a stellar-mass black-hole merger would point to a non-isolated formation channel. Eccentric binaries can form in dense stellar environments such as globular clusters or active galactic nuclei, or from triple stellar systems in the Galactic field. However, confidently measuring eccentricity is challenging -- short signals from high-mass eccentric mergers can mimic spin-induced precession, making the two effects hard to disentangle. This degeneracy weakens considerably for longer-duration signals. Here, GW200208_222617 provides a rare opportunity. Originating from a relatively low-mass binary with source-frame chirp mass $\sim20$ M$_\odot$, its gravitational-wave signal spanned $\sim14$ orbital cycles in band, with no indication of data quality issues. Previous analyses for quasi-circular binaries found no evidence for spin precession and, multiple subsequent studies found the data to favour an eccentric merger despite notable technical differences. All in all, we believe GW200208_222617 is the black-hole merger event from GWTC-3 with the least ambiguous detection of eccentricity. We present a critical discussion of properties and astrophysical interpretation of GW200208_222617 as an eccentric black-hole merger using models of field triples, globular clusters, and active galactic nuclei. We find that if GW200208_222617 was indeed eccentric, its origin is consistent with a field triple or globular cluster. Formation in the inner regions of an active galactic nucleus is disfavoured. The outer regions of such a disk remain a viable origin for GW200208_222617; we demonstrate how future detections of eccentric mergers formed in such environments could be powerful tools for constraining the disk geometry.</description>

      <title>Eccentricity evolution of spinning binaries and its dependence on the equation of state of the components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.12522v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the evolution of the eccentricity of an eccentric orbit with spinning components. We develop a prescription to express the evolving eccentricity in terms of reference eccentricity and frequency. For that purpose we considered the spins to be perpendicular to the orbital plane. Using this we found an analytical result for the contribution of spin in eccentricity evolution. As a result, we expressed orbital eccentricity in a series of reference eccentricity and gravitational wave frequency. The prescription developed here can easily be used to find arbitrarily higher-order contributions of reference eccentricity. With this we computed the eccentricity upto $\mathcal{O}(e_0^5)$. This result can be used to construct the waveforms of spinning compact objects in an eccentric orbit. Since, our expression depends on the spin induced quadrupole moments, we also study the impact of component properties on the eccentricity evolution through the quadrupole moment. We find for BNSs the evolution depends on the equation of state very mildly unless the NSs are subsolar mass. For subsolar mass NSs the deviations from BH case is comparatively larger and has equation of state dependence. For binary boson stars the deviations are comparatively larger across the mass values. We argue that it may affect our understanding of formation channels and their corresponding populations. We also argue that this can possibly be used as another tool to constrain exoticness of compact objects in a binary.</description>

      <title>Spin-2 Green's Functions on Kerr in Radiation Gauge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15468v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct retarded and advanced Green's functions for gravitational perturbations in Kerr in an ingoing radiation gauge. Our Green's functions have a frequency domain piece that has previously been obtained by Ori [Phys. Rev. D 67 (2003)] based on the Chrzanowski-Cohen-Kegeles metric reconstruction method. As is well known, this piece by itself is not sufficient to obtain an actual Green's function. We show how to complete it with a piece based on a method by Green et al. [Class. Quant. Grav. 37 (2020)]. The completion piece has a completely explicit form in the time-domain and is supported on pairs of points on the same outgoing principal null geodesic which are in the appropriate causal order. We expect our Green's functions to be useful for gravitational self-force calculations and other perturbation problems on Kerr spacetime.</description>

      <title>Testing Strong Gravitational Lensing Effects of Supermassive Black Holes with String-Inspired Metric: Observational Signatures and EHT Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06501v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze gravitational lensing in the strong field limit for spherically symmetric string-inspired Euler-Heisenberg black holes, characterized by magnetic charge ($q$) and Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton coupling constants ($\alpha, \beta$) from the low-energy limit of heterotic string theory. Our results show that the string coupling has a weak impact on the positions of relativistic images, deflection angles, photon orbit radii, and shadow sizes, making these black holes indistinguishable from the Gibbons-Maeda-Garfinkle-Horowitz-Strominger (GMGHS) black holes with the same mass and charge. Compared to Schwarzschild black holes, the string-inspired Euler-Heisenberg black holes exhibit smaller deflection angles, decreasing with increasing charge. Moreover, the time delay for Sgr A * and M87 * can reach $~11.477$ and $~17349.8$ minutes, respectively, at $q=0.1$ and $\eta=-1$, deviating from Schwarzschild black holes by $~0.0198$ and $~28.9$ minutes, which are not very significant. For Sgr A* and M87*, we determine $\theta_\infty$ range within $(11.52, 26.33)~\mu as$, and $(9.17, 19.78)~\mu as$ respectively, with angular separations $s$ ranging from $(3.29-6.85)~nas$ for Sgr A* and $(2.47-5.15)~nas$ for M87*. EHT bounds on the $\theta_{sh}$ of Sgr A* and M87* within the $1\sigma$ interval bound the $q$ as: for Sgr A* $0.54109\le q \le 0.7796 $ and for M87* $0&lt; q \le 0.29107$, while in both the cases, we did not find any bound on the parameter $\eta$. We show that string-inspired Euler-Heisenberg black holes and EHT observations agree in the finite parameter space. A discussion on the effective metric has been included.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Particle Creation Using an Equal-Time Wigner Formalism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18205v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well known that the expansion of the universe can create particles. However, due to ambiguities when defining particles during the expansion, there are still debates about how to choose vacuum and particle states. To clarify how particles are produced in an expanding universe, we study the creation of real scalar particles in flat FLRW spacetimes by using a recently developed equal-time Wigner formalism. By comparing this quantum kinetic formalism with the standard Bogoliubov approach, we make a natural definition of a particle number in terms of kinetic phase-space functions, which we then compare with common adiabatic particle numbers. With inspiration from flat spacetime QED, we perform numerical calculations and discuss the interpretation of the particle numbers in terms of a hypothetical switch-off in the expansion rate. Finally, we consider how this interpretation is affected by regularization.</description>

      <title>Kerr-Newman outside a rotating de Sitter-type core: A rotating version of the Lemos-Zanchin electrically charged solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01228v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A rotating version of the solution of the Einstein-Maxwell system of equations modeling static electrically charged regular black holes by Lemos and Zanchin [Phys. Rev. D 83, 124005 (2011)] is obtained in the present work. The full rotating geometry consists of the Kerr-Newman exterior geometry outside a rotating de Sitter-type core, with an electrically charged spheroidal shell at the boundary. The properties of the entire rotating solution, such as electromagnetic charge and current distributions, curvature regularity, energy-momentum tensor, and energy conditions, are thoroughly examined, revealing various types of charged rotating objects. We also study in detail the possible electromagnetic fields allowed in the interior region of the spheroidal shell of charge. By assuming that the interior geometry is described by the G\"urses-G\"ursey metric with an arbitrary mass function, we show that no well-behaved electromagnetic field is allowed in the interior region if it is devoid of electromagnetic sources. We also note that, although the overall electric charge of the static solution is preserved, the arbitrariness of the algorithm allows us to propose different electromagnetic fields and charge distributions for the same geometry of the interior region, together with different charge densities on the rotating boundary shell, without changing the exterior Kerr-Newman solution. For a particular choice of the interior electromagnetic fields, we show that it is possible to interpret the rotating de Sitter fluid as being electrically polarized due to the presence of the rotating charged spheroidal shell, despite the absence of net electric charge within the interior region, which is instead concentrated solely on the charged shell, with the interior medium behaving as a perfect conductor with infinite conductivity.</description>

      <title>Broadband limits on stochastic length fluctuations from a pair of table-top interferometers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09175v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Quantum-Enhanced Space-Time (QUEST) experiment consists of a pair of co-located Power Recycled Michelson Interferometers, each designed to have a broadband, shot-noise limited displacement sensitivity of $2\times10^{-19}$ $\mathrm{m/\sqrt{Hz}}$ from 1 to 200 MHz. Here we present the first results of QUEST that set new upper limits on correlated length fluctuations from 13 to 80 MHz, constituting the first broadband constraints for a stochastic gravitational wave background at these frequencies. In a coincident observing run of $10^{4}$ s the averaging of the cross-correlation spectra between the two interferometer signals resulted in a strain sensitivity of $3\times10^{-20}$ $\mathrm{1/\sqrt{Hz}}$ at 40 MHz, making QUEST the most sensitive table-top interferometric system to date.</description>

Abstract: We use Effective Field Theory techniques to derive the quadrupole-quadrupole part of the gravitational wave, obtaining a waveform in agreement with previous results found within the multipolar-post-Minkowskian method. In particular we emphasize the role of radiation-reaction terms, which affect the energy-momentum balance between source and radiation. An in-in effective action is then derived along the same principles and it is shown to provide energy and angular momentum balance equations in agreement with the corresponding fluxes carried at infinity by gravitational radiation.</description>

      <title>Testing black holes with cosmological constant in Einstein-bumblebee gravity through the black hole shadow using EHT data and deflection angle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13661v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study probes spacetime solutions within Einstein-Bumblebee gravity, a modified gravitational framework incorporating spontaneous Lorentz symmetry violation through a vector field mechanism. By introducing a cosmological constant into this model, the research scrutinizes thermodynamic properties of black holes in both anti-de Sitter (AdS) and de Sitter (dS) geometries. The investigation demonstrates how Lorentz-violating parameters alter foundational thermodynamic principles, including revisions to the first law of black hole mechanics and shifts in critical phenomena during phase transitions. Notably, the bumblebee coupling parameter emerges as a critical factor governing horizon structure and thermal emission characteristics, with pronounced deviations from general relativity (GR) predictions observed as this parameter increases. The analysis extends to observational signatures by calculating shadow profiles of these modified black holes. Shadow morphology exhibits dual dependence on the cosmological constant and the bumblebee parameter, presenting measurable discrepancies from classical relativity that could be constrained through Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observational data. Furthermore, using geometric formalisms, the study quantifies light deflection phenomena in weak and strong gravitational regimes. Results reveal that both the cosmological constant and Lorentz-violating parameter induce detectable modifications to lensing angles compared to Schwarzschild or Kerr benchmarks. These deviations, while subtle, underscore the necessity for next-generation astronomical instruments capable of resolving fine-scale spacetime curvature effects.</description>

      <title>Quadratic Mode Couplings in Rotating Black Holes and Their Detectability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14529v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quadratic quasinormal modes encode fundamental properties of black hole spacetimes. They are also one of the key ingredients of nonlinearities of General Relativity in the ringdown stage of binary black hole coalescence. In this work, we classify all possible quadratic coupling channels of quasinormal modes for a generic Kerr black hole, and use a frequency-domain pseudospectral code with hyperboloidal slicing to calculate these couplings. After accounting for all the channels in systems with reflection symmetry, our results become consistent with those extracted from numerical simulations and time-domain fits. This agreement provides a compelling example demonstrating the success of black hole second-order perturbation theory. We also explore potential applications of our calculations in future ringdown data analysis by carrying out a detectability survey for various quadratic modes. We find that a few of them are observationally relevant for third-generation ground-based detectors like Cosmic Explorer, as well as the space-borne detector LISA (Laser Interferometer Space Antenna).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19724v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The path integral of 4D Einstein-Hilbert gravity for the de Sitter-like Universe with fluctuations is investigated, and the transition amplitude from one boundary configuration to another is computed. The gravitational system is described by lapse, scale factor and metric-fluctuation field. Variational consistency demands augmenting the bulk theory with suitable boundary action. A given boundary choice on scale factor is seen to be achievable via an infinite family of covariant boundary actions, each restricting the boundary choices for the fluctuation field. General covariance intimately ties the two boundary choices, which no longer can be chosen independently. For vanishing metric fluctuations at the boundaries, the gauge-fixed gravitational path integral disintegrates into path integral over scale factor and metric-fluctuation field, connected via only lapse integration. While the former is exactly doable, the latter is computed up to one loop, leading to one-loop corrected lapse action. Ultraviolet (UV) divergences are systematically extracted and removed by the addition of suitable counterterms, leading to finite effective action for the lapse. The lapse effective action is then utilized for computing finite transition amplitude. Contributions from virtual gravitons are seen to be secularly growing with Universe size, leading to an infrared divergent transition amplitude. The presence of nonvanishing metric fluctuation at the boundaries implies that the ``no-boundary'' saddles of the theory without metric fluctuations are no longer the saddles of the one-loop corrected action. The corrected saddles have the Universe starting from a nonzero size.</description>

      <title>Static spheres and Aschenbach effect for black holes in massive gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01261v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the trajectories of massive and massless particles in four dimensional static and spherically symmetric black holes in de Rham-Gabadadze-Tolley (dRGT) massive gravity theory via phase-plane analysis and point out several novel features. In particular, we show the existence of a static sphere, a finite radial distance outside the black holes in these theories, where a massive particle can be at rest, as seen by an asymptotic zero angular momentum observer. Topological arguments show that the stable and unstable static spheres, which come in pairs, have opposite charges. In the presence of angular momentum, we first study the behaviour of massless particles and find the presence of stable and unstable photon spheres in both neutral and charged black holes. Subsequently, we study the motion of massive test particles around these black holes, and find one pair of stable and unstable time-like circular orbits (TCOs), such that the stable and unstable TCO's are disconnected in certain regions. Computing the angular velocity $\Omega_{\text{\tiny CO}}$ of the TCOs, measured by a static observer at rest, shows the unusual nature of its monotonic increase with the radius of TCO, near the location of stable photon sphere. This confirms the existence of Aschenbach effect for spherically symmetric black holes in massive gravity, which was only found to exist in rapidly spinning black holes, with the only other exception being the rare example of gravity coupled to quasi-topological electromagnetism.</description>

Abstract: We consider near-horizon collisions between two particles moving freely in the Schwarzschild metric in the region outside the horizon. One of them emerges from a white hole. We scrutiny when such a process can lead to the indefinitely large growth of the energy in the center of mass frame in the point of collision. We also trace how the kinematics of collision manifests itself in preserving the principle of kinematic censorship according to which the energy released in any event of collision cannot be literally infinite. According to this principle, the energy released in any event of collision, must remain finite although it can be made as large as one likes. Also, we find that particle decay near the singularity leads to unbounded release of energy independently of its initial value.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00899v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In light of increasing observational evidence supporting the existence of ultra-compact objects, we adopt the term astrophysical black hole to refer to any object having a huge mass confined within a sufficiently small region of spacetime. This terminology encompasses both the classical black hole solutions predicted by general relativity, as well as alternative compact objects that may not possess an event horizon. We propose models of Astrophysical Black holes (ABHs) without event horizons (EHs), as a more viable explanation for the long-term quenching phenomenon in galaxies. At the same time, the short-term quenching is explained here in terms of an efficient feedback expected in the models of stellar-mass astrophysical black holes (StMABHs). We have calculated the radiative flux from the disk in a general spherically symmetric metric background and used it to contrast the distinctive features of the BHs and ABHs scenarios. We demonstrate the relative ease of wind generation from the accretion disk surrounding an ABH without an event horizon, compared to a BH, and highlight the significant strength of these winds. The nature of the feedbacks arising from accretion onto a BH and an ABH in the `quasar' and `radio' modes are compared and some possible observational signatures of the StMABHs are pointed out.</description>

Abstract: This thesis employs the dynamical systems approach to explore two cosmological models: an anisotropic dark energy scenario in a Bianchi-I background and the Generalized SU(2) Proca (GSU2P) theory in a flat FLRW background. In the first case, a numerical framework is developed to analyze the interaction between a scalar tachyon field and a vector field, identifying parameter regions that allow anisotropic accelerated attractors. The second case examines the viability of GSU2P as a driver of inflation and late-time acceleration. Our analysis reveals fundamental limitations, including the absence of stable attractors and smooth cosmological transitions, ultimately ruling out the model as a complete description of the Universe's expansion. This work highlights the effectiveness of dynamical systems techniques in assessing alternative cosmological scenarios and underscores the need for refined theoretical frameworks aligned with observational constraints.</description>

      <title>Analyzing Deflection Angles and Photon Sphere Dynamics of Magnetically Charged Black Holes in Nonlinear Electrodynamic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04044v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the gravitational lensing properties of magnetically charged black holes within the framework of nonlinear electrodynamics. We derive the deflection angle and examine the influence of the nonlinear electrodynamics parameter $\xi$ on light bending. We initially employ a geometric approach based on the Gauss-Bonnet theorem to analyze the gravitational deflection of null and timelike particles. This method encapsulates the global characteristics of the lensing effect in an elegant manner. In the subsequent part of the work, we explore the impact of nonlinear electromagnetic corrections on the black hole shadow. Using numerical techniques, we study the behavior of the photon sphere and demonstrate that a reduction in the photon sphere radius leads to a correspondingly smaller shadow. We compare these results with those for the Schwarzschild and Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes, highlighting the distinctive features introduced by nonlinear electrodynamics. Furthermore, we examine the strong deflection limit for light trajectories near these black holes, focusing on the roles of both the magnetic charge $Q$ and the nonlinear parameter $\xi$. Our analysis reveals that the combined effects of $Q$ and $\xi$ enhance the strong deflection angle, resulting in a more pronounced lensing effect than that predicted by the classical Reissner-Nordstr\"om solution. These findings suggest that the nonlinear interactions may provide a potential observational signature for identifying NED black holes.</description>

      <title>A Directive for Obtaining Algebraically General Solutions of Einstein Equations Based on the Canonical Killing Tensor Forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00202v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work follows earlier investigations in which the existence of canonical Killing tensor forms and the application of general null tetrad transformations led to a variety of solutions (Petrov types D, III, N) in vacuum spacetimes with a cosmological constant. Among those, a distinct Petrov type D family was identified, characterized by a topological product of two-dimensional constant-curvature spaces and a shear-free, non-diverging, non-geodesic null congruence admitting the second canonical form. This family is derived and presented here in full detail. In addition, an algebraically general solution with a curvature singularity, describing a non-stationary cylindrically symmetric spacetime, also exhibiting a shear-free, non-diverging, and non-geodesic null congruence, is introduced. This solution arises from the same canonical form, developed through the application of Lorentz transformations within the framework of symmetric null tetrads. On this basis, we propose a new directive: by assuming the canonical forms of Killing tensors and implementing Lorentz transformations within the symmetric null tetrad concept, a broader class of algebraically general solutions of Einstein's equations can be derived.</description>

      <title>Bouncing completion of eternal inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01224v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using a purely kinematical argument, the Borde-Guth-Vilenkin (BGV) theorem states that any maximal space-time with average positive expansion is geodesically incomplete, hence past eternal inflation would be necessarily singular. Recently, discussions about the broadness of this theorem have been resurfaced by applying it to new models and/or challenging the space-time maximality hypothesis. In the present work, we use reference frames of non co-moving observers and their kinematical properties in order to inquire into the nature of such possible singular beginnings. Using the spatially flat de Sitter (dS) space-time as a laboratory, this approach allows us to exhaust all possibilities bounded by the BGV theorem in the case of general spatially flat Friedmann-Lema\^{\i}tre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) geometries. We show that either there exists a scalar or parallelly propagated curvature singularity, or the space-time must be past asymptotically dS (with a definite non-zero limit of the Hubble parameter when the scale factor becomes null, hence excluding certain cyclic models) in order to be extensible. We are able to present this local extension without violating the null energy condition, and we show that this extension must contain a bounce. This is a mathematical result based on purely kinematical arguments and intuition. The possible physical realization of such extensions are also discussed. As a side product, we present a new chart that covers all de Sitter space-time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02809v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In light of the latest results from ACT observations we review a class of potentials labeled as fractional attractors, that can originate from Palatini gravity. We show that, for certain choices of the scalar potential $V(\phi)$, the fractional attractors predict both a spectral index $n_s$ and a tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ that fall within the $1\sigma$ region of the combined ACT+Planck data for a wide range of parameters. We also provide a numerical fit for the parameter space of this models in the case of a simple quadratic and quartic fractional potential.</description>

      <title>Regular Black Hole Models in the Transition from Baryonic Matter to Quark Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07561v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate gravitational collapse scenarios involving baryonic matter transitioning into quark-gluon plasma under extreme astrophysical conditions, focusing on their implications for the formation of regular black holes. Standard gravitational collapse models inevitably predict central singularities, highlighting the limitations of classical general relativity in extreme density regimes. By introducing a physically motivated, inhomogeneous transition rate between baryonic and quark matter, we demonstrate analytically and numerically that it is possible to construct regular black hole solutions featuring a nonsingular de Sitter-like core. We further analyze the observable consequences of these models, particularly emphasizing modifications to the black hole shadow radius, which provide direct observational constraints accessible through Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) measurements.</description>

      <title>From Geometry to Observation: Gravitational Waves and the Raychaudhuri Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09562v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) are independent of any particular theory of gravity. The universality of this notion is highlighted by the Raychaudhuri equation (RE), which is independent of any theory of gravity and contains the Ricci tensor $R_{\mu\nu}$ as a key ingredient, thereby connecting spacetime geometry with matter-energy content. Under small metric perturbations, $R_{\mu\nu} \propto \Box h_{\mu\nu}$, where $h_{\mu\nu}$ is the perturbation, indicating that various gravity theories, via their corresponding $R_{\mu\nu}$, produce different gravitational wave equations. In the framework of Einstein's gravity, this leads to the standard wave equation. This study analyzes a modified form, {\it GW-inspired RE}, within the homogeneous and isotropic FLRW background to investigate late-time cosmic acceleration and structure formation. We employ {\it Pantheon+ SNe Ia, Hubble, and BAO} datasets to constrain model parameters through Bayesian inference utilizing NUTS in {\it NumPyro}. A nuisance parameter $\mu_0$ is introduced to address residual systematics. This facilitates a robust estimation of $H_0$, $\Omega_{DE,0}$, and $r_d$, which addresses the resolution of the Hubble tension. We analyze the redshift evolution of the deceleration parameter, $q(z)$, both with and without $\mu_0$, emphasizing its influence on cosmic dynamics. The GW-inspired RE is reformulated as a harmonic oscillator, providing insight into expansion and geodesic focusing. A graphical comparison demonstrates the relationship $d^{GW}_L(z) = d^{EM}_L(z)$ utilizing GWOSC data. Thus, the RE in the context of small perturbation of the metric opens up whole new vistas of {\it observational astronomy.}</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11033v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The goal of this talk is to give an overview of the current status of the development of the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer ground based gravitational wave (GW) detectors and of their foreseen scientific goals. These detectors will be up to a factor 8 more sensitive across the band covered by current detectors, namely LIGO, Virgo and KAGRA, and will extend the accessible frequency band towards the low frequency regime, i.e., below 10 Hz. These improvements will not only enhance the number and quality of GW observations, but will also enable researchers to have access to sources and physical processes which are out of reach for current detectors and explore the possibility of detecting previously unknown GW sources. The improvement in sensitivity in the low frequency regime will also increase the observation time of compact binary coalescence events, strengthening the collaboration with electromagnetic observatories for multimessenger observations of binary neutron star events. In fact, current detectors proved that joint observations of GW events with electromagnetic observatories are not only possible, but they can also give us unprecedented insights on the underlying physics of astrophysical processes.</description>

      <title>Light deflection in unified gravity and measurable deviation from general relativity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14446v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Light does not travel in a perfectly straight line when it passes near massive objects. Instead, it follows the curvature of spacetime as predicted by general relativity. In this work, we apply the gauge theory of unified gravity [Rep. Prog. Phys. 88, 057802 (2025)], formulated as an extension of the Standard Model to include gravity. Using dynamical equations, we calculate gravitational deflection of light near astrophysical objects without need to use a curved metric. We do not use a single free parameter, and the ray optics method for the present problem is extremely accurate. The deflection angles obtained from unified gravity and general relativity are equal in the first power of the gravitational constant, which explains previous experiments. However, the second-order terms reveal a measurable relative difference of $1/15\approx6.7\%$. Therefore, experimentally differentiating between the two theories will become possible in the near future.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22579v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many years of development have gone into producing instruments that meet the required noise performance of the LISA interferometric detection system. Concurrently, software simulations have been used to extensively develop the data analysis libraries to be used in the LISA pipeline, not least among which are the Time Delay Interferometry (TDI) algorithms. To bridge the gap between these two, we are developing a hardware-in-the-loop testbed to apply realistic, time-varying delays to signals traveling between phasemeters. We have shown that the testbed adds a sufficiently low amount of noise across the entire relevant LISA spectrum. We have also injected a realistic gravitational wave signal, generated via the LISA Data Challenge codebase, and successfully extracted it using TDI to remove the obscuring frequency noise of the carrier signal. Future efforts will expand the testbed to create a representative simulation of the entire LISA constellation, with an eye towards its use as a tool to aid in the development of the LISA data analysis pipelines.</description>

Abstract: Recent progress on the black hole information paradox has reproduced the Page curve as required by the unitary evolution of the black hole entanglement entropy. In this Letter, we will argue that, the quantum speed limit on how fast a quantum system can evolve unitarily, when saturating the maximal information transmission bounds (Pendry's bound and Bremermann-Bekenstein bound), will slow down the would-be divergent rate of dynamical black hole entropy decreasing at the very end of the Hawking evaporation, during which the Penrose inequality from cosmic censorship conjecture is exactly saturated. Therefore, an evaporating Schwarzschild black hole is the fastest transmitter of information in nature. Further applying the Bremermann-Bekenstein bound on the de Sitter entanglement entropy exactly reproduces the trans-Planckian censorship conjecture, indicating that the would-be-ended inflating de Sitter space is the fastest receiver of information in nature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07337v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a quantum dynamics framework for curved submanifolds embedded in higher-dimensional spaces. Through rigorous dimensional reduction, we derive the first complete Schr\"{o}dinger and Klein-Gordon equations incorporating non-perturbative geometric interactions-resolving ambiguities in constrained quantization. Crucially, extrinsic curvature of the ambient manifold governs emergent low-dimensional quantum phenomena. Remarkably, this mechanism generates scalar field masses matching Kaluza-Klein spectra while eliminating periodic compactification requirements. Geometric induction concurrently produces Higgs mechanism potentials. Particle masses emerge solely from submanifold embedding geometry, with matter-field couplings encoded in curvature invariants. This enables experimental access to higher-dimensional physics at all energy scales through geometric induction.</description>

      <title>f(R, $G$, T) Gravity: Cosmological Implications and Dynamical System Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07623v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the cosmological implications of a four-dimensional extension of the Gauss-Bonnet $f(G)$ gravity, where $G$ is the Gauss-Bonnet topological invariant, in which the Einstein-Hilbert action is replaced by an arbitrary function $f(R,G,T)$ of G, of the Ricci scalar $R$, and of the trace $T$ of the matter energy-momentum tensor. By construction, the extended Gauss-Bonnet type action involves a non-minimal coupling between matter and geometry. The field equations of the model are obtained by varying the action with respect to the metric. The generalized Friedmann equations, describing the cosmological evolution in the flat Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker geometry, are also presented in their general form. We investigate the cosmological evolution of the Universe in the generalized Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theiry for a specific choice of the Lagrangian density, as given by $f(R,G,T) = \alpha_1 G^{m} + \alpha_2 R^{\beta} - 2\alpha_3 \sqrt{-T},$ where $\alpha_i$ $ i = 1, 2, 3$), $ m $, and $\beta$ are model parameters. First, the theoretical predictions of the model are compared with a set of observational data (Cosmic Chronometers, Type IA Supernovae, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations) via an MCMC analysis, which allows us to obtain constraints on the model parameters. A comparison with the predictions of the $\Lambda$CDM system is also performed. Next, the generalized Friedmann equations are reformulated as a dynamical system, and the properties of its critical points are studied by using the Lyapunov linear stability analysis. This investigation allows for the reconstruction of the Universe's history in this model, from the early inflationary era to the late accelerating phase. The statefinder diagnostic parameters for the model are also considered from the dynamical system perspective.</description>

      <title>Black hole photon ring beyond General Relativity: an integrable parametrization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09882v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, the shape of the photon ring in black holes images has been argued to provide a sharp test of the Kerr hypothesis for future black hole imaging missions. In this work, we confront this proposal to beyond Kerr geometries and investigate the degeneracy in the estimations of the black hole parameters using the circlipse shape proposed by Gralla and Lupsasca. To that end, we consider a model-independent parametrization of the deviations to the Kerr black hole geometry, dubbed Kerr off shell (KOS), which preserves the fundamental symmetry structure of Kerr known as the Killing tower. Besides exhibiting a Killing tensor and thus a Carter-like constant, all the representants of this family also possess a Killing-Yano tensor and are of Petrov type D. The allowed deviations to Kerr, selected by the symmetry, are encoded in two free functions which depend respectively on the radial and polar angle coordinates. Using the symmetries, we provide an analytic study of the radial and polar motion of photon trajectories generating the critical curve, to which the subrings composing the photon ring converge. This allows us to derive a ready-to-use closed formula for the parametric critical curve in term of the free functions parametrizing the deviations to Kerr. Using this result, we confront the circlipse fitting function to four examples of Kerr-like objects and we show that it admits a high degree of degeneracy. At a given inclination, the same circlipse can fit both a Kerr black hole of a given mass and spin $(M,a)$ or a modified rotating black hole with different mass and spin parameters $(M,a)$ and a new parameter $\alpha$. Therefore, future tests of the Kerr hypothesis could be achieved only provided one can measure independently the mass and spin of the black hole to break this degeneracy.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Taiji's Parameter Estimation under Non-Stationarity: a Time-Frequency Domain Framework for Galactic Binaries and Instrumental Noises</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10599v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The data analysis of space-based gravitational wave detectors like Taiji faces significant challenges from non-stationary noise, which compromises the efficacy of traditional frequency-domain analysis. This work proposes a unified framework based on short-time Fourier transform (STFT) to enhance parameter estimation of Galactic binary and characterization of instrumental noise under non-stationarity. Segmenting data into locally stationary intervals, we derive STFT-based models for signals and noises, and implement Bayesian inference via the extended Whittle likelihood. Validated through the analysis of verification Galactic binaries and instrumental noises, our STFT approach outperforms frequency-domain methods by reducing the uncertainty and bias of estimation, successfully recovering low signal-to-noise ratio signals missed by frequency-domain analysis, and mitigating the degeneracy among noise parameters. The framework's robustness against noise drifts and computational efficiency highlight its potential for integration into future global analysis pipelines.</description>

      <title>Complete quasinormal modes of Type-D black holes</title>

Abstract: Quasinormal mode (QNM) spectra of black holes exhibit two open problems [Conf. Proc. C 0405132, 145 (2004); CQG 26, 163001 (2009)]: (i) the discontinuity in highly damped QNMs between Schwarzschild and Kerr solutions as $a \to 0$, and (ii) the unexplained spectral proximity between QNMs and algebraically special (AS) frequencies, particularly the anomalous multiplet splitting for Kerr $\ell=2$, $m \geq 0$ modes. We develop a novel method to compute complete QNM spectra for Type-D black holes, solving both problems and establishing a mathematical framework for boundary value problems of dissipative systems. Using analytic continuation of radial eigenvalue equations, our method eliminates the dependence on auxiliary parameters in the connection formulas for confluent Heun solutions. This breakthrough overcomes the long-standing challenge of calculating QNMs that cross or lie on the negative imaginary axis (NIA). For Schwarzschild and Kerr spacetimes ($0 \leq \hat{n} \leq 41$, $2 \leq \ell \leq 16$), we present complete spectra validated through scattering amplitudes with errors $&lt;10^{-10}$. The results provide definitive solutions to both open problems: (i) The inability of conventional methods to compute QNMs crossing or residing on the NIA leads to apparent discontinuities in Kerr spectra as $a \to 0$. (ii) When a QNM exactly coincides with the AS frequency, an additional QNM (unconventional mode) appears nearby. For the Kerr case with $\ell=2$, overtone sequences from both unconventional and AS modes exhibit precisely $2\ell+1$ branches, without multiplets or supersymmetry breaking at AS frequencies. Our method confirms Leung's conjecture of high-$\ell$ unconventional mode deviations from the NIA through the first $\ell=3$ calculation. Moreover, this paradigm surpasses the state-of-the-art Cook's continued fraction and isomonodromic methods in computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Nonassociative geometry of nonholonomic phase spaces with star R-flux string deformations and (non) symmetric metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.01320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.01320v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We elaborate on nonassociative differential geometry of phase spaces endowed with nonholonomic (non-integrable) distributions and frames, nonlinear and linear connections, symmetric and nonsymmetric metrics, and correspondingly adapted quasi-Hopf algebra structures. The approach is based on the concept of nonassociative star product introduced for describing closed strings moving in a constant R-flux background. Generalized Moyal-Weyl deformations are considered when, for nonassociative and noncommutative terms of star deformations, there are used nonholonomic frames (bases) instead of local partial derivatives. In such modified nonassociative and nonholonomic spacetimes and associated complex/ real phase spaces, the coefficients of geometric and physical objects depend both on base spacetime coordinates and conventional (co) fiber velocity/ momentum variables like in (non) commutative Finsler-Lagrange-Hamilton geometry. For nonassociative and (non) commutative phase spaces modelled as total spaces of (co) tangent bundles on Lorentz manifolds enabled with star products and nonholonomic frames, we consider associated nonlinear connection, N-connection, structures determining conventional horizontal and (co) vertical (for instance, 4+4) splitting of dimensions and N-adapted decompositions of fundamental geometric objects. There are defined and computed in abstract geometric and N-adapted coefficient forms the torsion, curvature and Ricci tensors. We extend certain methods of nonholonomic geometry in order to construct R-flux deformations of vacuum Einstein equations for the case of N-adapted linear connections and symmetric and nonsymmetric metric structures.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes in the Solar System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04518v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: If primordial black holes (PBHs) of asteroidal mass make up the entire dark matter, they could be detectable through their gravitational influence in the solar system. In this work, we study the perturbations that PBHs induce on the orbits of planets. Detailed numerical simulations of the solar system, embedded in a halo of PBHs, are performed. We find that the gravitational effect of the PBHs is dominated by the closest encounter. Using the Earth-Mars distance as an observational probe, we show that the perturbations are smaller than the current measurement uncertainties and thus PBHs are not directly constrained by solar system ephemerides. We estimate that an improvement in the ranging accuracy by an order of magnitude or the extraction of signals well below the noise level is required to detect the gravitational influence of PBHs in the solar system in the foreseeable future.</description>

      <title>Gravitational instantons and the quality problem of the QCD axion: Facts, speculations, and statements in between</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12741v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we critically reanalyze the explicit breaking of the Peccei-Quinn global symmetry -- and the corresponding corrections to the QCD axion potential -- induced by gravity. Specifically, we examine the role of gravitational instantons, which are non-perturbative, finite-action solutions to the Euclidean Einstein equations. These instantons represent topologically nontrivial configurations of spacetime and are analogous to instantons in gauge theory. The amount of symmetry breaking induced by gravitational instantons can be computed in a controlled way within the framework of semi-classical gravity, using 't Hooft operators, in full analogy to the computation of the axion potential arising from QCD small instanton effects. Contrary to previous results in the literature, we find that the effects of gravitational instantons are extremely small and therefore do not give rise to a significant quality problem for the axion solution to the strong CP problem, both within the Standard Model and in beyond-the-Standard-Model scenarios that involve multiple copies of the Standard Model. In conclusion, we argue that, assuming the ultraviolet completion of gravity is weakly coupled, the axion solution to the strong CP problem remains free from any quality issues due to gravity. Along the way, we derive the effective Lagrangian of the QCD axion, including its gravitational coupling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03639v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show how certain types of magnetic asymptotically Anti-de Sitter Euclidean wormholes can catalyze the onset of inflation. These wormholes can be embedded as saddle point solutions of General Relativity coupled to the Standard Model, the inflaton being identified with the Higgs particle. Our scenario is based on the assumption that the quantum effective potential for the Higgs turns negative at a certain high energy window, in line with current measured values for the Higgs and Top quark masses. Within our proposal, we can estimate various parameters and physical quantities of interest, in consistency with current observational bounds.</description>

      <title>Massive graviton dark matter searches with long-baseline atom interferometers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14282v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Atom interferometers offer exceptional sensitivity to ultra-light dark matter (ULDM) by precisely measuring effects on atomic systems. Previous studies have demonstrated their capability to detect scalar and vector ULDM candidates, yet their potential for probing spin-2 ULDM remains unexplored. In this work, we address this gap by investigating the sensitivity of atom interferometers to spin-2 ULDM across several frameworks for massive gravity, including the Lorentz-invariant Fierz-Pauli case and two distinct Lorentz-violating scenarios. We show that coherent oscillations of the spin-2 ULDM field induce measurable phase shifts in atom interferometers through three coupling mechanisms: scalar interactions that modify atomic energy levels, and vector and tensor effects that alter the propagation of both atoms and light. We demonstrate that these multifaceted interactions enable atom interferometers to probe a range of ULDM properties and mass scales that are inaccessible to laser interferometric gravitational wave detectors. Our results establish the potential of atom interferometers to open a new experimental frontier for spin-2 dark matter detection.</description>

      <title>Double Exponents in $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ Cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19324v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently proposed $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ invariant $\alpha$-attractor models have plateau potentials with respect to the inflaton and axion fields. The slope of the potential in the inflaton direction is exponentially suppressed at large values of the inflaton field, but the slope of the potential in the axion direction is double-exponentially suppressed. Therefore, the axion field remains nearly massless and practically does not change during inflation. The inflationary trajectory in such models is stable with respect to quantum fluctuations of the axion field. We show that isocurvature perturbations do not feed into the curvature perturbations during inflation, and discuss the possibility of such transfer at the post-inflationary stage.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02320v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the renormalized expectation value of the stress-energy tensor operator for a quantum scalar field propagating on three-dimensional global anti-de Sitter space-time. The scalar field has general mass and nonminimal coupling to the Ricci scalar curvature, and is subject to Dirichlet, Neumann or Robin boundary conditions at the space-time boundary. We consider both vacuum and thermal states, and explore whether the weak and null energy conditions are satisfied by the quantum stress-energy tensor. We uncover a rather complicated picture: compliance with these two energy conditions depends strongly on the mass and coupling of the scalar field to the curvature, and the boundary conditions applied.</description>

      <title>Exploring the evolution of gravitational-wave emitters with efficient emulation: Constraining the origins of binary black holes using normalising flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03819v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Binary population synthesis simulations allow detailed modelling of gravitational-wave sources from a variety of formation channels. These population models can be compared to the observed catalogue of merging binaries to infer the uncertain astrophysical input parameters describing binary formation and evolution, as well as relative rates between various formation pathways. However, it is computationally infeasible to run population synthesis simulations for all variations of uncertain input physics. We demonstrate the use of normalising flows to emulate population synthesis results and interpolate between astrophysical input parameters. Using current gravitational-wave observations of binary black holes, we use our trained normalising flows to infer branching ratios between multiple formation channels, and simultaneously infer common-envelope efficiency and natal spins across a continuous parameter range. Given our set of formation channel models, we infer the natal spin to be $0.04^{+0.04}_{-0.01}$, and the common-envelope efficiency to be $&gt;3.7$ at 90% credibility, with the majority of underlying mergers coming from the common-envelope channel. Our framework allows us to measure population synthesis inputs where we do not have simulations, and better constrain the astrophysics underlying current gravitational-wave populations.</description>

      <title>Two or three things particle physicists (mis)understand about (pre)heating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19980v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The transition from the end of inflation to a hot, thermal Universe, commonly referred to as (re)heating, is a critical yet often misunderstood phase in early Universe cosmology. This short review aims to provide a comprehensive, conceptually clear, and accessible introduction to the physics of (re)heating, tailored to the particle physics community. We critically examine the standard Boltzmann approach, emphasizing its limitations in capturing the intrinsically non-perturbative and non-linear dynamics that dominate the early stages of energy transfer. These include explosive particle production, inflaton fragmentation, turbulence, and thermalization; phenomena often overlooked in perturbative treatments. We survey a wide range of theoretical tools, from Boltzmann equations to lattice simulations, clarifying when each is applicable and highlighting scenarios where analytic control is still feasible. Special attention is given to model-dependent features such as (pre)heating, the role of fermions, gravitational couplings, and the impact of multifield dynamics. We also discuss exceptional cases, including Starobinsky-like models and instant (pre)heating, where (re)heating proceeds through analytically tractable channels without requiring full non-linear simulations. Ultimately, this review serves both as a practical guide and a cautionary tale, advocating for a more nuanced and physically accurate understanding of this pivotal epoch within the particle physics community.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04477v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Applying the holographic 2-flavor Einstein--Maxwell-dilaton model, the parameters of which are fixed by lattice QCD, we extract the equations of state for hot quark--gluon plasma around the critical point at T=182 MeV, and have corresponding quark star cores constructed. By further adding hadron shells, the mass range of the whole stars spans from 2 to 17 solar masses, with the maximum compactness around 0.22. This result allows them to be black hole mimickers and candidates for gap events. The I--Love--Q--C relations are also analyzed, which show consistency with the neutron star cases when the discontinuity at the quark--hadron interface is not large. Furthermore, we illustrate the full parameter maps of the energy density and pressure as functions of the temperature and chemical potential and discuss the constant thermal conductivity case supposing a heat source inside.</description>

      <title>Observational Insights on DBI K-essence Models Using Machine Learning and Bayesian Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05674v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a comparative observational investigation of two Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) k-essence scalar field models that address late-time cosmic acceleration and dark sector dynamics. The first model involves a non-canonical scalar field representing dark energy alongside standard matter, which is regulated by the Lagrangian, $\mathcal{L} = -\left[f(\phi)\sqrt{1- \frac{2X}{f(\phi)}} - f(\phi) + V(\phi)\right] + \mathcal{L}_m$. The second model combines dark matter and dark energy with $ \mathcal{L} = -V(\phi)\sqrt{1-2X}$. The background evolution is based on modified Friedmann and scalar field equations constrained by Pantheon+ Type Ia supernovae, Hubble parameter data, and BAO (including DESBAO). A hybrid inference methodology is chosen, which includes Bayesian parameter estimation using the NUTS sampler in {\it NumPyro} and a deep-learning emulator employing supervised neural networks to speed up likelihood computations. A nuisance parameter $\mu_0$ is added to reduce systematics and improve the estimate of $H_0$, $r_d$, and $\Omega_{d0}$. The deceleration parameter $q(z)$ exhibits significant differences: Model I yields $q^{\text{Bayes}}_0 = -0.538$, $q^{\text{ML}}_0 = -0.509$, with $z^{\text{Bayes}}_{\text{trans}} = 0.650$, $z^{\text{ML}}_{\text{trans}} = 0.602$, consistent with $\Lambda$CDM, while Model II results in stronger present acceleration ($q^{\text{Bayes}}_0 = -0.831$, $q^{\text{ML}}_0 = -0.780$). Model I performs better statistically and dynamically than Model II, as shown by lower $\chi^2_\nu$, AIC, and BIC values. We additionally use symbolic regression ({\it PySR}) to rebuild analytic forms of $\omega_{\text{eff}}(z)$, which improves interpretability. Model I provides a feasible, statistically preferred alternative to $\Lambda$CDM that addresses the Hubble tension.</description>

Abstract: It is expected that when the string coupling is taken to be sufficiently small, a black hole turns into a bound state of self-gravitating fundamental strings. This state would be described by winding strings wrapping around the Euclidean time circle, known as the Horowitz-Polchinski solution. In this paper, we study such a self-gravitating string configuration in two-dimensional dilaton gravity theories. We first derive an analytic expression of the solution describing a winding string in two-dimensions and investigate in detail the geometry of this solution. Our winding string solution in two dimensions describes the geometry near the surface of the bound state of self-gravitating strings in the large-dimension limit, much like a two-dimensional black hole describes the near horizon geometry of the Schwarzschild black hole in the large-dimension limit. To study quantum effects around self-gravitating strings, we obtain an analytic solution of winding strings in the RST model. In a similar fashion to the Hartle-Hawking vacuum around a black hole, our string solution in the RST model contains the background radiation, whose temperature is the same as that of the winding strings.</description>
