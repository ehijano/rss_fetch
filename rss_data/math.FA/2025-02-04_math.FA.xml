      <title>Intermediate algebras in Archimedean semiprime f-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of bounded quasi-inversion closed semiprime f-algebras and we prove that, if A is such an algebra, then any intermediate algebra in A is an order ideal of A. This extends a recent result by Dominguez who has dealt with the unital case (the problem on C(X)-type spaces has been solved earlier by Dominguez, Gomez-Perez, and Mulero). Our results are illustrated by examples of algebras of continuous functions and algebras of measurable functions.</description>

      <title>Inner and characteristic functions in polydiscs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characteristic functions of linear operators are analytic functions that serve as complete unitary invariants. Such functions, as long as they are built in a natural and canonical manner, provide representations of inner functions on a suitable domain and make significant contributions to the development of various theories in Hilbert function spaces. In this paper, we solve this problem in polydiscs. In particular, we present a concrete description of the characteristic functions of tuples of commuting pure contractions and, consequently, provide a description of inner functions on polydiscs.</description>

      <title>The Hartman-Stampacchia Theorem and the Maximum Displacements of Nonvanishing Continuous Vector-Valued Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims at giving solutions to six interesting interconnected open questions suggested by Professor Biagio Ricceri. The questions focus on the behavior of nonvanishing continuous vector-valued functions in finite-dimensional normed spaces as well as in infinite-dimensional normed spaces. Using the celebrated Hartman-Stampacchia Theorem (1966) on the solution existence of variational inequalities, we establish sharp lower estimates for the maximum displacements of nonvanishing continuous vector-valued functions. Then, combining the obtained results with suitable tools from functional analysis and several novel geometrical constructions, we get the above-mentioned solutions.</description>

      <title>Optimal domain of Volterra operators in Korenblum spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this article is to study the largest domain space $[T,X]$, whenever it exists, of a given continuous linear operator $T\colon X\to X$, where $X\subseteq H(\mathbb{D})$ is a Banach space of analytic functions on the open unit disc $\mathbb{D}\subseteq \mathbb{C}$. That is, $[T,X]\subseteq H(\mathbb{D})$ is the \textit{largest} Banach space of analytic functions containing $X$ to which $T$ has a continuous, linear, $X$-valued extension $T\colon [T,X]\to X$. The class of operators considered consists of generalized Volterra operators $T$ acting in the Korenblum growth Banach spaces $X:=A^{-\gamma}$, for $\gamma&gt;0$. Previous studies dealt with the classical Ces\`aro operator $T:=C$ acting in the Hardy spaces $H^p$, $1\leq p&lt;\infty$, \cite{CR}, \cite{CR1}, in $A^{-\gamma}$, \cite{ABR-R}, and more recently, generalized Volterra operators $T$ acting in $X:=H^p$, \cite{BDNS}.</description>

      <title>Existence of Unconditional Frames Formed By System of Translates in Modulation Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $1\leq p\leq 2$ and let $\Lambda = \{\lambda_n\}_{n\in \mathbb{N}} \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ be an arbitrary subset. We prove that for any $g\in M^p(\mathbb{R})$ with $1\leq p\leq 2$ the system of translates $\{g(x-\lambda_n)\}_{n\in \mathbb{N}}$ is never an unconditional basis for $M^q(\mathbb{R})$ for $p\leq q\leq p'$, where $p'$ is the conjugate exponent of $p.$ Moreover, we will also prove that for any $g\in M^p(\mathbb{R})$ with $1&lt; p\leq 2$ the system of translates $\{g(x-\lambda_n)\}_{n\in \mathbb{N}}$ is never an unconditional frame for $M^p(\mathbb{R}).$ Several results regarding the existence of unconditional frames formed by a system of translates in $M^1(\mathbb{R})$ as well as in $M^p(\mathbb{R})$ with $2&lt;p&lt;\infty$ will be presented as well.</description>

      <title>On subordinated semigroups and Hardy spaces associated to fractional powers of operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $L$ be a positive self-adjoint operator on $L^2(X)$, where $X$ is a $\sigma$-finite metric measure space. When $\alpha \in (0,1)$, the subordinated semigroup $\{\exp(-tL^{\alpha}):t \in \mathbb{R}^+\}$ can be defined on $L^2(X)$ and extended to $L^p(X)$. We prove various results about the semigroup $\{\exp(-tL^{\alpha}):t \in \mathbb{R}^+\}$, under different assumptions on $L$. These include the weak type $(1,1)$ boundedness of the maximal operator $f \mapsto \sup _{t\in \mathbb{R}^+}\exp(-tL^{\alpha})f$ and characterisations of Hardy spaces associated to the operator $L$ by the area integral and vertical square function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assume that B(X) is the algebra of all bounded linear operators on a complex Banach space X, and let W in B(X) is such that cl(W(X)) is not equal to X or W=zI, where z is a complex number and I is the identity operator. We show that if f: B(X) --&gt; B(X) is an additive mapping Lie centralizable at W, then f(A)=kA+h(A) for all A in B(X), where k is a complex number and h:B(X)--&gt; CI is an additive mapping such that h([A,B])=0 for all A,B in B(X) with AB=W.</description>

      <title>On the global solvability of the generalised Navier-Stokes system in critical Besov spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the global solvability of the Navier-Stokes system with fractional Laplacian $(-\Delta)^{\alpha}$ in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ for $n\geq2$, where the convective term has the form $(|u|^{m-1}u)\cdot\nabla u$ for $m\geq1$. By establishing the estimates for the difference $|u_{1}|^{m-1}u_{1}-|u_{2}|^{m-1}u_{2}$ in homogeneous Besov spaces, and employing the maximal regularity property of $(-\Delta)^{\alpha}$ in Lorentz spaces, we prove global existence and uniqueness of the strong solution of the Navier-Stokes in critical Besov spaces for both $m=1$ and $m&gt;1$</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a construction of the Koch snowflake that is not inherently six-way symmetrical, based on iteratively placing similar rhombi. This construction naturally splits the snowflake into four identical self-similar curves, in contrast to the typical decomposition into three Koch curves. Varying the shape of the rhombi creates a continuous family of new fractal curves with rectangular symmetry. We compute the Hausdorff dimension of the generalized curve and show that it attains a maximum at the original Koch snowflake.</description>

      <title>Bound states of 2+1 fermionic trimers on lattice at strong couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the bound states of $2+1$ fermionic trimers on a three-dimensional lattice at strong coupling. Specifically, we analyze the discrete spectrum of the associated three-body discrete Schr\"odinger operator $H_{\gamma,\lambda}(K),$ focusing on energies below the continuum and within its gap. Depending on the quasi-momentum $K,$ we show that if the mass ratio $\gamma&gt;0$ between the identical fermions and the third particle is below a certain threshold, the operator lacks a discrete spectrum below the essential spectrum for sufficiently large coupling $\lambda&gt;0.$ Conversely, if $\gamma$ exceeds this threshold, $H_{\gamma,\lambda}(K)$ admits at least one eigenvalue below the essential spectrum. Similar phenomena are observed in the neighborhood of the two-particle branch of the essential spectrum, which resides within the gap and grows sublinearly as $\lambda\to+\infty.$ For $K=0,$ the mass ratio thresholds are explicitly calculated and it turns out that, for certain intermediate mass ratios and large couplings, bound states emerge within the gap, although ground states are absent.</description>

      <title>PtyGenography: using generative models for regularization of the phase retrieval problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In phase retrieval and similar inverse problems, the stability of solutions across different noise levels is crucial for applications. One approach to promote it is using signal priors in a form of a generative model as a regularization, at the expense of introducing a bias in the reconstruction. In this paper, we explore and compare the reconstruction properties of classical and generative inverse problem formulations. We propose a new unified reconstruction approach that mitigates overfitting to the generative model for varying noise levels.</description>

      <title>A coupling approach to Lipschitz transport maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note, we propose a probabilistic approach to bound the (dimension-free) Lipschitz constant of the Langevin flow map on $\mathbb{R}^d$ introduced by Kim and Milman (2012). As example of application, we construct Lipschitz maps from a uniformly $\log$-concave probability measure to $\log$-Lipschitz perturbations as in Fathi, Mikulincer, Shenfeld (2024). Our proof is based on coupling techniques applied to the stochastic representation of the family of vector fields inducing the transport map. This method is robust enough to relax the uniform convexity to a weak asymptotic convexity condition and to remove the bound on the third derivative of the potential of the source measure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study small eigenvalues of Toeplitz operators on polarized complex projective manifolds. For Toeplitz operators whose symbols are supported on proper subsets, we prove the existence of eigenvalues that decay exponentially with respect to the semiclassical parameter. We moreover, establish a connection between the logarithmic distribution of these eigenvalues and the Mabuchi geodesic between the fixed polarization and the Lebesgue envelope associated with the polarization and the non-zero set of the symbol. As an application of our approach, we also obtain analogous results for Toeplitz matrices.</description>

      <title>Additivity and chain rules for quantum entropies via multi-index Schatten norms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The primary entropic measures for quantum states are additive under the tensor product. In the analysis of quantum information processing tasks, the minimum entropy of a set of states, e.g., the minimum output entropy of a channel, often plays a crucial role. A fundamental question in quantum information and cryptography is whether the minimum output entropy remains additive under the tensor product of channels. Here, we establish a general additivity statement for the optimized sandwiched R\'enyi entropy of quantum channels. For that, we generalize the results of [Devetak, Junge, King, Ruskai, CMP 2006] to multi-index Schatten norms. As an application, we strengthen the additivity statement of [Van Himbeeck and Brown, 2025] thus allowing the analysis of time-adaptive quantum cryptographic protocols. In addition, we establish chain rules for R\'enyi conditional entropies that are similar to the ones used for the generalized entropy accumulation theorem of [Metger, Fawzi, Sutter, Renner, CMP 2024].</description>

      <title>Operator moment dilations as block operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.13873v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{H}$ be a complex Hilbert space and let $\big\{A_{n}\big\}_{n\geq 1}$ be a sequence of bounded linear operators on $\mathcal{H}$. Then a bounded operator $B$ on a Hilbert space $\mathcal{K} \supseteq \mathcal{H}$ is said to be a dilation of this sequence if
  \begin{equation*}
  A_{n} = P_{\mathcal{H}}B^{n}|_{\mathcal{H}} \; \text{for all}\; n\geq 1,
  \end{equation*} where $P_{\mathcal{H}}$ is the projection of $\mathcal{K}$ onto $\mathcal{H}.$ The question of existence of dilation is a generalization of the classical moment problem. We recall necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of self-adjoint, isometric and unitary dilations and present block operator representations for these dilations. For instance, for self-adjoint dilations one gets block tridiagonal representations similar to the classical moment problem.
  Given a positive invertible operator $A$, an operator $T$ is said to be in the $\mathcal{C}_{A}$-class if the sequence $\{A^{-\frac{1}{2}}T^nA^{-\frac{1}{2}}:n\geq 1\}$ admits a unitary dilation. We identify a tractable collection of $\mathcal{C}_A$-class operators for which isometric and unitary dilations can be written down explicitly in block operator form. This includes the well-known $\rho$-dilations for positive scalars. Here the special cases $\rho =1$ and $\rho =2$ correspond to Sch\"{a}ffer representation for contractions and Ando representation for operators with numerical radius not more than one respectively.</description>

      <title>Variational inequalities for the Ornstein--Uhlenbeck semigroup: the higher--dimensional case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00497v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the $\varrho$-th order variation seminorm of a general Ornstein--Uhlenbeck semigroup $\left(\mathcal H_t\right)_{t&gt;0}$ in $\mathbb R^n$, taken with respect to $t$. We prove that this seminorm defines an operator of weak type $(1,1)$ with respect to the invariant measure when $\varrho&gt; 2$. For large $t$, one has an enhanced version of the standard weak-type $(1,1)$ bound. For small $t$, the proof hinges on vector-valued Calder\'on--Zygmund techniques in the local region, and on the fact that the $t$ derivative of the integral kernel of $\mathcal H_t$ in the global region has a bounded number of zeros in $(0,1]$. A counterexample is given for $\varrho= 2$; in fact, we prove that the second order variation seminorm of $\left(\mathcal H_t\right)_{t&gt;0}$, and therefore also the $\varrho$-th order variation seminorm for any $\varrho\in [1,2)$, is not of strong nor weak type $(p,p)$ for any $p \in [1,\infty)$ with respect to the invariant measure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10678v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate when the algebraic numerical range is a $C$-spectral set in a Banach algebra. While providing several counterexamples based on classical ideas as well as combinatorial Banach spaces, we discuss positive results for matrix algebras and provide an absolute constant in the case of complex $2\times2$-matrices with the induced $1$-norm. Furthermore, we discuss positive results for infinite-dimensional Banach algebras, including the Calkin algebra.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22509v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note, we consider a class of composition operators on Lebesgue spaces with variable exponents over metric measure spaces. Taking advantage of the compatibility between the metric-measurable structure and the regularity properties of the variable exponent, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for this class of operators to be bounded and compact, respectively. In addition, we show the usefulness of the variable change to study weak compactness properties in the framework of non-standard spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12341v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The linear operators defined on the Lipschitz projective tensor product of X and E motivate the study of a distinct class of operators acting on the cartesian produc X E. This class, denoted by LipL(X E;F), combines Lipschitz and linear properties, forming an intermediate framework between bilinear operators and two-Lipschitz operators. We establish an identification between this space and L(X E;F), which also links it to the space of bilinear operators B(AE(X) E;F). Furthermore, we extend summability concepts within this category, with a particular focus on integral and dominated (p;q)-summing operators</description>

Abstract: We give an elementary proof of the folklore result that the Agler norm of a function is determined by its norm on commuting tuples of nilpotent matrices. The proof is variation on a standard cone separation argument. The topic is closely related to the Eschmeier-Patton-Putinar formulation of Carath\'eodory-Fej\'er interpolation.</description>

      <title>Global universal approximation of functional input maps on weighted spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.03303v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce so-called functional input neural networks defined on a possibly infinite dimensional weighted space with values also in a possibly infinite dimensional output space. To this end, we use an additive family to map the input weighted space to the hidden layer, on which a non-linear scalar activation function is applied to each neuron, and finally return the output via some linear readouts. Relying on Stone-Weierstrass theorems on weighted spaces, we can prove a global universal approximation result on weighted spaces for continuous functions going beyond the usual approximation on compact sets. This then applies in particular to approximation of (non-anticipative) path space functionals via functional input neural networks. As a further application of the weighted Stone-Weierstrass theorem we prove a global universal approximation result for linear functions of the signature. We also introduce the viewpoint of Gaussian process regression in this setting and emphasize that the reproducing kernel Hilbert space of the signature kernels are Cameron-Martin spaces of certain Gaussian processes. This paves a way towards uncertainty quantification for signature kernel regression.</description>

      <title>State-dependent Delay Differential Equations on $H^1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.04730v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Classically, solution theories for state-dependent delay equations are developed in spaces of continuous or continuously differentiable functions. The former can be technically challenging to apply in as much as suitably Lipschitz continuous extensions of mappings onto the space of continuous functions are required; whereas the latter approach leads to restrictions on the class of initial pre-histories. Here, we establish a solution theory for state-dependent delay equations for arbitrary Lipschitz continuous pre-histories and suitably Lipschitz continuous right-hand sides on the Sobolev space $H^1$. The provided solution theory is independent of previous ones and is based on the contraction mapping principle on exponentially weighted spaces. In particular, initial pre-histories are not required to belong to solution manifolds and the generality of the approach permits the consideration of a large class of functional differential equations even for which the continuity of the right-hand side has constraints on the derivative.</description>

      <title>R\'enyi Resolvability, Noise Stability, and Anti-contractivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07660v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates three closely related topics -- R\'enyi resolvability, noise stability, and anti-contractivity. The R\'enyi resolvability problem refers to approximating a target output distribution of a given channel in the R\'enyi divergence when the input is set to a function of a given uniform random variable. This problem for the R\'enyi parameter in $(0,2]\cup\{\infty\}$ was first studied by the present author and Tan in 2019. In the present paper, we provide a complete solution to this problem for the R\'enyi parameter in the entire range $\mathbb{R}\cup\{\pm\infty\}$. We then connect the R\'enyi resolvability problem to the noise stability problem, by observing that maximizing or minimizing the $q$-stability of a set is equivalent to a variant of the R\'enyi resolvability problem. By such a connection, we provide sharp dimension-free bounds on the $q$-stability. We lastly relate the noise stability problem to the anti-contractivity of a Markov operator (i.e., conditional expectation operator), where the terminology ``anti-contractivity'' introduced by us refers to as the opposite property of the well-known contractivity/hyercontractivity. We derive sharp dimension-free anti-contractivity inequalities. All of the results in this paper are evaluated for binary distributions. Our proofs in this paper are mainly based on the method of types, especially strengthened versions of packing-covering lemmas.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19002v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a simplified (coarse) version of pseudo-differential calculus for operators of order zero on complete Riemannian manifolds. This calculus works for the usual Hormander (1,0) class of operators, as well as for pseudo-differential operators on filtered manifolds. In fact, we develop the coarse PDO calculus on a more general class of manifolds which we call manifolds with a tangent Lie structure. We prove an index theorem for `hypoelliptic' operators where the index is not just an integer, but an element of the K-homology group of the manifold.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01090v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an in-depth analysis of a parametrized version of the resolvent composition, an operation that combines a set-valued operator and a linear operator. We provide new properties and examples, and show that resolvent compositions can be interpreted as parallel compositions of perturbed operators. Additionally, we establish new monotonicity results, even in cases when the initial operator is not monotone. Finally, we derive asymptotic results regarding operator convergence, specifically focusing on graph-convergence and the $\rho$-Hausdorff distance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02199v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose deep Koopman-layered models with learnable parameters in the form of Toeplitz matrices for analyzing the transition of the dynamics of time-series data. The proposed model has both theoretical solidness and flexibility. By virtue of the universal property of Toeplitz matrices and the reproducing property underlying the model, we can show its universality and generalization property. In addition, the flexibility of the proposed model enables the model to fit time-series data coming from nonautonomous dynamical systems. When training the model, we apply Krylov subspace methods for efficient computations. In this sense, the proposed model establishes a new connection between Koopman operators and numerical linear algebraic methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19712v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of dynamic asymptotic dimension growth for actions of discrete groups on compact spaces, and more generally for locally compact \'etale groupoids. Using the work of Bartels, L\"uck, and Reich, we bridge asymptotic dimension growth for countable discrete groups with our notion for their group actions, thereby providing numerous concrete examples. Moreover, we demonstrate that the asymptotic dimension growth for a discrete metric space of bounded geometry is equivalent to the dynamic asymptotic dimension growth for its associated coarse groupoid. Consequently, we deduce that the coarse groupoid with subexponential dynamic asymptotic dimension growth is amenable. More generally, we show that every $\sigma$-compact locally compact Hausdorff \'etale groupoid with compact unit space having dynamic asymptotic dimension growth at most $x^{\alpha}$ $(0&lt;\alpha&lt;1)$ is amenable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07438v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a countable group $A$ with trivial bounded cohomology for all semi-separable coefficients and any group $\Gamma$, we prove that the bounded cohomology of certain restricted verbal wreath products $\Gamma \wr^{_W} A$ vanishes in positive degrees, for all semi-separable coefficients. Examples of such verbal wreath products include the standard restricted wreath product (extending a recent result by Monod for lamplighters groups) as well as verbal wreath products arising from $n$-solvable, $n$-nilpotent and $k$-Burnside ($k = 2,3,4,6$) verbal products. Moreover, we prove that the stable commutator length of any verbal wreath product $\Gamma \wr^{_W} A$ vanishes. As an application, we show that every group of type $F_p$ isometrically embeds into a group of type $F_p$ with vanishing bounded cohomology in degree $n\geq 1$ for all semi-separable coefficients.</description>
