      <title>Bifurcation Analysis of the Driven FitzHugh-Nagumo Oscillator: Prediction and Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bifurcation analysis is applied to the FitzHugh-Nagumo oscillator driven by a sinusoidal source. A numerically generated 2d regime map showing the variety of oscillatory dynamics in the parameter space of source frequency and amplitude agrees well with a map created from analog circuit measurements. Application of the sinusoidal source to the fast variable's first-order differential equation produces an island in the map in which oscillations at the source frequency are unstable and the behavior is dominated by two distinct families of subharmonic limit cycles and by chaos. Previously published maps are portions of the map shown here and are shown to be consistent with it. The more detailed and comprehensive regime map presented here should facilitate the understanding of this foundational system and thereby aid the ongoing research involving more complicated implementations of the Fitzhugh-Nagumo system.</description>

      <title>Convergence Dynamics and Scaling Laws in the Dissipative Relativistic Kicked Rotator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the convergence dynamics of this system near period-doubling bifurcations by combining analytical derivations and large-scale numerical simulations. At the bifurcation threshold ($K = K_c$), the dynamics reduce to a normal form that produces a power-law decay $d(n) \propto n^{-1/2}$, from which the critical exponents $\alpha = 1$, $\beta = -1/2$, and $z = -2$ are derived. These analytical predictions are confirmed numerically and shown to satisfy the homogeneous scaling relation $z = \alpha / \beta$. Linearization of the map near the fixed point yields an exponential relaxation law $d_n = d_0 e^{-n/\tau}$ for $K &lt; K_c$, with $\tau \propto (K_c - K)^{-1}$, leading to the relaxation exponent $\delta = -1$. The remarkable agreement between theory and simulation demonstrates that the dissipative relativistic kicked rotator shares the same universality class as one-dimensional unimodal maps, despite its higher dimensionality and relativistic corrections.</description>

      <title>Collective vibrational resonance and mode selection in nonlinear resonator arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article investigates how a uniform high frequency (HF) drive applied to each site of a weakly-coupled discrete nonlinear resonator array can modulate the onsite natural stiffness and damping and thereby facilitate the active tunability of the nonlinear response and the phonon dispersion relation externally. Starting from a canonical model of parametrically excited \textit{van der Pol-Duffing} chain of oscillators with nearest neighbor coupling, a systematic two-widely separated time scale expansion (\textit{Direct Partition of Motion}) has been employed, in the backdrop of Blekhman's perturbation scheme. This procedure eliminates the fast scale and yields the effective collective dynamics of the array with renormalized stiffness and damping, modified by the high-frequency drive. The resulting dispersion shift controls which normal modes enter the parametric resonance window, allowing highly selective activation of specific bulk modes through external HF tuning. The collective resonant response to the parametric excitation and mode-selection by the HF drive has been analyzed and validated by detailed numerical simulations. The results offer a straightforward, experimentally tractable route to active control of response and channelize energy through selective mode activation in MEMS/NEMS arrays and related resonator platforms.</description>

      <title>Emulating the logistic map with totalistic cellular automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the conditions under which the mean-field formulation of a totalistic cellular automaton can approximate the logistic equation. We obtain that this can be obtained only for infinite-range neighborhood. We then performed simulation of one-dimensional cellular automata, showing that this mean-field approximation is clearly obtained by shuffling the configuration or choosing at random the neighbors, but also rewiring a fraction of links, in the spirit of the small-world mechanism. We show that it is possible to obtain a good approximation of the logistic behavior with a fraction of rewiring link of 50% or more.</description>

      <title>Fisher information, Cr\'amer-Rao complexity and temperature in logistic map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we study the dynamics of the logistic map based on a probabilistic characterization in terms of the invariant density. We analyze the relevant regimes of the dynamics (regular, oscillatory, onset chaotic and fully chaotic) in terms of the Fisher information and the Cr\'amer-Rao (CR) complexity. We found that these informational quantifiers allow to distinguish the dynamical regions of the map, by maximizing the Fisher information in the regular behavior and with the CR complexity exhibiting variations and a maximum near to the Pomeau-Maneville scenario. Fisher information as a function of time is examined to the light of the Frieden's informational interpretation of the Thermodynamics Second Law. Finally, we apply the Equipartition Theorem to propose a definition of temperature for the logistic map, thus providing a macroscopic signature of the dynamics.</description>

      <title>Extreme-Mass-Ratio Inspirals Embedded in Dark Matter Halo II: Chaotic Imprints in Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the imprints of chaos in gravitational waves from extreme-mass-ratio inspirals configuration, where a stellar massive object, confined in a harmonic potential, orbits a supermassive Schwarzschild-like black hole embedded in a Dehnen-type dark matter halo. In our first paper [1], we demonstrated the system's transition from non-chaotic to chaotic dynamics by analyzing Poincar\'e sections, orbital evolution, and Lyapunov exponents across different energies and dark matter halo parameters. In this work, we compute the gravitational waveforms of the small celestial object along different chaotic and non-chaotic orbits by implementing the numerical kludge scheme. We further perform a spectral analysis of the gravitational waveforms from such orbits. In particular, we show that when the system is in a chaotic state, the gravitational wave signals are characterized by broader frequency spectra with finite widths, enhanced amplitude and energy emission rate, distinctly differentiating them from the signals generated during the system's non-chaotic state. Through recurrence analysis we also show that the time series of gravitational waveforms strain carry unique information on the motion of chaotic dynamics, which can be used to distinctly differentiate from non-chaotic to chaotic motion of the source. Furthermore, we discuss the potential detectability of these orbits for upcoming observatories like LISA, TianQin, and Taiji, emphasizing the significant potential for detecting chaotic imprints in gravitational waves to substantially enhance our understanding of chaotic dynamics in black hole physics and the dark matter environments of galactic nuclei.</description>

      <title>Degrees of universality in wave turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Turbulence of weakly interacting waves displays a great deal of universality: independence of the details of the interaction and of the pumping and dissipation scales. Here we study how inverse turbulent cascades (from small to large scales) transition from weak to strong. We find that while one-loop corrections can be dependent on excitation and dissipation scales, new types of universality appear in strong turbulence. We contrast turbulence of spin waves in ferromagnets with turbulent cascades in the Nonlinear Schr\"odinger Equation (NSE) and in an MMT-like model in higher dimensions having a multiplicative interaction vertex: vertex renormalization gives rise to dependence on the pumping (UV scale) in the former but not in the latter. As a result of this spectral nonlocality, spin-wave turbulence stops being weak if one is sufficiently far from the pumping scale, even when the interaction of waves with comparable wavenumbers is weak. We paraphrase this as: nonlocality enhances nonlinearity.
  We then describe strong turbulence in a multi-component version of these models with a large number of components. We argue that strong spin-wave turbulence is similar to turbulence of the focusing NSE, as it realizes a critical-balance state. However, UV nonlocality causes the level of spin-wave turbulence at large scales to decrease with increasing pumping level, culminating in a state that is independent of the level of pumping.</description>

      <title>Cislunar Resonant Transport and Heteroclinic Pathways: From 3:1 to 2:1 to L1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12675v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the dynamical structure of cislunar space beyond geosynchronous orbit is critical for both lunar exploration and for high-Earth-orbiting trajectories. In this study, we investigate the role of mean-motion resonances and their associated heteroclinic connections in enabling natural semi-major axis transport in the Earth-Moon system. Working within the planar circular restricted three-body problem, we compute and analyze families of periodic orbits associated with the interior 4:1, 3:1, and 2:1 lunar resonances. These families exhibit a rich bifurcation structure, including transitions between prograde and retrograde branches and connections through collision orbits. We construct stable and unstable manifolds of the unstable resonant orbits using a perigee-based Poincar\'e map, and identify heteroclinic connections - both between resonant orbits and with lunar $L_1$ libration-point orbits - across a range of Jacobi constant values. Using a new generalized distance metric to quantify the closeness between trajectories, we establish operational times-of-flight for such heteroclinic-type orbit-to-orbit transfers. These connections reveal ballistic, zero-$\Delta v$ pathways that achieve major orbit changes within reasonable times-of-flight, thus defining a network of accessible semi-major axes. Our results provide a new dynamical framework for long-term spacecraft evolution and cislunar mission design, particularly in regimes where lunar gravity strongly perturbs distant circumterrestrial orbits.</description>

      <title>Multi-dimensional chaos I: Classical and quantum mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03007v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of multi-dimensional chaos that applies to processes described by erratic functions of several dynamical variables. We employ this concept in the interpretation of classical and quantum scattering off a pinball system. In the former case it is illustrated by means of two-dimensional plots of the scattering angle and of the number of bounces. We draw similar patterns for the quantum differential cross section for various geometries of the disks. We find that the eigenvalues of the S-matrix are distributed according to the Circular Orthogonal Ensemble (COE) in random matrix theory (RMT), provided the setup be asymmetric and the wave-number be large enough. We then consider the electric potential associated with charges randomly located on a plane as a toy model that generalizes the scattering from a leaky torus. We propose several methods to analyze the spacings between the extrema of this function. We show that these follow a repulsive Gaussian beta-ensemble distribution even for Poisson-distributed positions of the charges. A generalization of the spectral form factor is introduced and determined. We apply these methods to the case of a chaotic S-matrix and of the quantum pinball scattering. The spacings between nearest neighbor extrema points and ratios between adjacent spacings follow a logistic and Beta distributions correspondingly. We conjecture about a potential relation with random tensor theory.</description>

      <title>The Geometric Origin of Time's Arrow: Loschmidt Resolved</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03843v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We resolve Loschmidt's paradox-the 150-year-old contradiction between time-reversible microscopic dynamics and irreversible macroscopic evolution. The resolution requires both quantum mechanics and classical chaos; neither alone suffices. Quantum uncertainty without chaos produces slow, polynomial spreading-not fundamentally irreversible. Classical chaos without quantum uncertainty produces computational intractability-trajectories diverge exponentially, yet the system remains on one trajectory, reversible in principle with sufficient precision. Only together do they produce geometric impossibility: chaos exponentially amplifies irreducible $\hbar$-scale uncertainty until stable manifolds contract below quantum resolution, rendering time-reversed trajectories physically inaccessible despite being mathematically valid and equiprobable. Information is never destroyed-it becomes geometrically inaccessible. The Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy rate is identical in both time directions, preserving microscopic symmetry while explaining macroscopic irreversibility. Three decades of Loschmidt echo experiments confirm perturbation-independent decay consistent with geometric inaccessibility. The framework unifies thermodynamic, quantum, and information-theoretic arrows of time.</description>
