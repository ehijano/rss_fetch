      <title>Lightning-fast adaptive immune receptor similarity search by symmetric deletion lookup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An individual's adaptive immune receptor (AIR) repertoire records immune history due to the exquisite antigen specificity of AIRs. Reading this record requires computational approaches for inferring receptor function from sequence, as the diversity of possible receptor-antigen pairs vastly outstrips experimental knowledge. Identification of AIRs with similar sequence and thus putatively similar function is a common performance bottleneck in these approaches. Here, we benchmark the time complexity of five different algorithmic approaches to radius-based search for Levenshtein neighbors. We show that a symmetric deletion lookup approach, originally proposed for spell-checking, is particularly scalable. We then introduce XTNeighbor, a variant of this algorithm that can be massively parallelized on GPUs. For one million input sequences, XTNeighbor identifies all sequence neighbors that differ by up to two edits in seconds on commodity hardware, orders of magnitude faster than existing approaches. We also demonstrate how symmetric deletion lookup can speed up search with more complex sequence-similarity metrics such as TCRdist. Our contribution is poised to greatly speed up existing analysis pipelines and enable processing of large-scale immunosequencing data without downsampling.</description>

      <title>Anatomically aware simulation of patient-specific glioblastoma xenografts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Patient-derived cells (PDC) mouse xenografts are increasingly important tools in glioblastoma (GBM) research, essential to investigate case-specific growth patterns and treatment responses. Despite the central role of xenograft models in the field, few good simulation models are available to probe the dynamics of tumor growth and to support therapy design. We therefore propose a new framework for the patient-specific simulation of GBM in the mouse brain. Unlike existing methods, our simulations leverage a high-resolution map of the mouse brain anatomy to yield patient-specific results that are in good agreement with experimental observations. To facilitate the fitting of our model to histological data, we use Approximate Bayesian Computation. Because our model uses few parameters, reflecting growth, invasion and niche dependencies, it is well suited for case comparisons and for probing treatment effects. We demonstrate how our model can be used to simulate different treatment by perturbing the different model parameters. We expect in silico replicates of mouse xenograft tumors can improve the assessment of therapeutic outcomes and boost the statistical power of preclinical GBM studies.</description>

      <title>Breast Cancer Classification Using Gradient Boosting Algorithms Focusing on Reducing the False Negative and SHAP for Explainability</title>

Abstract: Cancer is one of the diseases that kill the most women in the world, with breast cancer being responsible for the highest number of cancer cases and consequently deaths. However, it can be prevented by early detection and, consequently, early treatment. Any development for detection or perdition this kind of cancer is important for a better healthy life. Many studies focus on a model with high accuracy in cancer prediction, but sometimes accuracy alone may not always be a reliable metric. This study implies an investigative approach to studying the performance of different machine learning algorithms based on boosting to predict breast cancer focusing on the recall metric. Boosting machine learning algorithms has been proven to be an effective tool for detecting medical diseases. The dataset of the University of California, Irvine (UCI) repository has been utilized to train and test the model classifier that contains their attributes. The main objective of this study is to use state-of-the-art boosting algorithms such as AdaBoost, XGBoost, CatBoost and LightGBM to predict and diagnose breast cancer and to find the most effective metric regarding recall, ROC-AUC, and confusion matrix. Furthermore, our study is the first to use these four boosting algorithms with Optuna, a library for hyperparameter optimization, and the SHAP method to improve the interpretability of our model, which can be used as a support to identify and predict breast cancer. We were able to improve AUC or recall for all the models and reduce the False Negative for AdaBoost and LigthGBM the final AUC were more than 99.41\% for all models.</description>

      <title>Learning Melanocytic Cell Masks from Adjacent Stained Tissue</title>

Abstract: Melanoma is one of the most aggressive forms of skin cancer, causing a large proportion of skin cancer deaths. However, melanoma diagnoses by pathologists shows low interrater reliability. As melanoma is a cancer of the melanocyte, there is a clear need to develop a melanocytic cell segmentation tool that is agnostic to pathologist variability and automates pixel-level annotation. Gigapixel-level pathologist labeling, however, is impractical. Herein, we propose a means to train deep neural networks for melanocytic cell segmentation from hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) stained sections and paired immunohistochemistry (IHC) of adjacent tissue sections, achieving a mean IOU of 0.64 despite imperfect ground-truth labels.</description>

      <title>An Adaptive Computational Intelligence Approach to Personalised Health Assessment and Immune Age Characterisation from Common Haematological Markers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.01444v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a simulated digital model that learns a person's optimal blood health over time. Using a learning adaptive algorithm, our model provides a risk assessment score that compares an individual's chronological age from birth to an estimation of a biological immune age derived from the score. We demonstrate its efficacy against real and synthetic data from medically relevant cases, extreme cases, and empirical blood cell count data from 100K data records in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (CDC NHANES) that spans 13 years. We find that the score is informative when distinguishing healthy individuals from those with diseases, both self-reported and abnormal blood tests manifested, providing an entry-level score for patient triaging. We show that, by analyzing an individual's Full Blood Count (FBC) or Complete Blood Count (CBC), test results over time allows us to calculate an immune age score that correlates with chronological age. The immune age score, derived solely from popular hematological markers, can be widely used to serve purposes of precise healthcare, and predictive medicine.</description>

      <title>A generalisation of the method of regression calibration and comparison with Bayesian and frequentist model averaging methods</title>

Abstract: For many cancer sites low-dose risks are not known and must be extrapolated from those observed in groups exposed at much higher levels of dose. Measurement error can substantially alter the dose-response shape and hence the extrapolated risk. Recently, there has been considerable attention paid to methods of dealing with shared errors, which are particularly important in occupational and environmental settings. In this paper we test Bayesian model averaging (BMA) and frequentist model averaging (FMA) methods, the first of these similar to the so-called Bayesian two-dimensional Monte Carlo (2DMC) method, and both fairly recently proposed, against a very newly proposed modification of the regression calibration method, the extended regression calibration (ERC) method. The quasi-2DMC+BMA method performs well when a linear model is assumed, but poorly when a linear-quadratic model is assumed. FMA performs as well as quasi-2DMC+BMA when a linear model is assumed, and generally much better with a linear-quadratic model, although the coverage probability for the quadratic coefficient is uniformly too high. ERC yields coverage probabilities that are too low when shared and unshared Berkson errors are both large (50%), although otherwise it performs well, and coverage is generally better than the quasi-2DMC+BMA or FMA methods, particularly for the linear-quadratic model. The bias of predicted relative risk at a variety of doses is generally smallest for ERC, and largest for quasi-2DMC+BMA and FMA, with standard regression calibration and Monte Carlo maximum likelihood exhibiting bias in predicted relative risk generally somewhat intermediate between ERC and the other two methods. In general ERC performs best in the scenarios presented, and should be the method of choice in situations where there may be substantial shared error, or suspected curvature in the dose response.</description>
