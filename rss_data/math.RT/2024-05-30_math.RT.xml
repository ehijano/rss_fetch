      <title>Invariant Subspaces of Nilpotent Operators. Level, Mean, and Colevel: The Triangle $\Bbb T(n)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the category $\mathcal S(n)$ of all pairs $X = (U,V)$, where $V$ is a finite-dimensional vector space with a nilpotent operator $T$ with $T^n = 0$, and $U$ is a subspace of $V$ such that $T(U) \subseteq U$. Our main interest in an object $X=(U,V)$ are the three numbers $uX=\dim U$ (for the subspace), $wX=\dim V/U$ (for the factor) and $bX=\dim {\rm Ker} T$ (for the operator). Actually, instead of looking at the reference space $\Bbb R^3$ with the triples $(uX,wX,bX)$, we will focus the attention to the corresponding projective space $\Bbb T(n)$ which contains for a non-zero object $X$ the level-colevel pair {\bf pr}$X = (uX/bX,wX/bX)$ supporting the object $X$.
  We use $\Bbb T(n)$ to visualize part of the categorical structure of $\mathcal S(n)$: The action of the duality $D$ and the square $\tau_n^2$ of the Auslander-Reiten translation are represented on $\Bbb T(n)$ by a reflection and a rotation by $120^\circ$ degrees, respectively. Moreover for $n\geq 6$, each component of the Auslander-Reiten quiver of $\mathcal S(n)$ has support either contained in the center of $\Bbb T(n)$ or with the center as its only accumulation point.
  We show that the only indecomposable objects $X$ in $\mathcal S(n)$ with support having boundary distance smaller than 1 are objects with $bX=1$ which lie on the boundary, whereas any rational vector in $\Bbb T(n)$ with boundary distance at least 2 supports infinitely many indecomposable objects. At present, it is not clear at all what happens for vectors with boundary distance between 1 and 2. The use of $\Bbb T(n)$ provides even in the (quite well-understood) case $n = 6$ some surprises: In particular, we will show that any indecomposable object in $\mathcal S(6)$ lies on one of 12 central lines in $\Bbb T(6)$.
  The paper is essentially self-contained, all prerequisites which are needed are outlined in detail.</description>

      <title>Hecke and Artin monoids and their homomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work was motivated by a striking observation that parabolic projections of Hecke monoids map respect all parabolic elements. We found other classes of homomorphisms of Hecke monoids with the same property and discovered that many of them lift to homomorphisms of covering Artin monoids with a similar property. It turned out that they belong to a much larger class (in fact, a category) of homomorphisms of Artin monoids, most of which appear to be new.</description>

      <title>Ideal Torsion Pairs for Artin Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the module category of an Artin algebra, we generalize the notion of torsion pairs to ideal torsion pairs. Instead of full subcategories of modules, ideals of morphisms of the ambient category are considered. We characterize the functorially finite ideal torsion pairs, which are those fulfilling some nice approximation conditions, first through corresponding functors and then through the notion of ideals determined by objects introduced in this work. As an application of this theory, we generalize preprojective modules, introduce a new homological dimension, the torsion dimension, and establish its connection with the Krull-Gabriel dimension. In particular, it is shown that both dimensions coincide for hereditary Artin algebras.</description>

      <title>Rank functions on \((d+2)\)-angulated categories -- a functorial approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of a rank function on a \((d+2)\)-angulated category \(\CC\) which generalises the notion of a rank function on a triangulated category. Inspired by work of Chuang and Lazarev, for \(d\) an odd positive integer, we prove that there is a bijective correspondence between rank functions defined on objects in \(\CC\) and rank functions defined on morphisms in \(\CC\). Inspired by work of Conde, Gorsky, Marks and Zvonareva, for \(d\) an odd positive integer, we show there is a bijective correspondence between rank functions on \(\proj A\) and additive functions on \(\mod(\proj A)\), where \(\proj A\) is endowed with the Amiot-Lin \((d+2)\)-angulated category structure. This allows us to show that every integral rank function on \(\proj A\) can be decomposed into irreducible rank functions.</description>

      <title>Unitarity of minimal $W$-algebras and their representations II: Ramond sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study unitary Ramond twisted representations of minimal $W$-algebras. We classify all such irreducible highest weight representations with a non-Ramond extremal highest weight (unitarity in the Ramond extremal case, as well as in the untwisted extremal case, remains open). We compute the characters of these representations and deduce from them the denominator identities for all superconformal algebras in the Neveu-Schwarz and Ramond sector. Some of the results rely on conjectures about the properties of the quantum Hamiltonian reduction functor in the Ramond sector.</description>

      <title>Skein modules and character varieties of Seifert manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the Kauffman bracket skein module of a closed Seifert fibered 3-manifold $M$ is finitely generated over $\mathbb Z[A^{\pm 1}]$ if and only if $M$ is irreducible and non-Haken.
  We analyze in detail the character varieties $X(M)$ of such manifolds and show that under mild conditions they are reduced. We compute the Kauffman bracket skein modules for these $3$-manifolds (over $\mathbb Q(A)$) and show that their dimensions coincide with $|X(M)|.$</description>

      <title>A combinatorial interpretation of the Bernstein degree of modules of covariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce sets $\mathcal{R}(\sigma)$ consisting of semistandard tableaux of shape $\sigma$, subject to a certain restriction on the initial column. These $\mathcal{R}(\sigma)$ are generalizations of the rational, symplectic, or orthogonal tableaux (which furnish a weight basis for the irreducible finite-dimensional representations $U_\sigma$ of the classical groups $H = \operatorname{GL}_k$, $\operatorname{Sp}_{2k}$, or $\operatorname{O}_k$, respectively). As our main result, we show that the cardinality of $\mathcal{R}(\sigma)$ gives the Bernstein degree (i.e., multiplicity) of the modules of covariants (of type $U_\sigma$) of each classical group $H$. Via Howe duality, these modules can also be viewed as $(\mathfrak{g},K)$-modules of unitary highest weight representations of a real reductive group $G_{\mathbb{R}}$. Notably, our result using $\mathcal{R}(\sigma)$ is valid regardless of the rank of $H$, whereas the previous result of Nishiyama-Ochiai-Taniguchi (expressing the Bernstein degree in terms of $\dim U_\sigma$) holds only when $k$ is at most the real rank of $G_{\mathbb{R}}$. In effect, as $k$ increases beyond this range, $|\mathcal{R}(\sigma)|$ interpolates between $\dim U_\sigma$ and the dimension of a certain "limiting" $K$-module.</description>

      <title>Derandomized Non-Abelian Homomorphism Testing in Low Soundness Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a randomness-efficient homomorphism test in the low soundness regime for functions, $f: G\to \mathbb{U}_t$, from an arbitrary finite group $G$ to $t\times t$ unitary matrices. We show that if such a function passes a derandomized Blum--Luby--Rubinfeld (BLR) test (using small-bias sets), then (i) it correlates with a function arising from a genuine homomorphism, and (ii) it has a non-trivial Fourier mass on a low-dimensional irreducible representation.
  In the full randomness regime, such a test for matrix-valued functions on finite groups implicitly appears in the works of Gowers and Hatami [Sbornik: Mathematics '17], and Moore and Russell [SIAM Journal on Discrete Mathematics '15]. Thus, our work can be seen as a near-optimal derandomization of their results. Our key technical contribution is a "degree-2 expander mixing lemma'' that shows that Gowers' $\mathrm{U}^2$ norm can be efficiently estimated by restricting it to a small-bias subset. Another corollary is a "derandomized'' version of a useful lemma due to Babai, Nikolov, and Pyber [SODA'08].</description>

      <title>Lattice Models, Hamiltonian Operators, and Symmetric Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.14597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.14597v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give general conditions for the existence of a Hamiltonian operator whose discrete time evolution matches the partition function of certain solvable lattice models. In particular, we examine two classes of lattice models: the classical six-vertex model and a generalized family of $(2n+4)$-vertex models for each positive integer $n$. These models depend on a statistic called charge, and are associated to the quantum group $U_q(\widehat{\mathfrak{gl}}(1|n))$. Our results show a close and unexpected connection between Hamiltonian operators and the Yang-Baxter equation.
  The six-vertex model can be associated with Hamiltonians from classical Fock space, and we show that such a correspondence exists precisely when the Boltzmann weights are free fermionic. This allows us to prove that the free fermionic partition function is always a (skew) supersymmetric Schur function and then use the Berele-Regev formula to correct a result from of Brubaker, Bump, and Friedberg on the free fermionic domain-wall partition function. In this context, the supersymmetric function involution takes us between two lattice models that generalize the vicious walker and osculating walker models.
  Then, we prove a sharp solvability criterion for the six-vertex model with charge that provides the proper analogue of the free fermion condition. Building on results by Brubaker, Buciumas, Bump, and Gustafsson, we show that this criterion exactly dictates when a charged model has a Hamiltonian operator acting on a Drinfeld twist of $q$-Fock space. The resulting partition function is then a (skew) supersymmetric LLT polynomial, and almost all supersymmetric LLT polynomials appear as partition functions of our lattice models. We also prove a Cauchy identity for skew supersymmetric LLT polynomials. (see 2024 author's note below)</description>

      <title>Product-complete tilting complexes and Cohen-Macaulay hearts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.16722v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the cotilting heart associated to a tilting complex $T$ is a locally coherent and locally coperfect Grothendieck category (i.e. an Ind-completion of a small artinian abelian category) if and only if $T$ is product-complete. We then apply this to the specific setting of the derived category of a commutative noetherian ring $R$. If $\dim(R)&lt;\infty$, we show that there is a derived duality $\mathcal{D}^b_{fg}(R) \cong \mathcal{D}^b(\mathcal{B})^{op}$ between $\mathrm{mod} R$ and a noetherian abelian category $\mathcal{B}$ if and only if $R$ is a homomorphic image of a Cohen--Macaulay ring. Along the way, we obtain new insights about t-structures in $\mathcal{D}^b_{fg}(R)$. In the final part, we apply our results to obtain a new characterization of the class of those finite-dimensional Noetherian rings that admit a Gorenstein complex.</description>

      <title>Cluster expansion formulas and perfect matchings for type B and C</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14915v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathbf{P}_{2n+2}$ be the regular polygon with $2n+2$ vertices, and let $\theta$ be the rotation of 180$^\circ$. Fomin and Zelevinsky proved that $\theta$-invariant triangulations of $\mathbf{P}_{2n+2}$ are in bijection with the clusters of cluster algebras of type $B_n$ or $C_n$. Furthermore, cluster variables correspond to the orbits of the action of $\theta$ on the diagonals of $\mathbf{P}_{2n+2}$. In this paper, we associate a labeled modified snake graph $\mathcal{G}_{ab}$ to each $\theta$-orbit $[a,b]$, and we get the cluster variables of type $B_n$ and $C_n$ which correspond to $[a,b]$ as perfect matching Laurent polynomials of $\mathcal{G}_{ab}$. This extends the work of Musiker for cluster algebras of type B and C to every seed.</description>

      <title>SICs and the Triangle Group $(3,3,3)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13400v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The problem of existence of symmetric informationally-complete positive operator-valued measures (SICs for short) in every dimension is known as Zauner's conjecture and remains open to this day. Most of the known SIC examples are constructed as an orbit of the Weyl-Heisenberg group action. It appears that in these cases SICs are invariant under the so-called canonical order-three unitaries, which define automorphisms of the Weyl-Heisenberg group. In this note, we show that those order-three unitaries appear in projective unitary representations of the triangle group $(3,3,3)$. We give a full description of such representations and show how it can be used to obtain results about the structure of canonical order-three unitaries. In particular, we present an alternative way of proving the fact that any canonical order-three unitary is conjugate to Zauner's unitary if the dimension $d&gt;3$ is prime.</description>
