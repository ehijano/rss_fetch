      <title>Deterministic coherence and anti-coherence resonances in two coupled Lorenz oscillators: numerical study versus experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the deterministic coherence and anti-coherence resonance phenomena in two coupled identical chaotic Lorenz oscillators. Both effects are found to occur simultaneously when varying the coupling strength. In particular, the occurrence of deterministic coherence resonance is revealed by analysing time realizations $x(t)$ and $y(t)$ of both oscillators, whereas the anti-coherence resonance is identified when considering oscillations $z(t)$ at the same parameter values. Both resonances are observed when the coupling strength does not exceed a threshold value corresponding to complete synchronization of the interacting chaotic oscillators. In such a case, the coupled oscillators exhibit the hyperchaotic dynamics associated with the on-off intermittency. The highlighted effects are studied in numerical simulations and confirmed in physical experiments, showing an excellent correspondence and disclosing thereby the robustness of the observed phenomena.</description>

      <title>Convective Space-Time Chaos as a Dynamical Model of Deterministic and Stochastic Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, a concept of deterministic and stochastic turbulence has been introduced based on experiments with a boundary layer. A deterministic property means that identical random perturbations at the inlet lead to identical patterns downstream; during this stage, the non-identical, stochastic component grows and eventually dominates the flow further downstream. We argue that these properties can be explained by exploring the concept of convective space-time chaos, where secondary perturbations on top of a chaotic state grow but move away in the laboratory reference frame. We illustrate this with two simple models of convective space-time chaos, one is a partial differential equation describing waves on a film flowing down a plate, and the other is a set of unidirectionally coupled ordinary differential equations. To prove convective space-time chaos, we calculate the profiles of the convective Lyapunov exponent. The repeatability of the turbulent field in different identical experimental runs corresponds to the reliability of stable dynamical systems in response to random forcing. The onset of the stochastic component is quantified with the spatial Lyapunov exponent. We demonstrate how an effective randomization of the field is observed when the driving is quasiperiodic. Furthermore, we discuss space-time duality, which links sensitivity to boundary conditions in the convective space-time chaos to the usual sensitivity to initial conditions in a standard chaotic regime.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Groups of Basins of Attraction in Equivariant Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the symmetry properties of basins of attraction and their boundaries in equivariant dynamical systems. While the symmetry groups of compact attractors are well understood, the corresponding analysis for non-compact basins and their boundaries has remained underdeveloped. We establish a rigorous theoretical framework demonstrating the hierarchical inclusion of a chain of symmetry groups, showing that boundary symmetries can strictly exceed those of attractors and their basins. To determine admissible symmetry groups of basin boundaries, we propose three complementary approaches: (i) thickening transfer, which connects admissibility results from compact attractors to basins; (ii) algebraic constraints, which exploit the closed nature of boundaries to impose structural restrictions; and (iii) connectivity and flow analysis, which analyzes how the system's dynamics permute states. Numerical experiments on the Thomas system confirm these theoretical results, illustrating that cyclic group actions permute basins while preserving their common boundary, whereas central inversion leaves both basins and boundaries invariant. These findings reveal that basin boundaries often exhibit higher symmetry than the attractors they separate, providing new insights into the geometry of multistable systems and suggesting broader applications to physical and biological models where basin structure determines stability and predictability.</description>

      <title>Determining the boundary of dynamical chaos in the generalized Chirikov map via machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the boundary separating regular and chaotic dynamics in the generalized Chirikov map, an extension of the standard map with phase-shifted secondary kicks. Lyapunov maps were computed across the parameter space (K, K{\alpha}, {\tau} ) and used to train a convolutional neural network (ResNet18) for binary classification of dynamical regimes. The model reproduces the known critical parameter for the onset of global chaos in the standard map and identifies two-dimensional boundaries in the generalized map for varying phase shifts {\tau} . The results reveal systematic deformation of the boundary as {\tau} increases, highlighting the sensitivity of the system to phase modulation and demonstrating the ability of machine learning to extract interpretable features of complex Hamiltonian dynamics. This framework allows precise characterization of stability boundaries in nontrivial nonlinear systems.</description>

      <title>Geometric Phase of Stochastic Oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Several definitions of phase have been proposed for stochastic oscillators, among which the mean-return-time phase and the stochastic asymptotic phase have drawn particular attention. Quantitative comparisons between these two definitions have been done in previous studies, but physical interpretations of such a relation are still missing. In this work, we illustrate this relation using the geometric phase, which is an essential concept in both classical and quantum mechanics. We use properties of probability currents and the generalized Doob's h-transform to explain how the geometric phase arises in stochastic oscillators. Such an analogy is also reminiscent of the noise-induced phase shift in oscillatory systems with deterministic perturbation, allowing us to compare the phase responses in deterministic and stochastic oscillators. The resulting framework unifies these distinct phase definitions and reveals that their difference is governed by a geometric drift term analogous to curvature. This interpretation bridges spectral theory, stochastic dynamics, and geometric phase, and provides new insight into how noise reshapes oscillatory behavior. Our results suggest broader applications of geometric-phase concepts to coupled stochastic oscillators and neural models.</description>

      <title>Emergent order from mixed chaos at low temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores a novel connection between a thermodynamic and a dynamical systems perspective on emergent dynamical order. We provide evidence for a conjecture that Hamiltonian systems with mixed chaos spontaneously find regular behavior when minimally coupled to a thermal bath at sufficiently low temperature. Numerical evidence across a diverse set of five dynamical systems supports this conjecture, and allows us to quantify corollaries about the organization timescales and disruption of order at higher temperatures. Balancing the damping-induced phase-space contraction against thermal exploration, we are able to predict the transition temperatures in terms of the relaxation timescales, indicating a novel nonequilibrium fluctuation-dissipation relation, and formally connecting the thermodynamic and dynamical systems views. Our findings suggest that for a wide range of real-world systems, coupling to a cold thermal bath leads to emergence of robust, non-trivial dynamical order, rather than a mere reduction of motion as in equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Stochastic resonance of rotating particles in turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08346v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The chaotic dynamics of small-scale vorticity plays a key role in understanding and controlling turbulence, with direct implications for energy transfer, mixing, and coherent structure evolution. However, measuring or controlling its dynamics remains a major conceptual and experimental challenge due to its transient and chaotic nature. Here we use a combination of experiments, theory and simulations to show that small magnetic particles of different densities, exploring flow regions of distinct vorticity statistics, can act as effective probes for measuring and forcing turbulence at its smallest scale. The interplay between the magnetic torque, from an externally controllable magnetic field, and hydrodynamic stresses, from small-scale turbulent vorticity, reveals an extremely rich phenomenology. Notably, we present the first observation of stochastic resonance for particles in turbulence: turbulent fluctuations, effectively acting as noise, counterintuitively enhance the particle rotational response to external forcing. We identify a pronounced resonant peak in particle rotational phase-lag when the applied magnetic field matches the characteristic intensity of small-scale vortices. Furthermore, we uncover a novel symmetry-breaking mechanism: an oscillating magnetic field with zero-mean angular velocity remarkably induces net particle rotation in turbulence with zero-mean vorticity, as turbulent fluctuations aid the particle in "surfing" the magnetic field. Our findings offer insights into flexible particle manipulation in complex flows and open up a novel magnetic resonance-based approach for measuring vorticity: magnetic particles as probes emit detectable magnetic fields, enabling turbulence quantification even under optically-inaccessible conditions.</description>

      <title>Robust Wave Splitters Based on Scattering Singularities in Complex non-Hermitian Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18775v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have discovered specific conditions for generic scattering systems to act as wave splitters that are robust to any change in relative amplitude or phase of an arbitrary injected waveform. Specifically for complex systems with tunable parameters, these conditions for robust splitting (RS) are abundant, and by using multiple tunable parameters the relative amplitude and phase of the output signals can also be tuned. The splitting property of the systems works for all possible input phase differences and amplitude ratios and does not require a particular coherent input signal. We show experimentally that the fixed splitting ratios and output phases at RS conditions are robust to 100 dB of relative power and 2$\pi$ phase changes of the input waves to a complex non-Hermitian two-port system. We also demonstrate that the splitting power ratio can be tuned by multiple orders of magnitude and the RS conditions can be tuned to any desired frequency with suitable tunable perturbations embedded in the system. Although this phenomenon is realized in two-port systems and involves some degree of attenuation, tunable robust splitting can be achieved between any two ports of multiport systems. These results are general to all wave scattering phenomena (electromagnetic, acoustic, etc.) and hold in generic complex scattering systems.</description>

      <title>Binomial maps: stochastically evolving iterated integer maps for finite populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11974v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many models of population dynamics are formulated as deterministic iterated maps although real populations are stochastic. This is justifiable in the limit of large population sizes, as the stochastic fluctuations are negligible then. However, this also makes it challenging to use the same models for small populations where finite size effects like demographic noise and extinction cannot be ignored. Moreover, adding noise to the equations does not solve this problem as it can only represent the environmental stochasticity. An approach, sometimes used in ecological literature, but surprisingly uncommon in dynamical systems community, is \emph{Binomial maps}, which allow stochastic evolution of deterministic iterated map models of population. Here we present their formulation in a way so as to make their connection to the agent-based models explicit, and demonstrate it for the Logistic and Ricker maps. We also show that the Binomial maps are not completely equivalent to their deterministic counterparts, and derive sufficient conditions under which the equivalence holds. This approach enables rigorous finite-population analysis within familiar map-based models, bridging the deterministic map models and stochastic agent-based models.</description>

      <title>Spectral density characteristics of self-organized structuring in phase-synchronized oscillator ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21012v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The formation of coherent structures in developed turbulence can be described as a self-organization process, where macroscopic order emerges from a chaotic background through nonequilibrium phase transitions. We model this mechanism by simulating an ensemble of locally coupled classical oscillators, representing the oscillatory modes of fluctuation within a turbulent medium, which synchronize via a propagating Kuramoto-like interaction field. Upon synchronization, the system spontaneously self-organizes into dense structures, and we demonstrate a tendency for those structures to form quantized loop currents of phase information. These currents are governed by topological constraints that arise from statistical instabilities within the system's oscillatory interaction network. We show that the power spectral density of these emergent structures exhibits a stable, universal power-law behaviour, with spectral indices characteristic of natural plasma turbulence. These findings suggest that the statistical markers of turbulence can arise from universal principles of topological self-organization, independent of the system's specific physical constraints.</description>
