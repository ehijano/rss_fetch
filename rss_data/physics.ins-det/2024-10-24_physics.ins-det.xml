      <title>Primary scintillation yields induced by $\alpha$ particles in gas mixtures of Argon/CF$_4$ at 9.5 bar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report time and band-resolved scintillation from $\alpha$-particles in Ar/CF$_4$ mixtures at a pressure of 9.5 bar. Our results show that %-level addition of CF$_4$ enables strong wavelength-shifted scintillation in the visible range, with yields at the level of 1000 ph/MeV, scintillation decay times of 9-25 ns and formation times well below 10 ns. Such a performance is a priori sufficient for accurate time-tagging of MeV-particles, without the need to resort to a pure noble gas, thus opening an appealing technological path for next-generation time projection chambers.</description>

      <title>Listening For New Physics With Quantum Acoustics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel application of a qubit-coupled phonon detector to search for new physics, e.g., ultralight dark matter (DM) and high-frequency gravitational waves. The detector, motivated by recent advances in quantum acoustics, is composed of superconducting transmon qubits coupled to high-overtone bulk acoustic resonators ($h$BARs) and operates in the GHz - 10 GHz frequency range. New physics can excite $O(10 \, \mu \text{eV})$ phonons within the $h$BAR, which are then converted to qubit excitations via a transducer. We detail the design, operation, backgrounds, and expected sensitivity of a prototype detector, as well as a next-generation detector optimized for new physics signals. We find that a future detector can complement current haloscope experiments in the search for both dark photon DM and high-frequency gravitational waves. Lastly we comment on such a detector's ability to operate as a $10 \, \mu\text{eV}$ threshold athermal phonon sensor for sub-GeV DM detection.</description>

      <title>CAMO-S: A meteor-tracking spectrograph at the Canadian Automated Meteor Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Canadian Automated Meteor Observatory (CAMO) mirror tracking system has been in operation since 2009 and has, to date, produced more than 20,000 two-station meteor observations at meter-level spatial and 10 ms temporal resolution. In 2020, a spectral tracking camera was added in parallel at one of the CAMO stations. To date, it has recorded the spectra of hundreds of faint meteors. Engineering testing from 2020-2023 resulted in the selection of a 150 lpmm grating and an EMCCD camera to achieve a spectral resolution of about 1 nm/pixel in the final configuration. The CAMO spectral system can resolve spectra from individual meteoroid fragments, record spectra for meteors of +2 peak magnitude to as faint as +4 in parts of the lightcurve and produce relative abundance estimates for Mg, Fe and Na. Our preliminary results also show identification of the H and K lines of CA(II). Meteors with strong iron lines were found to have unusual fragmentation behaviour, involving gross fragmentation rather than continuously shedding small particles. The spectra of individual fragments can be resolved in some cases, showing that these Fe-rich objects do not differ in composition among fragments. Our calibration procedure and hardware configuration are discussed together with preliminary results.</description>

      <title>Applied-Field Magnetoplasmadynamic Thrusters for Deep Space Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in the development of Applied-Field Magnetoplasmadynamic thrusters (AF-MPDTs) present themselves to be an increasingly promising propulsion technology for deep space exploration missions. Various entities, ranging from state-sponsored institutions to privately-owned startups, have developed AF-MPDTs across a wide range of power levels. Current developments in superconducting technologies, namely High-Temperature Superconducting (HTS) coils such as REBCO, have enabled research into the integration of HTS coils into the applied-field module to generate MPD thrust. Developments in space cryocoolers have opened the doors for HTS use within a spaceflight design of an AF-MPDT, where the applied-field module is at 40 K. A TRL of 4-5 has been reached by some AF-MPDT prototypes; venturing beyond this will require higher cooling power space cryocoolers to be developed in parallel and appropriately integrated into the thruster. Moreover, bespoke thermal control is required to maintain the thruster's extreme temperature gradient where the cryocooled HTS are in close proximity to the thruster cathode. More effective space power supply units with higher power generation is a further limitation to reaching TRL 9. This review examines the underlying principles behind AF-MPDT propulsion and the recent global developments in AF-MPDT technology, with an in-depth analysis and critical discussion on the spaceflight components necessary to permit AF-MPDTs to become a widely-adopted spaceflight-ready propulsion technology.</description>

      <title>Characterizing seismic isolation using convolutional neural networks and Wiener filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14806v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate seismic motion propagation through a passively isolated mechanical system, using Wiener filters and convolutional neural networks with time-dilation layers. The goal of this study was to explore the capabilities of neural networks and Wiener filters in characterizing a mechanical system from the measurements. The mechanical system used is a testbed facility for technology development for current and future gravitational wave detectors, "VATIGrav", currently being commissioned at University of Hamburg. It consists of a large vacuum chamber mounted on four active vibration isolators with an optical table inside, mounted on four passive vibration isolators. In this paper we have used seismic data recorded on the ground and on the optical table inside the chamber. The data were divided in 6 hours for training and another 6 hours for validation, focusing on inferring 150-second stretches of time series of table motion from the ground motion in the frequency range from $0.1~\mathrm{Hz}$ to about $50~\mathrm{Hz}$. We compare the performance of a neural network with FTT-based loss function and with Huber loss function to single-input, single-output (SISO) and multiple-input, single-output (MISO) Wiener filters. To be able to compute very large MISO Wiener filters (with 15,000 taps) we have optimized the calculations exploiting block-Toeplitz structure of the matrix in Wiener-Hopf equations. We find that for the given task SISO Wiener filters outperform MISO Wiener filters, mostly due to low coherence between different motion axes. Neural network trained with Huber loss performs slightly worse than Wiener filters. Neural network with FFT-based loss outperforms Wiener filters in some frequency regions, particularly with low amplitudes and reduced coherence, while it tends to slightly underestimate the peaks, where Wiener filters perform better.</description>

      <title>Ultratight confinement of atoms in a Rydberg empowered optical lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.04450v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical lattices serve as fundamental building blocks for atomic quantum technology. However, the scale and resolution of these lattices are diffraction-limited to the light wavelength. In conventional lattices, achieving tight confinement of single sites requires high laser intensity, which unfortunately leads to reduced coherence due to increased scattering. This article presents a novel approach for creating an atomic optical lattice with a sub-wavelength spatial structure. The potential is generated by leveraging the nonlinear optical response of three-level Rydberg-dressed atoms, which allows us to overcome the diffraction limit of the driving fields. The resulting lattice comprises a three-dimensional array of ultra-narrow Lorentzian wells over nanometer scales. These unprecedented scales can now be accessed through a hybrid scheme that combines the dipolar interaction and optical twist of atomic eigenstates. The interaction-induced two-body resonance that forms the trapping potential, only occurs at a peculiar laser intensity, localizing the trap sites to ultra-narrow regions over the standing-wave driving field. The feasibility study shows that single-atom confinement in Lorentzian sites with 3nm width, and 37MHz depth are realizable with available lasers. The development of these ultra-narrow trapping techniques holds great promise for applications such as Rydberg-Fermi gates, atomtronics, quantum walks, Hubbard models, and neutral-atom quantum simulation.</description>

      <title>Anodization-free fabrication process for high-quality cross-type Josephson tunnel junctions based on a Nb/Al-AlO$_x$/Nb trilayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01806v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Josephson tunnel junctions form the basis for various superconducting electronic devices. For this reason, enormous efforts are routinely taken to establish and later on maintain a scalable and reproducible wafer-scale manufacturing process for high-quality Josephson junctions. Here, we present an anodization-free fabrication process for Nb/Al-AlO$_x$/Nb cross-type Josephson junctions that requires only a small number of process steps and that is intrinsically compatible with wafer-scale fabrication. We show that the fabricated junctions are of very high-quality and, compared to other junction types, exhibit not only a significantly reduced capacitance but also an almost rectangular critical current density profile. Our process hence enables the usage of low capacitance Josephson junctions for superconducting electronic devices such as ultra-low noise dc-SQUIDs, microwave SQUID multiplexers based on non-hysteretic rf-SQUIDs and RFSQ circuits.</description>

      <title>Wave-induced biases in ADCP measurements from quasi-Lagrangian platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00763v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Compact autonomous marine vehicles, both surface and submersible, are now commonly used to conduct observations of ocean velocities using Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCPs). However, in the inevitable presence of surface waves, ADCP measurements conducted by these platforms are susceptible to biases stemming from wave-coherent orbital motion and platform tilting. In typical ocean conditions, the magnitude of the bias can reach tens of centimeters per second. This paper presents analytical derivation of the depth-dependent bias formulas in the small-amplitude linear wave approximation. A variety of scenarios are considered, encompassing surface and subsurface platforms, upward- and downward-looking ADCPs, free-drifting and self-propelled vehicles. The bias is shown to be a function of the wave field properties, platform response dynamics, and the ADCP configuration (particularly, orientation and beam angle). In all cases, the wave-induced biases show parametric scaling similar to that of the Stokes drift, albeit with a number of critical nuances. Analytical derivations are validated with a semi-analytical model, which can also be used to estimate the biases for more complex measurement configurations and fully nonlinear waves. Further analysis reveals unexpected fundamental differences between the upward- and downward-looking ADCP configurations, offering insights for experimental design aimed at minimizing and mitigating wave-induced biases in autonomous oceanographic observations.</description>
