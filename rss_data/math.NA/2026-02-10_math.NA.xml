      <title>Stability and Convergence of Modal Approximations in Coupled Thermoelastic Systems: Theory and Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we review and analyze both the theoretical and numerical aspects of strongly and weakly coupled thermoelastic systems. By employing spectral analysis techniques and establishing uniform resolvent estimates, we derive uniform polynomial decay rates for the associated semigroups under a suitable class of boundary conditions. Particular attention is paid to the role of modal approximations in energy analysis. The theoretical results are complemented by numerical experiments that illustrate how the regularity of initial data, smooth versus nonsmooth, affects the observed decay rates, providing deeper insight into the interplay between spectral structure and energy dissipation.</description>

      <title>Scalable Preconditioners for the Pseudo-4D DFN Lithium-ion Battery Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pseudo-4D Doyle-Fuller-Newman (DFN) model enables predictive simulation of lithium-ion batteries with three-dimensional electrode architectures and particle-scale diffusion, extending the standard pseudo-2D (P2D) formulation to fully resolve cell geometry. This leads to large, nonlinear systems with strong coupling across multiple physical scales, posing significant challenges for scalable numerical solution. We introduce block-structured preconditioning strategies that exploit the mathematical properties of the coupled system, employing multigrid techniques for electrode-level operators and localized solvers for particle-scale diffusion. Comprehensive scalability studies are performed across a range of geometries, including homogeneous and heterogeneous cubic cells, flattened jelly-roll configurations, and triply periodic minimal surface electrodes, to assess solver robustness and parallel scalability. The proposed methods consistently deliver efficient convergence and enable the solution of battery models with hundreds of millions of degrees of freedom on large-scale parallel hardware.</description>

      <title>A Unifying Framework for Doubling Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existing doubling algorithms have been proven efficient for several important nonlinear matrix equations arising from real-world engineering applications. In a nutshell, the algorithms iteratively compute a basis matrix, in one of the two particular forms, for the eigenspace of some matrix pencil associated with its eigenvalues in certain complex region such as the left-half plane or the open unit disk, and their success critically depends on that the interested eigenspace do have a basis matrix taking one of the two particular forms. However, that requirement in general cannot be guaranteed. In this paper, a new doubling algorithm, called the $Q$-doubling algorithm, is proposed. It includes the existing doubling algorithms as special cases and does not require that the basis matrix takes one of the particular forms. An application of the $Q$-doubling algorithm to solve eigenvalue problems is investigated with numerical experiments that demonstrate its superior robustness to the existing doubling algorithms.</description>

      <title>Multifidelity sensor placement in Bayesian state estimation problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study optimal sensor placement for Bayesian state estimation problems in which sensors vary in cost and fidelity, resulting in a budget-constrained multifidelity optimal experimental design problem. Sensor placement optimality is quantified using the D-optimality criterion, and the problem is approached by leveraging connections with the column subset selection problem in numerical linear algebra. We implement a greedy approach for this problem, whose computational efficiency we improve using rank-one updates via the Sherman-Morrison formula. We additionally present an iterative algorithm that, for each feasible allocation of sensors, greedily optimizes over each sensor fidelity subject to previous sensor choices, repeating this process until a termination criterion is satisfied. To the best of our knowledge, these algorithms are novel in the context of cost constrained multifidelity sensor placement. We evaluate our methods on several benchmark state estimation problems, including reconstructions of sea surface temperature and flow around a cylinder, and empirically demonstrate improved performance over random designs.</description>

      <title>Convergence of a Low-Rank Strang Splitting for Stiff Matrix Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and analyze a second-order Strang splitting method for a class of stiff matrix differential equations with Sylvester-type structure. The method splits the dynamics into a stiff linear part, treated exactly via matrix exponentials, and a nonlinear part, integrated by a second-order dynamical low-rank (DLR) scheme. Our main contribution is a rigorous convergence proof showing that, under suitable assumptions, the overall scheme achieves second-order accuracy. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical results and demonstrate the robustness and efficiency of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Learned Finite Element-based Regularization of the Inverse Problem in Electrocardiographic Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrocardiographic imaging (ECGI) seeks to reconstruct cardiac electrical activity from body-surface potentials noninvasively. However, the associated inverse problem is severely ill-posed and requires robust regularization. While classical approaches primarily employ spatial smoothing, the temporal structure of cardiac dynamics remains underexploited despite its physiological relevance. We introduce a space-time regularization framework that couples spatial regularization with a learned temporal Fields-of-Experts (FoE) prior to capture complex spatiotemporal activation patterns. We derive a finite element discretization on unstructured cardiac surface meshes, prove Mosco-convergence, and develop a scalable optimization algorithm capable of handling the FoE term. Numerical experiments on synthetic epicardial data demonstrate improved denoising and inverse reconstructions compared to handcrafted spatiotemporal methods, yielding solutions that are both robust to noise and physiologically plausible.</description>

      <title>Stability and error analysis of fully discrete original energy-dissipative and length-preserving scheme for the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation, regarded as a gradient flow with manifold constraint, is the fundamental model describing magnetization dynamics in ferromagnetic materials. It is well known that the normalized tangent plane method is able to simultaneously achieve the non-convex manifold constraint and original energy dissipation. However, the associated computational cost of this numerical approach is exceedingly high. By contrast, the projection method is more straightforward to implement, while it often compromises the inherent energy dissipative property of the continuous model, and the error analysis turns out to be even more challenging. In this work, we first construct a linear and fully discrete finite difference numerical scheme, based on the projection method for the LLG equation, which is capable of simultaneously preserving the non-convex manifold constraint \(|\mathbf{m}| = 1\) and an unconditional original energy dissipation. In the error analysis, the classical theoretical technique becomes ineffective, due to the presence of the nonlinear Laplacian term, which in turn poses a significant challenge. To overcome this subtle difficulty, we carefully rewrite the numerical method in an equivalent weak form, in which a point-wise length preserving feature of the numerical solution plays an essential role. As a result of these estimates in the reformulated weak form, an optimal convergence rate could be theoretically established. In our knowledge, this numerical method is the first linear algorithm that preserves the following combined theoretical properties: (i) point-wise length preservation, (ii) unconditional original energy dissipation, (iii) a theoretical justification of convergence analysis and optimal rate error estimate.</description>

      <title>An Efficient and Robust Projection Enhanced Interpolation Based Tensor Train Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The tensor-train (TT) format is a data-sparse tensor representation commonly used in high dimensional data approximations. In order to represent data with interpretability in data science, researchers develop data-centric skeletonized low rank approximations. However, these methods might still suffer from accuracy degeneracy, nonrobustness, and high computation costs. In this paper, given existing skeletonized TT approximations, we propose a family of projection enhanced interpolation based algorithms to further improve approximation accuracy while keeping low computational complexity. We do this as a postprocessing step to existing interpolative decompositions, via oversampling data not in skeletons to include more information and selecting subsets of pivots for faster projections. We illustrate the performances of our proposed methods with extensive numerical experiments. These include up to 10D synthetic datasets such as tensors generated from kernel functions, and tensors constructed from Maxwellian distribution functions that arise in kinetic theory. Our results demonstrate significant accuracy improvement over original skeletonized TT approximations, while using limited amount of computational resources.</description>

      <title>High-Resolution Solvers for 3D Helmholtz Scattering Problems Using PFFT and Eigenvector-Based Preconditioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an efficient Krylov subspace iterative solver for the three-dimensional (3D) Helmholtz equation with non-constant coefficients and absorbing boundary conditions, combining high-resolution compact schemes with low-order preconditioners. To mitigate numerical dispersion and reduce pollution error, we employ fourth- and sixth-order compact finite-difference schemes, thereby significantly softening the strict points-per-wavelength requirement. The resulting large, ill-conditioned linear systems are solved using a preconditioned GMRES method. The key innovation lies in the construction of the preconditioner: we introduce two highly efficient direct solvers - one based on a low-dimensional eigenvector transformation (EigT) and another on a partial Fast Fourier Transform (PFFT) algorithm - both derived from a lower-order approximation of the original problem that incorporates the absorbing boundary conditions. The motivation and efficacy of this lower-order preconditioning strategy for high-resolution schemes are analyzed through model problems, providing insight into the convergence rate. The theoretical analysis is validated by a comprehensive set of numerical experiments, demonstrating the method's performance for realistic problem sizes and parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.07718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an algorithm to construct a certified approximation of a surface by generalizing the Krawczyk test. The Krawczyk test is based on interval arithmetic, and confirms the existence and uniqueness of a solution to a square system of analytic equations in a region. By generalizing this test, we extend the reach of this technique to non-square systems and higher-dimensional varieties. We provide a prototype implementation and illustrate its use on several examples.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Discovery of Sign-Indefinite Artificial Viscosity for Linear Convection -- A Space-Time Reconvolution Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial viscosity is traditionally interpreted as a positive, spatially acting regularization introduced to stabilize numerical discretizations of hyperbolic conservation laws. In this work, we report a data-driven discovery that motivates a reinterpretation of this classical view. We consider the linear convection equation discretized using an unstable FTCS scheme augmented with a learnable artificial viscosity. Using automatic differentiation and gradient-based optimization, the viscosity field is inferred by minimizing the error with respect to the exact solution, without imposing any sign constraints. The optimized viscosity consistently becomes locally negative near extrema, while the numerical solution remains stable and nearly exact. This behavior is not readily explained within classical modified equation analysis and Lax-Wendroff-type arguments, which predict a strictly positive effective viscosity. To resolve this apparent contradiction, we reinterpret artificial viscosity as a space-time closure that compensates unresolved truncation errors while enforcing entropy stability through global dissipation balance rather than pointwise positivity. Within this framework, the Lax-Wendroff scheme corresponds to a degenerate projection in which temporal truncation errors are eliminated and reintroduced as spatial diffusion. We show that entropy stability constrains the integrated dissipation budget rather than the pointwise sign of spatial viscosity. As a result, locally negative viscosity naturally emerges as a numerical reconvolution operator that compensates for dispersive truncation errors. Negative viscosity is therefore not an unphysical diffusion process, but a scheme- and grid-dependent correction mechanism.</description>

      <title>Fast Jacobi Spectral Methods and Closure Approximations for the Homogeneous FENE Model of Complex Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Finitely Extensible Nonlinear Elastic (FENE) dumbbell model is a widely used mathematical model for complex fluids. Direct simulation of the FENE Fokker--Planck equation is computationally challenging due to high dimensionality and singularity of its potential. In this paper, we develop two fast Jacobi-Spherical Harmonic spectral methods for the spatially homogeneous FENE Fokker--Planck equation. These methods effectively resolve the singularity near the boundary by combining properly designed Jacobi polynomials with a weighted variational formulation. A semi-implicit backward differentiation formula of second-order (BDF2) is employed for time marching, and its energy stability is rigorously proved. The resulting linear algebraic system possesses a sparse structure and can be efficiently solved. Numerical results verify the spectral convergence and efficiency of the direct spectral solvers, establishing them as a reliable tool for generating reference solutions for challenging benchmark problems. Furthermore, to achieve an optimal trade-off between accuracy and efficiency, we compare several closure approximation models, including the industry workhorse Peterlin approximation (FENE-P), the quasi-equilibrium approximation (FENE-QE), and a novel neural network implementation for FENE-QE proposed in this paper (FENE-QE-NN). Numerical experiments in extensional and shear flows demonstrate the superior accuracy and efficiency of the proposed methods compared to traditional approaches.</description>

      <title>Data Completion for Electrical Impedance Tomography by Conditional Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data scarcity is a fundamental barrier in Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT), as undersampled Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DtN) measurements can substantially degrade conductivity reconstructions. We address this bottleneck by completing partially observed DtN measurements using a diffusion based generative model. Specifically, we train a conditional diffusion model to learn the distribution of DtN data and to infer full measurement vectors given partial observations. Our approach supports flexible source receiver configurations and can be used as a plug in preprocessing step with off the shelf EIT solvers. Under mild assumptions on the polygon conductivity class, we derive nonasymptotic end to end bounds on the distributional discrepancy between the completed and ground truth DtN measurements. In numerical experiments, we couple the proposed diffusion completion procedure with a deep learning based inverse solver and compare its performance against the same solver with full measurement data. The results show that diffusion completion enables reconstructions comparable to the full data baseline while using only 1% of the measurements. In contrast, standard baselines such as matrix completion require 30% of the measurements to achieve similar reconstruction quality.</description>

      <title>Field conserving adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) scheme on massively parallel adaptive octree meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) is widely used to efficiently resolve localized features in time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs) by selectively refining and coarsening the mesh. However, in long-horizon simulations, repeated intergrid interpolations can introduce systematic drift in conserved quantities, especially for variational discretizations with continuous basis functions. While interpolation from parent-to-child during refinement in continuous Galerkin (CG) discretizations is naturally conservative, the standard injection-based child-to-parent coarsening interpolation is generally not.
  We propose a simple, scalable field-conserving coarsening operator for parallel, octree-based AMR. The method enforces discrete global conservation during coarsening by first computing field conserving coarse-element values at quadrature points and then recovering coarse nodal degrees of freedom via an $L^2$ projection (mass-matrix solve), which simultaneously controls the $L_2$ error. We evaluate the approach on mass-conserving phase-field models, including the Cahn--Hilliard and Cahn--Hilliard--Navier--Stokes systems, and compare against injection in terms of conservation error, solution quality, and computational cost.</description>

      <title>Deep Energy Method with Large Language Model assistance: an open-source Streamlit-based platform for solving variational PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) in energy form, also known as the deep energy method (DEM), offer advantages over strong-form PINNs such as lower-order derivatives and fewer hyperparameters, yet dedicated and user-friendly software for energy-form PINNs remains scarce. To address this gap, we present \textbf{LM-DEM} (Large-Model-assisted Deep Energy Method), an open-source, Streamlit-based platform for solving variational partial differential equations (PDEs) in computational mechanics. LM-DEM integrates large language models (LLMs) for geometry modeling: users can generate Gmsh-compatible geometries directly from natural language descriptions or images, significantly reducing the burden of traditional geometry preprocessing. The solution process is driven by the deep energy method, while finite element solutions can be obtained in parallel. The framework supports built-in problems including Poisson, screened Poisson, linear elasticity, and hyperelasticity in two and three dimensions, as well as user-defined energy functionals analogous to the \texttt{UMAT} interface in Abaqus. The source code is available at https://github.com/yizheng-wang/LMDEM, and a web-based version is accessible at https://ai4m.llmdem.com. LM-DEM aims to lower the barrier for practitioners and beginners to adopt energy-form PINNs for variational PDE problems.</description>

      <title>Inhomogeneous Priors for Bayesian Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many inverse problems arising in engineering and applied sciences involve unknown quantities with pronounced spatial inhomogeneity, such as localized defects or spatially varying material properties, making reliable uncertainty quantification particularly challenging. While Bayesian inverse problem methodologies provide a principled framework for assessing reconstruction reliability, commonly used Gaussian priors, such as Whittle-Matern models, impose globally homogeneous assumptions that limit their ability to capture such structure in large-scale settings. We introduce a new class of inhomogeneous priors defined via convolution with white noise, yielding nonstationary Whittle-Matern-type random fields with a rigorous mathematical construction. These priors fit naturally within existing Bayesian well-posedness theory and enable efficient sampling by reducing prior realizations to the solution of a pseudo-differential equation, for which we develop numerical schemes with quantified approximation error. Numerical experiments in one-dimensional denoising and two-dimensional limited-angle X-ray tomography demonstrate significant improvements in reconstruction quality and uncertainty quantification, particularly in data-limited scenarios.</description>

      <title>Characteristic Sweeps and Source Iteration for Charged-Particle Transport with Continuous Slowing-Down and Angular Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a semi-analytic deterministic framework for charged-particle transport with continuous slowing-down in energy and angular scattering. Directed transport and energy advection are treated by method-of-characteristics integration, yielding explicit directional sweeps defined by characteristic maps and inflow data. Scattering is incorporated through a fixed-point (source-iteration) scheme in which the angular gain is lagged, yielding a sequence of decoupled directional solves coupled only through angular sums.
  The method is formulated variationally in a transport graph space adapted to the charged particle drift. Under standard monotonicity and positivity assumptions on the stopping power and boundedness assumptions on cross sections, we establish coercivity and boundedness of the transport bilinear form, prove contraction of the source iteration under a subcriticality condition and derive a rigorous a posteriori bound for the iteration error, providing an efficient stopping criterion.
  We further analyse an elastic discrete-ordinates approximation, including conservation properties and a decomposition of angular error into quadrature, cone truncation and finite iteration effects. Numerical experiments for proton transport validate the characteristic sweep against an exact ballistic benchmark and demonstrate the predicted fixed-point convergence under forward-peaked scattering. Carbon-ion simulations with tabulated stopping powers and a reduced multi-species coupling illustrate Bragg peak localisation and distal tail formation driven by secondary charged fragments.</description>

      <title>Optimality Conditions for Rational Minimax Approximations: Bridging Ruttan's Criteria to Dual-Based Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a theoretical discussion on Ruttan's optimality conditions for rational minimax approximations in discrete and continuum settings, integrating analytical foundations with computational practice. We develop extended second-order optimality criteria for the discrete case, demonstrating that Ruttan's sufficient condition for global solutions [Ruttan, {Constr. Approx.}, 1 (1985), 287-296] becomes necessary when the number of extreme points is minimal. Our analysis further uncovers fundamental relationships between these conditions and the dual-based {d-Lawson} method [L.-H. Zhang et al., {Math. Comp.}, 94 (2025), 2457-2494], proving that strong duality in {d-Lawson} ensures simultaneous satisfaction of both Ruttan's and Kolmogorov's criteria. Additionally, we show that minimax approximants on a continuum satisfying Ruttan's sufficient global optimality can be captured through discrete minimax approximations at properly chosen boundary points, thereby enabling efficient computation of minimax approximants on a continuum using discrete methods.</description>

      <title>A quantum-inspired multi-level tensor-train monolithic space-time method for nonlinear PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a multilevel tensor-train (TT) framework for solving nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) in a global space-time formulation. While space-time TT solvers have demonstrated significant potential for compressed high-dimensional simulations, the literature contains few systematic comparisons with classical time-stepping methods, limited error convergence analyses, and little quantitative assessment of the impact of TT rounding on numerical accuracy. Likewise, existing studies fail to demonstrate performance across a diverse set of PDEs and parameter ranges. In practice, monolithic Newton iterations may stagnate or fail to converge in strongly nonlinear, stiff, or advection-dominated regimes, where poor initial guesses and severely ill-conditioned space-time Jacobians hinder robust convergence. We overcome this limitation by introducing a coarse-to-fine multilevel strategy fully embedded within the TT format. Each level refines both spatial and temporal resolutions while transferring the TT solution through low-rank prolongation operators, providing robust initializations for successive Newton solves. Residuals, Jacobians, and transfer operators are represented directly in TT and solved with the adaptive-rank DMRG algorithm. Numerical experiments for a selection of nonlinear PDEs including Fisher-KPP, viscous Burgers, sine-Gordon, and KdV cover diffusive, convective, and dispersive dynamics, demonstrating that the multilevel TT approach consistently converges where single-level space-time Newton iterations fail. In dynamic, advection-dominated (nonlinear) scenarios, multilevel TT surpasses single-level TT, achieving high accuracy with significantly reduced computational cost, specifically when high-fidelity numerical simulation is required.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.07990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Error estimates are proved for finite element approximations to the solution of second-order hyperbolic partial differential equations with coefficients varying in both space and time. Optimal rates of convergence in the energy norm are proved for the semi-discrete Galerkin finite element solution by introducing a time-dependent Ritz-like projection. Numerical experiments corroborate the rates of convergence and illustrate the localized wave field enhancement in a chain of time-modulated subwavelength resonators.</description>

      <title>Invariant-domain preserving IMEX schemes for the nonequilibrium Gray Radiation-Hydrodynamics equations Part I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we introduce an implicit-explicit invariant-domain
  preserving approximation of the nonequilibrium gray
  radiation-hydrodynamics equations. A time and space approximation
  of the system is proposed using a novel split of the equations
  composed of three elementary subsystems, two hyperbolic and one
  parabolic. The approximation thus realized is proved to be
  consistent, conservative, invariant-domain preserving, and
  first-order accurate. The proposed method is a stepping stone for
  achieving higher-order accuracy in space and time in the forthcoming
  second part of this work. The method is numerically illustrated and
  shown to converge as advertised. This paper is dedicated to the memory
  of Peter Lax.</description>

      <title>A numerical study for tempered time-fractional advection-dispersion equation on graded meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a second-order accurate time-stepping scheme for the tempered time-fractional advection-dispersion equation based on a sum-of-exponentials (SOE) approximation to the convolution kernel involved in the fractional derivative. To effectively resolve the weak initial-time singularity at t=0, graded temporal meshes are employed. A fully discrete scheme is constructed by coupling the proposed half-time-level temporal discretization with a finite difference method in space. Compared with the classical L1 scheme, the proposed SOE-based method achieves the same global convergence order while reducing both storage requirements and computational cost. Specifically, the storage demand is reduced from O(MN) to O(MN_exp), and the computational complexity is lowered from O(MN^2) to O(MN N_exp), where M and N denote the numbers of spatial and temporal grid points, respectively, and N_exp is the number of exponential terms used in the SOE approximation. The unique solvability, stability and accuracy of the resulting scheme are rigorously analyzed. Several numerical results are presented to confirm the sharpness of the error analysis and to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>On the Existence of Steady States for Blended Gas Flow with Non-Constant Compressibility Factor on Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study hydrogen-natural gas mixtures transported through pipeline networks. The flow is modeled by the isothermal Euler equations with a pressure law involving a non-constant, composition-dependent compressibility factor. For a broad class of such compressibility models, we prove the existence of steady-state solutions on networks containing compressor stations. The analysis is based on an implicit representation of the pressure profiles and a continuity argument that overcomes the discontinuous dependence of the gas composition on the flow direction. Numerical examples illustrate the influence of different compressibility models on the resulting states.</description>

      <title>Do physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) need to be deep? Shallow PINNs using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates the use of shallow physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for solving forward and inverse problems of nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). By reformulating PINNs as nonlinear systems, the Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm is employed to efficiently optimize the network parameters. Analytical expressions for the neural network derivatives with respect to the input variables are derived, enabling accurate and efficient computation of the Jacobian matrix required by LM. The proposed approach is tested on several benchmark problems, including the Burgers, Schr\"odinger, Allen-Cahn, and three-dimensional Bratu equations. Numerical results demonstrate that LM significantly outperforms BFGS in terms of convergence speed, accuracy, and final loss values, even when using shallow network architectures with only two hidden layers. These findings indicate that, for a wide class of PDEs, shallow PINNs combined with efficient second-order optimization methods can provide accurate and computationally efficient solutions for both forward and inverse problems.</description>

      <title>Comparison of Structure Preserving Schemes for the Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes Equations with Degenerate Mobility and Adaptive Mesh Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes (CHNS) system utilizes a diffusive phase-field for interface tracking of multi-phase fluid flows. Recently structure preserving methods for CHNS have moved into focus to construct numerical schemes that, for example, are mass conservative or obey initial bounds of the phase-field variable. In this work decoupled implicit-explicit formulations based on the Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methodology are considered and compared to existing schemes from the literature.
  For the fluid flow a standard continuous Galerkin approach is applied. An adaptive conforming grid is utilized to further draw computational focus on the interface regions, while coarser meshes are utilized around pure phases. All presented methods are compared against each other in terms of bound preservation, mass conservation, and energy dissipation for different examples found in the literature, including a classical rising droplet problem.</description>

Abstract: The Cahn-Hilliard equation and extensions, notably the Cahn-Hilliard-Darcy and Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes systems, provide widely used frameworks for coupling interfacial thermodynamics with flow. This review surveys the thermodynamic structures underlying these models, focusing on the formulation of free energy functionals, dissipation mechanisms, and variational principles. We compare structural properties, emphasizing how these models encode conservation laws and energy dissipation. A central theme is the translation of these thermodynamic structures into numerical practice by providing representative discretisation strategies that aim to preserve mass conservation, stability, and energy decay. Particular attention is paid to the trade-offs between accuracy, efficiency, and structure preservation in large-scale simulations.</description>

      <title>Convergence Analysis for the Recovery of the Friction Threshold in a Scalar Tresca Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a scalar valued elliptic partial differential equation on a sufficiently smooth domain $\Omega$, subject to a regularized Tresca friction-type boundary condition on a subset $\Gamma$ of $\partial \Omega$. The friction threshold, a positive function appearing in this boundary condition, is assumed to be unknown and serves as the coefficient to be recovered in our inverse problem. Assuming that (i) the friction threshold lies in a finite dimensional space with known basis functions, (ii) the right hand sides of the partial differential equation are known, and (iii) the solution to the partial differential equation on some small open subset $\omega \subset \Omega$ is available, we develop an iterative computational method for the recovery of the friction threshold. This algorithm is simple to implement and is based on piecewise linear finite elements. We show that the proposed algorithm converges in second order to a function $a_h$ and, moreover, that $a_h$ converges in second order in the finite element's mesh size $h$ to the true (unknown) friction threshold. We highlight our theoretical results by simulations that confirm our rates numerically.</description>

      <title>Systematic Performance Assessment of Deep Material Networks for Multiscale Material Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep Material Networks (DMNs) are structure-preserving, mechanistic machine learning models that embed micromechanical principles into their architectures, enabling strong extrapolation capabilities and significant potential to accelerate multiscale modeling of complex microstructures. A key advantage of these models is that they can be trained exclusively on linear elastic data and then generalized to nonlinear inelastic regimes during online prediction. Despite their growing adoption, systematic evaluations of their performance across the full offline-online pipeline remain limited. This work presents a comprehensive comparative assessment of DMNs with respect to prediction accuracy, computational efficiency, and training robustness. We investigate the effects of offline training choices, including initialization, batch size, training data size, and activation regularization on online generalization performance and uncertainty. The results demonstrate that both prediction error and variance decrease with increasing training data size, while initialization and batch size can significantly influence model performance. Moreover, activation regularization is shown to play a critical role in controlling network complexity and therefore generalization performance. Compared with the original DMN, the rotation-free Interaction-based Material Network (IMN) formulation achieves a 3.4x - 4.7x speed-up in offline training, while maintaining comparable online prediction accuracy and computational efficiency. These findings clarify key trade-offs between model expressivity and efficiency in structure-preserving material networks and provide practical guidance for their deployment in multiscale material modeling.</description>

      <title>VERIFY-RL: Verifiable Recursive Decomposition for Reinforcement Learning in Mathematical Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Training language models to solve complex mathematical problems benefits from curriculum learning progressively training on simpler subproblems. However, existing decomposition methods are often heuristic, offering no guarantees that subproblems are simpler, that solving them aids the parent task, or that their relationships are mathematically grounded. We observe that symbolic differentiation provides a natural structure for verified decomposition: calculus rules explicitly define how expressions reduce to simpler components with provable properties. We introduce Verify-RL, a framework where every parent-child decomposition satisfies three verifiable conditions: strictly decreasing structural complexity, solution containment, and formal rule derivation. Unlike heuristic methods where a significant fraction of decompositions are invalid our properties admit automatic verification through symbolic computation, achieving "verification by construction" Experiments demonstrate that eliminating invalid decompositions yields sizable gains, accuracy on the hardest problems more than doubles from 32% to 68%, with a 40% relative improvement overall.</description>

      <title>Escaping Spectral Bias without Backpropagation: Fast Implicit Neural Representations with Extreme Learning Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07603</link>

Abstract: Training implicit neural representations (INRs) to capture fine-scale details typically relies on iterative backpropagation and is often hindered by spectral bias when the target exhibits highly non-uniform frequency content. We propose ELM-INR, a backpropagation-free INR that decomposes the domain into overlapping subdomains and fits each local problem using an Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) in closed form, replacing iterative optimization with stable linear least-squares solutions. This design yields fast and numerically robust reconstruction by combining local predictors through a partition of unity. To understand where approximation becomes difficult under fixed local capacity, we analyze the method from a spectral Barron norm perspective, which reveals that global reconstruction error is dominated by regions with high spectral complexity. Building on this insight, we introduce BEAM, an adaptive mesh refinement strategy that balances spectral complexity across subdomains to improve reconstruction quality in capacity-constrained regimes.</description>

      <title>StabOp: A Data-Driven Stabilization Operator for Reduced Order Modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.07745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatial filters have played a central role in large eddy simulation and, more recently, in reduced order model (ROM) stabilization for convection-dominated flows. Nevertheless, important open questions remain: in under-resolved regimes, which filter is most suitable for a given stabilization or closure model? Moreover, once a filter is selected, how should its parameters, such as the filter radius, be determined? Addressing these questions is essential for the reliable design and performance of filter-based stabilization strategies. To answer these questions, we propose a novel strategy that differs fundamentally from current filter-based approaches: we replace traditional spatial filters with a data-driven stabilization operator (StabOp) that yields accurate results for a given resolution, quantity of interest, and stabilization strategy. Although the new StabOp can be used for both classical discretizations and ROMs, and for different types of filter-based stabilization or closure, for clarity we focus on ROMs and the Leray stabilization. To build the new StabOp, we postulate its model form as a linear, quadratic, or nonlinear mapping, and then solve a PDE-constrained optimization problem to minimize a given loss function. Using the resulting StabOp in the Leray ROM (L-ROM) yields a new stabilized ROM, StabOp-L-ROM. To assess the StabOp-L-ROM, we compare it with the L-ROM and the standard ROM in numerical simulations of four flows: 2D flow past a cylinder at Re=500, lid-driven cavity at Re=10000, 3D flow past a hemisphere at Re=2200, and minimal channel flow at Re=5000. Our numerical results show that the StabOp-L-ROM can be orders of magnitude more accurate than the classical L-ROM tuned with an optimal filter radius in the predictive regime. Furthermore, while the new StabOp smooths the input flow fields, its smoothing mechanism differs from that of classical spatial filters.</description>

      <title>Approximating Matrix Functions with Deep Neural Networks and Transformers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.07800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformers have revolutionized natural language processing, but their use for numerical computation has received less attention. We study the approximation of matrix functions, which map scalar functions to matrices, using neural networks including transformers. We focus on functions mapping square matrices to square matrices of the same dimension. These types of matrix functions appear throughout scientific computing, e.g., the matrix exponential in continuous-time Markov chains and the matrix sign function in stability analysis of dynamical systems. In this paper, we make two contributions. First, we prove bounds on the width and depth of ReLU networks needed to approximate the matrix exponential to an arbitrary precision. Second, we show experimentally that a transformer encoder-decoder with suitable numerical encodings can approximate certain matrix functions at a relative error of 5% with high probability. Our study reveals that the encoding scheme strongly affects performance, with different schemes working better for different functions.</description>

Abstract: Partial Differential Equations are precise in modelling the physical, biological and graphical phenomena. However, the numerical methods suffer from the curse of dimensionality, high computation costs and domain-specific discretization. We aim to explore pros and cons of different PDE solvers, and apply them to specific scientific simulation problems, including forwarding solution, inverse problems and equations discovery. In particular, we extend the recent CNF (NeurIPS 2023) framework solver to multi-dependent-variable and non-linear settings, together with down-stream applications. The outcomes include implementation of selected methods, self-tuning techniques, evaluation on benchmark problems and a comprehensive survey of neural PDE solvers and scientific simulation applications.</description>

      <title>V-ABFT: Variance-Based Adaptive Threshold for Fault-Tolerant Matrix Multiplication in Mixed-Precision Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Algorithm-Based Fault Tolerance (ABFT) is widely adopted to detect silent data corruptions (SDCs) in matrix multiplication, a cornerstone operation in deep learning systems. However, existing threshold determination methods face critical challenges: analytical bounds are overly conservative, while probabilistic approaches like A-ABFT yield thresholds $160$--$4200\times$ larger than actual rounding errors. We present V-ABFT, a variance-based adaptive threshold algorithm that achieves tighter error bounds by directly modeling the verification difference. By leveraging statistical variance estimation, V-ABFT reduces the threshold-to-actual-error ratio to approximately $7$--$20\times$ for FP32/FP64 and $48$--$158\times$ for BF16, representing a \textbf{6--48$\times$ improvement} over A-ABFT while maintaining zero false positive rate across BF16, FP16, FP32, and FP64 precisions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that for fused-kernel ABFT implementations that verify before output quantization, low-precision GEMM can use FP32-level thresholds ($e_{\max} \approx 10^{-6}$), enabling \textbf{$\sim$1000$\times$ finer detection granularity} compared to offline verification with low-precision output ($e_{\max} \approx 10^{-3}$). We reproduce A-ABFT's experimental setup and validate our implementation against the original paper's results. Our method requires only $O(n)$ complexity using max/min/mean statistics, compared to A-ABFT's $O(pn)$ for finding $p$ largest values. Extensive experiments on synthetic data and real model weights (LLaMA-7B, GPT-2, ViT) demonstrate V-ABFT's effectiveness across diverse distributions. V-ABFT is platform-agnostic and has been integrated into fault-tolerant GEMM implementations on both NPUs and GPUs.</description>

      <title>Energy-Controllable Time Integration for Elastodynamic Contact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamic simulation of elastic bodies is a longstanding task in engineering and computer graphics. In graphics, numerical integrators like implicit Euler and BDF2 are preferred due to their stability at large time steps, but they tend to dissipate energy uncontrollably. In contrast, symplectic methods like implicit midpoint can conserve energy but are not unconditionally stable and fail on moderately stiff problems. To address these limitations, we propose a general class of numerical integrators for Hamiltonian problems which are symplectic on linear problems, yet have superior stability on nonlinear problems. With this, we derive a novel energy-controllable time integrator, A-search, a simple modification of implicit Euler that can follow user-specified energy targets, enabling flexible control over energy dissipation or conservation while maintaining stability and physical fidelity. Our method integrates seamlessly with barrier-type energies and allows for inversion-free and penetration-free guarantees, making it well-suited for handling large deformations and complex collisions. Extensive evaluations over a wide range of material parameters and scenes demonstrate that A-search has biases to keep energy in low frequency motion rather than dissipation, and A-search outperforms traditional methods such as BDF2 at similar total running times by maintaining energy and leading to more visually desirable simulations.</description>

      <title>Optimal Quantum Speedups for Repeatedly Nested Expectation Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the estimation of repeatedly nested expectations (RNEs) with a constant horizon (number of nestings) using quantum computing. We propose a quantum algorithm that achieves $\varepsilon$-error with cost $\tilde O(\varepsilon^{-1})$, up to logarithmic factors. Standard lower bounds show this scaling is essentially optimal, yielding an almost quadratic speedup over the best classical algorithm. Our results extend prior quantum speedups for single nested expectations to repeated nesting, and therefore cover a broader range of applications, including optimal stopping. This extension requires a new derandomized variant of the classical randomized Multilevel Monte Carlo (rMLMC) algorithm. Careful de-randomization is key to overcoming a variable-time issue that typically increases quantized versions of classical randomized algorithms.</description>

      <title>Radial M\"untz-Sz\'asz Networks: Neural Architectures with Learnable Power Bases for Multidimensional Singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radial singular fields, such as $1/r$, $\log r$, and crack-tip profiles, are difficult to model for coordinate-separable neural architectures. We show that any $C^2$ function that is both radial and additively separable must be quadratic, establishing a fundamental obstruction for coordinate-wise power-law models. Motivated by this result, we introduce Radial M\"untz-Sz\'asz Networks (RMN), which represent fields as linear combinations of learnable radial powers $r^\mu$, including negative exponents, together with a limit-stable log-primitive for exact $\log r$ behavior. RMN admits closed-form spatial gradients and Laplacians, enabling physics-informed learning on punctured domains. Across ten 2D and 3D benchmarks, RMN achieves 1.5$\times$--51$\times$ lower RMSE than MLPs and 10$\times$--100$\times$ lower RMSE than SIREN while using 27 parameters, compared with 33,537 for MLPs and 8,577 for SIREN. We extend RMN to angular dependence (RMN-Angular) and to multiple sources with learnable centers (RMN-MC); when optimization converges, source-center recovery errors fall below $10^{-4}$. We also report controlled failures on smooth, strongly non-radial targets to delineate RMN's operating regime.</description>

      <title>Time-Delayed Transformers for Data-Driven Modeling of Low-Dimensional Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose the time-delayed transformer (TD-TF), a simplified transformer architecture for data-driven modeling of unsteady spatio-temporal dynamics. TD-TF bridges linear operator-based methods and deep sequence models by showing that a single-layer, single-head transformer can be interpreted as a nonlinear generalization of time-delayed dynamic mode decomposition (TD-DMD). The architecture is deliberately minimal, consisting of one self-attention layer with a single query per prediction and one feedforward layer, resulting in linear computational complexity in sequence length and a small parameter count. Numerical experiments demonstrate that TD-TF matches the performance of strong linear baselines on near-linear systems, while significantly outperforming them in nonlinear and chaotic regimes, where it accurately captures long-term dynamics. Validation studies on synthetic signals, unsteady aerodynamics, the Lorenz '63 system, and a reaction-diffusion model show that TD-TF preserves the interpretability and efficiency of linear models while providing substantially enhanced expressive power for complex dynamics.</description>

      <title>Arithmetical enhancements of the Kogbetliantz method for the SVD of order two</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13116v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An enhanced Kogbetliantz method for the singular value decomposition (SVD) of general matrices of order two is proposed. The method consists of three phases: an almost exact prescaling, that can be beneficial to the LAPACK's xLASV2 routine for the SVD of upper triangular 2x2 matrices as well, a highly relatively accurate triangularization in the absence of underflows, and an alternative procedure for computing the SVD of triangular matrices, that employs the correctly rounded hypot function. A heuristic for improving numerical orthogonality of the left singular vectors is also presented and tested on a wide spectrum of random input matrices. On upper triangular matrices under test, the proposed method, unlike xLASV2, finds both singular values with high relative accuracy as long as the input elements are within a safe range that is almost as wide as the entire normal range. On general matrices of order two, the method's safe range for which the smaller singular values remain accurate is of about half the width of the normal range.</description>

Abstract: We propose a new stable variational formulation for the quad-div problem in three dimensions and prove its well-posedness. Using this weak form, we develop and analyze the $\boldsymbol{H}(\operatorname{grad-div})$-conforming virtual element method of arbitrary approximation orders on polyhedral meshes. Three families of $\boldsymbol{H}(\operatorname{grad-div})$-conforming virtual elements are constructed based on the structure of a de Rham sub-complex with enhanced smoothness, resulting in an exact discrete virtual element complex. In the lowest-order case, the simplest element has only one degree of freedom at each vertex and face, respectively. We rigorously prove the interpolation error estimates, the stability of discrete bilinear forms, the well-posedness of discrete formulation and the optimal error estimates. Some numerical examples are shown to verify the theoretical results.</description>

Abstract: We consider a prototypical parabolic SPDE with finite-dimensional multiplicative noise, which, subject to a nonnegative initial datum, has a unique nonnegative solution. Inspired by well-established techniques in the deterministic case, we introduce a finite element discretization of this SPDE that is convergent and which, subject to a nonnegative initial datum and unconditionally with respect to the spatial discretization parameter, preserves nonnegativity of the numerical solution throughout the course of evolution. We perform a mathematical analysis of this method. In addition, in the associated linear setting, we develop a fully discrete scheme that also preserves nonnegativity, and we present numerical experiments that illustrate the advantages of the proposed method over alternative finite element and finite difference methods that were previously considered in the literature, which do not necessarily guarantee nonnegativity of the numerical solution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08169v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose, analyze, and implement a quadrature method for evaluating integrals of the form $\int_0^2 f(s)\exp(zs)\, {\rm d}s$, where $z$ is a complex number with a possibly large negative real part. The integrand may exhibit exponential decay, highly oscillatory behavior, or both simultaneously, making standard quadrature rules computationally expensive. Our approach is based on a Clenshaw-Curtis product-integration rule: the smooth part of the integrand is interpolated using a polynomial at Chebyshev nodes, and the resulting integral is computed exactly. We analyze the convergence of the method with respect to both the number of nodes and the parameter $z$. Additionally, we provide a stable and efficient implementation whose computational cost is essentially independent of $z$ and scales linearly with $L$. Notably, our approach avoids the use of special functions, enhancing its numerical robustness.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09434v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive nonlinear stability results for numerical integrators on Riemannian manifolds, by imposing conditions on the ODE vector field and the step size that makes the numerical solution non-expansive whenever the exact solution is non-expansive over the same time step. Our model case is a geodesic version of the explicit Euler method. Precise bounds are obtained in the case of Riemannian manifolds of constant sectional curvature. The approach is based on a cocoercivity property of the vector field adapted to manifolds from Euclidean space. It allows us to compare the new results to the corresponding well-known results in flat spaces, and in general we find that a non-zero curvature will deteriorate the stability region of the geodesic Euler method. The step size bounds depend on the distance traveled over a step from the initial point. Numerical examples for spheres and hyperbolic 2-space confirm that the bounds are tight.</description>

      <title>Sequential Monte Carlo with Gaussian Mixture Approximation for Infinite-Dimensional Statistical Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16028v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By formulating the inverse problem of partial differential equations (PDEs) as a statistical inference problem, the Bayesian approach provides a general framework for quantifying uncertainties. In the inverse problem of PDEs, parameters are defined on an infinite-dimensional function space, and the PDEs induce a computationally intensive likelihood function. Additionally, sparse data tends to lead to a multi-modal posterior. These features make it difficult to apply existing sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) algorithms. To overcome these difficulties, we propose new conditions for the likelihood functions, construct a Gaussian mixture based preconditioned Crank-Nicolson transition kernel, and demonstrate the universal approximation property of the infinite-dimensional Gaussian mixture probability measure. By combining these three novel tools, we propose a new SMC algorithm with Gaussian mixture approximation, together with an easy-to-use reduced version. For this new algorithm, we obtain a convergence theorem that allows Gaussian priors, illustrating that the sequential particle filter actually reproduces the true posterior distribution. Furthermore, the proposed new algorithm is rigorously defined on the infinite-dimensional function space, naturally exhibiting the discretization-invariant property. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the reduced version has a strong ability to probe the multi-modality of the posterior, significantly reduces the computational burden, and numerically exhibits the discretization-invariant property (important for large-scale problems).</description>

      <title>On the stability and conditioning of a fictitious domain formulation for fluid-structure interaction problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05228v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a distributed Lagrange multiplier formulation for fluid-structure interaction problems in the spirit of the fictitious domain approach. This is an unfitted method, which does not require the construction of meshes conforming to the interface. We focus on the stationary problem arising from the time discretization and we analyze the behavior of the condition number with respect to mesh refinement. At the numerical level, the computation of the term coupling the fluid and the solid mesh requires the knowledge of the intersection between fluid and mapped solid elements and it might happen that a portion of the intersected elements is very small. We show that our formulation is stable independently of such intersections and that the conditioning is not affected by the interface position.</description>

      <title>Tensor-based multivariate function approximation: methods benchmarking and comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04791v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We evaluate some methods designed for tensor- (or data-) based multivariate model construction (approximation and compression). To this aim, a collection of multivariate functions and an evaluation methodology are suggested. First, these functions, with varying complexity (e.g., number and degree of the variables) and nature (e.g., rational, irrational, differentiable or not, symmetric, etc.) are used to build $n$-dimensional tensors, each of different dimension and memory size. Second, grounded on this tensor, we evaluate the performances of different methods and implementations leading to different types of surrogate models (e.g., rational functions, networks). The accuracy, the computational time, the parameter tuning impact, etc. are monitored and reported. One objective is to evaluate the different available strategies to guide users on the prospects, advantages, and limits of the various tools. The contributions are twofold: (i) to suggest a comprehensive benchmark collection together with a methodology for tensor approximation with a surrogate model and, in addition, (ii) to provide a digest and additional details of the multivariate Loewner Framework (mLF) approach [Antoulas et al., 2025], as well as detailed examples and code.</description>

      <title>Surface Minkowski tensors to characterize shapes on curved surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13880v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce surface Minkowski tensors to characterize rotational symmetries of shapes embedded in curved surfaces. The definition is based on a modified vector transport of the shapes boundary co-normal into a reference point which accounts for the angular defect that a classical parallel transport would introduce. This modified transport can be easily implemented for general surfaces and differently defined embedded shapes, and the associated irreducible surface Minkowski tensors give rise to the classification of shapes by their normalized eigenvalues, which are introduced as shape measures following the flat-space analog. We analyze different approximations of the embedded shapes, their influence on the surface Minkowski tensors, and the stability to perturbations of the shape and the surface. The work concludes with a series of numerical experiments showing the applicability of the approach on various surfaces and shape representations and an application in biology in which the characterization of cells in a curved monolayer of cells is considered.</description>

      <title>Fast solution of a phase-field model of pitting corrosion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18058v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Excessive computational times represent a major challenge in the solution of corrosion models, limiting their practical applicability, e.g., as a support to predictive maintenance. In this paper, we propose an efficient strategy for solving a phase-field model for metal corrosion. Based on the Kronecker structure of the diffusion matrix in classical finite difference approximations on rectangular domains, time-stepping IMEX methods are efficiently solved in matrix form. However, when the domain is non-rectangular, the lack of the Kronecker structure prevents the direct use of the matrix-based approach. To address this issue, we reformulate the problem on an extended rectangular domain and introduce suitable iterative IMEX methods. The convergence of the iterations and the propagation of the numerical errors are analyzed. Test cases on two and three dimensional domains show that the proposed approach achieves accuracy comparable to existing methods, while significantly reducing the computational time, to the point of allowing actual predictions on standard workstations.</description>

      <title>Learning Geometric-Aware Quadrature Rules for Functional Minimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05445v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate numerical integration over non-uniform point clouds is a challenge for modern mesh-free machine learning solvers for partial differential equations (PDEs) using variational principles. While standard Monte Carlo (MC) methods are not capable of handling a non-uniform point cloud, modern neural network architectures can deal with permutation-invariant inputs, creating quadrature rules for any point cloud. In this work, we introduce QuadrANN, a Graph Neural Network (GNN) architecture designed to learn optimal quadrature weights directly from the underlying geometry of point clouds. The design of the model exploits a deep message-passing scheme where the initial layer encodes rich local geometric features from absolute and relative positions as well as an explicit local density measure. In contrast, the following layers incorporate a global context vector. These architectural choices allow the QuadrANN to generate a data-driven quadrature rule that is permutation-invariant and adaptive to both local point density and the overall domain shape. We test our methodology on a series of challenging test cases, including integration on convex and non-convex domains and estimating the solution of the Heat and Fokker-Planck equations. Across all the tests, QuadrANN reduces the variance of the integral estimation compared to standard Quasi-Monte Carlo methods by warping the point clouds to be more dense in critical areas where the integrands present certain singularities. This enhanced stability in critical areas of the domain at hand is critical for the optimization of energy functionals, leading to improved deep learning-based variational solvers.</description>

      <title>Harmonic potentials in the de Rham complex</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16822v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Representing vector fields by potentials can be a challenging task in domains with cavities or tunnels, due to the presence of harmonic fields which are both irrotational and solenoidal but may have no scalar or vector potentials. For harmonic fields normal to the boundary, which exist in domains with cavities, the standard approach is to construct scalar potentials by solving Laplace's equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions fitted to the closed surfaces surrounding the domain's cavities. For harmonic fields tangent to the boundary, which exist in domains with tunnels, a similar method was lacking. In this article we present a construction of vector potentials obtained by solving curl-curl problems with inhomogeneous tangent boundary conditions fitted to closed curves looping around the tunnels. Just as the cavity surfaces represent a basis for the 2-chain homology group, these tunnel curves represent a basis for the 1-chain homology group and the corresponding vector potentials yield a basis for the tangent harmonic fields. In our analysis the linear independence of the harmonic fields is established by considering their fluxes through a collection of reciprocal surfaces. These surfaces, whose boundaries lie on the boundary of the domain and which are in intersection duality with the tunnel curves, represent a basis for the relative 2-chain homology group modulo the boundary: their existence in general domains follows from the Poincar\'e-Lefschetz duality. Applied to structure-preserving finite elements, our method also provides an exact geometric parametrization of the discrete harmonic fields in terms of discrete potentials.</description>

      <title>A Reduced Order Modeling Method with Variable-Separation-Based Domain Decomposition for Parametric Dynamical Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17276v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a model order reduction method for a class of parametric dynamical systems. Using a temporal Fourier transform, we reformulate these systems into complex-valued elliptic equations in the frequency domain, containing frequency variables and parameters inherited from the original model. To reduce the computational cost of the frequency-variable elliptic equations, we extend the variable-separation-based domain decomposition method to the complex-valued context, resulting in an offline-online procedure for solving the parametric dynamical systems. At the offline stage, separate representations of the solutions for the interface problem and the subproblems are constructed. At the online stage, the solutions of the parametric dynamical systems for new parameter values can be directly derived by utilizing the separate representations and implementing the inverse Fourier transform. The proposed approach is capable of being highly efficient because the online stage is independent of the spatial discretization. Finally, we present three specific instances of parametric dynamical systems to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Entropy-Stable Discontinuous Spectral-Element Methods for the Spherical Shallow Water Equations in Covariant Form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08790v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce discontinuous spectral-element methods of arbitrary order that are well balanced, conservative of mass, and conservative or dissipative of total energy (i.e., a mathematical entropy function) for a covariant flux formulation of the rotating shallow water equations with variable bottom topography on curved manifolds such as the sphere. The proposed methods are based on a skew-symmetric splitting of the tensor divergence in covariant form, which we implement and analyze within a general flux-differencing framework using tensor-product summation-by-parts operators. Such schemes are proven to satisfy semi-discrete mass and energy conservation on general unstructured quadrilateral grids in addition to well balancing for arbitrary continuous bottom topographies, with energy dissipation resulting from a suitable choice of numerical interface flux. Furthermore, the proposed covariant formulation permits an analytical representation of the geometry and associated metric terms while satisfying the aforementioned entropy stability, conservation, and well-balancing properties without the need to approximate the metric terms so as to enforce discrete metric identities. Numerical experiments on cubed-sphere grids are presented in order to verify the schemes' structure-preservation properties as well as to assess their accuracy and robustness within the context of several standard test cases characteristic of idealized atmospheric flows. Our theoretical and numerical results support the further development of the proposed methodology towards a full dynamical core for numerical weather prediction and climate modelling, as well as broader applications to other hyperbolic and advection-dominated systems of partial differential equations on curved manifolds.</description>

      <title>PDE-Free Mass-Constrained Learning of Complex Systems with Hidden States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17657v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a three-tier machine learning framework based on the next-generation Equation-Free algorithm for learning the spatio-temporal dynamics of mass-constrained complex systems with hidden states, whose dynamics can in principle be described by PDEs, but lack explicit models. In the first step, we employ Diffusion Maps (DMs), a nonlinear manifold learning algorithm, to extract low-dimensional latent representations of the complex spatio-temporal evolution. In the second step, we learn manifold-informed reduced-order models (ROMs) with Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) and standard linear Multivariate Autoregressive models (MVARs) to approximate the solution operator on the latent space. In the final step, the latent dynamics are lifted back to the original high-dimensional space by solving an (ill-posed) pre-image problem via a convex interpolation based on the k-NN algorithm. In doing so, the proposed framework reconstructs the solution operator of the unknown mass-constrained PDE, without explicitly identifying the PDE itself. For comparison purposes, we also evaluated the performance of the scheme for constructing ROMs based on Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) and prove that both POD and the k-NN lifting operators preserve the mass. We illustrate the approach using two benchmark problems: (a) the Hughes model of crowd dynamics, which minimizes walking time while avoiding obstacles and high-density regions, and (b) a CFD problem involving the spatio-temporal evolution of a passive tracer advected by a periodic Navier--Stokes velocity field. We show that ROMs informed by DMs yield parsimonious models that consistently outperform the best POD-informed ROMs, yielding stable and accurate approximations of the solution operator in the latent space and, via reconstruction, in the original high-dimensional space over long time horizons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.00735v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the Hierarchical Poincar\'e-Steklov (HPS) method in a preconditioned iterative setting for variable-coefficient Helmholtz problems with impedance boundary conditions. HPS is commonly presented as a direct solver based on nested dissection and high-order tensor-product discretizations; here we recast its hierarchical merge tree as a multilevel preconditioner for the assembled skeleton (trace) system. The main goal is to flexibilize the final, memory-intensive coarse stage of direct HPS by replacing the exact coarse solve with a small, fixed amount of iterative work, thereby exposing tunable trade-offs between memory footprint and time to solution. Numerical experiments on a two-dimensional scattering benchmark illustrate these trade-offs and compare against both unpreconditioned GMRES and the classic direct HPS pipeline with an exact coarse space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01344v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The central-upwind flux is a widely used numerical flux function for local conservation laws. It has been investigated by Kurganov and Polizzi (2009) for a specific nonlocal conservation law and can be derived from a fully-discrete second-order scheme. Here, we derive this fully-discrete scheme in detail with a particular focus on the occurring nonlocal terms. In addition, we derive the central-upwind flux for a class of nonlocal conservation laws and use an estimate on the nonlocal speed which fixes the nonlocality at the cell interfaces. We prove that the resulting first-order numerical scheme converges to the correct solution. Under additional assumptions on the analytical flux we present a similar result for a second-order central-upwind scheme. Numerical examples compare the central-upwind schemes to Godunov-type schemes and the fully-discrete scheme.</description>

      <title>A cut finite element method for the Biot system of poroelasticity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17521v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel cut finite element method for the numerical solution of the Biot system of poroelasticity. The Biot system couples elastic deformation of a porous solid with viscous fluid flow and commonly arises on domains with complex geometries that make high-quality volumetric meshing challenging. To address this issue, we employ the cut finite element framework, where the domain boundary is represented independently of the background mesh, which significantly simplifies the meshing process. Our approach builds upon a parameter robust total pressure formulation of the Biot system, which we combine with the cut finite element method to develop a geometrically robust solution scheme, while preserving the parameter robustness. A key ingredient in the theoretical analysis is a modified inf-sup condition which also holds for mixed boundary conditions, leading to stability and optimal error estimates for the proposed formulation. Finally, we provide numerical evidence demonstrating the theoretical properties of the method and showcasing its capabilities by solving the Biot system on a realistic brain geometry.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01094v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the design of deterministic lateral displacement (DLD) microfluidic devices, we develop a high-order numerical framework for fluid-rigid-body interaction on fitted moving meshes. Rigid-body motion is enforced by a distributed Lagrange multiplier (DLM) formulation, while the moving fluid domain is treated by an arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) mapping. In space, we use isoparametric Taylor-Hood elements to achieve high-order accuracy and to represent curved boundaries and the fluid-particle interface. In time, we employ a high-order partitioned Runge-Kutta strategy in which the mesh motion is advanced explicitly and the coupled physical fields are advanced implicitly, yielding high-order accuracy for the particle trajectory. The fully coupled system is linearized into a generalized Stokes problem subject to distributed constraints of incompressibility and rigid-body motion. We establish well-posedness of this generalized Stokes formulation at both the continuous and discrete levels, providing the stability foundation for operator preconditioning that is robust with respect to key physical and discretization parameters. Numerical experiments on representative benchmarks, including a DLD case, demonstrate high-order convergence for the fluid solution and rigid-body dynamics, as well as robust iterative convergence of the proposed preconditioners.</description>

      <title>Finite element approximation for a reformulation of a 3D fluid-2D plate interaction system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.05701v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a finite element approximation of a coupled fluid-structure interaction consisting of a three-dimensional incompressible viscous fluid governed by the unsteady Stokes equations and a two-dimensional elastic plate. To avoid the use of $H^2-$conforming or nonconforming $\mathbb{P}_2$-Morley plate elements, the fourth-order plate equation is reformulated into a system of coupled second-order equations using an auxiliary variable. The coupling condition is enforced using a Lagrange multiplier representing the trace of the mean-zero fluid pressure on the interface.
  We establish well-posedness and stability results for the time-discrete and fully-discrete problems, and derive a priori error estimates. A partitioned domain decomposition algorithm based on a fixed-point iteration is employed for the numerical solution. Numerical experiments verify the theoretical rates of convergence in space and time using manufactured solutions, and demonstrate the applicability of the method to a physical problem.</description>

Abstract: The problem-project-oriented STEM education plays a significant role in training students' ability of innovation. Although the conceive-design-implement-operate (CDIO) approach and the computational thinking (CT) are hot topics in recent decade, there are still two deficiencies: the CDIO approach and CT are discussed separately and a general framework of coping with complex STEM problems in system modeling and simulation is missing. In this paper, a collaborative strategy based on the CDIO and CT is proposed for solving complex STEM problems in system modeling and simulation with a general framework, in which the CDIO is about ``how to do", CT is about ``how to think", and the project means ``what to do". As an illustration, the problem of solving the period of mathematical pendulum (MP) is discussed in detail. The most challenging task involved in the problem is to compute the complete elliptic integral of the first kind (CEI-1). In the philosophy of STEM education, all problems have more than one solutions. For computing the CEI-1, four methods are discussed with a top-down strategy, which includes the infinite series method, arithmetic-geometric mean (AGM) method, Gauss-Chebyshev method and Gauss-Legendre method. The algorithms involved can be utilized for R &amp; D projects of interest and be reused according to the requirements encountered. The general framework for solving complex STEM problem in system modeling and simulation is worth recommending to the college students and instructors.</description>

      <title>Analysis of singular subspaces under random perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09170v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of singular vector and singular subspace perturbations in the signal-plus-noise matrix model with random Gaussian noise. Assuming a low-rank signal matrix, we extend the Davis-Kahan-Wedin theorem in a fully generalized manner, applicable to any unitarily invariant matrix norm, building on previous results by O'Rourke, Vu, and the author. Our analysis provides fine-grained insights, including $\ell_\infty$ bounds for singular vectors, $\ell_{2, \infty}$ bounds for singular subspaces, and results for linear and bilinear functions of singular vectors. Additionally, we derive $\ell_{2,\infty}$ bounds on perturbed singular vectors, taking into account the weighting by their corresponding singular values. Finally, we explore practical implications of these results in the Gaussian mixture model and the submatrix localization problem.</description>

      <title>A DSMC method for the space homogeneous multispecies Landau equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17286v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method for the spatially homogeneous multispecies Landau-Fokker-Planck equation. The scheme is derived from a first-order approximation of the multispecies Boltzmann operator in the grazing collision limit and employs a regularized, easy-to-sample scattering kernel that removes the need for iterative solvers while preserving the fundamental invariants of the Landau dynamics. The method is fully mesh-free -- being a Monte Carlo particle algorithm -- which makes it naturally scalable to high-dimensional velocity spaces and straightforward to couple with particle-in-cell (PIC) solvers via operator splitting. A notable feature of our approach is its ability to treat realistic mass ratios: we show accurate simulations up to the physical proton-electron ($p$-$e$) mass ratio $m_p/m_e \approx 1836$. We validate the method against the multispecies BKW benchmark for Maxwellian interactions and study collisional relaxation for Coulomb interactions, showing conservation of mass, momentum, and energy, and the expected trend towards Maxwellian equilibria.</description>

      <title>Towards Spatio-Temporal Extrapolation of Phase-Field Simulations with Convolution-Only Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04510v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Phase-field simulations of liquid metal dealloying (LMD) can capture complex microstructural evolutions but can be prohibitively expensive for large domains and long time horizons. In this paper, we introduce a fully convolutional, conditionally parameterized U-Net surrogate designed to extrapolate far beyond its training data in both space and time. The architecture integrates convolutional self-attention, physically informed padding, and a flood-fill corrector method to maintain accuracy under extreme extrapolation, while conditioning on simulation parameters allows for flexible time-step skipping and adaptation to varying alloy compositions. To remove the need for costly solver-based initialization, we couple the surrogate with a conditional diffusion model that generates synthetic, physically consistent initial conditions. We train our surrogate on simulations generated over small domain sizes and short time spans, but, by taking advantage of the convolutional nature of U-Nets, we are able to run and extrapolate surrogate simulations for longer time horizons than what would be achievable with classic numerical solvers. Across multiple alloy compositions, the framework is able to reproduce the LMD physics accurately. It predicts key quantities of interest and spatial statistics with relative errors typically below 5% in the training regime and under 15% during large-scale, long time-horizon extrapolations. Our framework can also deliver speed-ups of up to 36,000 times, bringing the time to run weeks-long simulations down to a few seconds. This work is a first stepping stone towards high-fidelity extrapolation in both space and time of phase-field simulation for LMD.</description>

      <title>Free-RBF-KAN: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks with Adaptive Radial Basis Functions for Efficient Function Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07760v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) offer a promising framework for approximating complex nonlinear functions, yet the original B-spline formulation suffers from significant computational overhead due to De Boor algorithm. While recent RBF-based variants improve efficiency, they often sacrifice the approximation accuracy inherent in the original spline-based design. To bridge this gap, we propose Free-RBF-KAN, an architecture that integrates adaptive learning grids and trainable smoothness parameters to enable expressive, high-resolution function approximation. Our method utilizes learnable RBF shapes that dynamically align with activation patterns, and we provide the first formal universal approximation proof for the RBF-KAN family. Empirical evaluations across multiscale regression, physics-informed PDEs, and operator learning demonstrate that Free-RBF-KAN can achieve accuracy comparable to its B-spline counterparts while delivering significantly faster training and inference. These results establish Free-RBF-KAN as an efficient and adaptive alternative for high-dimensional structured modeling tasks.</description>

      <title>W-DUALMINE: Reliability-Weighted Dual-Expert Fusion With Residual Correlation Preservation for Medical Image Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08920v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Medical image fusion integrates complementary information from multiple imaging modalities to improve clinical interpretation. However, existing deep learningbased methods, including recent spatial-frequency frameworks such as AdaFuse and ASFE-Fusion, often suffer from a fundamental trade-off between global statistical similaritymeasured by correlation coefficient (CC) and mutual information (MI)and local structural fidelity. This paper proposes W-DUALMINE, a reliability-weighted dual-expert fusion framework designed to explicitly resolve this trade-off through architectural constraints and a theoretically grounded loss design. The proposed method introduces dense reliability maps for adaptive modality weighting, a dual-expert fusion strategy combining a global-context spatial expert and a wavelet-domain frequency expert, and a soft gradient-based arbitration mechanism. Furthermore, we employ a residual-to-average fusion paradigm that guarantees the preservation of global correlation while enhancing local details. Extensive experiments on CT-MRI, PET-MRI, and SPECT-MRI datasets demonstrate that W-DUALMINE consistently outperforms AdaFuse and ASFE-Fusion in CC and MI metrics while</description>

      <title>A coupled Kolmogorov-Arnold Network and Level-Set framework for evolving interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09818v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) require significantly smaller architectures compared to multilayer perceptron (MLP)-based approaches, while retaining expressive power through spline-based activations. Moving boundary problems are ubiquitous in physical systems, whose numerical solutions are quite complex. We propose a shallow KAN framework combined with a Level-set formulation that directly approximates the temperature distribution $T(\mathbf{x},t)$ and the moving interface $\Gamma(t)$, enforcing the governing PDEs, phase equilibrium, and Stefan condition through physics-informed residuals. Numerical experiments in one and two dimensions show that the framework achieves accurate reconstructions of both temperature fields and interface dynamics, highlighting the potential of KANs as a compact and efficient alternative for moving boundary PDEs. First, we validate the model with semi-infinite analytical solutions. Subsequently, the model is extended to 2D using a level-set based formulation for interface propagation, which is solved within the KAN framework. This work demonstrates that KANs are capable of solving complex moving boundary problems without the need for measurement data.</description>
