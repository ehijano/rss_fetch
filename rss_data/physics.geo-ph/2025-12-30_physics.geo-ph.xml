      <title>A Rapid GeoSAM-Based Workflow for Multi-Temporal Glacier Delineation: Case Study from Svalbard</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consistent glacier boundary delineation is essential for monitoring glacier change, yet many existing approaches are difficult to scale across long time series and heterogeneous environments. In this report, we present a GeoSAM-based, semi-automatic workflow for rapid glacier delineation from Sentinel-2 surface reflectance imagery. The method combines late-summer image compositing, spectral-index-based identification of candidate ice areas, prompt-guided segmentation using GeoSAM, and physically based post-processing to derive annual glacier outlines. The workflow is demonstrated in the Ny-Alesund and Kongsfjorden region of western Svalbard across multiple years of the Sentinel-2 era. Results show that the approach produces spatially coherent and temporally consistent outlines for major glacier bodies, while most errors are associated with small features affected by water bodies, terrain shadows, or high surface variability. The reliance on derived RGB imagery makes the method flexible and transferable to other optical datasets, with improved performance expected at higher spatial resolution. Although user inspection remains necessary to filter incorrect polygons and adjust thresholds for local conditions, the workflow provides a fast and practical alternative for multi-temporal glacier mapping and ice-loss assessment.</description>

      <title>Differentiable Inverse Modeling with Physics-Constrained Latent Diffusion for Heterogeneous Subsurface Parameter Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a latent diffusion-based differentiable inversion method (LD-DIM) for PDE-constrained inverse problems involving high-dimensional spatially distributed coefficients. LD-DIM couples a pretrained latent diffusion prior with an end-to-end differentiable numerical solver to reconstruct unknown heterogeneous parameter fields in a low-dimensional nonlinear manifold, improving numerical conditioning and enabling stable gradient-based optimization under sparse observations. The proposed framework integrates a latent diffusion model (LDM), trained in a compact latent space, with a differentiable finite-volume discretization of the forward PDE. Sensitivities are propagated through the discretization using adjoint-based gradients combined with reverse-mode automatic differentiation. Inversion is performed directly in latent space, which implicitly suppresses ill-conditioned degrees of freedom while preserving dominant structural modes, including sharp material interfaces. The effectiveness of LD-DIM is demonstrated using a representative inverse problem for flow in porous media, where heterogeneous conductivity fields are reconstructed from spatially sparse hydraulic head measurements. Numerical experiments assess convergence behavior and reconstruction quality for both Gaussian random fields and bimaterial coefficient distributions. The results show that LD-DIM achieves consistently improved numerical stability and reconstruction accuracy of both parameter fields and corresponding PDE solutions compared with physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and physics-embedded variational autoencoder (VAE) baselines, while maintaining sharp discontinuities and reducing sensitivity to initialization.</description>

      <title>Climate change alters teleconnections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Internal modes of climate variability, such as El Ni\~no and the North Atlantic Oscillation, can have strong influences upon distant weather patterns, effects that are referred to as "teleconnections". The extent to which anthropogenic climate change has and will continue to affect these teleconnections, however, remains uncertain. Here, we employ a covariance fingerprinting approach to demonstrate that shifts in teleconnection patterns affecting monthly temperatures between the periods 1960-1990 and 1990-2020 are attributable to anthropogenic forcing. We further apply multilinear regression to assess the regional contributions and statistical significance of changes in five key climate modes: the El Ni\~no-Southern Oscillation, North Atlantic Oscillation, Southern Annular Mode, Indian Ocean Dipole, and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. In many regions, observed changes exceed what would be expected from natural variability alone, further implicating an anthropogenic influence. Finally, we provide projections of how these teleconnections will alter in response to further changes in climate.</description>

      <title>Diffusion priors enhanced velocity model building from time-lag images using a neural operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Velocity model building serves as a crucial component for achieving high precision subsurface imaging. However, conventional velocity model building methods are often computationally expensive and time consuming. In recent years, with the rapid advancement of deep learning, particularly the success of generative models and neural operators, deep learning based approaches that integrate data and their statistics have attracted increasing attention in addressing the limitations of traditional methods. In this study, we propose a novel framework that combines generative models with neural operators to obtain high resolution velocity models efficiently. Within this workflow, the neural operator functions as a forward mapping operator to rapidly generate time lag reverse time migration (RTM) extended images from the true and migration velocity models. In this framework, the neural operator is acting as a surrogate for modeling followed by migration, which uses the true and migration velocities, respectively. The trained neural operator is then employed, through automatic differentiation, to gradually update the migration velocity placed in the true velocity input channel with high resolution components so that the output of the network matches the time lag images of observed data obtained using the migration velocity. By embedding a generative model, trained on a high-resolution velocity model distribution, which corresponds to the true velocity model distribution used to train the neural operator, as a regularizer, the resulting predictions are cleaner with higher resolution information. Both synthetic and field data experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed generative neural operator based velocity model building approach.</description>

      <title>Beating the aliasing limit with aperiodic monotile arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16476v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Finding optimal wave sampling methods has far-reaching implications in wave physics, such as seismology, acoustics, and telecommunications. A key challenge is surpassing the Whittaker-Nyquist-Shannon (WNS) aliasing limit, establishing a frequency below which the signal cannot be faithfully reconstructed. However, the WNS limit applies only to periodic sampling, opening the door to bypass aliasing by aperiodic sampling. In this work, we investigate the efficiency of a recently discovered family of aperiodic monotile tilings, the Hat family, in overcoming the aliasing limit when spatially sampling a wavefield. By analyzing their spectral properties, we show that monotile aperiodic seismic (MAS) arrays, based on a subset of the Hat tiling family, are efficient in surpassing the WNS sampling limit. Our investigation leads us to propose MAS arrays as a novel design principle for seismic arrays. We show that MAS arrays can outperform regular and other aperiodic arrays in realistic beamforming scenarios using single and distributed sources, including station-position noise. While current seismic arrays optimize beamforming or imaging applications using spiral or regular arrays, MAS arrays can accommodate both, as they share properties with both periodic and aperiodic arrays. More generally, our work suggests that aperiodic monotiles can be an efficient design principle in various fields requiring wave sampling.</description>

Abstract: By analyzing the seismicity in natural time and studying the evolution of the fluctuations of the entropy change of seismicity under time reversal for various scales of different length i (number of events), we can identify the approach of a major earthquake (EQ) occurrence. The current investigation is extended from 1984 until now for the seismicity in Japan.</description>

      <title>Assessing the economic benefits of space weather mitigation investment decisions: Evidence from Aotearoa New Zealand</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12495v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Space weather events pose a growing threat to modern economies, yet their macroeconomic consequences still remain underexplored. This study presents the first dedicated economic assessment of geomagnetic storm impacts on Aotearoa New Zealand, quantifying potential gross domestic product (GDP) losses across seven conservative disruption and mitigation scenarios due to an extreme coronal mass ejection (CME). The primary focus is upon the damaging impacts of geomagnetically induced currents (GICs) on the electrical power transmission network. We support space weather mitigation investments decisions by providing a first-order approximation of their potential economic benefits, using best-in-class scientific models. In the absence of mitigation, a severe but realistic storm could result in up to NZ\$8.36 billion in lost GDP, with more than half stemming from cascading supply chain effects. Yet, even less severe scenarios incur losses exceeding NZ\$3 billion. Importantly, even with conservative impact estimates we find that research-led operational strategies, such as optimized switching and islanding, can avoid up to NZ\$370 million in losses for as little as NZ\$0.5 million in expenditure, delivering a benefit-cost ratio of 740 to 1. Equally, physical protections such as GIC blocking devices achieve benefit-cost returns up to 80 to 1, highlighting the strong case for investment in space weather mitigation. When also acknowledging additional unmodelled impacts, including multi-billion losses in capital equipment and long-term revenue, the economic rationale for pre-emptive mitigation becomes even more pertinent. Future research needs to integrate the modelling of capital and revenue losses for strategically important industrial facilities.</description>
