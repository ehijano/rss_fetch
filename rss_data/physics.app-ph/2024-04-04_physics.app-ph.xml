      <title>Damping Reveals Hidden Dimensions in Elastic Metastructures Through Induced Transparency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Damping typically results in attenuation of vibrations and elastic wave propagation in mechanical systems. Contrary to this conventional understanding, we demonstrate experimentally and explain theoretically the revival of an elastic wave transmitted through a periodic metastructure when a weak non-Hermitian defect (damping mechanism) induces violation of time-reversal symmetry. Damping alters the nature of the system's resonant modes, instigating interference in the scattering field. This leads to transmission revival, revealing the presence of hidden modes which are otherwise masked by the symmetry. Our findings offer an innovative approach for designing dissipation-driven switches and controllers and non-destructive structural health monitoring systems.</description>

      <title>Remote-contact catalysis for target-diameter semiconducting carbon nanotube array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrostatic catalysis has been an exciting development in chemical synthesis (beyond enzymes catalysis) in recent years, boosting reaction rates and selectively producing certain reaction products. Most of the studies to date have been focused on using external electric field (EEF) to rearrange the charge distribution in small molecule reactions such as Diels-Alder addition, carbene reaction, etc. However, in order for these EEFs to be effective, a field on the order of 1 V/nm (10 MV/cm) is required, and the direction of the EEF has to be aligned with the reaction axis. Such a large and oriented EEF will be challenging for large-scale implementation, or materials growth with multiple reaction axis or steps. Here, we demonstrate that the energy band at the tip of an individual single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) can be spontaneously shifted in a high-permittivity growth environment, with its other end in contact with a low-work function electrode (e.g., hafnium carbide or titanium carbide). By adjusting the Fermi level at a point where there is a substantial disparity in the density of states (DOS) between semiconducting (s-) and metallic (m-) SWCNTs, we achieve effective electrostatic catalysis for s-SWCNT growth assisted by a weak EEF perturbation (200V/cm). This approach enables the production of high-purity (99.92%) s-SWCNT horizontal arrays with narrow diameter distribution (0.95+-0.04 nm), targeting the requirement of advanced SWCNT-based electronics for future computing. These findings highlight the potential of electrostatic catalysis in precise materials growth, especially for s-SWCNTs, and pave the way for the development of advanced SWCNT-based electronics.</description>

      <title>Class-E, Active Electrically-Small Antenna for High-Power Wideband Transmission at the High-Frequency (HF) Band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Antennas operating at the high-frequency (HF) band (3-30 MHz) are frequently electrically small due to the large wavelength of electromagnetic waves (10-100 m). However, the bandwidth-efficiency products of passively matched electrically small antennas (ESAs) are fundamentally limited. Wideband HF waveforms using bandwidths of 24 kHz or more have recently received significant attention in military communications applications. Efficiently radiating such signals from conventional passive ESAs is very challenging due to fundamental physical limits on bandwidth-efficiency products of ESAs. However, active antennas are not subject to the same constraints. In this work, we present the design and experimental characterization of a high-power, active ESA with enhanced bandwidth-efficiency product compared to {that of} passively matched ESAs. Specifically, the proposed active ESA can radiate wideband HF signals with banwidths of 24 kHz or more, with total efficiencies up to 80$\%$, and radiated power levels approaching 100 W. Our approach uses a highly-efficient, integrated class-E switching circuit specifically designed to drive an electrically small, high-Q HF antenna over a bandwidth exceeding 24 kHz. Using a high-Q RLC antenna model, we have successfully demonstrated wideband binary ASK, PSK, and FSK modulations with the proposed class-E switching architecture. Experimental results indicate that the bandwidth-efficiency product of this class-E active antenna is 5.4-9.8 dB higher than that of an equivalent passive design with the same data rate, and bit-error-rate (BER).</description>

      <title>Beyond the blur: using experimental point spread functions to help scanning Kelvin probe microscopy reach its full potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scanning Kelvin probe microscopy (SKPM) is a powerful technique for investigating the electrostatic properties of material surfaces, enabling the imaging of variations in work function, topology, surface charge density, or combinations thereof. Regardless of the underlying signal source, SKPM results in a voltage image which is spatially distorted due to the finite size of the probe, long-range electrostatic interactions, mechanical and electrical noise, and the finite response time of the electronics. In order to recover the underlying signal, it is necessary to deconvolve the measurement with an appropriate point spread function (PSF) that accounts the aforementioned distortions, but determining this PSF is difficult. Here we describe how such PSFs can be determined experimentally, and show how they can be used to recover the underlying information of interest. We first consider the physical principles that enable SKPM, and discuss how these affect the system PSF. We then show how one can experimentally measure PSFs by looking at well defined features, and that these compare well to simulated PSFs, provided scans are performed extremely slowly and carefully. Next, we work at realistic scan speeds, and show that the idealised PSFs fail to capture temporal distortions in the scan direction. While simulating PSFs for these situations would be quite challenging, we show that measuring PSFs with similar scan parameters works well. Our approach clarifies the basic principles of and inherent challenges to SKPM measurements, and gives practical methods to improve results.</description>

      <title>Centimeter-Scale Achromatic Hybrid Metalens Design: A New Paradigm Based on Differentiable Ray Tracing in the Visible Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single metalenses are limited by their physical constraints, precluding themselves from achieving high numerical aperture across a wide visible spectral band in large-aperture applications. A hybrid system that integrates a metalens with a refractive lens can address this issue, yet previous designs lacked sufficient flexibility. Here, by reanalyzing the generalized Snell's law, we introduce a new paradigm for the hybrid metalens design based on differentiable ray tracing. Through joint optimization of the phase distribution of the metalens and refractive lens parameters, our system achieves achromatic performance within the broad spectral range of 440-700 nm, with an aperture of 1 cm and an f-number of 1.4. Owing to the differentiable nature of the proposed system, it can be seamlessly integrated as the optical front-end into any differentiable computational imaging system. Our system offers unprecedented opportunities for the advancement of metalenses in innovative optical design and computational imaging domains.</description>

      <title>Materials for High Temperature Digital Electronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Silicon microelectronics, consisting of complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology, have changed nearly all aspects of human life from communication to transportation, entertainment, and healthcare. Despite the widespread and mainstream use, current silicon-based devices suffer significant reliability issues at temperatures exceeding 125 {\deg}C. The emergent technological frontiers of space exploration, geothermal energy harvesting, nuclear energy, unmanned avionic systems, and autonomous driving will rely on control systems, sensors, and communication devices which operate at temperatures as high as 500 {\deg}C and beyond. At these extreme temperatures, active (heat exchanger, phase change cooling) or passive (fins and thermal interface materials) cooling strategies add significant mass and complication which is often infeasible. Thus, new material solutions beyond conventional silicon CMOS devices are necessary for high temperature, resilient electronic systems. Accomplishing this will require a united effort to explore development, integration, and ultimately manufacturing of non-silicon-based logic and memory technologies, non-traditional metals for interconnects, and ceramic packaging technology.</description>

      <title>Recent Advancements in Mode Division Multiplexing for Communication and Computation in Silicon Photonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mode Division Multiplexing (MDM) is a technique used over the past decade in Silicon Photonics (SiPh) to incorporate more data into communication links by employing higher-order transverse electric or transverse magnetic modes. MDM was primarily used in optical communication; however, in recent years, there have been several applications of MDM in optical computing, including both classical and quantum computing. Although MDM has shown great promise for increasing the throughput of optical communication and the accuracy and fidelity of optical computation, there are a few challenges towards expanding its applications. One major challenge is the lack of process design kits (PDKs) and building block libraries compatible with standard SiPh foundries. Here, we present a comprehensive library of MDM components developed using classical and inverse design, compatible with standard 220 nm SiPh foundries. The library includes thermo-optic phase shifters, mode multiplexers and demultiplexers, mode converters, mode exchangers, and multi-mode interference couplers. We also discuss our recent achievements in MDM for datacom, classical and quantum optical computing, including a mode-selective switch for mode-reconfigurable optical add-drop multiplexer (ROADM), multimode multiply-accumulate operation, and multimode photonic quantum processors.</description>

      <title>A multiple-timing analysis of temporal ratcheting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.07555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.07555v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a two-timing perturbation analysis to investigate the existence of temporal ratchets in an exemplary system of a particle moving in a tank of fluid in response to an external vibration of the tank. We consider two-mode vibrations with angular frequencies $\omega$ and $\alpha\omega$, where $\alpha$ is a rational number. It has been established, in other physical systems, that if $\alpha$ is a ratio of odd and even integers (e.g., $\tfrac{2}{1}$, $\tfrac{3}{2}$, $\tfrac{4}{3}$), the system yields a net response: here, a nonzero time-average particle velocity. Our first-order and third-order two-timing perturbation schemes predict the existence of temporal ratchets for, respectively, $\alpha=2$ and $\alpha=\tfrac{3}{2}$, $\tfrac{4}{3}$. More importantly, we find closed form formula for the magnitude and direction of the induced net velocities for these $\alpha$ values.</description>

      <title>AlN/Si interface engineering to mitigate RF losses in MOCVD grown GaN-on-Si substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02707v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fabrication of low-RF loss GaN-on-Si HEMT stacks is critical to enable competitive front-end-modules for 5G and 6G applications. The main contribution to RF losses is the interface between the III-N layer and the HR Si wafer, more specifically the AlN/Si interface. At this interface, a parasitic surface conduction layer exists in Si, which decreases the substrate effective resistivity sensed by overlying circuitry below the nominal Si resistivity. However, a clear understanding of this interface with control of the parasitic channel is lacking. In this letter, a detailed physical and electrical description of MOCVD-grown AlN/Si structures is presented. The presence of a $\text{SiC}_\text{x}\text{N}_\text{y}$ interfacial layer is revealed and its importance for RF losses is shown. Through C-V and I-V characterisation, an increase in the C concentration of this interfacial layer is linked to the formation of negative charge at the AlN/Si interface, which counteracts the positive charge present in the 0-predose limit. The variation of TMAl predose is shown to allow precise tuning of the C composition and, consequently, the resulting interface charge. Notably, a linear relationship between predose and net interface charge is observed and confirmed by the fabrication of an AlN/Si sample with close to zero net charge. In addition, a higher $D_{it}$ ($\sim 2\times 10^{12}$ cm$^\text{-2}$) for such compensated samples is observed and can contribute to low RF loss. An exceptionally high effective resistivity of above 8 k$\Omega\cdot$cm is achieved, corresponding to an RF loss below 0.3 dB/mm at 10 GHz.</description>

      <title>The Quantization Monte Carlo method for solving radiative transport equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.11068v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Quantization Monte Carlo method to solve thermal radiative transport equations with possibly several collision regimes, ranging from few collisions to massive number of collisions per time unit. For each particle in a given simulation cell, the proposed method advances the time by replacing many collisions with sampling directly from the escape distribution of the particle. In order to perform the sampling, for each triplet of parameters (opacity, remaining time, initial position in the cell) on a parameter grid, the escape distribution is precomputed offline and only the quantiles are retained. The online computation samples only from this quantized (i.e., discrete) version by choosing a parameter triplet on the grid (close to actual particle's parameters) and returning at random one quantile from the precomputed set of quantiles for that parameter. We first check numerically that the escape laws depend smoothly on the parameters and then implement the procedure on a benchmark with good results.</description>
