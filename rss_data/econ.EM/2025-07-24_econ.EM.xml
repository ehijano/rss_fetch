      <title>Decoding Consumer Preferences Using Attention-Based Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a new demand estimation method using attention-based language models. An encoder-only language model is trained in a two-stage process to analyze the natural language descriptions of used cars from a large US-based online auction marketplace. The approach enables semi-nonparametrically estimation for the demand primitives of a structural model representing the private valuations and market size for each vehicle listing. In the first stage, the language model is fine-tuned to encode the target auction outcomes using the natural language vehicle descriptions. In the second stage, the trained language model's encodings are projected into the parameter space of the structural model. The model's capability to conduct counterfactual analyses within the trained market space is validated using a subsample of withheld auction data, which includes a set of unique "zero shot" instances.</description>

      <title>A general randomized test for Alpha</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a methodology to construct tests for the null hypothesis that the pricing errors of a panel of asset returns are jointly equal to zero in a linear factor asset pricing model -- that is, the null of "zero alpha". We consider, as a leading example, a model with observable, tradable factors, but we also develop extensions to accommodate for non-tradable and latent factors. The test is based on equation-by-equation estimation, using a randomized version of the estimated alphas, which only requires rates of convergence. The distinct features of the proposed methodology are that it does not require the estimation of any covariance matrix, and that it allows for both N and T to pass to infinity, with the former possibly faster than the latter. Further, unlike extant approaches, the procedure can accommodate conditional heteroskedasticity, non-Gaussianity, and even strong cross-sectional dependence in the error terms. We also propose a de-randomized decision rule to choose in favor or against the correct specification of a linear factor pricing model. Monte Carlo simulations show that the test has satisfactory properties and it compares favorably to several existing tests. The usefulness of the testing procedure is illustrated through an application of linear factor pricing models to price the constituents of the S&amp;P 500.</description>

      <title>Identification and Estimation of Causal Effects in High-Frequency Event Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15667v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide precise conditions for nonparametric identification of causal effects by high-frequency event study regressions, which have been used widely in the recent macroeconomics, financial economics and political economy literatures. The high-frequency event study method regresses changes in an outcome variable on a measure of unexpected changes in a policy variable in a narrow time window around an event or a policy announcement (e.g., a 30-minute window around an FOMC announcement). We show that, contrary to popular belief, the narrow size of the window is not sufficient for identification. Rather, the population regression coefficient identifies a causal estimand when (i) the effect of the policy shock on the outcome does not depend on the other variables (separability) and (ii) the surprise component of the news or event dominates all other variables that are present in the event window (relative exogeneity). Technically, the latter condition requires the ratio between the variance of the policy shock and that of the other variables to be infinite in the event window. Under these conditions, we establish the causal meaning of the event study estimand corresponding to the regression coefficient and the consistency and asymptotic normality of the event study estimator. Notably, this standard linear regression estimator is robust to general forms of nonlinearity. We apply our results to Nakamura and Steinsson's (2018a) analysis of the real economic effects of monetary policy, providing a simple empirical procedure to analyze the extent to which the standard event study estimator adequately estimates causal effects of interest.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric "rich covariates" without saturation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21213v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider two nonparametric approaches to ensure that linear instrumental variables estimators satisfy the rich-covariates condition emphasized by Blandhol et al. (2025), even when the instrument is not unconditionally randomly assigned and the model is not saturated. Both approaches start with a nonparametric estimate of the expectation of the instrument conditional on the covariates, and ensure that the rich-covariates condition is satisfied either by using as the instrument the difference between the original instrument and its estimated conditional expectation, or by adding the estimated conditional expectation to the set of regressors. We derive asymptotic properties when the first step uses kernel regression, and assess finite-sample performance in simulations where we also use neural networks in the first step. Finally, we present an empirical illustration that highlights some significant advantages of the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Can we have it all? Non-asymptotically valid and asymptotically exact confidence intervals for expectations and linear regressions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16776v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We contribute to bridging the gap between large- and finite-sample inference by studying confidence sets (CSs) that are both non-asymptotically valid and asymptotically exact uniformly (NAVAE) over semi-parametric statistical models. NAVAE CSs are not easily obtained; for instance, we show they do not exist over the set of Bernoulli distributions. We first derive a generic sufficient condition: NAVAE CSs are available as soon as uniform asymptotically exact CSs are. Second, building on that connection, we construct closed-form NAVAE confidence intervals (CIs) in two standard settings -- scalar expectations and linear combinations of OLS coefficients -- under moment conditions only. For expectations, our sole requirement is a bounded kurtosis. In the OLS case, our moment constraints accommodate heteroskedasticity and weak exogeneity of the regressors. Under those conditions, we enlarge the Central Limit Theorem-based CIs, which are asymptotically exact, to ensure non-asymptotic guarantees. Those modifications vanish asymptotically so that our CIs coincide with the classical ones in the limit. We illustrate the potential and limitations of our approach through a simulation study.</description>
