      <title>Ahead of the Count: An Algorithm for Probabilistic Prediction of Instant Runoff (IRV) Elections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How can we probabilistically predict the winner in a ranked-choice election without all ballots being counted? In this study, we introduce a novel algorithm designed to predict outcomes in Instant Runoff Voting (IRV) elections. The algorithm takes as input a set of discrete probability distributions describing vote totals for each candidate ranking and calculates the probability that each candidate will win the election. In fact, we calculate all possible sequences of eliminations that might occur in the IRV rounds and assign a probability to each.
  The discrete probability distributions can be arbitrary and, in applications, could be measured empirically from pre-election polling data or from partial vote tallies of an in-progress election.
  The algorithm is effective for elections with a small number of candidates (five or fewer), with fast execution on typical consumer computers. The run-time is short enough for our method to be used for real-time election night modeling where new predictions are made continuously as more and more vote information becomes available. We demonstrate the algorithm in abstract examples, and also using real data from the 2022 Alaska state elections to simulate election-night predictions and also predictions of election recounts.</description>

      <title>Contextual Integrity Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The contextual integrity model is a widely accepted way of analyzing the plurality of norms that are colloquially called "privacy norms". Contextual integrity systematically describes such norms by distinguishing the type of data concerned, the three social agents involved (subject, sender, and recipient) and the transmission principle governing the transfer of information. It allows analyzing privacy norms in terms of their impact on the interaction of those agents with one another.
  This paper places contextual integrity in a strict game theoretic framework. When such description is possible it has three key advantages: Firstly, it allows indisputable utilitarian justification of some privacy norms. Secondly, it better relates privacy to topics which are well understood by stakeholders whose education is predominantly quantitative, such as engineers and economists. Thirdly, it is an absolute necessity when describing ethical constraints to machines such as AI agents.
  In addition to describing games which capture paradigmatic informational norms, the paper also analyzes cases in which the game, per se, does not encourage normative behavior. The paper discusses two main forms of mechanisms which can be applied to the game in such cases, and shows that they reflect accepted privacy regulation and technologies.</description>

      <title>Desk-AId: Humanitarian Aid Desk Assessment with Geospatial AI for Predicting Landmine Areas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The process of clearing areas, namely demining, starts by assessing and prioritizing potential hazardous areas (i.e., desk assessment) to go under thorough investigation of experts, who confirm the risk and proceed with the mines clearance operations. This paper presents Desk-AId that supports the desk assessment phase by estimating landmine risks using geospatial data and socioeconomic information. Desk-AId uses a Geospatial AI approach specialized to landmines. The approach includes mixed data sampling strategies and context-enrichment by historical conflicts and key multi-domain facilities (e.g., buildings, roads, health sites). The proposed system addresses the issue of having only ground-truth for confirmed hazardous areas by implementing a new hard-negative data sampling strategy, where negative points are sampled in the vicinity of hazardous areas. Experiments validate Desk-Aid in two domains for landmine risk assessment: 1) country-wide, and 2) uncharted study areas). The proposed approach increases the estimation accuracies up to 92%, for different classification models such as RandomForest (RF), Feedforward Neural Networks (FNN), and Graph Neural Networks (GNN).</description>

      <title>Artificial Intelligence for the Internal Democracy of Political Parties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The article argues that AI can enhance the measurement and implementation of democratic processes within political parties, known as Intra-Party Democracy (IPD). It identifies the limitations of traditional methods for measuring IPD, which often rely on formal parameters, self-reported data, and tools like surveys. Such limitations lead to the collection of partial data, rare updates, and significant demands on resources. To address these issues, the article suggests that specific data management and Machine Learning (ML) techniques, such as natural language processing and sentiment analysis, can improve the measurement (ML about) and practice (ML for) of IPD. The article concludes by considering some of the principal risks of ML for IPD, including concerns over data privacy, the potential for manipulation, and the dangers of overreliance on technology.</description>

      <title>A community palm model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Palm oil production has been identified as one of the major drivers of deforestation for tropical countries. To meet supply chain objectives, commodity producers and other stakeholders need timely information of land cover dynamics in their supply shed. However, such data are difficult to obtain from suppliers who may lack digital geographic representations of their supply sheds and production locations. Here we present a "community model," a machine learning model trained on pooled data sourced from many different stakeholders, to develop a specific land cover probability map, in this case a semi-global oil palm map. An advantage of this method is the inclusion of varied inputs, the ability to easily update the model as new training data becomes available and run the model on any year that input imagery is available. Inclusion of diverse data sources into one probability map can help establish a shared understanding across stakeholders on the presence and absence of a land cover or commodity (in this case oil palm). The model predictors are annual composites built from publicly available satellite imagery provided by Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and ALOS DSM. We provide map outputs as the probability of palm in a given pixel, to reflect the uncertainty of the underlying state (palm or not palm). The initial version of this model provides global accuracy estimated to be approximately 90% (at 0.5 probability threshold) from spatially partitioned test data. This model, and resulting oil palm probability map products are useful for accurately identifying the geographic footprint of palm cultivation. Used in conjunction with timely deforestation information, this palm model is useful for understanding the risk of continued oil palm plantation expansion in sensitive forest areas.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic Fairness: A Tolerance Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in machine learning and deep learning have brought algorithmic fairness into sharp focus, illuminating concerns over discriminatory decision making that negatively impacts certain individuals or groups. These concerns have manifested in legal, ethical, and societal challenges, including the erosion of trust in intelligent systems. In response, this survey delves into the existing literature on algorithmic fairness, specifically highlighting its multifaceted social consequences. We introduce a novel taxonomy based on 'tolerance', a term we define as the degree to which variations in fairness outcomes are acceptable, providing a structured approach to understanding the subtleties of fairness within algorithmic decisions. Our systematic review covers diverse industries, revealing critical insights into the balance between algorithmic decision making and social equity. By synthesizing these insights, we outline a series of emerging challenges and propose strategic directions for future research and policy making, with the goal of advancing the field towards more equitable algorithmic systems.</description>

      <title>Deceptive, Disruptive, No Big Deal: Japanese People React to Simulated Dark Commercial Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark patterns and deceptive designs (DPs) are user interface elements that trick people into taking actions that benefit the purveyor. Such designs are widely deployed, with special varieties found in certain nations like Japan that can be traced to global power hierarchies and the local socio-linguistic context of use. In this breaking work, we report on the first user study involving Japanese people (n=30) experiencing a mock shopping website injected with simulated DPs. We found that Alphabet Soup and Misleading Reference Pricing were the most deceptive and least noticeable. Social Proofs, Sneaking in Items, and Untranslation were the least deceptive but Untranslation prevented most from cancelling their account. Mood significantly worsened after experiencing the website. We contribute the first empirical findings on a Japanese consumer base alongside a scalable approach to evaluating user attitudes, perceptions, and behaviours towards DPs in an interactive context. We urge for more human participant research and ideally collaborations with industry to assess real designs in the wild.</description>

      <title>Theorizing Deception: A Scoping Review of Theory in Research on Dark Patterns and Deceptive Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The issue of dark patterns and deceptive designs (DPs) in everyday interfaces and interactions continues to grow. DPs are manipulative and malicious elements within user interfaces that deceive users into making unintended choices. In parallel, research on DPs has significantly increased over the past two decades. As the field has matured, epistemological gaps have also become a salient and pressing concern. In this scoping review, we assessed the academic work so far -- 51 papers between 2014 to 2023 -- to identify the state of theory in DP research. We identified the key theories employed, examined how these theories have been referenced, and call for enhancing the incorporation of theory into DP research. We also propose broad theoretical foundations to establish a comprehensive and solid base for contextualizing and informing future DP research from a variety of theoretical scopes and lenses.</description>

      <title>Cross-Cultural Validation of Partner Models for Voice User Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent research has begun to assess people's perceptions of voice user interfaces (VUIs) as dialogue partners, termed partner models. Current self-report measures are only available in English, limiting research to English-speaking users. To improve the diversity of user samples and contexts that inform partner modelling research, we translated, localized, and evaluated the Partner Modelling Questionnaire (PMQ) for non-English speaking Western (German, n=185) and East Asian (Japanese, n=198) cohorts where VUI use is popular. Through confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), we find that the scale produces equivalent levels of goodness-to-fit for both our German and Japanese translations, confirming its cross-cultural validity. Still, the structure of the communicative flexibility factor did not replicate directly across Western and East Asian cohorts. We discuss how our translations can open up critical research on cultural similarities and differences in partner model use and design, whilst highlighting the challenges for ensuring accurate translation across cultural contexts.</description>

      <title>Does Machine Bring in Extra Bias in Learning? Approximating Fairness in Models Promptly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Providing various machine learning (ML) applications in the real world, concerns about discrimination hidden in ML models are growing, particularly in high-stakes domains. Existing techniques for assessing the discrimination level of ML models include commonly used group and individual fairness measures. However, these two types of fairness measures are usually hard to be compatible with each other, and even two different group fairness measures might be incompatible as well. To address this issue, we investigate to evaluate the discrimination level of classifiers from a manifold perspective and propose a "harmonic fairness measure via manifolds (HFM)" based on distances between sets. Yet the direct calculation of distances might be too expensive to afford, reducing its practical applicability. Therefore, we devise an approximation algorithm named "Approximation of distance between sets (ApproxDist)" to facilitate accurate estimation of distances, and we further demonstrate its algorithmic effectiveness under certain reasonable assumptions. Empirical results indicate that the proposed fairness measure HFM is valid and that the proposed ApproxDist is effective and efficient.</description>

      <title>DemOpts: Fairness corrections in COVID-19 case prediction models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: COVID-19 forecasting models have been used to inform decision making around resource allocation and intervention decisions e.g., hospital beds or stay-at-home orders. State of the art deep learning models often use multimodal data such as mobility or socio-demographic data to enhance COVID-19 case prediction models. Nevertheless, related work has revealed under-reporting bias in COVID-19 cases as well as sampling bias in mobility data for certain minority racial and ethnic groups, which could in turn affect the fairness of the COVID-19 predictions along race labels. In this paper, we show that state of the art deep learning models output mean prediction errors that are significantly different across racial and ethnic groups; and which could, in turn, support unfair policy decisions. We also propose a novel de-biasing method, DemOpts, to increase the fairness of deep learning based forecasting models trained on potentially biased datasets. Our results show that DemOpts can achieve better error parity that other state of the art de-biasing approaches, thus effectively reducing the differences in the mean error distributions across more racial and ethnic groups.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic Pluralism: A Structural Approach To Equal Opportunity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.08157v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a structural approach toward achieving equal opportunity in systems of algorithmic decision-making called algorithmic pluralism. Algorithmic pluralism describes a state of affairs in which no set of algorithms severely limits access to opportunity, allowing individuals the freedom to pursue a diverse range of life paths. To argue for algorithmic pluralism, we adopt Joseph Fishkin's theory of bottlenecks, which focuses on the structure of decision-points that determine how opportunities are allocated. The theory contends that each decision-point or bottleneck limits access to opportunities with some degree of severity and legitimacy. We extend Fishkin's structural viewpoint and use it to reframe existing systemic concerns about equal opportunity in algorithmic decision-making, such as patterned inequality and algorithmic monoculture. In proposing algorithmic pluralism, we argue for the urgent priority of alleviating severe bottlenecks in algorithmic decision-making. We contend that there must be a pluralism of opportunity available to many different individuals in order to promote equal opportunity in a systemic way. We further show how this framework has several implications for system design and regulation through current debates about equal opportunity in algorithmic hiring.</description>

      <title>AI Art is Theft: Labour, Extraction, and Exploitation, Or, On the Dangers of Stochastic Pollocks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06178v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since the launch of applications such as DALL-E, Midjourney, and Stable Diffusion, generative artificial intelligence has been controversial as a tool for creating artwork. While some have presented longtermist worries about these technologies as harbingers of fully automated futures to come, more pressing is the impact of generative AI on creative labour in the present. Already, business leaders have begun replacing human artistic labour with AI-generated images. In response, the artistic community has launched a protest movement, which argues that AI image generation is a kind of theft. This paper analyzes, substantiates, and critiques these arguments, concluding that AI image generators involve an unethical kind of labour theft. If correct, many other AI applications also rely upon theft.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13142v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dreams of machines rivaling human intelligence have shaped the field of AI since its inception. Yet, the very meaning of human-level AI or artificial general intelligence (AGI) remains elusive and contested. Definitions of AGI embrace a diverse range of incompatible values and assumptions. Contending with the fractured worldviews of AGI discourse is vital for critiques that pursue different values and futures. To that end, we provide a taxonomy of AGI definitions, laying the ground for examining the key social, political, and ethical assumptions they make. We highlight instances in which these definitions frame AGI or human-level AI as a technical topic and expose the value-laden choices being implicitly made. Drawing on feminist, STS, and social science scholarship on the political and social character of intelligence in both humans and machines, we propose contextual, democratic, and participatory paths to imagining future forms of machine intelligence. The development of future forms of AI must involve explicit attention to the values it encodes, the people it includes or excludes, and a commitment to epistemic justice.</description>

      <title>Foregrounding Artist Opinions: A Survey Study on Transparency, Ownership, and Fairness in AI Generative Art</title>

Abstract: Generative AI tools are used to create art-like outputs and sometimes aid in the creative process. These tools have potential benefits for artists, but they also have the potential to harm the art workforce and infringe upon artistic and intellectual property rights. Without explicit consent from artists, Generative AI creators scrape artists' digital work to train Generative AI models and produce art-like outputs at scale. These outputs are now being used to compete with human artists in the marketplace as well as being used by some artists in their generative processes to create art. We surveyed 459 artists to investigate the tension between artists' opinions on Generative AI art's potential utility and harm. This study surveys artists' opinions on the utility and threat of Generative AI art models, fair practices in the disclosure of artistic works in AI art training models, ownership and rights of AI art derivatives, and fair compensation. Results show that a majority of artists believe creators should disclose what art is being used in AI training, that AI outputs should not belong to model creators, and express concerns about AI's impact on the art workforce and who profits from their art. We hope the results of this work will further meaningful collaboration and alignment between the art community and Generative AI researchers and developers.</description>

      <title>Cleansing Jewel: A Neural Spelling Correction Model Built On Google OCR-ed Tibetan Manuscripts</title>

Abstract: Scholars in the humanities rely heavily on ancient manuscripts to study history, religion, and socio-political structures in the past. Many efforts have been devoted to digitizing these precious manuscripts using OCR technology, but most manuscripts were blemished over the centuries so that an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) program cannot be expected to capture faded graphs and stains on pages. This work presents a neural spelling correction model built on Google OCR-ed Tibetan Manuscripts to auto-correct OCR-ed noisy output. This paper is divided into four sections: dataset, model architecture, training and analysis. First, we feature-engineered our raw Tibetan etext corpus into two sets of structured data frames -- a set of paired toy data and a set of paired real data. Then, we implemented a Confidence Score mechanism into the Transformer architecture to perform spelling correction tasks. According to the Loss and Character Error Rate, our Transformer + Confidence score mechanism architecture proves to be superior to Transformer, LSTM-2-LSTM and GRU-2-GRU architectures. Finally, to examine the robustness of our model, we analyzed erroneous tokens, visualized Attention and Self-Attention heatmaps in our model.</description>

      <title>Multilingual Text-to-Image Generation Magnifies Gender Stereotypes and Prompt Engineering May Not Help You</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16092v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Text-to-image generation models have recently achieved astonishing results in image quality, flexibility, and text alignment, and are consequently employed in a fast-growing number of applications. Through improvements in multilingual abilities, a larger community now has access to this technology. However, our results show that multilingual models suffer from significant gender biases just as monolingual models do. Furthermore, the natural expectation that multilingual models will provide similar results across languages does not hold up. Instead, there are important differences between languages. We propose a novel benchmark, MAGBIG, intended to foster research on gender bias in multilingual models. We use MAGBIG to investigate the effect of multilingualism on gender bias in T2I models. To this end, we construct multilingual prompts requesting portraits of people with a certain occupation or trait. Our results show that not only do models exhibit strong gender biases but they also behave differently across languages. Furthermore, we investigate prompt engineering strategies, such as indirect, neutral formulations, to mitigate these biases. Unfortunately, these approaches have limited success and result in worse text-to-image alignment. Consequently, we call for more research into diverse representations across languages in image generators, as well as into steerability to address biased model behavior.</description>

      <title>Not My Voice! A Taxonomy of Ethical and Safety Harms of Speech Generators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01708v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid and wide-scale adoption of AI to generate human speech poses a range of significant ethical and safety risks to society that need to be addressed. For example, a growing number of speech generation incidents are associated with swatting attacks in the United States, where anonymous perpetrators create synthetic voices that call police officers to close down schools and hospitals, or to violently gain access to innocent citizens' homes. Incidents like this demonstrate that multimodal generative AI risks and harms do not exist in isolation, but arise from the interactions of multiple stakeholders and technical AI systems. In this paper we analyse speech generation incidents to study how patterns of specific harms arise. We find that specific harms can be categorised according to the exposure of affected individuals, that is to say whether they are a subject of, interact with, suffer due to, or are excluded from speech generation systems. Similarly, specific harms are also a consequence of the motives of the creators and deployers of the systems. Based on these insights we propose a conceptual framework for modelling pathways to ethical and safety harms of AI, which we use to develop a taxonomy of harms of speech generators. Our relational approach captures the complexity of risks and harms in sociotechnical AI systems, and yields a taxonomy that can support appropriate policy interventions and decision making for the responsible development and release of speech generation models.</description>

      <title>LLM Voting: Human Choices and AI Collective Decision Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01766v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the voting behaviors of Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically GPT-4 and LLaMA-2, their biases, and how they align with human voting patterns. Our methodology involved using a dataset from a human voting experiment to establish a baseline for human preferences and a corresponding experiment with LLM agents. We observed that the methods used for voting input and the presentation of choices influence LLM voting behavior. We discovered that varying the persona can reduce some of these biases and enhance alignment with human choices. While the Chain-of-Thought approach did not improve prediction accuracy, it has potential for AI explainability in the voting process. We also identified a trade-off between preference diversity and alignment accuracy in LLMs, influenced by different temperature settings. Our findings indicate that LLMs may lead to less diverse collective outcomes and biased assumptions when used in voting scenarios, emphasizing the importance of cautious integration of LLMs into democratic processes.</description>
