      <title>Orthosymplectic Quotient Quiver Subtraction II: Framed Quivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The technique of $\textit{orthosymplectic quotient quiver subtraction}$ is introduced for framed orthosymplectic quivers. This involves subtracting an $\textit{orthosymplectic quotient quiver}$ from a framed orthosymplectic $3d\;\mathcal N=4$ quiver gauge theory which has the effect of gauging an $\mathrm{SO}(n)$ or $\mathrm{Sp}(n)$ subgroup of the IR Coulomb branch global symmetry with complete Higgsing. The orthosymplectic quotient quivers take the form of magnetic quivers for class $\mathcal S$ theories on cylinders with (twisted) maximal punctures of simply laced algebras, similar to the case of unitary quotient quiver subtraction. This gives a set of quotient quivers for all classical groups. Notably, quotient quiver subtraction for framed and unframed orthosymplectic quivers are different procedures.</description>

      <title>Vacua and infrared radiation in de Sitter quantum field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the asymptotic behavior of quantum fields and perturbative quantum gravity in de Sitter space. We show that the necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a de Sitter invariant vacuum state in the free theory is if the local field observables commute with the ``memory observable'' on any cosmological horizon. This criterion yields simple, gauge-invariant proofs of the existence of a de Sitter invariant vacuum for the (source-free) massive scalar field, electromagnetic field and linearized gravitational field. However, the massless, minimally coupled scalar does not satisfy this criterion and, consequently, there is no de Sitter invariant vacuum state. In this case, we construct the Hilbert space of normalizable states that have ``square integrable'' distributions in the memory and the conjugate constant mode. This Hilbert space has a unitary representation of the de Sitter symmetry group but no de Sitter invariant normalizable state. However even for free theories with a normalizable de Sitter invariant vacuum we show, by a simple example, that in the presence of a source a large number of infrared particles can be produced if the source interacts with the field for timescales much longer than the Hubble time. In the limit as the source persists forever it emits an infinite number of infrared particles.</description>

      <title>Black Hole Transitions, AdS and the Distance Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the connection between black hole instabilities and Swampland constraints, presenting new insights into the AdS Distance Conjecture. By examining the scale at which horizon instabilities of Schwarzschild-AdS$_d$ black holes take place$-\Lambda_{\mathrm{BH}}-$we uncover a universal scaling relation, $\Lambda_{\mathrm{BH}}\sim |\Lambda_{\mathrm{AdS}}|^{\alpha}$, with $\frac{1}{d}\leq \alpha\leq \frac{1}{2}$, linking the emergence of towers of states directly to instability scales as $\Lambda_{\mathrm{AdS}}\to 0$. This approach circumvents the explicit dependence on field-space distances, offering a refined formulation of the AdS Distance Conjecture grounded in physical black hole scales. From a top-down perspective, we find that these instability scales correspond precisely to the Gregory-Laflamme and Horowitz-Polchinski transitions, as expected for the flat space limit, and consistently with our proposed bounds. Furthermore, revisiting explicit calculations in type IIB string theory on AdS$_5\times S^5$, we illustrate how higher-derivative corrections may alter these bounds, potentially extending their applicability towards the interior of moduli space. Using also general results about gravitational collapse in AdS, our analysis points towards a possible breakdown of the conjecture in $d&gt;10$, suggesting an intriguing upper limit on the number of non-compact spacetime dimensions. Finally, we briefly discuss parallel considerations and implications for the dS case.</description>

      <title>A Supertwistor Formalism for $\mathcal{N}=1,2,3,4\;\text{SCFT}_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a manifest supertwistor space formalism for three dimensional $\mathcal{N}=1, 2,3,4$ superconformal field theories. This formalism simultaneously makes manifest the supersymmetry, conformal invariance and conservation. We solve two and three point correlators of (half) integer spin conserved supercurrents using the graded supergroup generators. Apart from the superconformal generators, we find that the superhelicity operators are necessary to fix their functional form in this setup. The superhelicity operators can be recast into first order Euler equations which besides the standard polynomial solutions, also admit weak solutions that are distributional in nature. They play an important role in the case of three point functions, where the super-correlator takes the form of a product of delta functions. Interestingly, we find that these super-correlators are extremely simple, elegant and uniform for all spins and for all $\mathcal{N}\leq4$, which resemble the non supersymmetric correlators where the twistors are replaced with appropriately defined supertwistors.</description>

      <title>The BPHZL renormalization of a planar quantum electrodynamics up to 2-loops and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The renormalization of a parity-even massless $U(1)\times U(1)$ quantum electrodynamics in three space-time dimensions (QED$_3$) is studied by adopting the Bogoliubov-Parasiuk-Hepp-Zimmermann-Lowenstein (BPHZL) renormalization method. The presence of two massless fermions requires the Lowenstein-Zimmermann (LZ) subtraction scheme to renormalize the infrared divergences induced by the ultraviolet subtractions at 1- and 2-loops, moreover due to the model superrenormalizability the ultraviolet divergences are bounded up to 2-loops. Finally, through the BPHZL renormalization method together with the LZ subtraction scheme the ultraviolet and infrared finiteness of the model is proved up to 2-loops and beyond.</description>

      <title>Structure of Loop Space at Finite $N$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The space of invariants for a single matrix is generated by traces containing at most $N$ matrices per trace. We extend this analysis to multi-matrix models at finite $N$. Using the Molien-Weyl formula, we compute partition functions for various multi-matrix models at different $N$ and interpret them through trace relations. This allows us to identify a complete set of invariants, naturally divided into two distinct classes: primary and secondary. The full invariant ring of the multi-matrix model is reconstructed via the Hironaka decomposition, where primary invariants act freely, while secondary invariants satisfy quadratic relations. Significantly, while traces with at most $N$ matrices are always present, we also find invariants involving more than $N$ matrices per trace. The primary invariants correspond to perturbative degrees of freedom, whereas the secondary invariants emerge as non-trivial background structures. The growth of secondary invariants aligns with expectations from black hole entropy, suggesting deep structural connections to gravitational systems.</description>

      <title>Packaged Quantum States and Symmetry: A Group-Theoretic Framework for Gauge-Invariant Packaged Entanglements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a group-theoretic framework showing that any nontrivial representation of a finite or compact group inherently induces packaged entanglement (in which every internal quantum numbers are inseparably entangled) in multiparticle quantum systems. 
In this framework, each single-particle excitation carries an inseparable block of internal quantum numbers dictated by its irreducible representation. 
The local gauge constraints or superselection rules forbid any partial fractionation of charges or quantum labels. 
We illustrate this principle through gauge symmetries ($U(1)$, $SU(2)$, and $SU(3)$), discrete symmetries (charge conjugation $C$, parity $P$, time reversal $T$, and their combinations), and $p$-form symmetries. 
In each case, physical requirements (e.g., gauge invariance or superselection) ensure that the resulting states cannot be factorized. These naturally explain phenomena like Bell-type structures, color confinement, and hybrid gauge-invariant configurations. 
The packaging principle bridges concepts in gauge theory, quantum information, and topological classifications. Our results may be useful for applications in exotic hadron spectroscopy, the exploration of extended symmetries in field theory, and quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Quantum Signatures of Chaos from Free Probability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A classical dynamical system can be viewed as a probability space equipped with a measure-preserving time evolution map, admitting a purely algebraic formulation in terms of the algebra of bounded functions on the phase space. Similarly, a quantum dynamical system can be formulated using an algebra of bounded operators in a non-commutative probability space equipped with a time evolution map. Chaos, in either setting, can be characterized by statistical independence between observables at $ t = 0 $ and $ t \to \infty $, leading to the vanishing of cumulants involving these observables. In the quantum case, the notion of independence is replaced by free independence, which only emerges in the thermodynamic limit (asymptotic freeness). In this work, we propose a definition of quantum chaos based on asymptotic freeness and investigate its emergence in quantum many-body systems including the mixed-field Ising model with a random magnetic field, a higher spin version of the same model, and the SYK model. The hallmark of asymptotic freeness is the emergence of the free convolution prediction for the spectrum of operators of the form $ A(0) + B(t) $, implying the vanishing of all free cumulants between $A(0)$ and $B(t)$ in the thermodynamic limit for an infinite-temperature thermal state. We systematically investigate the spectral properties of $ A(0) + B(t) $ in the above-mentioned models, show that fluctuations on top of the free convolution prediction follow universal Wigner-Dyson statistics, and discuss the connection with quantum chaos. Finally, we argue that free probability theory provides a rigorous framework for understanding quantum chaos, offering a unifying perspective that connects many different manifestations of it.</description>

      <title>Energy transport in holographic non-conformal interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study energy transport in a system of two dimensional conformal field theories exchanging energy across a non-conformal interface involving a localised scalar operator, using holographic duality. By imposing the sourceless boundary condition, or equivalently, enforcing energy conservation at the interface, we show that the sum of the transmission and reflection coefficients is equal to one. Unlike conformal interfaces, we find that both the energy transmission and reflection coefficients are generally complex and frequency dependent. When the interface brane connects two distinct AdS$_2$ geometries, the transmission coefficient approaches the value expected for a conformal interface in the UV regime at high frequencies and in the IR regime at low frequencies. In the intermediate frequency range, the transmission coefficient may exhibit oscillatory behavior. Moreover, we present a nontrivial example of a fully transmissive interface, which exhibits similarities to a topological interface.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We continue the study of Carroll limits on partition functions of relativistic conformal theories and their thermodynamics. By introducing imaginary chemical potentials $v$ conjugate to momenta, one can access and study the Carroll regime in which $v\gg c$. We analyze examples of free massless particles, 2d CFTs and some free field theories in $d$ spatial dimensions. For 2d holographic CFTs, we revisit and clarify further the connection between the Carroll limit and the flat space limit of BTZ black holes. The general picture, valid in any dimension, is that, starting from AdS/CFT, the boundary Carrollian field theory lives on the horizon of a large black hole in AdS, which is pushed to the null boundary in the flat space limit.</description>

      <title>Aspects of canonical differential equations for Calabi-Yau geometries and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show how a method to construct canonical differential equations for multi-loop Feynman integrals recently introduced by some of the authors can be extended to cases where the associated geometry is of Calabi-Yau type and even beyond. This can be achieved by supplementing the method with information from the mixed Hodge structure of the underlying geometry. We apply these ideas to specific classes of integrals whose associated geometry is a one-parameter family of Calabi-Yau varieties, and we argue that the method can always be successfully applied to those cases. Moreover, we perform an in-depth study of the properties of the resulting canonical differential equations. In particular, we show that the resulting canonical basis is equivalent to the one obtained by an alternative method recently introduced in the literature. We apply our method to non-trivial and cutting-edge examples of Feynman integrals necessary for gravitational wave scattering, further showcasing its power and flexibility.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Double-scaled SYK (DSSYK) is known to have an underlying quantum group theoretical description. We precisely pinpoint the quantum group structure, improving upon earlier work in the literature. This allows us to utilize this framework for bulk gravitational applications. We explain bulk discretization in DSSYK from the underlying irreducibility of the representations. We derive trumpet and brane amplitudes using character insertions of the quantum group, simplifying earlier calculations. Most importantly, we factorize the bulk Hilbert space dual to DSSYK in the quantum group description using a complete set of edge degrees of freedom living at a bulk entangling surface. An analogous treatment for $\mathcal{N}=1$ DSSYK is provided in the same quantum group theoretical framework.</description>

      <title>How Much NEC Breaking Can the Universe Endure?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum fields can notoriously violate the null energy condition (NEC). In a cosmological context, NEC violation can lead to, e.g., dark energy at late times with an equation-of-state parameter smaller than $-1$ and nonsingular bounces at early times. However, it is expected that there should still be a limit in semiclasssical gravity to how much `negative energy' can accumulate over time and in space as a result of quantum effects. In the course of formulating quantum-motivated energy conditions, the smeared null energy condition has emerged as a recent proposal. This condition conjectures the existence of a semilocal bound on negative energy along null geodesics, which is expected to hold in semiclassical gravity. In this work, we show how the smeared null energy condition translates into theoretical constraints on NEC-violating cosmologies. Specifically, we derive the implied bounds on dark energy equation-of-state parameters and an inequality between the duration of a bouncing phase and the growth rate of the Hubble parameter at the bounce. In the case of dark energy, we identify the parameter space over which the smeared null energy condition is consistent with the recent constraints from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI).</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We search for signatures of extremely long-baseline oscillations between left- and right-handed neutrinos using the high-energy astrophysical neutrino spectra measured by IceCube. We assume the astrophysical neutrino sources to be distributed in redshift following the star formation rate and use the IceCube all-sky flux measurements from TeV to PeV energies. We find, for the first time, that $\delta m^2$ in the range $2\times 10^{-19}$ to $3 \times 10^{-18}\textrm{eV}^2$ is disfavored at the $3\sigma$ confidence level, while there exists a preference for a $\delta m^2$ of $1.9 \times 10^{-19}\textrm{eV}^2$ at $2.8\sigma$. This preference for quasi-Dirac neutrinos is driven by the tension between cascade and track measurements below $30~\textrm{TeV}$.</description>

      <title>Gross-Neveu-XY quantum criticality in moir\'e Dirac materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional van-der-Waals materials offer a highly tunable platform for engineering electronic band structures and interactions. By employing techniques such as twisting, gating, or applying pressure, these systems enable precise control over the electronic excitation spectrum. In moir\'e bilayer graphene, the tunability facilitates the transition from a symmetric Dirac semimetal phase through a quantum critical point into an interaction-induced long-range ordered phase with a finite band gap. At charge neutrality, the ordered state proposed to emerge from twist-angle tuning is the Kramers intervalley-coherent insulator. In this case, the transition falls into the quantum universality class of the relativistic Gross-Neveu-XY model in 2+1 dimensions. Here, we refine estimates for the critical exponents characterizing this universality class using an expansion around the lower critical space-time dimension of two. We compute the order-parameter anomalous dimension $\eta_\varphi$ and the correlation-length exponent $\nu$ at one-loop order, and the fermion anomalous dimension $\eta_\psi$ at two-loop order. Combining these results with previous findings from the expansion around the upper critical dimension, we obtain improved estimates for the universal exponents in $2+1$ dimensions via Pad\'e interpolation. For $N_\mathrm{f} = 4$ four-component Dirac fermions, relevant to moir\'e bilayer graphene, we estimate $1/\nu=0.916(5)$, $\eta_\varphi=0.926(13)$, and $\eta_\psi=0.0404(13)$. For $N_\mathrm{f} = 2$, potentially relevant to recent tetralayer WSe$_2$ experiments, the Gross-Neveu-XY fixed point may be unstable due to a fixed-point collision at $N_\mathrm{f,c}$, with $N_\mathrm{f,c} = 1 + \sqrt{2} + \mathcal{O}(\epsilon)$ in the expansion around the lower critical dimension.</description>

      <title>Phenomenological implications of a class of non-invertible selection rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Through well-motivated models in particle physics, we demonstrate the power of a general class of selection rules from non-invertible fusion algebra that are only exact at low orders in perturbation theory. Surprisingly, these non-invertible selection rules can even be applied to the minimal extension of the Standard Model, which is to add a gauge-singlet real scalar. In this model, we show that Fibonacci fusion rules can lead to experimentally testable features for the scattering processes of the real scalar. We anticipate that this class of non-invertible selection rules can be applied to a wide range of models beyond the Standard Model. To further strengthen our methodology, we discuss a dark matter model based on the Ising fusion rules, where the dark matter is labeled by the non-invertible element in the algebra, hence its stability is preserved at all loop orders.</description>

      <title>Dynamical nonlinear tails in Schwarzschild black hole ringdown</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear tails in black hole perturbations, arising from second-order effects, present a distinct departure from the well-known Price tail of linear theory. We present an analytical derivation of the power law indices and amplitudes for nonlinear tails stemming from outgoing sources, and validate these predictions to percent-level accuracy with numerical simulations. We then perform a perturbative analysis on the dynamical formation of nonlinear tails in a self-interacting scalar field model, wherein the nonlinear tails are sourced by a $\lambda \Phi^3$ cubic coupling. Due to cascading mode excitations and back-reactions, nonlinear tails with $t^{-l-1}$ power law are sourced in each harmonic mode, dominating the late time behavior of the scalar perturbations. In verification, we conducted numerical simulations of the self-interacting scalar model, including all real spherical harmonic (RSH) with $l\leq 4$ and their respective nonlinear couplings. We find general agreement between the predicted and numerical power law indices and amplitudes for the nonlinear tails, with the exception of $l=4$ modes, which display $t^{-4}$ power law instead of the predicted $t^{-5}$. This discrepancy is due to distortion in the source of the tails, which is caused by another nonlinear effect. These results establish nonlinear tails as universal features of black hole dynamics, with implications for gravitational wave astronomy: they may imprint observable signatures in merger remnants, offering novel probes of strong-field gravity and nonlinear mode couplings.</description>

Abstract: We derive the one-loop effective 3-dimensional Lagrangian that describes the high-temperature limit of the electroweak theory, to order $\mathcal{O}(g^6)$ in coupling constants $g$, including corrections due to Matsubara modes of both fermionic and bosonic degrees of freedom. We clarify certain aspects of the gauge-independence of physical parameters. We also extend the calculation to the Standard Model effective field theory, paving the way, in particular, for a precise study of the electroweak phase transition within this framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present semi-analytical solutions for the evolution of both the temperature and chemical potentials for viscous Gubser flow with conserved charges. Such a solution can be especially useful in testing numerical codes intended to simulate relativistic fluids with large chemical potentials. The freeze-out hypersurface profiles for constant energy density are calculated, along with the corresponding normal vectors and presented as a new unit test for numerical codes. We also compare the influence of the equation of state on the semi-analytical solutions. We benchmark the newly developed Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) code CCAKE that includes both shear viscosity and three conserved charges. The numerical solutions are in excellent agreement with the semi-analytical solution and also are able to accurately reproduce the hypersurface at freeze-out.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the notion of topological T-duality from oriented sphere bundles to transgressive fibrations, a more general type fibration characterised by the abundance of transgressive elements. Examples of transgressive fibrations include principal $\mathrm{U}(n)$-bundles therefore our notion of T-duality belongs to the realm of non-Abelian T-duality. We prove that transgressive T-duals have isomorphic twisted cohomology. We then introduce Clifford--Courant algebroids, show that one can assign such an algebroid to a transgressive fibration and that transgressive T-duals have isomorphic Clifford--Courant algebroids. We provide several examples illustrating different properties of T-dual spaces.</description>

      <title>Four-loop anomalous dimension of flavor non-singlet twist-two operator of general Lorentz spin in QCD: zeta(3) term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the anomalous dimension of the flavor non-singlet twist-two quark operator of arbitrary Lorentz spin N at four loops in QCD and construct its contribution proportional to zeta(3) in analytic form by applying advanced methods of number theory on the available knowledge of low-N moments. In conjunction with similar results on the zeta(5) and zeta(4) contributions, this completes our knowledge of the transcendental part of the considered anomalous dimension. This also provides important constraints on the as-yet elusive all-N form of the rational part. Via Mellin transformation, we thus obtain the exact functional form in x of the respective piece of the non-singlet Dokshitzer-Gribov-Lipatov-Altarelli-Parisi splitting function at four loops. This allows us to appreciably reduce the theoretical uncertainty in the approximation of that splitting function otherwise amenable from the first few low-N moments.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Dark Universe: A European Strategy for Axions and other WISPs Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Axions and other very weakly interacting slim (with $m &lt;$ 1 GeV) particles (WISPs) are a common feature of several extensions of the Standard Model of Particle Physics. The search of WISPs was already recommended in the last update of the European strategy on particle physics (ESPP). After that, the physics case for WISPs has gained additional momentum. Indeed, WISPs may provide a new paradigm to explain the nature of dark matter and puzzling astrophysical and particle physics observations. This document briefly summarizes current searches for WISPs and the perspectives in this research field for the next decade, ranging from their theoretical underpinning, over their indirect observational consequences in astrophysics, to their search in laboratory experiments. It is stressed that in Europe a rich, diverse, and low-cost experimental program is already underway with the potential for one or more game-changing discoveries. In this context, it is also reported the role of the EU funded COST Action ''Cosmic WISPers in the Dark Universe: Theory, astrophysics, and experiments'' (CA21106, https://www.cost.eu/actions/CA21106) in coordinating and supporting WISPs searches in Europe, shaping a roadmap to track the strategy to guarantee a European leadership in this field of research. This document has been submitted in March 2025 as an input to the update process of the ESPP.</description>

      <title>Experimental Signatures for Identifying Distinct Origins of Color Field Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Signatures for non-abelian dynamics have long been central to QCD and QGP. Equally important are they in spin systems and laser-plasma interactions, where they emerge as effective interactions. Distinguishing experimentally gauge inequivalent sources (and hence potentials) that produce the same field tensor is one major task in this endeavour. As a step in this direction, this paper investigates how physically distinct sources which produce the same color electric field (uniform and constant) may be distinguished experimentally in a gauge-invariant manner. We first study the motion of a test particle in such fields and show that the resultant trajectories are counterintuitive. We then examine the radiation emitted - both gluonic and photonic and show that each source (independent non-abelian configuration) leaves a unique signature in the energy spectra, laying the ground for application to specific physical systems.</description>

      <title>Chiral Solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generalizing quantum chromo dynamics (QCD) from three to arbitrarily many color degrees of freedom suggests that baryons can be described as solitons in an effective meson theory whose interaction strength decreases with the number of colors. The exact form of that theory is unknown, but at low energies chiral symmetry and its breaking are considered as the construction recipes for modeling the theory. The Skyrmion is a static, localized solution in a non-linear field theory for pions and it is the most prominent version of a soliton in a chirally symmetric meson theory. Upon quantization it reproduces the spectrum of the low-lying baryons and their static properties reasonably well. Extending that theory by vector mesons improves on the agreement between predicted and empirical data. Chiral solitons within models for the quark flavor dynamics facilitate the investigation of nucleon structure functions. Here we provide a pedagogical overview of these facets.</description>

      <title>Constraining axion-chiral parameters with pulsar timing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The arrival time of electromagnetic signals traveling in chiral cosmic media is investigated in the context of axion electrodynamics. Considering that the interstellar medium (ISM) is described by a cold, ionized, chiral plasma, we derive the time delay between two traveling signals, expressed in terms of a modified dispersion measure (DM) which receives additional contribution from the chiral parameters. Faraday rotation angle is also considered in this chiral plasma scenario, yielding modified rotation measures (RM). Using DMs data from five pulsars, we establish constraints on the chiral parameter magnitude at the order of $10^{-23}$ - $10^{-22}$ GeV. On the other hand, the Faraday rotation retrieved from RM measurements implied upper constraints as tight as $10^{-36}$ GeV. By applying the obtained RM limits, we estimate that the axion-photon coupling magnitude is restrained to the level of 1 part in $10^{17}$ GeV$^{-1}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct and study Donaldson-Thomas invariants counting orthogonal and symplectic objects in linear categories, which are a generalization of the usual Donaldson-Thomas invariants from the structure groups $\mathrm{GL} (n)$ to the groups $\mathrm{O} (n)$ and $\mathrm{Sp} (2n)$, and a special case of the intrinsic Donaldson-Thomas theory developed by the author, Halpern-Leistner, Ib\'a\~nez N\'u\~nez, and Kinjo. Our invariants are defined using the motivic Hall algebra and its orthosymplectic analogue, the motivic Hall module. We prove wall-crossing formulae for our invariants, which relate the invariants with respect to different stability conditions.
  As examples, we define Donaldson-Thomas invariants counting orthogonal and symplectic perfect complexes on a Calabi-Yau threefold, and Donaldson-Thomas invariants counting self-dual representations of a self-dual quiver with potential. In the case of quivers, we compute the invariants explicitly in some cases. We also define a motivic version of Vafa-Witten invariants counting orthogonal and symplectic Higgs complexes on a class of algebraic surfaces.</description>

      <title>Quantum decoherence in the Caldeira-Leggett model by the real-time path integral on a computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose first-principle calculations of an open system based on the real-time path integral formalism treating the environment as well as the system of our interest together on a computer. The sign problem that occurs in applying Monte Carlo methods can be overcome in general by using the so-called Lefschetz thimble method, which has been developed over the past decade. Here we focus on the Caldeira-Leggett model, which is well known, in particular, as a model of quantum decoherence. In this case, the calculation simplifies drastically since the path integral becomes Gaussian for typical initial conditions. The relevant saddle point, which is unique and complex, can be determined by solving a linear equation with a huge but sparse coefficient matrix, and the integration over the Lefschetz thimble can be performed analytically. Thus we obtain, without assumptions or approximations, the reduced density matrix after a long-time evolution, tracing out a large number of harmonic oscillators in the environment. In particular, we confirm the dependence of the decoherence time on the coupling constant and the temperature that has been predicted from the master equation in a certain parameter regime.</description>

      <title>Freeze-in and Freeze-out production of Higgs Portal Majorana Fermionic Dark Matter during and after Reheating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the production of Majorana fermionic dark matter (DM) via the Higgs portal, considering both freeze-in and freeze-out mechanisms during and after the post-inflationary reheating phase. We assume that the Universe is reheated through the decay of the inflaton into a pair of massless fermions. Our analysis focuses on how the non-standard evolution of the Hubble expansion rate and the thermal bath temperature during reheating influence DM production. Additionally, we examine the impact of electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB), distinguishing between scenarios where DM freeze-in or freeze-out occurs before or after EWSB. We further explore the viable DM parameter space and its compatibility with current and future detection experiments, including XENONnT, LUX-ZEPLIN (LZ), XLZD, and collider searches. Moreover, we incorporate constraints from the Lyman-$\alpha$ bound to ensure consistency with small-scale structure formation.</description>

      <title>A New Class of Ghost and Tachyon Free Metric Affine Gravities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.01023</link>
      <description>arXiv:1912.01023v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct the spin-projection operators for a theory containing a symmetric two-index tensor and a general three-index tensor. We then use them to analyse, at linearized level, the most general action for a metric-affine theory of gravity with terms up to second order in curvature, which depends on 28 parameters. In the metric case we recover known results. In the torsion-free case, we are able to determine the most general class of theories that are projective invariant, contain only one massless spin 2 and no spin 3, and are free of ghosts and tachyons.</description>

Abstract: We consider the analytic continuation of $(p+q)$-dimensional Minkowski space (with $p$ and $q$ even) to $(p,q)$-signature, and study the conformal boundary of the resulting "Klein space". Unlike the familiar $(-+++..)$ signature, now the null infinity ${\mathcal I}$ has only one connected component. The spatial and timelike infinities ($i^0$ and $i'$) are quotients of generalizations of AdS spaces to non-standard signature. Together, ${\mathcal I}, i^0$ and $i'$ combine to produce the topological boundary $S^{p+q-1}$ as an $S^{p-1} \times S^{q-1}$ fibration over a null segment. The highest weight states (the $L$-primaries) and descendants of $SO(p,q)$ with integral weights give rise to natural scattering states. One can also define $H$-primaries which are highest weight with respect to a signature-mixing version of the Cartan-Weyl generators that leave a point on the celestial $S^{p-1} \times S^{q-1}$ fixed. These correspond to massless particles that emerge at that point and are Mellin transforms of plane wave states.</description>

Abstract: Speed matters. How the masses and spins of new particles active during inflation can be read off from the statistical properties of primordial density fluctuations is well understood. However, not when the propagation speeds of the new degrees of freedom and of the curvature perturbation differ, which is the generic situation in the effective field theory of inflationary fluctuations. Here we use bootstrap techniques to find exact analytical solutions for primordial 2-,3- and 4-point correlators in this context. We focus on the imprints of a heavy relativistic scalar coupled to the curvature perturbation that propagates with a reduced speed of sound $c_s$, hence strongly breaking de Sitter boosts. We show that akin to the de Sitter invariant setup, primordial correlation functions can be deduced by acting with suitable weight-shifting operators on the four-point function of a conformally coupled field induced by the exchange of the massive scalar. However, this procedure requires the analytical continuation of this seed correlator beyond the physical domain implied by momentum conservation. We bootstrap this seed correlator in the extended domain from first principles, starting from the boundary equation that it satisfies due to locality. We further impose unitarity, reflected in cosmological cutting rules, and analyticity, by demanding regularity in the collinear limit of the four-point configuration, in order to find the unique solution. Equipped with this, we unveil that heavy particles that are lighter than $H/c_s$ leave smoking gun imprints in the bispectrum in the form of resonances in the squeezed limit, a phenomenon that we call the low speed collider. We characterise the overall shape of the signal as well as its unusual logarithmic mass dependence, both vividly distinct from previously identified signatures of heavy fields.

Abstract: This paper investigates the influence of matter fields on the geometry of black hole horizons within higher-order gravity theories. Focusing on five-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity at a critical coupling constant ($\alpha = -3/(4\Lambda)$), we demonstrate that while vacuum solutions permit horizons with arbitrary geometry, the introduction of a scalar field imposes constraints. Specifically, the scalar hair restricts the horizon to manifolds of constant scalar curvature, extending beyond the Thurston geometries (Sol, Nil, $SL_2R$) previously identified. We prove a uniqueness theorem for the scalar-coupled solutions, showing that the metric and scalar field must adopt specific forms, with the horizon geometry solely required to satisfy the constant curvature condition. Furthermore, analogous results are established in generic $F(R)$ gravity, where arbitrary horizons with constant scalar curvature emerge at critical couplings, exemplified by $F(R) = R + \lambda R^2 - 2\Lambda$ with $\lambda = -1/(8\Lambda)$. These findings highlight a probably universal feature: critical couplings in higher-order gravity enable unconstrained horizon geometries in vacuum, while matter fields introduce geometric restrictions. This work deepens understanding of the interplay between matter, higher-curvature corrections, and black hole horizon geometry.</description>

Abstract: Analyzing the supersymmetric Pati-Salam landscape on a $\mathbb{T}^6/(\mathbb{Z}_2\times \mathbb{Z}_2)$ orientifold in IIA string theory, we have found only two models that accurately account for all standard model fermion masses and mixings. The models are dual to each other under the exchange of two SU(2) sectors and feature 12 adjoint scalars, the maximum number allowed in the landscape, whose linear combination yields the two light Higgs eigenstates. Dirac neutrino-masses in normal ordering $(50.6,~10.6,~6.2)\pm 0.1$~meV satisfying both the experimental as well as swampland constraints.</description>

      <title>Local Operator Algebras of Charged States in Gauge Theory and Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08865v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Powerful techniques have been developed in quantum field theory that employ algebras of local operators, yet local operators cannot create physical charged states in gauge theory or physical nonzero-energy states in perturbative quantum gravity. A common method to obtain physical operators out of local ones is to dress the latter using appropriate Wilson lines. This procedure destroys locality, it must be done case by case for each charged operator in the algebra, and it rapidly becomes cumbersome, particularly in perturbative quantum gravity.
  In this paper we present an alternative approach to the definition of physical charged operators: we define an automorphism that maps an algebra of local charged operators into a (non-local) algebra of physical charged operators. The automorphism is described by a formally unitary intertwiner mapping the exact BRS operator associated to the gauge symmetry into its quadratic part.
  The existence of an automorphism between local operators and the physical ones, describing charged states, allows to retain many of the results derived in local operator algebras and extend them to the physical-but-nonlocal algebra of charged operators as we discuss in some simple applications of our construction. We also discuss a formal construction of physical states and possible obstructions to it.</description>

      <title>More on the upper bound of holographic n-partite information</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19207v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that there exists a huge amount of multipartite entanglement in holography by studying the upper bound for holographic $n$-partite information $I_n$ that $n-1$ fixed boundary subregions participate. We develop methods to find the $n$-th region $E$ that makes $I_n$ reach the upper bound. Through the explicit evaluation, it is shown that $I_n$, an IR term without UV divergence, could diverge when the number of intervals or strips in region $E$ approaches infinity. At this upper bound configuration, we could argue that $I_n$ fully comes from the $n-$partite global quantum entanglement. Our results indicate: fewer-partite entanglement in holography emerges from more-partite entanglement; $n-1$ distant local subregions are highly $n$-partite entangling. Moreover, the relationship between the convexity of a boundary subregion and the multipartite entanglement it participates, and the difference between multipartite entanglement structure in different dimensions are revealed as well.</description>

      <title>Influence Phase of a dS Observer II: Electromagnetism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00135v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend our proposal for static patch holography made in part I (arXiv:2309.07290) to the case of electromagnetism. Using the on-shell action on de Sitter Schwinger-Keldysh (dS-SK) geometry, we derive the influence phase of an observer in dS$_{d+1}$ interacting with bulk electromagnetic fields. This influence phase, computed with appropriate boundary conditions and counterterms, encodes the physics of electromagnetic radiation reaction and corresponding dS Hawking radiation. The self-force is rendered finite through holographic renormalisation. In the short-time limit, we reproduce electromagnetic flat space radiation reaction ala Abraham-Lorentz-Dirac, along with cosmological corrections. We give a fully covariantised expression for this radiation reaction in several even spacetime dimensions. In this process, we also extend many existing results to cosmological spacetimes: multipole expansions including smearing effects, non-relativistic expansion for electromagnetism, and classical renormalisation in odd spacetime dimensions. Further, we review and extend many properties of vector spherical harmonics(VSHs) in arbitrary dimensions, explain the relation between spherical and cartesian VSH, and derive an addition theorem for VSHs.</description>

      <title>Holography for the IKKT matrix model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08771v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Holographic dualities that relate type II strings on near-horizon Dp brane geometries to super Yang-Mills theories with sixteen supercharges in p+1 dimensions provide non-conformal generalizations of the famous AdS/CFT correspondence. For the extremal case p=-1, this suggests a holographic duality for the IKKT matrix model - super Yang-Mills theory reduced to zero dimensions. Despite intriguing and highly non-trivial results in the IKKT model, this duality has remained largely unexplored so far. In this letter, we consider the lowest supermultiplet of gauge invariant operators of the model and identify its states with the lowest Kaluza-Klein fluctuations of (Euclidean) IIB supergravity on the D(-1) instanton background. We construct its holographic bulk realization as a one-dimensional maximal supergravity with 32 supercharges and local SO(10) invariance, capturing the full non-linear dynamics. Analyzing the bulk Killing spinor equations, we construct the most general half-supersymmetric solutions, which typically break SO(10). We present their uplifts to IIB supergravity, and furthermore to pp-waves in twelve dimensions. These results provide the minimal setup for conducting precision tests of holography involving Einstein gravity.</description>

Abstract: We establish an exact correspondence between tree-level cosmological correlators with unparticle exchange (at integer scaling dimensions) and banana diagrams of conformally coupled scalars. This duality enables us to systematically solve the governing differential equations through the application of shift relations and de Sitter bootstrap techniques. Furthermore, we adapt a dimensional regularization scheme to cosmological correlators, demonstrating how renormalization conditions uniquely fix the regularization prescription. Our results provide new insights into the analytic structure of higher-order loop corrections to inflationary correlation functions.</description>

      <title>Restricting One-Loop radiative effects in quantum gravity: Demonstrating 4D GR as an EFT and its consistent unification with the Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09796v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In "On Restricting to One-Loop Order the Radiative Effects in Quantum Gravity" (Brandt, Frenkel, and McKeon, 2020), a Lagrange multiplier (LM) field is introduced into the Einstein-Hilbert action, removing all multi-loop graviton diagrams and confining quantum-gravity corrections to just one loop. The resulting one-loop effective action carries a term proportional to $\ln(\mu/\Lambda)$, which they suggest could be experimentally determined, hinting at direct measurements of quantum-gravity effects. We show, however, that $\mu$ and $\Lambda$ emerge from a chosen \emph{renormalization scheme}, not from physical observables, implying that $\ln(\mu/\Lambda)$ signals a finite UV cutoff in this ``LM renormalization scheme.'' Although Newton's constant remains fixed (no running of $G_N$, the resulting logarithmic dependence encodes a limited domain of validity for General Relativity (GR) in four dimensions, thereby demonstrating explicitly that 4D GR behaves as an effective field theory (EFT) for energies below the cutoff. We then illustrate how this truncated, renormalized gravity sector can be consistently unified with the Standard Model (SM), yielding a finite and renormalized EFT encompassing both gravity and particle physics up to a scale $\Lambda_{\text{grav}}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19431v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show how a strange metal emerges from the long-range quantum entanglements. Given that the quenched average of a spatially random coupling between a Fermi surface and critical bosons results in linear-$T$ resistivity, we first calculate the annealed average of the model and find that it also give the linear resistivity. We then observe that the correlator of the 'coupling field' in quenched average can be interpreted as the wormholes that connect pair of points separated by arbitrary distance, while the annealed average can be interpreted as a pure system without disorder having quantum entanglements between the connected pairs. We show that, in the large-$N$ limit, two averages are equivalent. Therefore we suggest that this equivalence provides insight to the precise meaning of $ER=EPR$ conjecture in the context of an explicit model with well defined computation. Also, we point out that the wormhole picture clarifies why a SYK-rized model describes the strongly interacting system even in the case the averaged coupling strength is tiny.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.16865v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the trigonometric quantum spin-Calogero-Sutherland model, and the Haldane-Shastry spin chain as a special case, using a Bethe-ansatz analysis. We harness the model's Yangian symmetry to import the standard tools of integrability for Heisenberg spin chains into the world of integrable long-range models with spins. From the transfer matrix with a diagonal twist we construct Heisenberg-style symmetries (Bethe algebra) that refine the usual hierarchy of commuting Hamiltonians (quantum determinant) of the spin-Calogero-Sutherland model. We compute the first few of these new conserved charges explicitly, and diagonalise them by Bethe ansatz inside each irreducible Yangian representation. This yields a new eigenbasis for the spin-Calogero-Sutherland model that generalises the Yangian Gelfand-Tsetlin basis of Takemura-Uglov. The Bethe-ansatz analysis involves non-generic values of the inhomogeneities. Our review of the inhomogeneous Heisenberg XXX chain, with special attention to how the Bethe ansatz works in the presence of fusion, may be of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.09292v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Correlations between the energies of a system's spectrum are one of the defining features of quantum chaos. They can be probed using the Spectral Form Factor (SFF). We investigate how each spectral distance contributes in building this two-point correlation function. Specifically, starting from the spectral distribution of $k$-th neighbor level spacing ($k$nLS), we provide analytical expressions for the $k$-th neighbor Spectral Form Factor ($k$nSFF). We do so for the three Gaussian Random Matrix ensembles and the `Poissonian' ensemble of uncorrelated energy levels. We study the properties of the $k$nSFF, namely its minimum value and the time at which this minimum is reached, as well as the energy spacing with the deepest $k$nSFF. This allows us to quantify the contribution of each individual $k$nLS to the SFF ramp, which is a characteristic feature of quantum chaos. In particular, we show how the onset of the ramp, characterized either by the dip or the Thouless time, shifts to shorter times as contributions from longer-range spectral distance are included. Interestingly, the even and odd neighbors contribute quite distinctively, the first being the most important to built the ramp. They respectively yield a resonance or antiresonance in the ramp. All of our analytical results are tested against numerical realizations of random matrices. We complete our analysis and show how the introduced tools help characterize the spectral properties of a physical many-body system by looking at the interacting XXZ Heisenberg model with local on-site disorder that allows transitioning between the chaotic and integrable regimes.</description>

Abstract: The massive, real scalar field described by the Klein-Gordon equation in one spatial dimension is the most elementary example of a bosonic quantum field theory. It has been investigated for many decades either as a simple academic theory or as a realistic emergent many-body theory in low-dimensional systems. Despite this, the space and time behavior of its propagators have rarely been in the foreground, and although exact results are known, there remain gaps in the description and a lack of an in-depth physical analysis. The aim of this paper is to address the deficits by providing a comprehensive discussion of the results, and to show that this old theory still allows for several new results and insights. To start, we review the known results by providing a rederivation in full detail, to which we add a discussion on how exactly space and time variables need to be extended to complex values to ensure analyticity throughout spacetime. This procedure shows also how singularities on the lightcone need to be regularized to remain compatible with the analyticity and the physical limit of a vanishing mass. An extension to nonzero temperatures is provided by considering the contact of the field to a nonrelativistic thermal reservoir, such as is necessary for emerging field theories in condensed matter systems. Subsequently, it is shown that the transient, short spacetime propagation can be understood in the context of the modern development of a generalized Gibbs ensemble, which describes a massless theory with an effective temperature that is set by the Klein-Gordon mass and the physical temperature. Finally, an approximation scheme is presented that captures the non-trivial mass dependence of the propagators throughout all spacetime but involves only elementary functions.</description>

      <title>Feynman 1947 letter on path integral for the Dirac equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15070v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1947, four months before the famous Shelter Island conference, Richard Feynman wrote a lengthy letter to his former MIT classmate Theodore Welton, reporting on his efforts to develop a path integral describing the propagation of a Dirac particle. While these efforts never came to fruition, and were shortly abandoned in favor of a very different method of dealing with the electron propagator appearing in in QED, the letter is interesting both from the historical viewpoint of revealing what Feynman was thinking about during that period just before the development of QED, and for its scientific ideas. It also contains at the end some philosophical remarks, which Feynman wraps up with the comment, ``Well enough for the baloney.'' In this article I present a transcription of the letter along with editorial notes, and a facsimile of the original handwritten document. I also briefly comment on Feynman's efforts and discuss their relation to some later work.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo Simulation of Operator Dynamics and Entanglement in Dual-Unitary Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00953v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate operator dynamics and entanglement growth in dual-unitary circuits, a class of locally scrambled quantum systems that enables efficient simulation beyond the exponential complexity of the Hilbert space. By mapping the operator evolution to a classical Markov process,we perform Monte Carlo simulations to access the time evolution of local operator density and entanglement with polynomial computational cost. Our results reveal that the operator density converges exponentially to a steady-state value, with analytical bounds that match our simulations. Additionally, we observe a volume-law scaling of operator entanglement across different subregions,and identify a critical transition from maximal to sub-maximal entanglement growth, governed by the circuit's gate parameter. This transition, confirmed by both mean-field theory and Monte Carlo simulations, provides new insights into operator entanglement dynamics in quantum many-body systems. Our work offers a scalable computational framework for studying long-time operator evolution and entanglement, paving the way for deeper exploration of quantum information dynamics.</description>

      <title>Calculating the EFT likelihood via saddle-point expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16082v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend the functional approach for calculating the EFT likelihood by applying the saddle-point expansion. We demonstrate that, after suitable reformulation, the likelihood expression is consistent with the path integral required to be computed in the theory of false vacuum decay. In contrast to the saddle-point approximation, the application of the saddle-point expansion necessitates more nuanced considerations, particularly concerning the treatment of the negative eigenvalues of the second derivative of the action at the saddle point. We illustrate that a similar issue arises in the likelihood calculation, which requires approximating the original integral contour through the combination of the steepest descent contours in the field space. As a concrete example, we focus on calculating the EFT likelihood under a Gaussian distribution and propose a general procedure for computing the likelihood using the saddle-point expansion method for arbitrary partition functions. Precise computation of the likelihood will benefit Bayesian forward modeling, thereby enabling more reliable theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>Copenhagen Survey on Black Holes and Fundamental Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15776v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this survey is to take a snapshot of the attitudes of physicists working on some of the most pressing questions in modern physics, which may be useful to sociologists and historians of science. For this study, a total of 85 completed surveys were returned out of 151 registered participants of the ``Black holes Inside and out'' conference, held in Copenhagen in 2024. The survey asked questions about some of the most contentious issues in fundamental physics, including the nature of black holes and dark energy. A number of surprising results were found. For example, some of the leading frameworks, such as the cosmological constant, cosmic inflation, or string theory - while most popular - gain less than the majority of votes from the participants. The only statement that gains majority approval (by 68\% of participants) was that the Big Bang meant ``the universe evolved from a hot dense state'', not ``an absolute beginning time''. These results provide reasons for caution in describing ideas as consensus in the scientific community when a more nuanced view may be justified.</description>
