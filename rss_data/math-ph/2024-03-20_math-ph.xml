      <title>Feynman-Kac formulas for semigroups generated by multi-polaron Hamiltonians in magnetic fields and on general domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove Feynman-Kac formulas for the semigroups generated by selfadjoint operators in a class containing Fr\"ohlich Hamiltonians known from solid state physics. The latter model multi-polarons, i.e., a fixed number of quantum mechanical electrons moving in a polarizable crystal and interacting with the quantized phonon field generated by the crystal's vibrational modes. Both the electrons and phonons can be confined to suitable open subsets of Euclidean space. We also include possibly very singular magnetic vector potentials and electrostatic potentials. Our Feynman-Kac formulas comprise Fock space operator-valued multiplicative functionals and can be applied to every vector in the underlying Hilbert space. In comparison to the renormalized Nelson model, for which analogous Feynman-Kac formulas are known, the analysis of the creation and annihilation terms in the multiplicative functionals requires novel ideas to overcome difficulties caused by the phonon dispersion relation being constant. Getting these terms under control and generalizing other construction steps so as to cover confined systems are the main achievements of this article.</description>

      <title>Griffiths polynomials of Racah type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bivariate Griffiths polynomials of Racah type are constructed from univariate Racah polynomials. The bispectral properties of the former are deduced from simple properties of the latter. A duality relation and the orthogonality of these polynomials are provided. The domain of validity for the indices and variables of these polynomials is also determined. Particular limits on the parameters entering the polynomials allow to define several Griffiths polynomials of other types. One special limit connects them to the original Griffiths polynomials (of Krawtchouk type). Finally, a connection with the $9j$ symbols is made.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian for a Bose gas with Contact Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Hamiltonian for a Bose gas in three dimensions of $N \geq 3$ spinless particles interacting via zero-range or contact interactions. Such interactions are described by (singular) boundary conditions satisfied at the coincidence hyperplanes, i.e., when the coordinates of two particles coincide. It is known that if one imposes the same kind of boundary condition of the one-body problem with a point interaction then one is inevitably led to a Hamiltonian unbounded from below and therefore unstable. This is due to the fact that the interaction becomes too strong and attractive when the coordinates of three or more particles coincide. In order to avoid such instability property, we develop a suggestion formulated by Minlos and Faddeev in 1962 and introduce a slightly modified boundary condition which reduces the strength of the interaction when the positions of the particles $i, j$ coincide in the following cases: a) a third particle approaches the common position of $i$ and $j$; b) two other particles approach to each other. In all the other cases the usual boundary condition is restored. Following a quadratic form approach, we prove that the Hamiltonian characterized by such modified boundary condition is self-adjoint and bounded from below. We also show that the N-body Hamiltonian with contact interactions obtained years ago by Albeverio, H{\o}egh-Krohn and Streit using the theory of Dirichlet forms (J. Math. Phys., 18, 907--917, 1977) is a special case of our Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Review on the probabilistic construction and Conformal bootstrap in Liouville Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the paper, we review the recent construction of the Liouville conformal field theory (CFT) from probabilistic methods, and the formalization of the conformal bootstrap. This model has offered a fruitful playground to unify the probabilistic construction of the path integral, the geometric axiomatics of CFT by Segal and the representation theoretical content of the conformal bootstrap. We explain and extract the main steps and ideas behind the construction and resolution of this non-compact CFT.</description>

      <title>The Bayes Principle and Segal Axioms for $P(\phi)_2$, with application to Periodic Covers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of the present paper is to reconcile the so-called $P(\phi)_2$ model from classical constructive quantum field theory (CQFT) with (metric version of) geometric and categorical axioms proposed by G. Segal \cite{Segal} in the 90's, in showing that the $P(\phi)_2$ model satisfies these axioms, appropriately adjusted. The approach is based on previous works of Dimock arXiv:math-ph/0305017 and Pickrell arXiv:math-ph/0702077, while we give a new proof to a key step using what we call ``the Bayes principle'' of conditional probabilities in the infinite dimensional setting. We also give a precise statement and full proof of the locality of the $P(\phi)_2$ interaction. After that, we note that the so-called ``transfer operator'' associated to a cobordism has strictly positive kernel, this implies the operator has a spectral gap and allows to define a $P(\phi)_2$ Gibbs state on non-compact periodic curved surfaces (namely, with discrete ``time translations'') by analogy with 1-dimensional spin chains. This also implies asymptotic properties of the $P(\phi)_2$ partition function on periodic covers of large degrees.</description>

      <title>On categorification of Stokes coefficients in Chern-Simons theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a finite-dimensional oscillatory integral which provides a "finite-dimensional model" for analytically continued $SU(2)$ Chern-Simons theory on closed 3-manifolds that are described by plumbing trees. This model allows an efficient description of Stokes phenomenon for perturbative expansions in Chern-Simons theory around classical solutions - $SL(2,\mathbb{C})$ flat connections. Moreover, the Stokes coefficients can be categorified, i.e. promoted to graded vector spaces, in terms of this finite-dimensional model. At least naively, the categorification gives BPS spectrum of 5d maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory on the 3-manifold times a line with appropriate boundary conditions. We also comment on necessity of taking into account "flat connections at infinity" to capture Stokes phenomenon for certain 3-manifolds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine relativistic diffusion through the frame and observer bundles associated with a Lorentzian manifold $(M,g)$. Our focus is on spacetimes with a non-trivial isometry group, and we detail the conditions required to find symmetric solutions of the relativistic diffusion equation. Additionally, we analyze the conservation laws associated with the presence of Killing vector fields on $(M,g)$ and their implications for the expressions of the geodesic spray and the vertical Laplacian on both the frame and the observer bundles. Finally, we present several relevant examples of symmetric spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Orbifold Indices in Four Dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce supersymmetric indices for four-dimensional gauge theories defined on $\mathscr O \times S^1$, where $\mathscr O $ is a circle bundle over the weighted complex projective line informally known as spindle. Trivial fibrations yield a four-dimensional version of the spindle index, which we obtain by applying localization to partition functions of theories on the direct product of a spindle and a two-dimensional torus. Conversely, non-trivial fibrations lead to the branched lens index, which we compute by localizing theories on the direct product of a circle and a branched covering of the lens space, possibly endowed with conical singularities. The branched lens index encompasses the maximally refined four-dimensional lens index as a special case.</description>

      <title>Collision of two solitons for $1d$ Nonlinear Schrodinger Equation with same mass</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the global dynamics of the collision of two solitons having the same mass for one-dimensional Nonlinear Schr\"odinger models with multi-power nonlinearity. For any natural number k, it is verified that if the incoming speed v between the two solitary waves is small enough, then, after the collision, the two solitons will move away with an outcoming speed v_{f}=v+O(v^{k}) and the remainder of the solution will also have energy and weighted norms of order O(v^{k}). This is applied to several one-dimensional models such as the cubic NLS and the cubic-quintic NLS.</description>

      <title>Usefulness of signed eigenvalue/vector distributions of random tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum field theories can be applied to compute various statistical properties of random tensors. In particular signed distributions of tensor eigenvalues/vectors are the easiest, which can be computed as partition functions of four-fermi theories. Though signed distributions are different from genuine ones because of extra signs of weights, they are expected to coincide in vicinities of ends of distributions. In this paper, we perform a case study of the signed eigenvalue/vector distribution of the real symmetric order-three random tensor. The correct critical point and the correct end in the large $N$ limit have been obtained from the four-fermi theory, for which a method using the Schwinger-Dyson equation is very efficient. Since locations of ends are particularly important in applications, such as the largest eigenvalues and the best rank-one tensor approximations, signed distributions are the easiest and highly useful through the Schwinger-Dyson method.</description>

      <title>A two-scale effective model for defect-induced localization transitions in non-Hermitian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We illuminate the fundamental mechanism responsible for the transition between the non-Hermitian skin effect and defect-induced localization in the bulk. We study a Hamiltonian with non-reciprocal couplings that exhibits the skin effect (the localization of all eigenvectors at one edge) and add an on-site defect in the center. Using a two-scale asymptotic method, we characterize the long-scale growth and decay of the eigenvectors and derive a simple and intuitive effective model for the transition that occurs when the defect is sufficiently large that one of the modes is localized at the defect site, rather than at the edge of the system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generalized Hurwitz theorem states that there are fifteen composition algebras for any given field: seven unital, six para-unital, and two non-unital algebras. In this article we explore the recovery of such algebras from 3D Geometric Algebras. Different involutions, such as reversion, inversion, Clifford conjugation, and full grade inversion, are introduced in order to recover the norm of all composition algebras. A special attention is given to composition algebras of dimension 8, i. e. octonions, para-octonions and Okubo algebra, for which the introduction of a different product is needed.</description>

      <title>Phase Transition and Thermodynamic Stability in an Entropy-driven Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the notion that the mathematics of gravity can be reproduced from a statistical requirement of maximal entropy, we study the consequence of introducing an entropic source term in the Einstein-Hilbert action. For a spatially homogeneous cosmological system driven by this entropic source and enveloped by a time evolving apparent horizon, we formulate a modified version of the second law of thermodynamics. An explicit differential equation governing the internal entropy profile is found. Using a Hessian matrix analysis of the internal entropy we check the thermodynamic stability for a {\Lambda}CDM cosmology, a unified cosmic expanson and a non-singular ekpyrotic bounce. We find the mathematical condition for a second order phase transition during these evolutions from the divergence of specific heat at constant volume. The condition is purely kinematic and quadratic in nature, relating the deceleration parameter and the jerk parameter that chalks out an interesting curve on the parameter space. This condition is valid even without the entropic source term and may be a general property of any phase transition.</description>

We show that $N^{1-\frac{2s}d}\kappa_N$ has a positive, finite limit given by a certain variational problem, thereby generalizing a result of Lieb and Yau related to the Chandrasekhar theory of gravitational collapse.</description>

      <title>Efficient thermalization and universal quantum computing with quantum Gibbs samplers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The preparation of thermal states of matter is a crucial task in quantum simulation. In this work, we prove that a recently introduced, efficiently implementable dissipative evolution thermalizes to the Gibbs state in time scaling polynomially with system size at high enough temperatures, and for any Hamiltonian that satisfies a Lieb-Robinson bound, such as local Hamiltonians on a lattice. Furthermore, we show the efficient adiabatic preparation of the associated purifications or ``thermofield double'' states. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first results rigorously establishing the efficient preparation of high-temperature Gibbs states and their purifications. In the low-temperature regime, we show that implementing this family of dissipative evolutions for inverse temperatures logarithmic in the system's size is polynomially equivalent to standard quantum computation. On a technical level, for high temperatures, our proof makes use of the mapping of the generator of the evolution into a Hamiltonian, and then analysing it as perturbation of the Hamiltonian corresponding to infinite temperature. For low temperature, we instead perform a perturbation at zero temperature of the Laplace transform of the energy observable at fixed runtime, and resort to circuit-to-Hamiltonian mappings akin to the proof of universality of quantum adiabatic computing. Taken together, our results show that a family of quasi-local dissipative evolutions efficiently prepares a large class of quantum many-body states of interest, and has the potential to mirror the success of classical Monte Carlo methods for quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>On the $N$-waves hierarchy with constant boundary conditions. Spectral properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper is devoted to $N$-wave equations with constant boundary conditions related to symplectic Lie algebras. We study the spectral properties of a class of Lax operators $L$, whose potentials $Q(x,t)$ tend to constants $Q_\pm$ for $x\to \pm \infty$. For special choices of $Q_\pm$ we outline the spectral properties of $L$, the direct scattering transform and construct its fundamental analytic solutions. We generalise Wronskian relations for the case of CBC -- this allows us to analyse the mapping between the scattering data and the $x$-derivative of the potential $Q_x$. Next, using the Wronskian relations we derive the dispersion laws for the $N$-wave hierarchy and describe the NLEE related to the given Lax operator.</description>

      <title>Decoherence-free algebras in quantum dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this Article we analyze the algebraic properties of the asymptotic dynamics of finite-dimensional open quantum systems in the Heisenberg picture. In particular, a natural product (Choi-Effros product) can be defined in the asymptotic regime. Motivated by this structure, we introduce a new space called the Choi-Effros decoherence-free algebra. Interestingly, this space is both a C* -algebra with respect to the composition product, and a B* -algebra with respect to the Choi-Effros product. Moreover, such space admits a direct-sum decomposition revealing a clear relationship with the attractor subspace of the dynamics. In particular, the equality between the attractor subspace and the Choi-Effros decoherence-free algebra is a necessary and sufficient condition for a faithful dynamics. Finally, we show how all the findings do not rely on complete positivity but on the much weaker Schwarz property.</description>

      <title>Fundamental limitations on the recoverability of quantum processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum information processing and computing tasks can be understood as quantum networks, comprising quantum states and channels and possible physical transformations on them. It is hence pertinent to estimate the change in informational content of quantum processes due to physical transformations they undergo. The physical transformations of quantum states are described by quantum channels, while the transformations of quantum channels are described by quantum superchannels. In this work, we determine fundamental limitations on how well can the physical transformation on quantum channels be undone or reversed, which are of crucial interest to design and benchmark quantum information and computation devices. In particular, we refine the quantum data processing inequality for quantum channels by strengthening the monotonicity inequality of quantum relative entropy of quantum channels under the action of an arbitrary quantum superchannel. We identify a class of quantum superchannels, which appears to be quantum superchannel analogue of quantum subunital channels, under the action of which the entropy of an arbitrary quantum channel is nondecreasing.</description>

Abstract: We show that for the Lindblad evolution defined using (at most) quadratically growing classical Hamiltonians and (at most) linearly growing classical jump functions (quantized into jump operators assumed to satisfy certain ellipticity conditions and modeling interaction with a larger system), the evolution of a quantum observable remains close to the classical Fokker--Planck evolution in the Hilbert--Schmidt norm for times vastly exceeding the Ehrenfest time (the limit of such agreement with no jump operators). The time scale is the same as in two recent papers by Hern\'andez--Ranard--Riedel but the statement and methods are different.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian Quantum Fermi Accelerator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.07950v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We exactly solve a quantum Fermi accelerator model consisting of a time-independent non-Hermitian Hamiltonian with time-dependent Dirichlet boundary conditions. A Hilbert space for such systems can be defined in two equivalent ways, either by first constructing a time-independent Dyson map and subsequently unitarily mapping to fixed boundary conditions or by first unitarily mapping to fixed boundary conditions followed by the construction of a time-dependent Dyson map. In turn this allows to construct time-dependent metric operators from a time-independent metric and two time-dependent unitary maps that freeze the moving boundaries. From the time-dependent energy spectrum, we find the known possibility of oscillatory behavior in the average energy in the PT-regime, whereas in the spontaneously broken PT-regime we observe the new feature of a one-time depletion of the energy. We show that the PT broken regime is mended with moving boundary, equivalently to mending it with a time-dependent Dyson map.</description>

Abstract: Boundaries of Walker-Wang models have been used to construct commuting projector models which realize chiral unitary modular tensor categories (UMTCs) as boundary excitations. Given a UMTC $\mathcal{A}$ representing the Witt class of an anomaly, the article [arXiv:2208.14018] gave a commuting projector model associated to an $\mathcal{A}$-enriched unitary fusion category $\mathcal{X}$ on a 2D boundary of the 3D Walker-Wang model associated to $\mathcal{A}$. That article claimed that the boundary excitations were given by the enriched center/M\"uger centralizer $Z^\mathcal{A}(\mathcal{X})$ of $\mathcal{A}$ in $Z(\mathcal{X})$.
  In this article, we give a rigorous treatment of this 2D boundary model, and we verify this assertion using topological quantum field theory (TQFT) techniques, including skein modules and a certain semisimple algebra whose representation category describes boundary excitations. We also use TQFT techniques to show the 3D bulk point excitations of the Walker-Wang bulk are given by the M\"uger center $Z_2(\mathcal{A})$, and we construct bulk-to-boundary hopping operators $Z_2(\mathcal{A})\to Z^{\mathcal{A}}(\mathcal{X})$ reflecting how the UMTC of boundary excitations $Z^{\mathcal{A}}(\mathcal{X})$ is symmetric-braided enriched in $Z_2(\mathcal{A})$.
  This article also includes a self-contained comprehensive review of the Levin-Wen string net model from a unitary tensor category viewpoint, as opposed to the skeletal $6j$ symbol viewpoint.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.10961v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interpreting the GNVW index for 1D quantum cellular automata (QCA) in terms of the Jones index for subfactors leads to a generalization of the index defined for QCA on more general abstract spin chains. These include fusion spin chains, which arise as the local operators invariant under a global (categorical/MPO) symmetry, and as the boundary operators of 2D topological codes. We show that for the fusion spin chains built from the fusion category $\mathbf{Fib}$, the index is a complete invariant for the group of QCA modulo finite depth circuits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12016v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This is an expository article that describes the spectral-theoretic aspects in the study of the stability of self-similar blowup for nonlinear wave equations. The linearization near a self-similar solution leads to a genuinely nonself-adjoint operator which is difficult to analyze. The main goal of this article is to provide an accessible account to the only known method that is capable of providing sufficient spectral information to complete the stability analysis. The exposition is based on a mini course given at the Summer School on Geometric Dispersive PDEs in Obergurgl, Austria, in September 2022.</description>

      <title>The $GW$ Approximation: A Quantum Chemistry Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.05351v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide an in-depth examination of the $GW$ approximation of Green's function many-body perturbation theory by detailing both its theoretical and practical aspects in the realm of quantum chemistry. First, the quasiparticle context is introduced before delving into the derivation of Hedin's equations. From these, we explain how to derive the well-known $GW$ approximation of the self-energy. In a second time, we meticulously explain each step involved in a $GW$ calculation and what type of physical quantities can be computed. To illustrate its versatility, we consider two contrasting systems: the water molecule, a weakly correlated system, and the carbon dimer, a strongly correlated system. Each stage of the process is thoroughly detailed and explained alongside numerical results and illustrative plots. We hope that the contribution will facilitate the dissemination and democratization of Green's function-based formalisms within the computational and theoretical quantum chemistry community.</description>

Abstract: We present a formal definition of superoscillating function. We discuss the limitations of previously proposed definitions and illustrate that they do not cover the full gamut of superoscillatory behaviours. We demonstrate the suitability of the new proposal with several examples of well-known superoscillating functions that were not encompassed by previous definitions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13034v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The cellular automaton is a widely known model of both reversible and irreversible computations. The family of reversible second-order cellular automata considered in this work is appropriate both for construction of logic gates and analysis of damage distribution. The quantities such as formal dimension of damage patterns can be used only for rough estimation of consequences of particular faults and numerical experiments are provided for illustration of some subtleties. Such analysis demonstrates high sensitivity to errors from defects, lack of synchronization and too short intervals between signals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04586v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is shown that the Dunkl harmonic oscillator on the line can be generalized to a quasi-exactly solvable one, which is an anharmonic oscillator with $n+1$ known eigenstates for any $n\in \N$. It is also proved that the Hamiltonian of the latter can also be rewritten in a simpler way in terms of an extended Dunkl derivative. Furthermore, the Dunkl isotropic oscillator and Dunkl Coulomb potentials in the plane are generalized to quasi-exactly solvable ones. In the former case, potentials with $n+1$ known eigenstates are obtained, whereas, in the latter, sets of $n+1$ potentials associated with a given energy are derived.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01624v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The periodic KPZ fixed point is the conjectural universal limit of the KPZ universality class models on a ring when both the period and time critically tend to infinity. For the case of the periodic narrow wedge initial condition, we consider the conditional distribution when the periodic KPZ fixed point is unusually large at a particular position and time. We prove a conditional limit theorem up to the ``pinch-up" time. When the period is large enough, the result is the same as that for the KPZ fixed point on the line obtained by Liu and Wang in 2022. We identify the regimes in which the result changes and find probabilistic descriptions of the limits.</description>

      <title>Semigroup of annuli in Liouville CFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10914v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In conformal field theory, the semigroup of annuli with boundary parametrization plays a special role, in that it generates the whole algebra of local conformal symmetries, the so-called Virasoro algebra. The subgroup of elements $\mathbb{A}_f=\mathbb{D}\setminus f(\mathbb{D}^\circ)$ for contracting biholomorphisms $f:\mathbb{D}\to f(\mathbb{D})\subset \mathbb{D}^\circ$ with $f(0)=0$ is called the holomorphic semigroup of annuli. In this article, we construct a differentiable representation of the holomorphic semigroup into the space of bounded operators on the Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$ of Liouville Conformal Field Theory and show it generates under differentiation the positive Virasoro elements ${\bf L}_n,\tilde{{\bf L}}_n$ for $n\geq 0$. We also construct a projective representation of the semigroup of annuli in the space of bounded operators on $\mathcal{H}$ in terms of Segal amplitudes and show that all Virasoro elements ${\bf L}_n,\tilde{{\bf L}}_n$ for $n\in \mathbb{Z}$ are generated by differentiation of these annuli amplitudes. Finally, we use this to show that the Segal amplitudes for Liouville theory are differentiable with respetc to their boundary parametrizations, and the differential is computed in terms of Virasoro generators. This paper will serve, in a forthcoming work, as a fundamental tool in the construction of the conformal blocks as globally defined holomorphic sections of a holomorphic line bundle on Teichmuller space and satisfying the Ward identities.</description>

      <title>Andreev reflection mediated $\Delta_T$ noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10990v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum noise has been extensively utilized to investigate various aspects of quantum transport, such as current-current correlations and wave-particle duality. A recent focus in this field is on $\Delta_T$ quantum noise, which arises because of a finite temperature difference at vanishing charge current. This paper explores the characterization of $\Delta_T$ noise auto-correlation alongside the shot noise and thermal-noise contributions in a 1D metal/insulator/superconductor junction. We consider a finite temperature gradient with zero applied bias for reservoirs at comparable temperatures. Andreev reflection enhances the $\Delta_T$ noise in a metal-insulator-superconductor junction in contrast to a metal-insulator-metal junction in the transparent limit. Unlike quantum noise for which shot-noise dominates thermal-noise at large bias voltages and finite barrier strength, $\Delta_T$ thermal-noise is always higher than $\Delta_T$ shot-noise. Thus, a general bound that is independent of barrier strength is established. This investigation sheds light on the distinct behavior of $\Delta_T$ noise, alongside the ratio of shot-noise to thermal-noise contributions, offering valuable insights into the intricate interplay between finite temperature gradient, barrier strength, and Andreev reflection.</description>
