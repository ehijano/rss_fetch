      <title>Planar Collisionless Shock Simulations with Semi-Implicit Particle-in-Cell Model FLEKS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08384v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the applicability of the semi-implicit particle-in-cell code FLEKS to heliospheric shock simulations. We examine one- and two-dimensional local planar shock simulations, initialized using MHD states with upstream conditions representative of plasmas in the hypersonic, $\beta\sim 1$ regime, for both quasi-perpendicular and quasi-parallel configurations. The refined algorithm in FLEKS proves robust, enabling accurate shock simulations with a grid resolution on the order of the electron inertial length $d_e$. Our simulations successfully capture key shock features, including shock structures (foot, ramp, overshoot, and undershoot), upstream and downstream waves (fast magnetosonic, whistler, Alfv\'en ion-cyclotron, and mirror modes), and non-Maxwellian particle distributions. Crucially, we find that at least two spatial dimensions are critical for accurately reproducing downstream wave physics in quasi-perpendicular shocks and capturing the complex dynamics of quasi-parallel shocks, including surface rippling, shocklets, SLAMS, magnetic reconnection and jets. Furthermore, our parameter studies demonstrate the impact of mass ratio and grid resolution on shock physics. This work provides valuable guidance for selecting appropriate physical and numerical parameters for shock simulations using a semi-implicit PIC method, paving the way for incorporating kinetic shock processes into large-scale collisionless plasma simulations with the MHD-AEPIC model.</description>

      <title>What Determines the Brightness of the Magnetically Open Solar Corona?: Insights from Three-dimensional Radiative Magnetohydrodynamic Simulations and Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14049v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the relationship between solar coronal holes and open-field regions using three-dimensional radiative magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations combined with remote-sensing observations from the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). Our numerical simulations reveal that magnetically open regions in the corona can exhibit brightness comparable to quiet regions, challenging the conventional view that open-field regions are inherently dark coronal holes. We find that the coronal brightness is primarily determined by the total energy input from photospheric magnetic activities, such as the small-scale dynamo, rather than differences in dissipative processes within the corona. Using synthesized EUV intensity maps, we show that brightness thresholds commonly used to identify coronal holes may overlook open-field regions, especially at lower spatial resolutions. Observational analysis utilizing SDO/HMI and AIA synoptic maps supports our simulation results, demonstrating that magnetic field extrapolation techniques, such as the Potential Field Source Surface (PFSS) model, are sensitive to the chosen parameters, including the source surface height. We suggest that discrepancies in estimates of open magnetic flux (the ``open flux problem'') arise both from the modeling assumptions in coronal magnetic field extrapolation and systematic biases in solar surface magnetic field observations. Our findings indicate the need for reconsidering criteria used to identify coronal holes as indicators of open-field regions to better characterize the solar open magnetic flux.</description>
