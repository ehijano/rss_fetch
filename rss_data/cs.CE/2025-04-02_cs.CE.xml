      <title>A computational framework for evaluating tire-asphalt hysteretic friction including pavement roughness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pavement surface textures obtained by a photogrammetry-based method for data acquisition and analysis are employed to investigate if related roughness descriptors are comparable to the frictional performance evaluated by finite element analysis. Pavement surface profiles are obtained from 3D digital surface models created with Close-Range Orthogonal Photogrammetry. To characterize the roughness features of analyzed profiles, selected texture parameters were calculated from the profile's geometry. The parameters values were compared to the frictional performance obtained by numerical simulations. Contact simulations are performed according to a dedicated finite element scheme where surface roughness is directly embedded into a special class of interface finite elements. Simulations were performed for different case scenarios and the obtained results showed a notable trend between roughness descriptors and friction performance, indicating a promising potential for this numerical method to be consistently employed to predict the frictional properties of actual pavement surface profiles.</description>

      <title>Anomaly Detection for Hybrid Butterfly Subspecies via Probability Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting butterfly hybrids requires knowledge of the parent subspecies, and the process can be tedious when encountering a new subspecies. This study focuses on a specific scenario where a model trained to recognize hybrid species A can generalize to species B when B biologically mimics A. Since species A and B share similar patterns, we leverage BioCLIP as our feature extractor to capture features based on their taxonomy. Consequently, the algorithm designed for species A can be transferred to B, as their hybrid and non-hybrid patterns exhibit similar relationships. To determine whether a butterfly is a hybrid, we adopt proposed probability filtering and color jittering to augment and simulate the mimicry. With these approaches, we achieve second place in the official development phase. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/Justin900429/NSF-HDR-Challenge.</description>

      <title>Design and Experimental Validation of an Urban Microclimate Tool Integrating Indoor-Outdoor Detailed Longwave Radiative Fluxes at District Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical simulation is a powerful tool for assessing the causes of an Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect or quantifying the impact of mitigation solutions on outdoor and indoor thermal comfort. For that purpose, several models have been developed at the district scale. At this scale, the outside surface energy budget is detailed, however building models are very simplified and considered as a boundary condition of the district scale model. This shortcoming inhibits the opportunity to investigate the effect of urban microclimate on the inside building conditions. The aim of this work is to improve the representation of the physical phenomena involved in the building models of a district model. For that purpose, the model integrates inside and outside fully detailed long-wave radiative flux. The numerical model is based on finite differences to solve conduction through all the surfaces and the radiosity method to solve long-wave radiative heat fluxes inside and outside. Calculated temperatures and heat fluxes are evaluated with respect to \textit{in situ} measurements from an experimental demonstrator over 14 sensors and a 24-day period. Results are also compared to state-of-the-art models simulation tool show improvement of the RMSE of $0.9 \ \mathsf{^{\,\circ}C}$ to $2.1 \ \mathsf{^{\,\circ}C}$ on the surface temperature modeled.</description>

      <title>Focal Mechanism Uncertainty Quantification In Ground Motion Simulations Of Le Teil Earthquake</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring the seismic safety of nuclear power plants (NPPs) is essential, especially for facilities that rely on base isolation to reduce earthquake impacts. For understanding the seismic response, accurate models are key to predict the ground motions, which are generally sensitive to various factors, including earthquake source parameters like the focal mechanism, i.e., strike, dip, and rake angles. This study examines how uncertainties in these parameters affect ground motion predictions. The analysis is based on the SMATCH benchmark, which provides a standardized approach for evaluating the seismic response of the Cruas-Meysse NPP in France during the Mw 4.9 Le-Teil earthquake of 2019. A set of 27 3D high-fidelity numerical simulations was performed using a spectral-element method, each incorporating different focal mechanism variations. These simulations provide an effective approach for investigating the factors behind the exceptional ground motion observed during this event. To quantify uncertainty, the simulated ground motions were compared to recorded data using two well-established goodness-of-fit criteria: one assessing time-frequency domain characteristics and another focusing on the characterization of the ground motion signals by intensity measures. Results highlight the significant influence of focal mechanism variability on ground motion predictions, especially on the rake angle, which showed the strongest correlation with wave and intensity measures.</description>

      <title>Multi-convex Programming for Discrete Latent Factor Models Prototyping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discrete latent factor models (DLFMs) are widely used in various domains such as machine learning, economics, neuroscience, psychology, etc. Currently, fitting a DLFM to some dataset relies on a customized solver for individual models, which requires lots of effort to implement and is limited to the targeted specific instance of DLFMs. In this paper, we propose a generic framework based on CVXPY, which allows users to specify and solve the fitting problem of a wide range of DLFMs, including both regression and classification models, within a very short script. Our framework is flexible and inherently supports the integration of regularization terms and constraints on the DLFM parameters and latent factors, such that the users can easily prototype the DLFM structure according to their dataset and application scenario. We introduce our open-source Python implementation and illustrate the framework in several examples.</description>

      <title>Mastering truss structure optimization with tree search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06145v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the combined use of generative grammar rules and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for optimizing truss structures. Our approach accommodates intermediate construction stages characteristic of progressive construction settings. We demonstrate the significant robustness and computational efficiency of our approach compared to alternative reinforcement learning frameworks from previous research activities, such as Q-learning or deep Q-learning. These advantages stem from the ability of MCTS to strategically navigate large state spaces, leveraging the upper confidence bound for trees formula to effectively balance exploitation-exploration trade-offs. We also emphasize the importance of early decision nodes in the search tree, reflecting design choices crucial for highly performative solutions. Additionally, we show how MCTS dynamically adapts to complex and extensive state spaces without significantly affecting solution quality. While the focus of this paper is on truss optimization, our findings suggest MCTS as a powerful tool for addressing other increasingly complex engineering applications.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Modelling of Elasticity Tensor Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16714v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel framework for the probabilistic modelling of random fourth order material tensor fields, with a focus on tensors that are physically symmetric and positive definite (SPD), of which the elasticity tensor is a prime example. Given the critical role that spatial symmetries and invariances play in determining material behaviour, it is essential to incorporate these aspects into the probabilistic description and modelling of material properties. In particular, we focus on spatial point symmetries or invariances under rotations, a classical subject in elasticity. Following this, we formulate a stochastic modelling framework using a Lie algebra representation via a memoryless transformation that respects the requirements of positive definiteness and invariance. With this, it is shown how to generate a random ensemble of elasticity tensors that allows an independent control of strength, eigenstrain, and orientation. The procedure also accommodates the requirement to prescribe specific spatial symmetries and invariances for each member of the whole ensemble, while ensuring that the mean or expected value of the ensemble conforms to a potentially 'higher' class of spatial invariance. Furthermore, it is important to highlight that the set of SPD tensors forms a differentiable manifold, which geometrically corresponds to an open cone within the ambient space of symmetric tensors. Thus, we explore the mathematical structure of the underlying sample space of such tensors, and introduce a new distance measure or metric, called the 'elasticity metric', between the tensors. Finally, we model and visualize a one-dimensional spatial field of orthotropic Kelvin matrices using interpolation based on the elasticity metric.</description>

      <title>Chance-Constrained Optimal Design of Porous Thermal Insulation Systems Under Spatially Correlated Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02077v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a computationally efficient method for the optimal design of silica aerogel porous material systems, balancing thermal insulation performance with mechanical stability under stress concentrations. The proposed approach explicitly accounts for additive manufacturing uncertainties by modeling material porosity as a spatially correlated stochastic field within a multiphase finite element formulation. A risk-averse objective function, incorporating statistical moments of the design objective, is employed in conjunction with chance constraints that enforce mechanical stability by restricting the probability of exceeding critical stress thresholds. To mitigate the prohibitively high computational cost associated with the large-dimensional uncertainty space and Monte Carlo estimations of the objective function's statistical moments, a second-order Taylor expansion is utilized as a control variate. Furthermore, a continuation-based smoothing strategy is introduced to address the non-differentiability of the chance constraints, ensuring compatibility with gradient-based optimization. The resulting framework achieves computational scalability, remaining agnostic to the dimensionality of the stochastic design space. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated through numerical experiments on two- and three-dimensional thermal break systems for building insulation. The results highlight the framework's capability to solve large-scale, chance-constrained optimal design problems governed by finite element models with uncertain design parameter spaces reaching dimensions in the hundreds of thousands.</description>

      <title>Open-FinLLMs: Open Multimodal Large Language Models for Financial Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11878v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Financial LLMs hold promise for advancing financial tasks and domain-specific applications. However, they are limited by scarce corpora, weak multimodal capabilities, and narrow evaluations, making them less suited for real-world application. To address this, we introduce \textit{Open-FinLLMs}, the first open-source multimodal financial LLMs designed to handle diverse tasks across text, tabular, time-series, and chart data, excelling in zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning settings. The suite includes FinLLaMA, pre-trained on a comprehensive 52-billion-token corpus; FinLLaMA-Instruct, fine-tuned with 573K financial instructions; and FinLLaVA, enhanced with 1.43M multimodal tuning pairs for strong cross-modal reasoning. We comprehensively evaluate Open-FinLLMs across 14 financial tasks, 30 datasets, and 4 multimodal tasks in zero-shot, few-shot, and supervised fine-tuning settings, introducing two new multimodal evaluation datasets. Our results show that Open-FinLLMs outperforms afvanced financial and general LLMs such as GPT-4, across financial NLP, decision-making, and multi-modal tasks, highlighting their potential to tackle real-world challenges. To foster innovation and collaboration across academia and industry, we release all codes (https://anonymous.4open.science/r/PIXIU2-0D70/B1D7/LICENSE) and models under OSI-approved licenses.</description>

      <title>A hybrid pressure formulation of the face-centred finite volume method for viscous laminar incompressible flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04864v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work presents a hybrid pressure face-centred finite volume (FCFV) solver to simulate steady-state incompressible Navier-Stokes flows. The method leverages the robustness, in the incompressible limit, of the hybridisable discontinuous Galerkin paradigm for compressible and weakly compressible flows to derive the formulation of a novel, low-order face-based discretisation. The incompressibility constraint is enforced in a weak sense, by introducing an inter-cell mass flux defined in terms of a new, hybrid variable, representing the pressure at the cell faces. This results in a new hybridisation strategy where cell variables (velocity, pressure and deviatoric strain rate tensor) are expressed as a function of velocity and pressure at the barycentre of the cell faces. The hybrid pressure formulation provides first-order convergence of all variables, including the stress, without the need for gradient reconstruction, thus being less sensitive to cell type, stretching, distortion, and skewness than traditional low-order finite volume solvers. Numerical benchmarks of Navier-Stokes flows at low and moderate Reynolds numbers, in two and three dimensions, are presented to evaluate accuracy and robustness of the method. In particular, the hybrid pressure formulation outperforms the FCFV method when convective effects are relevant, achieving accurate predictions on significantly coarser meshes.</description>
