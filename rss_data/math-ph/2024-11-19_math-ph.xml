      <title>Asymptotic expansion of the partition function for $\beta$-ensembles with complex potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we establish under certain hypotheses the $N \to +\infty$ asymptotic expansion of integrals of the form $$\mathcal{Z}_{N,\Gamma}[V] \, = \, \int_{\Gamma^N} \prod_{ a &lt; b}^{N}(z_a - z_b)^\beta \, \prod_{k=1}^{N} \mathrm{e}^{ - N \beta V(z_k) } \, \mathrm{d}\mathbf{z}$$ where $V \in \mathbb{C}[X]$, $\beta \in 2 \mathbb{N}^*$ is an even integer and $\Gamma \subset \mathbb{C}$ is an unbounded contour such that the integral converges. For even degree, real valued $V$s and when $\Gamma = \mathbb{R}$, it is well known that the large-$N$ expansion is characterised by an equilibrium measure corresponding to the minimiser of an appropriate energy functional. This method bears a structural resemblance with the Laplace method. By contrast, in the complex valued setting we are considering, the analysis structurally resembles the classical steepest-descent method, and involves finding a critical point \textit{and} a steepest descent curve, the latter being a deformation of the original integration contour. More precisely, one minimises a curve-dependent energy functional with respect to measures on the curve and then maximises the energy over an appropriate space of curves. Our analysis deals with the one-cut regime of the associated equilibrium measure. We establish the existence of an all order asymptotic expansion for $\ln \mathcal{Z}_{N,\Gamma}[V]$ and explicitly identify the first few terms.</description>

      <title>On the degeneracy of the energy levels of Schroedinger and Klein-Gordon equations on Riemannian coverings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the degeneracy of the energy levels of the Schroedinger equation with Kepler-Coulomb potential and of the Klein-Gordon equation on Riemannian coverings of the Euclidean space and of the Schwarzschild space-time respectively. Degeneracy of energy levels is a consequence of the superintegrability of the system. We see how the degree of degeneracy changes depending on the covering parameter k, the parameter that in space-times can be related with a cosmic string, and show examples of lower degeneracy in correspondence of non integer values of k.</description>

      <title>On one-parameter families of hermiticity-preserving superoperators which are not positive</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A \textit{one-parameter family of hermiticity-preserving superoperators} is a time-dependent family $\{\Phi_{t}\colon\mathbb{M}_{n}(\mathbb{C})\rightarrow\mathbb{M}_{n}(\mathbb{C})\}_{t\in\mathbb{R}}$ of hermiticity-preserving superoperators determined, in a certain sense, by real and complex polynomial functions in the variable $t\in\mathbb{R}$. The paper studies sufficient computable criteria for nonpositivity of superoperators in one-parameter families. More precisely, we give sufficient conditions for the following assertions to hold: $(1)$ every $\Phi_{t}$ is not positive, $(2)$ $\Phi_{t}$ is not positive for $t$ in some open interval $(u,v)\subseteq\mathbb{R}$ and $(3)$ there is some $\Phi_{t}$ which is not positive. We show that in some situations $(3)$ implies $(2)$. Our approach to the problem is based on the \textit{Descartes rule of signs} and the \textit{Sturm-Tarski theorem}. In order to apply these facts, we introduce the \textit{sign variation formulas}. These formulas are first order logical formulas in one free variable $t$, generalising sign sequences of polynomials used in Descartes rule of signs.</description>

      <title>Scaling of the Lyapunov exponent at a balanced hyperbolic critical point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In both the random hopping model and at topological phase transitions in one-dimensional chiral systems, the Lyapunov exponent vanishes at zero energy, but is here shown to have an inverse logarithmic increase with a coefficient that is computed explicitly. This is the counterpart of the Dyson spike in the density of states. The argument also transposes to the free energy density of the random field Ising model, and more generally to many so-called balanced hyperbolic critical points. It is based on the fact that the Furstenberg measure in rescaled logarithmic Dyson-Schmidt variables can be well-approximated by an absolutely continuous measure with trapezoidal density.</description>

      <title>Existence of Boutroux curves, $g$-functions and spectral networks from Newton's polygon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the existence of an algebraic plane curve of equation $P(x,y)=0$, with prescribed asymptotic behaviors at punctures, and with the Boutroux property, namely, periods have vanishing real part, i.e, $\Re(\int_\gamma y dx)=0$ for every closed loop $\gamma$. This has applications in the Riemann-Hilbert problem, in random matrix theory, in spectral networks, in WKB analysis and Stokes phenomenon, in algebraic and enumerative geometry, and many applications in mathematical physics. From Newton's polygon we can define an affine space such that there exists always a Boutroux curve. This result is applied to random matrix and asymptotic theory, in which a key ingredient is called the $g$-function, the function $g(x)=\int_o^x Y dX$ is a $g$-function precisely if and only if the algebraic plane curve is a Boutroux curve.</description>

      <title>Topological Dynamics of Synthetic Molecules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of synthetic molecules whose architectures are generated by space transformations from a point group acting on seed resonators. We show that the dynamical matrix of any such molecule can be reproduced as the left regular representation of a self-adjoint element from the stabilized group's algebra. Furthermore, we use elements of representation theory and K-theory to rationalize the dynamical features supported by such synthetic molecules up to topological equivalences. These tools enable us to identify a set of fundamental models which generate by superposition all possible dynamical matrices up to homotopy equivalences. Interpolations between these fundamental models give rise to topological spectral flows.</description>

      <title>Evolving the Euler rotation axis as a dynamical system, using the Euler vector and generalizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Differential equations are derived which show how generalized Euler vector representations of the Euler rotation axis and angle for a rigid body evolve in time; the Euler vector is also known as a rotation vector or axis-angle vector. The solutions can exhibit interesting rotational features in this non-abstract, visualizable setting, including spinor-like behavior and quasiperiodicity. The equations are well-behaved at zero, reducing to the simple infinitesimal case there. One of them is equivalent to a known quaternion differential equation. The simple geometric derivation does not depend on Euler's rotation theorem, and yields a proof of Euler's theorem using only infinitesimal motions. With mild regularity conditions on the angular velocity function, there is a continuous evolution of the normalized axis and angle for all time. Dynamical systems properties are discussed, and numerical solutions are used to investigate them when the angular velocity is itself rotating, and the Euler vector trajectory traces out a torus-like shape, with a strobe plot that densely fills in a closed curve.</description>

      <title>Stability of a Riemann Shock in a Physical Class: From Brenner-Navier-Stokes-Fourier to Euler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stability of an irreversible singularity, such as a Riemann shock solution to the full Euler system, in the absence of any technical conditions for perturbations, remains a major open problem even within a mono-dimensional framework. A natural approach to justify the stability of such a singularity involves considering a class of vanishing physical dissipation limits (or viscosity limits) of physical viscous flows with evanescent viscosities. We prove the existence of vanishing physical dissipation limits, on which a Riemann shock of small jump strength is stable (up to a time-dependent shift) and unique. As a physical viscous model that generates vanishing dissipation limits, we adopt the Brenner-Navier-Stokes-Fourier system, proposed by Brenner based on the bi-velocity theory. For this viscous system, we show the uniform stability of shock with respect to the strength of the viscosity. The uniformity is ensured by the contraction estimates of any large perturbations around the shock. Since we cannot impose any smallness on initial perturbations for the contraction estimates, the density could be arbitrarily small or large. Controlling such large perturbations is the most challenging part in our analysis. The contraction estimates ensure the existence of vanishing physical dissipation limits of solutions to the Brenner-Navier-Stokes-Fourier system. In addition, the distance of those limits from the Riemann shock, up to shifts, is controlled by the magnitude of the initial perturbations. The distance is measured by the relative entropy with a weight depending on the shock. This is the first result for the stability of Riemann shock solution to the full Euler system in a class of vanishing physical dissipation limits.</description>

Abstract: We revisit the local form subordination condition on the perturbation of a self-adjoint operators with compact resolvent, which is used to show the Riesz basis property of the eigensystem of the perturbed operator. Our new assumptions and new proof allow for establishing the Riesz basis property also in the case of slow and non-monotone decay in this subordination condition.</description>

      <title>A convergence framework for Airy$_\beta$ line ensemble via pole evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Airy$_\beta$ line ensemble is an infinite sequence of random curves. It is a natural extension of the Tracy-Widom$_\beta$ distributions, and is expected to be the universal edge scaling limit of a range of models in random matrix theory and statistical mechanics. In this work, we provide a framework of proving convergence to the Airy$_\beta$ line ensemble, via a characterization through the pole evolution of meromorphic functions satisfying certain stochastic differential equations. Our framework is then applied to prove the universality of the Airy$_\beta$ line ensemble as the edge limit of various continuous time processes, including Dyson Brownian motions with general $\beta$ and potentials, Laguerre processes and Jacobi processes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a multipartite systems, local operations are conducted by one party and the results are communicated to the other parties. Such models have been studied under the framework of LOCC and SLOCC. In this paper, we study when can an action of one party be simulated by another. We obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for when can a unitary action be simulated in a bipartite system. We also show that arbitrary operations can be simulated by any party as long as the given multipartite state is Schmidt decomposable. Moreover, we obtain condition for simulation of local measurements in arbitrary tripartite systems.</description>

      <title>Boson Clustering and Low-Density Properties at High Temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In statistical and quantum many-body physics, the correlation function is a fundamental quantity, especially for lattice models described by local Hamiltonians. Away from the phase-transition point, correlation function typically satisfies the clustering property, meaning that the correlation concentrates at short ranges while decays rapidly (exponentially) at long distances. Though the clustering property has been extensively studied for spin and fermion systems, whether a similar result holds for boson systems remains a long-standing open problem. The essential difficulty lies in the infinite Hilbert-space dimension of a boson, in stark contrast to the finite dimension of a spin or fermion. This work is devoted to establishing the boson counterpart of the clustering of correlations at high temperatures, focusing primarily on the canonical Bose-Hubbard model. As a byproduct, we rigorously justify the low-boson-density assumption for the Gibbs state of the Bose-Hubbard model. This assumption is often invoked as a preliminary requirement for proving various rigorous results, including the boson Lieb-Robinson bound. Building on the results above, we show the specific heat density can be bounded above by a constant at high temperatures. Our achievement is based on the imaginary-time interaction picture, which is expected to have much broader applications to other open problems concerning bosons in statistical and quantum many-body physics.</description>

      <title>A consistent treatment of dynamic contact angles in the sharp-interface framework with the generalized Navier boundary condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we revisit the Generalized Navier Boundary condition (GNBC) introduced by Qian et al. in the sharp interface Volume-of-Fluid context. We replace the singular uncompensated Young stress by a smooth function with a characteristic width $\varepsilon$ that is understood as a physical parameter of the model. Therefore, we call the model the ``Contact Region GNBC'' (CR-GNBC). We show that the model is consistent with the fundamental kinematics of the contact angle transport described by Fricke, K\"ohne and Bothe. We implement the model in the geometrical Volume-of-Fluid solver Basilisk using a ``free angle'' approach. This means that the dynamic contact angle is not prescribed but reconstructed from the interface geometry and subsequently applied as an input parameter to compute the uncompensated Young stress. We couple this approach to the two-phase Navier Stokes solver and study the withdrawing tape problem with a receding contact line. It is shown that the model is grid-independent and leads to a full regularization of the singularity at the moving contact line. In particular, it is shown that the curvature at the moving contact line is finite and mesh converging. As predicted by the fundamental kinematics, the parallel shear stress component vanishes at the moving contact line for quasi-stationary states (i.e. for $\dot{\theta}_d=0$) and the dynamic contact angle is determined by a balance between the uncompensated Young stress and an effective contact line friction. Furthermore, a non-linear generalization of the model is proposed, which aims at reproducing the Molecular Kinetic Theory of Blake and Haynes for quasi-stationary states.</description>

      <title>From the self-dual Yang-Mills equation to the Fokas-Lenells equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A reduction from the self-dual Yang-Mills (SDYM) equation to the unreduced Fokas-Lenells (FL) system is described in this paper. It has been known that the SDYM equation can be formulated from the Cauchy matrix schemes of the matrix Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (KP) hierarchy and the Ablowitz-Kaup-Newell-Segur (AKNS) hierarchy. We show that the reduction can be realized in these two Cauchy matrix schemes, respectively. Each scheme allows us to construct solutions for the unreduced FL system. We prove that these solutions obtained from different schemes are equivalent under certain reflection transformation of coordinates. Using conjugate reduction we obtain solutions of the FL equation. The paper adds an important example to Ward's conjecture on the reductions of the SDYM equation. It also indicates the Cauchy matrix structures of the Kaup-Newell hierarchy.</description>

      <title>Airy$_\beta$ line ensemble and its Laplace transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Airy$_\beta$ line ensemble is a random collection of continuous curves, which should serve as a universal edge scaling limit in problems related to eigenvalues of random matrices and models of 2d statistical mechanics. This line ensemble unifies many existing universal objects including Tracy-Widom distributions, eigenvalues of the Stochastic Airy Operator, Airy$_2$ process from the KPZ theory. Here $\beta&gt;0$ is a real parameter governing the strength of the repulsion between the curves.
  We introduce and characterize the Airy$_\beta$ line ensemble in terms of the Laplace transform, by producing integral formulas for its joint multi-time moments. We prove two asymptotic theorems for each $\beta&gt;0$: the trajectories of the largest eigenvalues in the Dyson Brownian Motion converge to the Airy$_\beta$ line ensemble; the extreme particles in the G$\beta$E corners process converge to the same limit.
  The proofs are based on the convergence of random walk expansions for the multi-time moments of prelimit objects towards their Brownian counterparts. The expansions are produced through Dunkl differential-difference operators acting on multivariate Bessel generating functions.</description>

      <title>Mixed Multiple Orthogonal Laurent Polynomials on the Unit Circle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mixed orthogonal Laurent polynomials on the unit circle of CMV type are constructed utilizing a matrix of moments and its Gauss--Borel factorization and employing a multiple extension of the CMV ordering. A systematic analysis of the associated multiple orthogonality and biorthogonality relations, and an examination of the degrees of the Laurent polynomials is given. Recurrence relations, expressed in terms of banded matrices, are found. These recurrence relations lay the groundwork for corresponding Christoffel-Darboux kernels and relations, as well as for elucidating the ABC theorem. The paper also develops the theory of diagonal Christoffel and Geronimus perturbations of the matrix of measures. Christoffel formulas are found for both perturbations.</description>

      <title>Ultra high order cumulants and quantitative CLT for polynomials in Random Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: From the study of the high order freeness of random matrices, it is known that the order $r$ cumulant of the trace of a polynomial of $N$-dimensional GUE/GOE is of order $N^{2-r}$ if $r$ is fixed. In this work, we extend the study along three directions. First, we also consider generally distributed Wigner matrices with subexponential entries. Second, we include the deterministic matrices into discussion and consider arbitrary polynomials in random matrices and deterministic matrices. Third, more importantly, we consider the ultra high order cumulants in the sense that $r$ is arbitrary, i.e., could be $N$ dependent. Our main results are the upper bounds of the ultra high order cumulants, for which not only the $N$-dependence but also the $r$-dependence become significant. These results are then used to derive three types of quantitative CLT for the trace of any given self-adjoint polynomial in these random matrix variables: a CLT with a Cram\'{e}r type correction, a Berry-Esseen bound, and a concentration inequality which captures both the Gaussian tail in the small deviation regime and $M$-dependent tail in the large deviation regime, where $M$ is the degree of the polynomial. In contrast to the second order freeness which implies the CLT for linear eigenvalue statistics of polynomials in random matrices, our study on the ultra high order cumulants leads to the quantitative versions of the CLT.</description>

      <title>Resolving Verlinde's formula of logarithmic CFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Verlinde's formula for rational vertex operator algebras computes the fusion rules from the modular transformations of characters. In the non semisimple and non finite case, a logarithmic Verlinde formula has been proposed together with David Ridout. In this formula one replaces simple modules by their resolutions by standard modules. Here and under certain natural assumptions this conjecture is proven in generality.
  The result is illustrated in the examples of the singlet algebras and of the affine vertex algebra of $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ at any admissible level, i.e. in particular the Verlinde conjectures in these cases are true. In the latter case it is also explained how to compute the actual fusion rules from knowledge of the Grothendieck ring.</description>

      <title>Ribbon categories of weight modules for affine $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ at admissible levels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the braided tensor category of finitely-generated weight modules for the simple affine vertex operator algebra $L_k(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ of $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ at any admissible level $k$ is rigid and hence a braided ribbon category. The proof uses a recent result of the first two authors with Shimizu and Yadav on embedding a braided Grothendieck-Verdier category $\mathcal{C}$ into the Drinfeld center of the category of modules for a suitable commutative algebra $A$ in $\mathcal{C}$, in situations where the braided tensor category of local $A$-modules is rigid. Here, the commutative algebra $A$ is Adamovi\'{c}'s inverse quantum Hamiltonian reduction of $L_k(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$, which is the simple rational Virasoro vertex operator algebra at central charge $1-\frac{6(k+1)^2}{k+2}$ tensored with a half-lattice conformal vertex algebra. As a corollary, we also show that the category of finitely-generated weight modules for the $N = 2$ super Virasoro vertex operator superalgebra at central charge $-6\ell-3$ is rigid for $\ell$ such that $(\ell+1)(k+2) = 1$.</description>

      <title>Fusion rules and rigidity for weight modules over the simple admissible affine $\mathfrak{sl}(2)$ and $\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal vertex operator superalgebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the categories of weight modules over the simple $\mathfrak{sl}(2)$ and $\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal vertex operator algebras at fractional admissible levels and central charges are rigid (and hence the categories of weight modules are braided ribbon categories) and that the decomposition formulae of fusion products of simple projective modules conjectured by Thomas Creutzig, David Ridout and collaborators hold (including when the decomposition involves summands that are indecomposable yet not simple). In addition to solving this old open problem, we develop new techniques for the construction of intertwining operators by means of integrating screening currents over certain cycles, which are expected to be of independent interest, due to their applicability to many other algebras. In the example of $\mathfrak{sl}(2)$ these new techniques allow us to give explicit formulae for a logarithmic intertwining operator from a pair of simple projective modules to the projective cover of the tensor unit, namely, the vertex operator algebra as a module over itself.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the structure of non-equilibrium steady states (NESS) for a class of exactly solvable models in the setting of a chain with left and right reservoirs. Inspired by recent results on the harmonic model, we focus on models in which the NESS is a mixture of equilibrium product measures, and where the probability measure which describes the mixture has a spatial Markovian property. We completely characterize the structure of such mixture measures, and show that under natural scaling and translation invariance properties, the only possible mixture measures are coinciding with the Dirichlet process found earlier in the context of the harmonic model.</description>

      <title>Data-driven model reconstruction for nonlinear wave dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The use of machine learning to predict wave dynamics is a topic of growing interest, but commonly-used deep learning approaches suffer from a lack of interpretability of the trained models. Here we present an interpretable machine learning framework for analyzing the nonlinear evolution dynamics of optical wavepackets in complex wave media. We use sparse regression to reduce microscopic discrete lattice models to simpler effective continuum models which can accurately describe the dynamics of the wavepacket envelope. We apply our approach to valley-Hall domain walls in honeycomb photonic lattices of laser-written waveguides with Kerr-type nonlinearity and different boundary shapes. The reconstructed equations accurately reproduce the linear dispersion and nonlinear effects including self-steepening and self-focusing. This scheme is proven free of the a priori limitations imposed by the underlying hierarchy of scales traditionally employed in asymptotic analytical methods. It represents a powerful interpretable machine learning technique of interest for advancing design capabilities in photonics and framing the complex interaction-driven dynamics in various topological materials.</description>

Abstract: We analyze the many-body Hamiltonian describing a mobile impurity immersed in a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). Using exact unitary transformations and rigorous error estimates, we show the validity of the Bogoliubov-Fr\"ohlich Hamiltonian for the Bose polaron in the regime of moderately strong, repulsive interactions with a dilute BEC. Moreover, we calculate analytically the universal logarithmic correction to the ground state energy that arises from an impurity mediated phonon-phonon interaction.</description>

      <title>Surface sums for lattice Yang-Mills in the large-$N$ limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a sum over weighted planar surfaces formula for Wilson loop expectations in the large-$N$ limit of strongly coupled lattice Yang-Mills theory, in any dimension. The weights of each surface are simple and expressed in terms of products of signed Catalan numbers.
  In establishing our results, the main novelty is to convert a recursive relation for Wilson loop expectations, known as the master loop equation, into a new peeling exploration of the planar surfaces. This exploration reveals hidden cancellations within the sums, enabling a deeper understanding of the structure of the planar surfaces.
  We view our results as a continuation of the program initiated in [CPS23] to understand Yang-Mills theories via surfaces and as a refinement of the string trajectories point-of-view developed in [Cha19a].</description>

Abstract: Although it is long believed that vanishing of chiral central charges of a 2d conformal field theory (CFT) implies the existence of conformal boundary conditions, there are yet higher obstructions. In this paper, we focus on 2d rational CFTs, for which we identify a series of obstructions, known as higher central charges. We also discuss its implication for lattice realizations and the generalization with global symmetries.</description>

      <title>Spikes in Poissonian quantum trajectories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the dynamics of a continuously monitored qubit in the limit of strong measurement rate where the quantum trajectory is described by a stochastic master equation with Poisson noise. Such limits are expected to give rise to quantum jumps between the pointer states associated with the non-demolition measurement. A surprising discovery in earlier work [Tilloy et al., Phys. Rev. A 92, 052111 (2015)] on quantum trajectories with Brownian noise was the phenomena of spikes observed in between the quantum jumps. Here, we show that spikes are observed also for Poisson noise. We consider three cases where the non-demolition is broken by adding, to the basic strong measurement dynamics, either unitary evolution or thermal noise or additional measurements. We present a complete analysis of the spike and jump statistics for all three cases using the fact that the dynamics effectively corresponds to that of stochastic resetting. We provide numerical results to support our analytic results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we prove that Schr\"{o}dinger's equation with a Hamiltonian of the form $H=-\Delta+i(A \nabla + \nabla A) + V$, which includes a magnetic potential $A$, has the same dispersive and solution decay properties as the free Schr\"{o}dinger equation. In particular, we prove $L^1 \to L^\infty$ decay and some related estimates for the wave equation.
  The potentials $A$ and $V$ are short-range and $A$ has four derivatives, but they can be arbitrarily large. All results hold in three space dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to define a notion of non-commutative Gelfand duality. Using techniques from derived algebraic geometry, we show that category of rings is anti-equivalent to a subcategory of pre-ringed spaces, inspired by Grothendieck's work on commutative rings. Our notion of spectrum, although formally reminiscent of the Grothendieck spectrum, is new; in particular, for commutative rings it does not always agree with the Grothendieck spectrum, but it always projects onto it. Remarkably, an appropriately defined relative version of our spectrum agrees with the Grothendieck spectrum for finitely generated commutative algebras over the complex numbers. This work aims to represent the starting point for a rigorous study of geometric properties of quantum spacetimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04226v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A typical crystal is a finite piece of a material which may be invariant under some point symmetry group. If it is a so-called intrinsic higher-order topological insulator or superconductor, then it displays boundary modes at hinges or corners protected by the crystalline symmetry and the bulk topology. We explain the mechanism behind such phenomena using operator K-theory. Specifically, we derive a groupoid C*-algebra that 1) encodes the dynamics of the electrons in the infinite size limit of a crystal; 2) remembers the boundary conditions at the crystal's boundaries, and 3) admits a natural action by the point symmetries of the atomic lattice. The filtrations of the groupoid's unit space by closed subsets that are invariant under the groupoid and point group actions supply equivariant cofiltrations of the groupoid C*-algebra. We show that specific derivations of the induced spectral sequences in twisted equivariant K-theories enumerate all non-trivial higher-order bulk-boundary correspondences.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16583v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is shown that a large class of quantum dynamical maps on complex matrix algebras governed by time-local Master Equations tend to become entanglement breaking in the course of time. Such situation seems to be generic for quantum evolution and in particular, completely positive dynamical semigroups with a unique faithful stationary state enjoy this property. Inspired by this observation, we propose a new concept of eventually entanglement breaking divisible (eEB-divisible) dynamics. A dynamical map is eEB-divisible if any propagator becomes entanglement breaking in finite time. It turns out that eEB-divisibility is quite general and holds for a large class of quantum evolutions.</description>

Abstract: The article explores the acoustic equations in inhomogeneous media and the linearized shallow water equations.
  Two methods for integrating these equations are proposed. The first method is based on the of the Laplace cascade method, while the second involves reducing two-dimensional and three-dimensional models to the wave equation. In the case of plane waves, solutions to some equations depending on two arbitrary functions are obtained. In the two-dimensional and three-dimensional cases, equations that can be reduced to equations with constant coefficients are found.</description>

      <title>Generating function for quantum depletion of Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13576v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a Bose gas on the unit torus at zero temperature in the Gross-Pitaevskii regime, known to perform Bose-Einstein condensation: a macroscopic fraction of the bosons occupy the same quantum state, called condensate. We study the Bose gas' quantum depletion, that is the number of bosons outside the condensate, and derive an explicit asymptotic formula of its generating function. Moreover, we prove an upper bound for large deviations of the quantum depletion.</description>

      <title>Enhanced binding for a quantum particle coupled to scalar quantized field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22569v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a quantum particle coupled to a scalar quantized field, such as the regularized Nelson model. We show that there are situations where the Hamiltonian of the particle alone does not have a bound state, while the particle-field Hamiltonian has a ground state. This complements results for other models such as the Pauli--Fierz model, where such results have been shown. When the uncoupled quantum particle already has a bound state, we provide a new technique to show that this bound state persists when coupling the particle to the field, for any coupling strength. We especially do not use the binding condition. Our results use the functional integral representation and rely on a recent method using the Gaussian correlation inequality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09227v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Euler derived the differential equations of elastica by the variational method in 1744, but his original derivation has never been properly interpreted or explained in terms of modern mathematics. We elaborate Euler's original derivation of elastica and show that Euler used Noether's theorem concerning the translational symmetry of elastica, although Noether published her theorem in 1918. It is also shown that his equation is essentially the static modified KdV equation which is obtained by the isometric and isoenergy conditions, known as the Goldstein-Petrich scheme.</description>

      <title>Transmission eigenvalue distribution in disordered media from anisotropic field theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10355v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A field theory for the distribution of transmission eigenvalues through a disordered medium is developed in details. The central equation of this theory is a self-consistent transport equation for a $2\times 2$ matrix radiance. This equation determines the transmission eigenvalue distribution not only in the diffusive regime but also in the quasiballistic regime, where the radiance is expected to be significantly anisotropic in the material bulk. We show that the matrix transport equation can be solved analytically in this regime. We also show that, in addition to the finite-width waveguide, our equation is able to predict the transmission eigenvalue distribution through an infinite slab.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Field Theory of Wave Transmission Statistics in Disordered Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10360v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a field theory to characterize the mean distribution of transmission eigenvalues for coherent wave propagation through a disordered medium. Unlike the Dorokhov-Mello-Pereyra-Kumar (DMPK) theory, our approach does not rely on the isotropy hypothesis, which assumes uniform field intensity across scattering channels. As a result, it accurately predicts the transmission eigenvalue distribution both in the diffusive and quasiballistic regime. In addition, it proves to be more versatile than the DMPK theory, allowing for the incorporation of physical effects such as absorption or partial channel control with minimal adjustments to the formalism. Although these effects are commonly encountered in experiments on complex media, until now there has been no ab initio theory addressing them. Our predictions are numerically validated against transmission eigenvalue distributions computed from the microscopic wave equation.</description>

      <title>Double Copy from Tensor Products of Metric BV${}^{\color{gray} \blacksquare}$-algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.02563v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Field theories with kinematic Lie algebras, such as field theories featuring colour-kinematics duality, possess an underlying algebraic structure known as BV${}^{\color{gray} \blacksquare}$-algebra. If, additionally, matter fields are present, this structure is supplemented by a module for the BV${}^{\color{gray} \blacksquare}$-algebra. We explain this perspective, expanding on our previous work and providing many additional mathematical details. We also show how the tensor product of two metric BV${}^{\color{gray} \blacksquare}$-algebras yields the action of a new syngamy field theory, a construction which comprises the familiar double copy construction. As examples, we discuss various scalar field theories, Chern-Simons theory, self-dual Yang-Mills theory, and the pure spinor formulations of both M2-brane models and supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. The latter leads to a new cubic pure spinor action for ten-dimensional supergravity. We also give a homotopy-algebraic perspective on colour-flavour-stripping, obtain a new restricted tensor product over a wide class of bialgebras, and we show that any field theory (even one without colour-kinematics duality) comes with a kinematic $L_\infty$-algebra.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.16885v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We observe that an old theorem of Graham implies that for any positive integer $s$, there exists some positive integer $T(s)$ such that every $s$-colouring of $\mathbb{Z}^2$ contains a monochromatic pair of points $(x,y),(x',y')$ with $(x-x')^2 - (y-y')^2 = (T(s))^2$. By scaling, this implies that every finite colouring of $\mathbb{Q}^2$ contains a monochromatic pair of points $(x,y),(x',y')$ with $(x-x')^2 - (y-y')^2 = 1$, which answers in a strong sense a problem of Kosheleva and Kreinovich on a pseudo-Euclidean analogue of the Hadwiger-Nelson problem.
  The proof of Graham's theorem relies on repeated applications of van der Waerden's theorem, and so the resulting function $T(s)$ grows extremely quickly. We give an alternative proof in the weaker setting of having a second spacial dimension that results in a significantly improved bound. To be more precise, we prove that for every positive integer $s$ with $r\equiv 2 \pmod{4}$, every $s$-colouring of $\mathbb{Z}^3$ contains a monochromatic pair of points $(x,y,z),(x',y',z')$ such that $(x-x')^2 + (y-y')^2 - (z-z')^2 = (5^{(s-2)/4}(8\cdot 5^{(s-2)/2})!)^2$. In fact, we prove a stronger density version. The density version in $\mathbb{Z}^2$ remains open.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.01946v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The evaluation of graphs on 2-spheres is a central ingredient of the Turaev-Viro construction of three-dimensional topological field theories. In this article, we introduce a class of graphs, called extruded graphs, that is relevant for the Turaev-Viro construction with general defect configurations involving defects of various dimensions. We define the evaluation of extruded graphs and show that it is invariant under a set of moves. This ensures the computability and uniqueness of our evaluation.</description>

      <title>Spin-bounded correlations: rotation boxes within and beyond quantum theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09278v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How can detector click probabilities respond to spatial rotations around a fixed axis, in any possible physical theory? Here, we give a thorough mathematical analysis of this question in terms of "rotation boxes", which are analogous to the well-known notion of non-local boxes. We prove that quantum theory admits the most general rotational correlations for spins 0, 1/2, and 1, but we describe a metrological game where beyond-quantum resources of spin 3/2 outperform all quantum resources of the same spin. We prove a multitude of fundamental results about these correlations, including an exact convex characterization of the spin-1 correlations, a Tsirelson-type inequality for spins 3/2 and higher, and a proof that the general spin-J correlations provide an efficient outer SDP approximation to the quantum set. Furthermore, we review and consolidate earlier results that hint at a wealth of applications of this formalism: a theory-agnostic semi-device-independent randomness generator, an exact characterization of the quantum (2,2,2)-Bell correlations in terms of local symmetries, and the derivation of multipartite Bell witnesses. Our results illuminate the foundational question of how space constrains the structure of quantum theory, they build a bridge between semi-device-independent quantum information and spacetime physics, and they demonstrate interesting relations to topics such as entanglement witnesses, spectrahedra, and orbitopes.</description>

      <title>An ergodic theorem with weights and applications to random measures, RW homogenization and IPS hydrodynamics on point processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12348v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a multidimensional ergodic theorem with weighted averages for the action of the group $\mathbb{Z}^d$ on a probability space. At level $n$ weights are of the form $n^{-d} \psi(j/n)$, $ j\in \mathbb{Z}^d$, for real functions $\psi$ decaying suitably fast. We discuss applications to random measures and to quenched stochastic homogenization of random walks on simple point processes with long-range random jump rates, allowing to remove the technical Assumption (A9) from \cite[Theorem~4.4]{Fhom1}. This last result concerns also some semigroup and resolvent convergence particularly relevant for the derivation of the quenched hydrodynamic limit of interacting particle systems via homogenization and duality. As a consequence we show that also the quenched hydrodynamic limit of the symmetric simple exclusion process on point processes stated in \cite[Theorem~4.1]{F_SEP} remains valid when removing the above mentioned Assumption (A9).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05474v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This book delves into the burgeoning field of quantum resource theories, a novel and vibrant area of research within quantum information science that seeks to unify diverse quantum phenomena under a single framework. By recognizing various attributes of physical systems as "resources," this approach offers a fresh perspective on quantum phenomena, transforming our understanding and application of concepts such as quantum entanglement, coherence, and more. With a focus on the pedagogical, the book aims to equip readers with the advanced mathematical tools and physical principles needed to navigate and contribute to this rapidly evolving field. It covers a wide range of topics, from the foundational aspects of quantum mechanics and quantum information to detailed explorations of specific resource theories, including entanglement, asymmetry, and thermodynamics. Through rigorous mathematical exposition and a unique axiomatic approach, the book provides deep insights into the operational and conceptual frameworks that underpin quantum resource theories, making it an invaluable resource for graduate students, early-career researchers, and anyone interested in the cutting-edge developments in quantum information science.</description>

      <title>Casimir effect of a rough membrane in an Aether-like Lorentz-violating scenario</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13187v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the Casimir effect of a rough membrane within the framework of theories that break Lorentz symmetry. We consider two constant Aether vectors: one timelike and other spacelike, simultaneously. We employ an appropriate change of coordinates such that the membrane assumes a completely flat border and the remaining terms associated with the roughness are considered as part of the potential. Quantum fluctuations are induced by a scalar quantum field subject to Dirichlet boundary conditions. The spectrum is obtained through perturbation theory and regularized using the $\zeta$--function method. We provide an explicit example of a membrane with periodic boundaries. The presence of Aether vectors has a significant impact on the dominant term of the Casimir effect, while roughness only affects the secondary terms. Additionally, we examine the finite-temperature case.</description>

      <title>Finite-size Nagle-Kardar model: Casimir force</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18324v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive exact results for the critical Casimir force (CCF) within the
  Nagle-Kardar model with periodic boundary conditions (PBC's). The model represents one-dimensional Ising chain with long-range equivalent-neighbor ferromagnetic interactions of strength $J_{l}/N&gt;0$ superimposed on the nearest-neighbor interactions of strength $J_{s}$ which could be either ferromagnetic ($J_{s}&gt;0$) or antiferromagnetic ($J_{s}&lt;0$). In the infinite system limit the model exhibits in the plane $(K_s=\beta J_s,K_l=\beta J_l)$ a critical line $2 K_l=\exp{\left(-2 K_s\right)}, K_s&gt;-\ln3/4$, which ends at a tricritical point $(K_l=-\sqrt{3}/2, K_s=-\ln3/4)$. The critical Casimir amplitudes are: $\Delta_{\rm Cas}^{\rm (cr)}=1/4$ at the critical line, and $\Delta_{\rm Cas}^{\rm (tr)}=1/3$ at the tricritical point. Quite unexpectedly, with the imposed PBC's the CCF exhibits very unusual behavior as a function of temperature and magnetic field. It is \textit{repulsive} near the critical line and tricritical point, decaying rapidly with separation from those two singular regimes fast away from them and becoming \textit{attractive}, displaying in which the maximum amplitude of the attraction exceeds the maximum amplitude of repulsion.
  This represents a violation of the widely-accepted ``boundary condition rule,'' which holds that the CCF is attractive for equivalent BC's and repulsive for conflicting BC's \textit{independently} of the actual bulk universality class of the phase transition under investigation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09426v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use the SLE$_\kappa$ loop measure to construct a natural representation of the Virasoro algebra of central charge $c = c(\kappa) \le 1$. In particular, we introduce a non-degenerate bilinear Hermitian form (and non positive-definite) using the SLE loop measure and show that the representation is indefinite unitary. Our proof relies on the infinitesimal conformal restriction property of the SLE loop measure.</description>

      <title>Bridging Classical and Quantum: Group-Theoretic Approach to Quantum Circuit Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19575v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficiently simulating quantum circuits on classical computers is a fundamental challenge in quantum computing. This paper presents a novel theoretical approach that achieves exponential speedups (polynomial runtime) over existing simulators for a wide class of quantum circuits. The technique leverages advanced group theory and symmetry considerations to map quantum circuits to equivalent forms amenable to efficient classical simulation. Several fundamental theorems are proven that establish the mathematical foundations of this approach, including a generalized Gottesman-Knill theorem. The potential of this method is demonstrated through theoretical analysis and preliminary benchmarks. This work contributes to the understanding of the boundary between classical and quantum computation, provides new tools for quantum circuit analysis and optimization, and opens up avenues for further research at the intersection of group theory and quantum computation. The findings may have implications for quantum algorithm design, error correction, and the development of more efficient quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>On an integrable discretization of the massive Thirring model in light-cone coordinates and the associated Yang-Baxter map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13913v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a fully discrete analog of the massive Thirring model in light-cone coordinates by constructing its Lax-pair representation. This Lax-pair representation can also be used to define a new Yang-Baxter map, so we obtain a Yang-Baxter map that admits a continuous limit. We present most of the results for the general case where the dependent variables are matrix-valued.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14091v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the notion of a multiplicative unimodularity for a coisotropic Poisson homogeneous space. Then, we discuss the unimodularity and the multiplicative unimodularity for these spaces and the existence of an invariant volume form for explicit Hamiltonian systems on such spaces. Several interesting examples illustrating the theoretical results are also presented.</description>

      <title>Resurgence in Liouville Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14574v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Liouville conformal field theory is a prototypical example of an exactly solvable quantum field theory, in the sense that the correlation functions in an arbitrary background can be determined exactly using only the constraints of unitarity and crossing symmetry. For example, the three point correlation functions are given by the famous formula of Dorn-Otto-Zamolodchikov-Zamolodchikov (DOZZ). Unlike many other exactly solvable theories, Liouville theory has a continuously tunable parameter -- essentially $\hbar$ -- which is related to the central charge of the theory. Here we investigate the nature of the perturbative expansion in powers of $\hbar$, which is the loop expansion around a semi-classical solution. We show that the perturbative coefficients grow factorially, as expected of a Feynman diagram expansion, and take the form of an asymptotic series. We identify the singularities in the Borel plane, and show that they are associated with complex instanton solutions of Liouville theory; they correspond precisely to the complex solutions described by Harlow, Maltz, and Witten. Both single- and multi-valued solutions of Liouville appear. We show that the perturbative loop expansions around these different saddle points mix in the way expected for a trans-series expansion. Thus Liouville theory provides a calculable example of a quantum field theory where perturbative and instanton contributions can be summed up and assembled into a finite answer.</description>

      <title>R-matrices and Miura operators in 5d Chern-Simons theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15712v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive Miura operators for $W$- and $Y$-algebras from first principles as the expectation value of the intersection between a topological line defect and a holomorphic surface defect in 5-dimensional non-commutative $\mathfrak{gl}(1)$ Chern-Simons theory. The expectation value, viewed as the transition amplitude for states in the defect theories forming representations of the affine Yangian of $\mathfrak{gl}(1)$, satisfies the Yang-Baxter equation and is thus interpreted as an R-matrix. To achieve this, we identify the representations associated with the line and surface defects by calculating the operator product expansions (OPEs) of local operators on the defects, as conditions that anomalous Feynman diagrams cancel each other. We then evaluate the expectation value of the defect intersection using Feynman diagrams. When the line and surface defects are specified, we demonstrate that the expectation value precisely matches the Miura operators and their products.</description>

      <title>Constraining Genetic Symbolic Regression via Semantic Backpropagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07369v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Evolutionary symbolic regression approaches are powerful tools that can approximate an explicit mapping between input features and observation for various problems. However, ensuring that explored expressions maintain consistency with domain-specific constraints remains a crucial challenge. While neural networks are able to employ additional information like conservation laws to achieve more appropriate and robust approximations, the potential remains unrealized within genetic algorithms. This disparity is rooted in the inherent discrete randomness of recombining and mutating to generate new mapping expressions, making it challenging to maintain and preserve inferred constraints or restrictions in the course of the exploration. To address this limitation, we propose an approach centered on semantic backpropagation incorporated into the Gene Expression Programming (GEP), which integrates domain-specific properties in a vector representation as corrective feedback during the evolutionary process. By creating backward rules akin to algorithmic differentiation and leveraging pre-computed subsolutions, the mechanism allows the enforcement of any constraint within an expression tree by determining the misalignment and propagating desired changes back. To illustrate the effectiveness of constraining GEP through semantic backpropagation, we take the constraint of physical dimension as an example. This framework is applied to discovering physical equations from the Feynman lectures. Results have shown not only an increased likelihood of recovering the original equation but also notable robustness in the presence of noisy data.</description>

      <title>Infinite cycles of interacting bosons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19695v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the first-quantized description of bosonic systems permutation cycles formed by the particles play a fundamental role. In the ideal Bose gas Bose-Enstein condensation (BEC) is signaled by the appearance of infinite cycles. When the particles interact, the two phenomena may not be simultaneous, the existence of infinite cycles is necessary but not sufficient for BEC. We demonstrate that their appearance is always accompanied by a singularity in the thermodynamic quantities which in three and four dimensions can be as strong as a one-sided divergence of the isothermal compressibility. Arguments are presented that long-range interactions can give rise to unexpected results, such as the absence of infinite cycles in three dimensions for long-range repulsion or their presence in one and two dimensions if the pair potential has a long attractive tail.</description>

Abstract: I carry out numerical scattering calculations against a family of finite-length one-dimensional point-like arrangements of atoms, $\chi(x)$, related to the distribution of prime numbers by a shift operation making the atomic density approximately constant. I show how the Riemann Zeta Function (RZF) naturally parameterizes the analytic structure of the scattering amplitude and give numerical results.</description>

      <title>Exact WKB in all sectors I: Potentials with degenerate saddles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09511v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the exact-WKB (EWKB) method through the analysis of Airy and Weber types, with an emphasis on the exact quantization of locally harmonic potentials in multiple sectors. The core innovation of our work lies in introducing a novel complexification approach to the energy parameter $u$, distinct from the common complexification of the (semi-classical) expansion parameter used in Borel summability. This new technique allows for continuous analytical continuation across different sectors of a potential while maintaining the exact quantization condition, even before median summation. By redefining the $A$-cycle above the potential barrier top, we ensure the quantization condition remains real and, by use of the Stokes automorphism and the median resummation, show that the resurgence structure is preserved across transitions between sectors. Furthermore, we discuss the Weber-type exact-WKB method, offering exact estimates for quantum actions around all types of saddle points, generalizing previous results. Through the analysis of these quantum actions, we reveal the presence of $S$-duality, facilitating the exchange between perturbative and non-perturbative behaviors, and we conjecture the mapping of the P-NP relations between dual theories. Our study encompasses periodic and symmetric double-well potentials, demonstrating that the exact-WKB method captures intricate structures in quantum systems in all sectors, including multi-instanton contributions and the resurgence of quantum actions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09863v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We remind the definition and main properties of the Krichever quasiclassical tau-function, and turn to the application of these formulas for recent studies of two-dimensional quantum gravity. We show, that in the case of minimal gravity it turns to be directly related with the Verlinde formula for minimal models, giving in particular case its one more direct proof. Generalizations for continuous "complex Liouville" theory are also briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Operator algebra and algorithmic construction of boundaries and defects in (2+1)D topological Pauli stabilizer codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11942v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a computational algorithm for constructing all boundaries and defects of topological generalized Pauli stabilizer codes in two spatial dimensions. Utilizing the operator algebra formalism, we establish a one-to-one correspondence between the topological data-such as anyon types, fusion rules, topological spins, and braiding statistics-of (2+1)D bulk stabilizer codes and (1+1)D boundary anomalous subsystem codes. To make the operator algebra computationally accessible, we adapt Laurent polynomials and convert the tasks into matrix operations, e.g., the Hermite normal form for obtaining boundary anyons and the Smith normal form for determining fusion rules. This approach enables computers to automatically generate all possible gapped boundaries and defects for topological Pauli stabilizer codes through boundary anyon condensation and topological order completion. This streamlines the analysis of surface codes and associated logical operations for fault-tolerant quantum computation. Our algorithm applies to $Z_d$ qudits, including both prime and nonprime $d$, thus enabling the exploration of topological quantum codes beyond toric codes. We have applied the algorithm and explicitly demonstrated the lattice constructions of 2 boundaries and 6 defects in the $Z_2$ toric code, 3 boundaries and 22 defects in the $Z_4$ toric code, 1 boundary and 2 defects in the double semion code, 1 boundary and 22 defects in the six-semion code, 6 boundaries and 270 defects in the color code, and 6 defects in the anomalous three-fermion code. In addition, we investigate the boundaries of two specific bivariate bicycle codes within a family of low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. We demonstrate that their topological orders are equivalent to 8 and 10 copies of $Z_2$ toric codes, with anyons restricted to move by 12 and 1023 lattice sites in the square lattice, respectively.</description>

      <title>Analytical Expressions for Effective Indices of Modes of Optical Fibers Near and Beyond Cutoff</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01154v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive an analytical expression for the effective indices of modes of circular step-index fibers valid near their cutoff wavelengths. The approximation, being a first-order Taylor series of a smooth function, is also valid for the real part of the effective index beyond cutoff where the modes become lossy. The approximation is used to derive certain previously unknown mode properties. For example, it is shown that for non-dispersive materials the EH-mode group index at cutoff, surprisingly, does not depend on wavelength, core radius, or even radial mode order.</description>
