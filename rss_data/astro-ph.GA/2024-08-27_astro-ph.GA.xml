      <title>Sequential formation of supermassive stars and heavy seed BHs through the interplay of cosmological cold accretion and stellar radiative feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supermassive stars (SMSs) and heavy seed black holes, as their remnants, are promising candidates for Supermassive Black Hole (SMBH) progenitors, especially for ones observed in the early universe $ z\simeq 8.5-10$ by recent JWST observations. Expected cradles of SMSs are the atomic cooling halos ($M_{\rm halo}\simeq 10^7~{\rm M_\odot}$), where "cold accretion" emerges and possibly forms SMSs. We perform a suit of cosmological radiation hydrodynamics simulations and investigate star formation after the emergence of cold accretion, solving radiative feedback from stars inside the halo. We follow the mass growth of the protostars for $\sim 3~{\rm Myr}$, resolving the gas inflow down to $\sim 0.1~{\rm pc}$ scales. We discover that, after cold accretion emerges, multiple SMSs of $m_\star \gtrsim 10^5{\rm M_\odot}$ form at the halo centre with the accretion rates maintained at $\dot{m}_\star \simeq 0.04~{\rm M_\odot}~{\rm yr^{-1}}$ for $\lesssim 3~{\rm Myr}$. Cold accretion supplies gas at a rate of $\dot{M}_{\rm gas}\gtrsim 0.01-0.1~{\rm M_\odot}~{\rm yr^{-1}}$ from outside the halo virial radius to the central gas disc. Gravitational torques from spiral arms transport gas further inward, which feeds the SMSs. Radiative feedback from stars suppresses H$_2$ cooling and disc fragmentation, while photoevaporation is prevented by a dense envelope, which attenuates ionising radiation. Our results suggest that cold accretion can bring efficient BH mass growth after seed formation in the later universe. Moreover, cold accretion and gas migration inside the central disc increase the mass concentration and provide a promising formation site for the extremely compact stellar clusters observed by JWST.</description>

      <title>The potential for long-lived intermediate mass black hole binaries in the lowest density dwarf galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intermediate Mass Black Hole (IMBH) mergers with masses $10^4 - 10^6$ $M_{\odot}$ are expected to produce gravitational waves (GWs) detectable by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) with high signal to noise ratios out to redshift 20. IMBH mergers are expected to take place within dwarf galaxies, however, the dynamics, timescales, and effect on their hosts are largely unexplored. In a previous study, we examined how IMBHs would pair and merge within nucleated dwarf galaxies. IMBHs in nucleated hosts evolve very efficiently, forming a binary system and coalescing within a few hundred million years. Although the fraction of dwarf galaxies ($10^7$ M$_{\odot} \leq$ $M_{\star} \leq 10^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$) hosting nuclear star clusters is between 60-100\%, this fraction drops to 20-70\% for lower-mass dwarfs ($M_{\star}\approx 10^7$ M$_{\odot}$), with the largest drop in low-density environments. Here, we extend our previous study by performing direct $N-$body simulations to explore the dynamics and evolution of IMBHs within non-nucleated dwarf galaxies, under the assumption that IMBHs exist within these dwarfs. To our surprise, none of IMBHs in our simulation suite merge within a Hubble time, despite many attaining high eccentricities $e \sim 0.7-0.95$. We conclude that extremely low stellar density environments in the centers of non-nucleated dwarfs do not provide an ample supply of stars to interact with IMBHs binary resulting in its stalling, in spite of triaxiality and high eccentricity, common means to drive a binary to coalescence. Our findings underline the importance of considering all detailed host properties to predict IMBH merger rates for LISA.</description>

      <title>H$_3^+$ absorption and emission in local U/LIRGs with JWST/NIRSpec: Evidence for high H$_2$ ionization rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the 3.4-4.4$\mu$m fundamental rovibrational band of H3+, a key tracer of the ionization of the molecular interstellar medium (ISM), in a sample of 12 local (d&lt; 400 Mpc) ultra/luminous infrared galaxies (U/LIRGs) observed with JWST/NIRSpec. The P, Q, and R branches of the band are detected in 13 out of 20 analyzed regions within these U/LIRGs, which increases the number of extragalactic H3+ detections by a factor of 6. For the first time in the ISM, the H3+ band is observed in emission in 3 of these regions. In the remaining 10 regions, the band is seen in absorption. The absorptions are produced toward the 3.4-4.4$\mu$m hot dust continuum rather than toward the stellar continuum, indicating that they likely originate in clouds associated with the dust continuum source. The H3+ band is undetected in Seyfert-like U/LIRGs where the mildly obscured X-ray radiation from the AGN might limit the abundance of this molecule. For the detections, the H3+ abundances, N(H3+)/N_H = (0.5-5.5)x10^-7, imply relatively high ionization rates between 3x10^-16 and &gt;4x10^-15 s^-1, which are likely associated with high-energy cosmic rays. In half of the targets the absorptions are blue-shifted by 50-180 km/s, which are lower than the molecular outflow velocities measured using other tracers such as OH 119$\mu$m or rotational CO lines. This suggests that H3+ traces gas close to the outflow launching sites before it has been fully accelerated. We used nonlocal thermodynamic equilibrium models to investigate the physical conditions of these clouds. In 7 out of 10 objects, the H3+ excitation is consistent with inelastic collisions with H2 in warm translucent molecular clouds (T_kin ~ 250-500 K and n(H2) ~ 10^(2-3) cm^-3). In three objects, dominant infrared pumping excitation is required to explain the absorptions from the (3,0) and (2,1) levels of H3+ detected for the first time in the ISM.</description>

      <title>The Extended Mapping Obscuration to Reionization with ALMA (Ex-MORA) Survey: 5$\sigma$ Source Catalog and Redshift Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the greatest challenges in galaxy evolution over the last decade has been constraining the prevalence of heavily dust-obscured galaxies in the early Universe. At $z&gt;3$, these galaxies are increasingly rare, and difficult to identify as they are interspersed among the more numerous dust-obscured galaxy population at $z=1-3$, making efforts to secure confident spectroscopic redshifts expensive, and sometimes unsuccessful. In this work, we present the Extended Mapping Obscuration to Reionization with ALMA (Ex-MORA) Survey -- a 2mm blank-field survey in the COSMOS-Web field, and the largest ever ALMA blank-field survey to-date covering 577 arcmin$^2$. Ex-MORA is an expansion of the MORA survey designed to identify primarily $z&gt;3$ dusty, star-forming galaxies while simultaneously filtering out the more numerous $z&lt;3$ population by leveraging the very negative $K$-correction at observed-frame 2mm. We identify 37 significant ($&gt;$5$\sigma$) sources, 33 of which are robust thermal dust emitters. We measure a median redshift of $\langle z \rangle = 3.6^{+0.1}_{-0.2}$, with two-thirds of the sample at $z&gt;3$, and just under half at $z&gt;4$, demonstrating the overall success of the 2mm-selection technique. The integrated $z&gt;3$ volume density of Ex-MORA sources is $\sim1-3\times10^{-5}$ Mpc$^{-3}$, consistent with other surveys of infrared luminous galaxies at similar epochs. We also find that techniques using rest-frame optical emission (or lack thereof) to identify $z&gt;3$ heavily dust-obscured galaxies miss at least half of Ex-MORA galaxies. This supports the idea that the dusty galaxy population is heterogeneous, and that synergies across observatories spanning multiple energy regimes are critical to understanding their formation and evolution at $z&gt;3$.</description>

      <title>Bursts of star formation and radiation-driven outflows produce efficient LyC leakage from dense compact star clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The escape of LyC photons emitted by massive stars from the dense interstellar medium of galaxies is one of the most significant bottlenecks for cosmological reionization. The escape fraction shows significant scatter between galaxies, and anisotropic, spatial variation within them, motivating further study of the underlying physical factors responsible for these trends. We perform numerical radiation hydrodynamic simulations of idealized clouds with different gas surface densities (compactness) $\Sigma \sim 10^2$--$10^5 \, M_{\odot} \rm{pc}^{-2}$, meant to emulate star cluster-forming clumps ranging from conditions typical of the local Universe to the high ISM-pressure conditions more frequently encountered at high redshift. Our results indicate that dense compact star clusters with $\Sigma \gtrsim 10^4 \, M_{\odot} \rm{pc}^{-2}$ efficiently leak LyC photons, with cloud-scale luminosity-weighted average escape fractions $\gtrsim 80\%$ as opposed to $\lesssim 10\%$ for $\Sigma \sim 100 \, M_{\odot} \rm{pc}^{-2}$. This occurs due to higher star formation efficiencies and shorter dynamical timescales at higher $\Sigma$; the former results in higher intrinsic LyC emission, and the latter implies rapid evolution, with a burst of star formation followed by rapid gas dispersal, permitting high LyC escape well before the intrinsic LyC emission of stellar populations drop ($\sim 4 \, \mathrm{Myr}$). LyC escape in dense clouds is primarily facilitated by highly ionized outflows driven by radiation pressure on dust with velocities $ \sim 3$ times the cloud escape velocity. We also vary the (assumed) dust abundances ($Z_{\rm{d}}$) and find a very mild increase ($\sim 10%$) in the escape fraction for $\sim 100$ lower $Z_{\mathrm{d}}$. Our results suggest a scenario in which localized compact bursts of star formation in galaxies are disproportionately productive sites of LyC leakage.</description>

      <title>Massive star cluster formation III. Early mass segregation during cluster assembly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mass segregation is seen in many star clusters, but whether massive stars form in the center of a cluster or migrate there dynamically is still debated. N-body simulations have shown that early dynamical mass segregation is possible when sub-clusters merge to form a dense core with a small crossing time. However, the effect of gas dynamics on both the formation and dynamics of the stars could inhibit the formation of the dense core. We aim to study the dynamical mass segregation of star cluster models that include gas dynamics and self-consistently form stars from the dense substructure in the gas. Our models use the Torch framework, which is based on AMUSE and includes stellar and magnetized gas dynamics, as well as stellar evolution and feedback from radiation, stellar winds, and supernovae. Our models consist of three star clusters forming from initial turbulent spherical clouds of mass $10^{4,5,6}\rm~M_\odot$ and radius $11.7\rm~pc$ that have final stellar masses of $3.6\times10^3\rm~M_\odot$, $6.5\times10^4\rm~M_\odot$, and $8.9\times10^5\rm~M_\odot$, respectively. There is no primordial mass segregation in the model by construction. All three clusters become dynamically mass segregated at early times via collapse confirming that this mechanism occurs within sub-clusters forming directly out of the dense substructure in the gas. The dynamics of the embedded gas and stellar feedback do not inhibit the collapse of the cluster. We find that each model cluster becomes mass segregated within $2~$Myr of the onset of star formation, reaching the levels observed in young clusters in the Milky Way. However, we note that the exact values are highly time-variable during these early phases of evolution. Massive stars that segregate to the center during core collapse are likely to be dynamically ejected, a process that can decrease the overall level of mass segregation again.</description>

      <title>KBSS-InCLOSE I: Design and First Results from the Inner CGM of QSO Line Of Sight Emitting Galaxies at z~2-3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the design and first results of the Inner Circumgalactic Medium (CGM) of QSO Line of Sight Emitting galaxies at $z\sim 2-3$, KBSS-InCLOSE. The survey will connect galaxy properties (e.g., stellar mass $M_*$, interstellar medium ISM metallicity) with the physical conditions of the inner CGM (e.g., kinematics, metallicity) to directly observe the galaxy-scale baryon cycle. We obtain deep Keck/KCWI optical IFU pointings of Keck Baryonic Structure Survey (KBSS) QSOs to discover new star-forming galaxies at small projected distances $b\lesssim12"$ (98 kpc, $\overline{z}=2.3$), then obtain follow-up Keck/MOSFIRE NIR spectra to confirm their redshifts. We leverage KBSS images and Keck/HIRES QSO spectra to model stellar populations and inner CGM absorption. In this paper, we analyze two QSO fields and discover more than 15 new galaxies with KCWI, then use MOSFIRE for two galaxies Q2343-G1 ($z=2.43$; G1) and Q2233-N1 ($z=3.15$; N1), which are both associated with Damped Lyman Alpha absorbers. We find that G1 has typical $M_*$,UV/optical emission properties. N1 has lower $M_*$ with very strong nebular emission. We jointly analyze neutral phase CGM and ionized ISM in N/O (for the first time at this $z$), dust extinction, and high-ionization CGM finding that: G1's CGM is metal poor and less evolved than its ISM, while N1's CGM and ISM abundances are comparable; their CGM shows $\sim1$ dex less dust extinction than the ISM; and G1's CGM has direct evidence of hot, metal-rich galactic outflow ejecta. These findings support that metals and dust are driven into the CGM from outflows, but may also be e.g., stripped ISM gas or satellite enrichment. The full KBSS-InCLOSE sample will explore these scenarios.</description>

      <title>Assessing realistic binding energies of some essential interstellar radicals with amorphous solid water: A fully quantum chemical approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the absence of laboratory data, state-of-the-art quantum chemical approaches can provide estimates on the binding energy (BE) of interstellar species with grains. Without BE values, contemporary astrochemical models are compelled to utilize wild guesses, often delivering misleading information. Here, we employ a fully quantum chemical approach to estimate the BE of 7 diatomic radicals - CH, NH, OH, SH, CN, NS, and NO, playing a crucial role in shaping the interstellar chemical composition, using a suitable amorphous solid water model as a substrate since water is the principal constituent of interstellar ice in dense and shielded regions. While the BEs are compatible with physisorption, the binding of CH in some sites shows chemisorption, in which a chemical bond to an oxygen atom of a water molecule is formed. While no structural change can be observed for the CN radical, it is believed that the formation of a hemibonded system between the outer layer of the water cluster and the radical is the reason for the unusually large BE in one of the binding sites considered in our study. A significantly lower BE for NO, consistent with recent calculations, is obtained, which is useful in explaining the recently observed HONO/NH2OH and HONO/HNO ratio in the low-mass hot corino, IRAS 16293-2422B, with chemical models.</description>

      <title>A Yebes W band Line Survey towards an Unshocked Molecular Cloud of Supernova Remnant 3C391: Evidence of Cosmic-Ray-Induced Chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic rays (CRs) have strong influences on the chemistry of dense molecular clouds (MCs). To study the detailed chemistry induced by CRs, we conducted a Yebes W band line survey towards an unshocked MC (which we named as 3C391:NML) associated with supernova remnant (SNR) 3C391. We detected emission lines of 18 molecular species in total and estimated their column densities with local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) and non-LTE analysis. Using the abundance ratio N(HCO+)/N(CO) and an upper limit of N(DCO+)/N(HCO+), we estimated the CR ionization rate of 3C391:NML is $\zeta\gtrsim 2.7\times 10^{-14}\rm \ s^{-1}$ with an analytic method. However, we caution on adopting this value because chemical equilibrium, which is a prerequisite of using the equations, is not necessarily reached in 3C391:NML. We observed lower N(HCO+)/N(HOC+), higher N(HCS+)/N(CS), and higher X($l$-C3H+) by an order of magnitude in 3C391:NML than the typical values in quiescent dense MCs. We found that an enhanced CR ionization rate (of order $\sim 10^{-15}$ or $\sim 10^{-14}\rm \ s^{-1}$) is needed to reproduce the observation with chemical model. This is higher than the values found in typical MCs by 2--3 orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>A Deep Dive into the NGC 741 Galaxy Group: Insights into a Spectacular Head-Tail Radio Galaxy from VLA, MeerKAT, uGMRT and LOFAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present deep, wideband multifrequency radio observations (144 MHz$-$8 GHz) of the remarkable galaxy group NGC 741, which yield crucial insights into the interaction between the infalling head-tail radio galaxy (NGC 742) and the main group. Our new data provide an unprecedentedly detailed view of the NGC 741-742 system, including the shock cone, disrupted jets from NGC 742, the long ($\sim$ 255 kpc) braided southern radio tail, and eastern lobe-like structure, and reveal, for the first time, complex radio filaments throughout the tail and lobe, and a likely vortex ring behind the shock cone. The cone traces the bow shock caused by the supersonic ($\mathcal{M}\sim2$) interaction between the head-tail radio galaxy NGC 742 and the intragroup medium (IGrM) while the ring may have been formed by interaction between the NGC 742 shock and a previously existing lobe associated with NGC 741. This interaction plausibly compressed and re-accelerated the radio plasma. We estimate that shock-heating by NGC 742 has likely injected $\sim$2-5$\times$10$^{57}$ erg of thermal energy into the central 10 kpc cooling region of the IGrM, potentially affecting the cooling and feedback cycle of NGC 741. A comparison with Chandra X-ray images shows that some of the previously detected thermal filaments align with radio edges, suggesting compression of the IGrM as the relativistic plasma of the NGC 742 tail interacts with the surrounding medium. Our results highlight that multi-frequency observations are key to disentangling the complex, intertwined origins of the variety of radio features seen in the galaxy group NGC 741, and the need for simulations to reproduce all the detected features.</description>

      <title>EDGE: Predictable Scatter in the Stellar Mass--Halo Mass Relation of Dwarf Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stellar-mass--halo-mass (SMHM) relation is central to our understanding of galaxy formation and the nature of dark matter. However, its normalisation, slope, and scatter are highly uncertain at dwarf galaxy scales. In this paper, we present DarkLight, a new semi-empirical dwarf galaxy formation model designed to robustly predict the SMHM relation for the smallest galaxies. DarkLight harnesses a correlation between the mean star formation rate of dwarfs and their peak rotation speed -- the $\langle$SFR$\rangle$-$v_{\rm max}$ relation -- that we derive from simulations and observations. Given the sparsity of data for isolated dwarfs with $v_{\rm max} \lesssim 20$ km/s, we fit the $\langle$SFR$\rangle$-$v_{\rm max}$ relation to observational data for dwarfs above this velocity scale and to the high-resolution EDGE cosmological simulations below. Reionisation quenching is implemented via distinct $\langle$SFR$\rangle$-$v_{\rm max}$ relations before and after reionisation. We find that the SMHM scatter is small at reionisation, $\sim$0.2 dex, but rises to $\sim$0.5 dex ($1\sigma$) at a halo mass of $\sim$10$^9$ M$_\odot$ as star formation is quenched by reionisation but dark matter halo masses continue to grow. While we do not find a significant break in the slope of the SMHM relation, one can be introduced if reionisation occurs early ($z_{\rm quench} \gtrsim 5$). Finally, we find that dwarfs can be star forming today down to a halo mass of $\sim$2 $\times 10^9$ M$_\odot$. We predict that the lowest mass star forming dwarf irregulars in the nearby universe are the tip of the iceberg of a much larger population of quiescent isolated dwarfs.</description>

      <title>Why are optical coronal lines faint in active galactic nuclei?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Forbidden collisionally excited optical atomic transitions from high ionization potential (IP$\geq$54.8\,eV) ions, such as Ca$^{\mathrm{4+}}$, Ne$^{\mathrm{4+}}$, Fe$^{\mathrm{6+}}$, Fe$^{\mathrm{10+}}$, Fe$^{\mathrm{13+}}$, Ar$^{\mathrm{9+}}$, and S$^{\mathrm{11+}}$, are known as optical coronal lines (CLs). The spectral energy distribution (SED) of active galactic nuclei (AGN) typically extends to hundreds of electron volts and above, which should be able to produce such highly ionized gas. However, optical CLs are often not detected in AGN. Here we use photoionization calculations with the \textsc{Cloudy} spectral synthesis code to determine possible reasons for the rarity of these optical CLs. We calculate CL luminosities and equivalent widths from radiation pressure confined photoionized gas slabs exposed to an AGN continuum. We consider the role of dust, metallicity, and ionizing SED in the formation of optical CLs. We find that (1) dust reduces the strength of most CLs by $\sim$three orders of magnitude, primarily as a result of depletion of metals onto the dust grains. (2) In contrast to the CLs, the more widely observed lower IP optical lines such as [O\, III] 5007\,\AA, are less affected by depletion and some are actually enhanced in dusty gas. (3) In dustless gas many optical CLs become detectable, and are particularly strong for a hard ionizing SED. This implies that prominent CL emission likely originate in dustless gas. Our calculations also suggest optical CL emission is enhanced in galaxies with low mass black holes characterized by a harder radiation field and a low dust to metal ratio. The fact that optical CLs are not widely observed in the early universe with JWST may point to rapid dust formation at high redshift.</description>

      <title>Key Science Goals for the Next Generation Very Large Array (ngVLA): Update from the ngVLA Science Advisory Council (2024)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 2017, the next generation Very Large Array (ngVLA) Science Advisory Council, together with the international astronomy community, developed a set of five Key Science Goals (KSGs) to inform, prioritize and refine the technical capabilities of a future radio telescope array for high angular resolution operation from 1.2 - 116 GHz with 10 times the sensitivity of the Jansky VLA and ALMA. The resulting KSGs, which require observations at centimeter and millimeter wavelengths that cannot be achieved by any other facility, represent a small subset of the broad range of astrophysical problems that the ngVLA will be able address. This document presents an update to the original ngVLA KSGs, taking account of new results and progress in the 7+ years since their initial presentation, again drawing on the expertise of the ngVLA Science Advisory Council and the broader community in the ngVLA Science Working Groups. As the design of the ngVLA has also matured substantially in this period, this document also briefly addresses initial expectations for ngVLA data products and processing that will be needed to achieve the KSGs. The original ngVLA KSGs endure as outstanding problems of high priority. In brief, they are: (1) Unveiling the Formation of Solar System Analogues; (2) Probing the Initial Conditions for Planetary Systems and Life with Astrochemistry; (3) Charting the Assembly, Structure, and Evolution of Galaxies from the First Billion Years to the Present; (4) Science at the Extremes: Pulsars as Laboratories for Fundamental Physics; (5) Understanding the Formation and Evolution of Stellar and Supermassive Black Holes in the Era of Multi-Messenger Astronomy.</description>

      <title>New supernova remnant candidates in the LOFAR Two Metre Sky Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In spite of their key role in galaxy evolution and several decades of observational efforts, the census of supernova remnants (SNRs) in our Galaxy remains incomplete. Theoretical predictions based on the local supernova rate estimate the expected number of SNRs in the Galaxy to be $\gtrsim$ 1000. By contrast, the number of detected SNRs amounts to about 300. High-resolution, wide-area radio surveys at low frequencies are ideal tools with which to find missing SNRs, given the prominence of these sources at low radio frequencies. We aim to find missing SNRs using proprietary data from the LOFAR Two-Metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) at 144~MHz. We used LoTSS total intensity maps of two Galactic regions, one with $39^\mathrm{o} &lt; l &lt; 66^\mathrm{o}$ and $|b|&lt; 2.5^\mathrm{o}$, and the other with $145^\mathrm{o} &lt; l &lt; 150^\mathrm{o}$ and $|b| &lt; 3^\mathrm{o}$, in addition to mid-infrared (MIR) data from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) all-sky survey to search for SNR candidates. We report the discovery of 14 new SNR candidates selected on the basis of their morphology at 144 MHz and a lack of MIR emission. We also follow up on 24 previously reported SNR candidates, inferring their spectral index between the LoTSS frequency (144 MHz) and the frequency at which they were reported. The high resolution and sensitivity of LoTSS observations has resulted in the detection of 14 new SNR candidates. In order to unambiguously confirm the SNR nature of these candidates, follow-up X-ray observations are required with facilities such as eROSITA.</description>

      <title>Distance estimation of gamma-ray emitting BL Lac objects from imaging observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Direct redshift determination of BL Lac objects is highly challenging as the emission in the optical and near-infrared (NIR) bands is largely dominated by the non-thermal emission from the relativistic jet that points very close to our line of sight. Therefore, their optical spectra often show no emission lines from the host galaxy. In this work, we aim to overcome this difficulty by attempting to detect the host galaxy and derive redshift constraints based on assumptions on the galaxy magnitude ("imaging redshifts"). Imaging redshifts are derived by obtaining deep optical images under good seeing conditions, so that it is possible to detect the host galaxy as weak extension of the point-like source. We then derive the imaging redshift by using the host galaxy as a standard candle using two different methods. We determine imaging redshift for 9 out of 17 blazars that we observed as part of this program. The redshift range of these targets is 0.28-0.60 and the two methods used to derive the redshift give very consistent results within the uncertainties. We also performed a detailed comparison of the imaging redshifts with those obtained by other methods, like direct spectroscopic constraints or looking for groups of galaxies close to the blazar. We show that the constraints from different methods are consistent and that for example in the case of J2156.0+1818, which is the most distant source for which we detect the host galaxy, combining the three constraints narrows down the redshift to $0.63&lt;z&lt;0.71$. This makes the source interesting for future studies of extragalactic background light in the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory era.</description>

      <title>Stellar model tests and age determination for RGB stars from the APO-K2 catalogue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By adopting the recently empirically derived dependence of $\alpha$-elements on $[\alpha/{\rm Fe}]$ instead of the conventionally applied uniform one, we tested the agreement between stellar model predictions and observations for red giant branch (RGB) stars in the APO-K2 catalogue. We particularly focused on the biases in effective temperature scales and on the robustness of age estimations. We computed a grid of stellar models relying on the empirical scaling of $\alpha$-elements, investigating the offset in effective temperature $\Delta T$ between these models and observations, using univariate analyses for both metallicity [Fe/H] and $[\alpha/{\rm Fe}]$. To account for potential confounding factors, we then employed a multivariate generalised additive model to study the dependence of $\Delta T$ on [Fe/H], $[\alpha/{\rm Fe}]$, $\log g$, and stellar mass. The initial analysis revealed a negligible trend of $\Delta T$ with [Fe/H], in contrast with previous works in the literature. A slight $\Delta T$ difference of 25 K was detected between stars with high and low $\alpha$-enhancement. Our multivariate analysis reveals a dependence of $\Delta T$ on both [Fe/H] and $[\alpha/{\rm Fe}]$, and highlights a significant dependence on stellar mass. This suggests a discrepancy in how effective temperature scales with stellar mass in the models compared to observations. Despite differences in assumed chemical composition, our analysis, through a fortunate cancellation effect, yields ages that are largely consistent with recent studies of the same sample. Notably, our analysis identifies a 6% fraction of stars younger than 4 Ga within the high-$\alpha$ population. However, our analysis of the [C/N] ratio supports the possible origin of the these stars as a result of mergers or mass transfer events.</description>

      <title>Systematic search for cool hypervelocity stars in multi-epoch WISE data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sixty years after the discovery of brown dwarfs, the search for these objects continues, particularly in the vicinity of the Sun. Objects near the Sun are characterized by large proper motions, making them seen as fast-moving objects. While the Gaia DR3 catalogue is a comprehensive source of proper motions, it lacks the depth needed for discovering fainter objects. Modern multi-epoch surveys, with their greater depth, offer a new opportunity for systematic search for ultra-cool dwarfs. The study aims to systematically search for high proper motion objects using the newly released catalogue of epochal WISE data in order to identify new brown dwarf candidates in the solar neighborhood, estimate their spectral types, distances and spatial velocities. We used recently released unTimely catalogue of epochal detections in unWISE coadds to search for objects with high proper motions using simple motion detection algorithm. This method was used to identify objects with proper motions exceeding approximately 0.6 arcseconds per year. The identified objects were then cross-referenced with data from other large-scale sky surveys to further analyze their characteristics. The search yielded 3245 moving objects with significant proper motions, 32 of which had not been previously published. Among these, at least 15 were identified as reliable new brown dwarf candidates, with estimated distances closer than 50 parsecs and spectral types later than T0.</description>

      <title>An Eddington Limited Accretion Disk Wind in the narrow line Seyfert 1, PG 1448+273</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: PG 1448+273 is a luminous, nearby ($z=0.0645$), narrow line Seyfert 1 galaxy, which likely accretes close to the Eddington limit. Previous X-ray observations of PG 1448 with XMM-Newton in 2017 and NuSTAR in 2022 revealed the presence of an ultra fast outflow, as seen through its blueshifted iron K absorption profile, where the outflow velocity appeared to vary in the range $0.1-0.3c$. In this work, new X-ray observations of PG 1448 are presented, in the form of four simultaneous XMM-Newton and NuSTAR observations performed in July and August 2023. The X-ray spectra appeared at a similar flux in each observation, making it possible to analyze the mean 2023 X-ray spectrum at high signal to noise. A broad ($\sigma=1$ keV) and highly blue-shifted ($E=9.8\pm0.4$ keV) iron K absorption profile is revealed in the mean spectrum. The profile can be modeled by a fast, geometrically thick accretion disk wind, which reveals a maximum terminal velocity of $v_{\infty}=-0.43\pm0.03c$, one of the fastest known winds in a nearby AGN. As a result, the inferred mass outflow rate of the wind may reach a significant fraction of the Eddington accretion rate.</description>

      <title>On some minimal characteristics in a model of a system of N particles with interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For the well-known model of a system of N particles with interaction (N-body problem), we consider the spatial problem of finding the minimum of the function of the kinetic energy of a system on its phase space under conditions on its size and angular momentum. Based on the solution to this problem, we prove that the minimum possible kinetic energy of a system at the current value of its size can be achieved only on flat trajectories of the system. And under some natural additional conditions these trajectories are flat finite and periodic (elliptical) trajectories generated by flat central configurations. The solution to this problem also provides a simpler solution to a similar optimization dual problem of finding the minimum of the size of a system under conditions on its kinetic energy and angular momentum. This leads to a similar result that the minimum possible size of the system at the current value of its kinetic energy can also be achieved only on flat trajectories. Under some additional conditions these trajectories are also flat periodic elliptical trajectories generated by flat central configurations. Next, we consider the more complex spatial problem of finding local minima of the function of the kinetic energy of a system on its phase space at fixed values of the integrals of motion: angular momentum and total energy of a system. Based on the solution of this problem, we prove further that under some natural additional conditions the local minima of the system kinetic and potential energy functions at fixed values of these integrals of motion can be achieved only on flat periodic elliptical trajectories generated by some flat central configurations. And at the points of these local minima the minimum possible kinetic energy of the system at the current value of its size and the minimum possible size of the system at the current value of its kinetic energy are also achieved.</description>

      <title>Stellar/BH Population in AGN Disks: Direct Binary Formation from Capture Objects in Nuclei Clusters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.09129v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Active Galatic Nuclei(AGN) disk has been proposed as a potential channel for the merger of binary black holes. The population of massive stars and black holes in AGN disks captured from the nuclei cluster plays a crucial role in determining the efficiency of binary formation and final merger rate within the AGN disks. In this paper, we investigate the capture process using analytical and numerical approaches. We discover a new constant integral of motion for one object's capture process. Applying this result to the whole population of the nuclei cluster captured by the AGN disk, we find that the population of captured objects depends on the angular density and eccentricity distribution of the nuclei clusters and is effectively independent of the radial density profile of the nuclei cluster and disk models. An isotropic nuclei cluster with thermal eccentricity distribution predicts a captured profile $d N/d r \propto r^{-1/4}$. The captured objects are found to be dynamically crowded within the disk. Direct binary formation right after the capture would be promising, especially for stars. The conventional migration traps that help pile up single objects in AGN disks for black hole mergers might not be required.</description>

      <title>Deep imaging with Milankovi\'c telescope: Linking merger history to kinematics of elliptical galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05532v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kinematical and morphological features observed in early-type galaxies provide valuable insights into the evolution of their hosts. We studied the origin of prolate rotation (i.e., rotation around the long axis) in Illustris large-scale cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. We found that basically all the simulated massive prolate rotators were created in relatively recent major mergers of galaxies. Such mergers are expected to produce tidal features such as tails, shells, asymmetric stellar halos. We investigated deep optical images of prolate rotators, including newly obtained Milankovi\'c data, revealing signs of galaxy interaction in all of them. This correlation proves to be statistically very significant when compared with a general sample of early-type galaxies from the MATLAS deep imaging survey. In an ongoing project, we use Milankovi\'c to assemble deep images of the complete sample of all known nearby massive prolate rotators. Additionally, we searched these data for asteroids to improve the accuracy of trajectories and even discover one previously unknown main-belt asteroid. The most frequent tidal features among the prolate rotators happen to be shells. We developed methods to calculate the probable time of the merger from optical images. This will allow us to compare the merger history of the sample with predictions from Illustris. Our plan is to expand these methods to even larger samples of shell galaxies supplied by upcoming large surveys like LSST at Rubin Observatory. This will provide an unprecedented amount of statistically significant data on the recent merger history of our Universe and allow extensive investigation of the impact of mergers to a wide range of other astrophysical phenomena.</description>

Abstract: Studying the nature of spiral arms is essential for understanding the formation of the intricate disc structure of the Milky Way. The European Space Agency's Gaia mission has provided revolutionary observational data that have uncovered detailed kinematical features of stars in the Milky Way. However, so far the nature of spiral arms continues to remain a mystery. Here we present that the stellar kinematics traced by the classical Cepheids around the Perseus and Outer spiral arms in the Milky Way shows strikingly different kinematical properties from each other: the radial and azimuthal velocities of Cepheids with respect to the Galactic centre show positive and negative correlations in the Perseus and Outer arms, respectively. We also found that the dynamic spiral arms commonly seen in an N-body/hydrodynamics simulation of a Milky Way-like galaxy can naturally explain the observed kinematic trends. Furthermore, a comparison with such a simulation suggests that the Perseus arm is being disrupted while the Outer arm is growing. Our findings suggest that two neighbouring spiral arms in distinct evolutionary phases - growing and disrupting phases - coexist in the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>Evidence of a Past Merger of the Galactic Center Black Hole</title>

Abstract: The origin of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) residing in the centers of most galaxies remains a mystery. The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) provided direct imaging of the SMBH Sgr A* at the Milky Way's center, indicating it likely spins rapidly with its spin axis significantly misaligned relative to the Galactic plane's angular momentum. Through investigating various SMBH growth models, here we show that the inferred spin properties of Sgr A* provide evidence of a past SMBH merger. Inspired by the merger between the Milky Way and Gaia-Enceladus, which has a 4:1 mass ratio as inferred from Gaia data, we have discovered that a 4:1 major merger of SMBH with a binary angular momentum inclination angle of 145-180 degrees with respect to the line of sight (LOS), can successfully replicate the measured spin properties of Sgr A*. This merger event in our galaxy provides potential observational support for the theory of hierarchical BH mergers in the formation and growth of SMBHs. The inferred merger rate, consistent with theoretical predictions, suggests a promising detection rate of SMBH mergers for space-borne gravitational wave detectors expected to operate in 2030s.</description>

      <title>Angular momentum transfer in cosmological simulations of Milky Way-mass discs</title>

Abstract: Fueling star formation in large, discy galaxies requires a continuous supply of gas accreting into star-forming regions. Previously, we characterized this accretion in 4 Milky Way mass galaxies ($M_{\rm halo}\sim10^{12}M_{\odot}$) in the FIRE-2 cosmological zoom-in simulations. At $z\sim0$, we found that gas within the inner circumgalactic medium (iCGM) approaches the disc with comparable angular momentum (AM) to the disc edge, joining in the outer half of the gaseous disc. Within the disc, gas moves inward at velocities of $\sim$1-5~km~s$^{-1}$ while fully rotationally supported. In this study, we analyze the torques that drive these flows. In all cases studied, we find that the torques in discs enable gas accreted near the disc edge to transport inwards and fuel star formation in the central few kpc. The primary sources of torque come from gravity, hydrodynamical forces, and the sub-grid $P dV$ work done by supernova (SNe) remnants interacting with gas on $\lesssim$10 pc scales. These SNe remnant interactions induce negative torques within the inner disc and positive torques in the outer disc. The gas-gas gravitational, hydro, and "feedback" torques transfer AM outward to where accreting gas joins the disc, playing an important role in driving inflows and regulating disc structure. Gravitational torques from stars and dark matter provide an AM sink within the innermost regions of the disc and iCGM, respectively. Feedback torques are dominant within the disc, while gravitational and hydrodynamical torques have similar significance depending on the system/region. Torques from viscous shearing, magnetic forces, stellar winds, and radiative transfer are less significant.</description>

      <title>Probing populations of dark stellar remnants in the globular clusters 47 Tuc and Terzan 5 using pulsar timing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06274v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new method to combine multimass equilibrium dynamical models and pulsar timing data to constrain the mass distribution and remnant populations of Milky Way globular clusters (GCs). We first apply this method to 47 Tuc, a cluster for which there exists an abundance of stellar kinematic data and which is also host to a large population of millisecond pulsars. We demonstrate that the pulsar timing data allow us to place strong constraints on the overall mass distribution and remnant populations even without fitting on stellar kinematics. Our models favor a small population of stellar-mass BHs in this cluster (with a total mass of $446^{+75}_{-72} \mathrm{M_\odot}$), arguing against the need for a large ($ &gt; 2000 \ \mathrm{M_\odot}$) central intermediate-mass black hole. We then apply the method to Terzan 5, a heavily obscured bulge cluster which hosts the largest population of millisecond pulsars of any Milky Way GC and for which the collection of conventional stellar kinematic data is very limited. We improve existing constraints on the mass distribution and structural parameters of this cluster and place stringent constraints on its black hole content, finding an upper limit on the mass in BHs of $\sim 4000 \ \mathrm{M_\odot}$. This method allows us to probe the central dynamics of GCs even in the absence of stellar kinematic data and can be easily applied to other GCs with pulsar timing data, for which datasets will continue to grow with the next generation of radio telescopes.</description>

      <title>Detection of antifreeze molecule ethylene glycol in the hot molecular core G358.93$-$0.03 MM1</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21572v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The identification of complex prebiotic molecules using millimeter and submillimeter telescopes allows us to understand how the basic building blocks of life are formed in the universe. In the interstellar medium (ISM), ethylene glycol ((CH$_{2}$OH)$_{2}$) is the simplest sugar alcohol molecule, and it is the reduced alcohol of the simplest sugar-like molecule, glycolaldehyde (CH$_{2}$OHCHO). We present the first detection of the rotational emission lines of $aGg^{\prime}$ conformer of ethylene glycol ((CH$_{2}$OH)$_{2}$) towards the hot molecular core G358.93$-$0.03 MM1 using the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA). The estimated column density of $aGg^{\prime}$-(CH$_{2}$OH)$_{2}$ towards the G358.93$-$0.03 MM1 is (4.5$\pm$0.1)$\times$10$^{16}$ cm$^{-2}$ with an excitation temperature of 155$\pm$35 K. The abundance of $aGg^{\prime}$-(CH$_{2}$OH)$_{2}$ with respect to H$_{2}$ is (1.4$\pm$0.5)$\times$10$^{-8}$. Similarly, the abundances of $aGg^{\prime}$-(CH$_{2}$OH)$_{2}$ with respect to CH$_{2}$OHCHO and CH$_{3}$OH are 3.1$\pm$0.5 and (6.1$\pm$0.3)$\times$10$^{-3}$. We compare the estimated abundance of $aGg^{\prime}$-(CH$_{2}$OH)$_{2}$ with the existing three-phase warm-up chemical model abundance of (CH$_{2}$OH)$_{2}$, and we notice the observed abundance and modelled abundance are nearly similar. We discuss the possible formation pathways of $aGg^{\prime}$-(CH$_{2}$OH)$_{2}$ towards the hot molecular cores, and we find that $aGg^{\prime}$-(CH$_{2}$OH)$_{2}$ is probably created via the recombination of two CH$_{2}$OH radicals on the grain surface of G358.93$-$0.03 MM1.</description>

      <title>New constraints on the central mass contents of Omega Centauri from combined stellar kinematics and pulsar timing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00939v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a combined analysis of stellar kinematics and line-of-sight accelerations of millisecond pulsars to investigate the mass contents of Omega Centauri. We consider multiple mass components: the visible photometric distribution, a central cluster of dark remnants, an intermediate-mass black hole, and a distribution of intermediate extension traced by the pulsars. By self-consistently incorporating multiple independent datasets, including the effects of different centers, we obtain significant constraints on these mass distributions. Our results strongly favor an extended central mass of ~ 2 - 3 x 10^5 Msun, emulating a cluster of heavy stellar remnants, over an IMBH, with a 3-sigma upper limit of 6 x 10^3 Msun on its mass. Pulsar timing observations provide significant constraints, favoring a central mass distribution that is ~ 20% more massive and extended. Notably, we observe a clear linear scaling between the pulsar distribution and stellar encounter rates, showing excellent agreement with the expectation from millisecond pulsar formation models and motivating a profile for their distribution, providing the first validation of its kind where positions are linked to their place of formation in globular clusters. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of this novel methodology in exploring the structure of star clusters, setting a promising precedent amid the advent of the rapidly growing number of observations and discoveries currently being experienced in this field.</description>

      <title>Blowing star formation away in AGN Hosts (BAH) -- I. Observation of Warm Molecular Outflows with JWST MIRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06100v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) medium-resolution spectrometer (MRS) observations of the radio loud AGN host UGC 8782 to map the warm molecular and ionized gas kinematics. The data reveal spatially resolved outflows in the inner 2 kpc, seen in low ionization (traced by the [Ar ii] 6.99um emission) and in warm molecular gas (traced by the H2 rotational transitions). We find a maximum mass-outflow rate of 4.90 (2.04) M/yr at ~900 pc from the nucleus for the warm outflow (198 K&lt; T&lt; 1000 K) and estimate and outflow rate of up to 1.22 (0.51) M/yr for the hotter gas phase (T &gt; 1000 K). These outflows can clear the entire nuclear reservoir of warm molecular gas in about 1 Myr. The derived kinetic power of the molecular outflows lead to coupling efficiencies of 2-5 percent of the AGN luminosity, way above the minimum expected to the AGN feedback be effective quenching the star formation.</description>

      <title>Bounding the Cosmological Constant using Galactic Rotation Curves from the SPARC Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16650v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dark energy (and its simplest model, the Cosmological Constant or $\Lambda$) acts as a repulsive force that opposes gravitational attraction. Assuming galaxies maintain a steady state over extended periods, the estimated upper limit on $\Lambda$ studies its pushback to the attractive gravitational force of dark matter. From the SPARC dataset, we select galaxies that are best fitted by the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) and Hernquist density models. Introducing the presence of $\Lambda$ in these galaxies helps to establish the upper limit on its repulsive force. This upper limit on $\Lambda$ is around $\rho_{\left(&lt;\Lambda\right)} \sim 10^{-25}$~kg/m$^3$, only two orders of magnitude higher than the one measured by Planck. {We show that for galaxies with detectable velocities far from the galaxy core, the upper limit on $\Lambda$ is lower. Furthermore, we show that galaxies and other systems follow the same principle: for larger orbital periods the upper limit on $\Lambda$ is lower. Consequently, we address the implications for future measurements on the upper limit and the condition for detecting the impact of $\Lambda$ on galactic scales.</description>

      <title>High-energy neutrinos from the vicinity of the supermassive black hole in NGC 1068</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20146v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive multi-messenger study of NGC 1068, the prototype Seyfert II galaxy recently associated with high-energy IceCube neutrinos. Various aspects of the source, including its nuclear activity, jet, outflow, and starburst region, are analyzed in detail using a multi-wavelength approach and relevant luminosities are derived. We then explore its gamma-ray and neutrino emissions and investigate potential mechanisms underlying these phenomena and their relations with the different astrophysical components to try to understand which one is responsible for the IceCube neutrinos. By first using simple order-of-magnitude arguments and then applying specific theoretical models, we infer that only the region close to the accretion disc around the supermassive black hole has both the right density of X-ray photons needed to provide the targets for protons to sustain neutrino production and of optical/infrared photons required to absorb the associated but unobserved gamma rays. We conclude by highlighting ongoing efforts to constrain a possible broad connection between neutrinos and active galactic nuclei, as well as future synergies between astronomical and neutrino facilities.</description>

      <title>A multi-wavelength study to decipher the 2017 flare of the blazar OJ 287</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11848v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In February 2017, the blazar OJ~287 underwent a period of intense multiwavelength activity. It reached a new historic peak in the soft X-ray (0.3-10 keV) band, as measured by Swift-XRT. This event coincides with a very-high-energy (VHE) $\gamma$-ray outburst that led VERITAS to detect emission above 100 GeV, with a detection significance of $10\sigma$ (from 2016 December 9 to 2017 March 31). The time-averaged VHE $\gamma$-ray spectrum was consistent with a soft power law ($\Gamma = -3.81 \pm 0.26$) and an integral flux corresponding to $\sim2.4\%$ that of the Crab Nebula above the same energy. Contemporaneous data from multiple instruments across the electromagnetic spectrum reveal complex flaring behavior, primarily in the soft X-ray and VHE bands. To investigate the possible origin of such an event, our study focuses on three distinct activity states: before, during, and after the February 2017 peak. The spectral energy distributions during these periods suggest the presence of at least two non-thermal emission zones, with the more compact one responsible for the observed flare. Broadband modeling results and observations of a new radio knot in the jet of OJ~287 in 2017 are consistent with a flare originating from a strong recollimation shock outside the radio core.</description>
