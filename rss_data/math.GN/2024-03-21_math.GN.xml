      <title>Bounding the Interleaving Distance for Mapper Graphs with a Loss Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.15130v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data consisting of a graph with a function mapping into $\R^d$ arise in many data applications, encompassing structures such as Reeb graphs, geometric graphs, and knot embeddings. As such, the ability to compare and cluster such objects is required in a data analysis pipeline, leading to a need for distances between them. In this work, we study the interleaving distance on discretization of these objects, $\R^d$-mapper graphs, where functor representations of the data can be compared by finding pairs of natural transformations between them. However, in many cases, computation of the interleaving distance is NP-hard. For this reason, we take inspiration from recent work by Robinson to find quality measures for families of maps that do not rise to the level of a natural transformation, called assignments. We then endow the functor images with the extra structure of a metric space and define a loss function which measures how far an assignment is from making the required diagrams of an interleaving commute. Finally we show that the computation of the loss function is polynomial with a given assignment. We believe this idea is both powerful and translatable, with the potential to provide approximations and bounds on interleavings in a broad array of contexts.</description>

      <title>The homotopy decomposition of the suspension of a non-simply-connected $5$-manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16642v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we determine the homotopy types of the reduced suspension space of certain connected orientable closed smooth $5$-manifolds. As applications, we compute the reduced $K$-groups of $M$ and show that the suspension map between the third cohomotopy set $\pi^3(M)$ and the fourth cohomotopy set $\pi^4(\Sigma M)$ is a bijection.</description>

      <title>Epic math battle of history: Grothendieck vs Nikodym</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13145v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define a $\sigma$-centered notion of forcing that forces the existence of a Boolean algebra with the Grothendieck property and without the Nikodym property. In particular the existence of such an algebra is consistent with the negation of the continuum hypothesis. The algebra we construct consists of Borel subsets of the Cantor set and has cardinality $\omega_1$. We also show how to apply our method to streamline Talagrand's construction of such an algebra under the continuum hypothesis.</description>
