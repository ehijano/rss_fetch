      <title>Relations, Negations, and Numbers: Looking for Logic in Generative Text-to-Image Models</title>

Abstract: Despite remarkable progress in multi-modal AI research, there is a salient domain in which modern AI continues to lag considerably behind even human children: the reliable deployment of logical operators. Here, we examine three forms of logical operators: relations, negations, and discrete numbers. We asked human respondents (N=178 in total) to evaluate images generated by a state-of-the-art image-generating AI (DALL-E 3) prompted with these `logical probes', and find that none reliably produce human agreement scores greater than 50\%. The negation probes and numbers (beyond 3) fail most frequently. In a 4th experiment, we assess a `grounded diffusion' pipeline that leverages targeted prompt engineering and structured intermediate representations for greater compositional control, but find its performance is judged even worse than that of DALL-E 3 across prompts. To provide further clarity on potential sources of success and failure in these text-to-image systems, we supplement our 4 core experiments with multiple auxiliary analyses and schematic diagrams, directly quantifying, for example, the relationship between the N-gram frequency of relational prompts and the average match to generated images; the success rates for 3 different prompt modification strategies in the rendering of negation prompts; and the scalar variability / ratio dependence (`approximate numeracy') of prompts involving integers. We conclude by discussing the limitations inherent to `grounded' multimodal learning systems whose grounding relies heavily on vector-based semantics (e.g. DALL-E 3), or under-specified syntactical constraints (e.g. `grounded diffusion'), and propose minimal modifications (inspired by development, based in imagery) that could help to bridge the lingering compositional gap between scale and structure.
