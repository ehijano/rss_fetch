      <title>SCExAO/CHARIS Spectroscopic Characterization of Cloudy L/T Transition Companion Brown Dwarf HIP 93398 B</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brown dwarfs with measured dynamical masses and spectra from direct imaging are benchmarks that anchor substellar atmosphere cooling and evolution models. We present Subaru SCExAO/CHARIS infrared spectroscopy of HIP 93398 B, a brown dwarf companion recently discovered by Li et al. 2023 as part of an informed survey using the Hipparcos-Gaia Catalog of Accelerations. This object was previously classified as a T6 dwarf based on its luminosity, with its independently-derived age and dynamical mass in tension with existing models of brown dwarf evolution. Spectral typing via empirical standard spectra, temperatures derived by fitting substellar atmosphere models, and J-H, J-K and H-L' colors all suggest that this object has a substantially higher temperature and luminosity, consistent with classification as a late-L dwarf near the L/T transition (T = 1200$^{+140}_{-119}$ K) with moderate to thick clouds possibly present in its atmosphere. When compared with the latest generation of evolution models that account for clouds with our revised luminosity and temperature for the object, the tension between the model-independent mass/age and model predictions is resolved.</description>

      <title>Magnetic interaction of stellar coronal mass ejections with close-in exoplanets: implication on planetary mass loss and Ly-$\alpha$ transits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) erupting from the host star are expected to have effects on the atmospheric erosion processes of the orbiting planets. For planets with a magnetosphere, the embedded magnetic field in the CMEs is thought to be the most important parameter to affect planetary mass loss. In this work, we investigate the effect of different magnetic field structures of stellar CMEs on the atmosphere of a hot Jupiter with a dipolar magnetosphere. We use a time-dependent 3D radiative magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) atmospheric escape model that self-consistently models the outflow from hot Jupiters magnetosphere and its interaction with stellar CMEs. For our study, we consider three configurations of magnetic field embedded in stellar CMEs -- (a) northward $B_z$ component, (b) southward $B_z$ component, and (c) radial component. {We find that both the CMEs with northward $B_z$ component and southward $B_z$ component increase the planetary mass-loss rate when the CME arrives from the stellar side, with the mass-loss rate remaining higher for the CME with northward $B_z$ component until it arrives at the opposite side.} The largest magnetopause is found for the CME with a southward $B_z$ component when the dipole and the CME magnetic field have the same direction. We also find that during the passage of a CME, the planetary magnetosphere goes through three distinct changes - (1) compressed magnetosphere, (2) enlarged magnetosphere, and (3) relaxed magnetosphere for all three considered CME configurations. We compute synthetic Ly-$\alpha$ transits at different times during the passage of the CMEs. The synthetic Ly-$\alpha$ transit absorption generally increases when the CME is in interaction with the planet for all three magnetic configurations. The maximum Ly-$\alpha$ absorption is found for the radial CME case when the magnetosphere is the most compressed.</description>

      <title>Simulating Solar Neighborhood Brown Dwarfs I: The Luminosity Function Above and Below the Galactic Plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brown dwarfs form the key, yet poorly understood, link between stellar and planetary astrophysics. These objects offer unique tests of Galactic structure, but observational limitations have inhibited the large-scale analysis of these objects to date. Major upcoming sky surveys will reveal unprecedented numbers of brown dwarfs, among even greater numbers of stellar objects, enabling the statistical study of brown dwarfs. To extract the comparatively rare brown dwarfs from these massive datasets, we must understand how they will look in upcoming surveys. In this work, we construct a synthetic population of brown dwarfs in the Solar Neighborhood to explore their evolutionary properties using Gaia-derived star formation histories alongside observational mass, metallicity, and age relationships. We apply the cloudless Sonora Bobcat, hybrid SM08, and gravity-dependent hybrid Sonora Diamondback evolutionary models to the sample. We present the simulated luminosity function and its evolution with distance from the Galactic Plane. Our simulation shows that brown dwarf population statistics are a function of height above/below the Galactic Plane and sample different age distributions. Interpreting the local sample requires combining evolutionary models, the initial mass function, the star formation history, and kinematic heating. Our models are a guide to how well height-dependent samples can test these scenarios. Sub-populations of brown dwarfs farther from the Plane are older and occupy a different region of brown dwarf parameter space than younger sub-populations closer to the Galactic Plane. Therefore, fully exploring population statistics both near and far from the Plane is critical to prepare for upcoming surveys.</description>

      <title>Multiplicity of Galactic Cepheids from long-baseline interferometry V. High-accuracy orbital parallax and mass of SU Cygni</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cepheid masses are particularly necessary to help solving the mass discrepancy, while independent distance determinations provide crucial test of the period-luminosity relation and Gaia parallaxes. We used CHARA/MIRC to measure the astrometric positions of the high-contrast companion orbiting the Cepheid SU Cygni. We also present new radial velocity measurements from the HST. The combination of interferometric astrometry with optical and ultraviolet spectroscopy provides the full orbital elements of the system, in addition to component masses and the distance to the Cepheid system. We measured the mass of the Cepheid, $M_A = 4.859\pm0.058M_\odot$, and its two companions, $M_{Ba} = 3.595 \pm 0.033 M_\odot$ and $M_{Bb} = 1.546 \pm 0.009 M_\odot$. This is the most accurate existing measurement of the mass of a Galactic Cepheid (1.2%). Comparing with stellar evolution models, we show that the mass predicted is higher than the measured mass of the Cepheid, similar to conclusions of our previous work. We also measured the distance to the system to be $926.3 \pm 5.0$pc, i.e. an unprecedented parallax precision of $6\mu$as (0.5%), being the most precise and accurate distance for a Cepheid. Such precision is similar to what is expected by Gaia for the last data release (DR5 in $\sim$ 2030) for single stars fainter than G = 13, but is not guaranteed for stars as bright as SU Cyg. We demonstrated that evolutionary models remain inadequate in accurately reproducing the measured mass, often predicting higher masses for the expected metallicity, even when factors such as rotation or convective core overshooting are taken into account. Our precise distance measurement allowed us to compare prediction period-luminosity relations. We found a disagreement of 0.2-0.5 mag with relations calibrated from photometry, while relations calibrated from direct distance measurement are in better agreement.</description>

      <title>Pulsations in binary stars -- a short review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Asteroseismology has become an indispensable method for measuring stellar ages and radii, while binary systems remain the most prevalent tool for determining stellar masses. The synergy of the two, namely pulsating stars in binary systems, offer even more than the sum of their parts. The sometimes-overwhelming number of pulsation models to be examined for asteroseismic modelling can be tightly constrained when dynamical masses for both components are available. Binaries offer twice the opportunity to measure an asteroseismic age, which is then applicable to both components of a system, often providing ages for stars that are otherwise very difficult to determine. Some stellar physics, such as the strength of internal mixing or of core overshoot, is so difficult to infer that only in binary systems do sufficient constraints exist to advance our asteroseismic models. The pulsations themselves can also be used to infer dynamical masses through pulsation timing, while eclipsing binaries provide opportunities to test asteroseismic scaling relations. In these proceedings of an invited talk I selectively review the synergies afforded by pulsations in binaries, consisting of a variety of main-sequence primary spectral types, to inferences made from the oscillations of red giants, even when their companions are undetectable. I also describe how the field is changing as we become more data rich through each generation of large photometric survey.</description>

      <title>CZ Aqr: an oscillating eclipsing Algol-type system composed of a $\delta$ Sct primary star and a subgiant star in a quadruple system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Eclipsing Algol-type systems containing a $\delta$ Scuti (hereafter $\delta$ Sct) star enable precise determination of physical parameters and the investigation of stellar internal structure and evolution. We present the absolute parameters of CZ Aquarius (hereafter CZ Aqr) based on TESS data. CZ Aqr has an orbital period of 0.86275209 d, a mass ratio of 0.489 (6), and the secondary component nearly fills its Roche lobe. $O-C$ analysis reveals a downward parabolic trend and a cyclical variation with a period of 88.2 yr. The downward parabola suggests a long-term decrease in the orbital period with $\dot{P}$ = -3.09$\times$$10^{-8}$ d $\textrm{yr}^{-1}$. The mass loss rate is estimated to be 4.54$\times$$10^{-9}$ M$_{\odot}$ $\textrm{yr}^{-1}$, which possibly due to magnetic stellar wind or hot spot. The cyclical variation might be caused by the light travel time effect via the presence of a third body with a minimum mass of $M_{3min}$ = 0.312 (21) M$_{\odot}$. Additionally, there are two possible celestial bodies in a 2:7 resonance orbit around CZ Aqr. The asymmetric light curve is explained by adding a hot spot on the surface of the primary star. After removing the binary model, 26 frequencies were extracted from TESS data. Two radial modes were newly identified among three possible independent frequencies. Our results show that the eclipsing Algol-type system is composed of a $\delta$ Sct primary star and a subgiant star in a quadruple system.</description>

      <title>CARMENES input catalogue of M dwarfs VIII. Kinematics in the solar neighbourhood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aims. Our goals are to characterise the kinematic properties and to identify young and old stars among the M dwarfs of the CARMENES input catalogue. Methods. We compiled the spectral types, proper motions, distances, and radial velocities for 2187 M dwarfs. We used the public code SteParKin to derive their galactic space velocities and identify members in the different galactic populations. We also identified candidate members in young stellar kinematic groups, with ages ranging from 1 Ma to 800 Ma with SteParKin, LACEwING, and BANYAN {\Sigma}. We removed known close binaries and perform an analysis of kinematic, rotation, and activity indicators (rotational periods and projected velocities, Halpha, X-rays, and UV emission) for 1546 M dwarfs. We defined five rotation-activity-colour relations satisfied by young ({\tau} &lt;= 800 Ma) stars. Results. We identified 191 young M dwarf candidates (~12%), 113 of which are newly recognised in this work. In this young sample, there are 118 very active stars based on H{\alpha} emission, fast rotation, and X-ray and UV emission excess. Of them, 27 have also strong magnetic fields, 9 of which are likely younger than 50 Ma. Additionally, there are 87 potentially young stars and 99 stars with a dubious youth classification, which may increase the fraction of young stars to an astounding 24%. Only one star out of the 2187 exhibits kinematics typical of the old Galactic halo. Conclusions. A combined analysis of kinematic and rotation-activity properties provides a robust method for identifying young M dwarfs from archival data. However, more observational efforts are needed to ascertain the true nature of numerous young star candidates in the field and, perhaps more importantly, to precisely quantify their age.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Close-binary central stars of planetary nebulae offer a unique tool with which to study the critical and yet poorly understood common-envelope phase of binary stellar evolution. Furthermore, as the nebula itself is thought to comprise the ionised remnant of the ejected common envelope, such planetary nebulae can be used to directly probe the mass, morphology and dynamics of the ejecta. In this review, I summarise our current understanding of the importance of binarity in the formation of planetary nebulae as well as what they may be able to tell us about the common-envelope phase - including the possible relationships with other post-common-envelope phenomena like stellar mergers, novae and type Ia supernovae.</description>

      <title>Classical Be stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical Be stars, the "e" standing for the presence of spectroscopic line emission, are main sequence stars of spectral type B that are able to form a gaseous disk in Keplerian motion from star-ejected matter. The main driver of this capability is the rapid surface rotation, which might be acquired via binary interaction or through internal stellar evolution, but additional mechanisms, such as nonradial pulsation, usually enable a star to become a Be star well below the actual critical rotation threshold. The angular momentum loss through the disk then keeps the star below the critical rotation value for the rest of its main sequence life span. It is one of the oldest standing research fields of astronomy, since the first discovery of a Be star in 1866. The article, therefore, not only presents the properties of Be stars, but as well the history of the field. The current main research topics, discussed in greater detail, are: 1) the variability of the central object and the nature of Be stars as nonradially pulsating stars, 2) the physics of the viscosity governed circumstellar disk and its variability, which can serve as proxy for the more common, but typically harder to observe viscuous accretion disks, and 3) the role of binarity both in the formation of Be stars as rapid rotators, and as well their impact on the observed properties of these stars.</description>

      <title>X-Shooting ULLYSES: Massive stars at low metallicity VI. Atmosphere and mass-loss properties of O-type giants in the Small Magellanic Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mass loss through a stellar wind is an important physical process that steers the evolution of massive stars and controls the properties of their end-of-life products, such as the supernova type and the mass of compact remnants. For an accurate mass loss determination, the inhomogeneities in the wind, known as clumping, needs to be taking into account. We aim to improve empirical estimates of mass loss and wind clumping for hot main-sequence massive stars, study the dependence of both properties on the metallicity, and compare the theoretical predictions to our findings. We analyzed the optical and UV spectra of 13 O-type stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud galaxy, which has a metallicity of $\sim 0.2\,Z_\odot$. We quantified the stellar atmosphere, outflow, and wind-clumping properties. To probe the role of metallicity, we compared our findings to studies of Galactic and Large Magellanic Cloud samples that were analyzed with similar methods. We find significant variations in the wind-clumping properties of the target stars, with clumping starting at flow velocities $0.01 - 0.23$ of the terminal wind velocity and reaching clumping factors $f_{\rm cl} = 2 - 30$. In the luminosity ($\log L / L_{\odot} = 5.0 - 6.0$) and metallicity ($Z/Z_{\odot} = 0.2 - 1$) range we considered, we find that the scaling of the mass loss $\dot{M}$ with metallicity $Z$ varies with luminosity. At $\log L/L_{\odot} = 5.75$, we find $\dot{M} \propto Z^m$ with $m = 1.02 \pm 0.30$, in agreement with pioneering work in the field. For lower luminosities, however, we obtain a significantly steeper scaling of $m &gt; 2$. The monotonically decreasing $m(L)$ behavior adds a complexity to the functional description of the mass-loss rate of hot massive stars. Although the trend is present in the predictions, it is much weaker than we found here.</description>

      <title>The Role of Thermal Instability in Accretion Outbursts in High-Mass Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-mass young stellar objects (HMYSOs) can exhibit episodic bursts of accretion, accompanied by intense outflows and luminosity variations.
  Thermal Instability (TI) due to Hydrogen ionisation is among the most promising mechanisms of episodic accretion in low mass ($M_*\lesssim 1M_{\odot}$) protostars. Its role in HMYSOs has not yet been elucidated. Here, we investigate the properties of TI outbursts in young, massive ($M_*\gtrsim 5M_{\odot}$) stars, and compare them to those observed so far.
  Our simulations show that modelled TI bursts can replicate the durations and peak accretion rates of long (a few years to decades) outbursts observed in HMYSOs with similar mass characteristics. However, they struggle with short-duration (less than a year) bursts with short (a few weeks or months) rise times, suggesting the need for alternative mechanisms. Moreover, while our models match the durations of longer bursts, they fail to reproduce the multiple outbursts seen in some HMYSOs, regardless of model parameters. We also emphasise the significance of not just evaluating model accretion rates and durations, but also performing photometric analysis to thoroughly evaluate the consistency between model predictions and observational data.
  Our findings suggest that some other plausible mechanisms, such as gravitational instabilities and disc fragmentation can be responsible for generating the observed outburst phenomena in HMYSOs and underscore the need for further investigation into alternative mechanisms driving short outbursts.
  However, the physics of TI is crucial in sculpting the inner disc physics in the early bright epoch of massive star formation, and comprehensive parameter space exploration and the use of 2D modeling are essential for obtaining a more detailed understanding of the underlying physical processes.</description>

Abstract: The analysis of the rotation rate of individual sunspots and pores was performed according to the data of the processing of observations by the \textit{Solar Dynamics Observatory/Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager} (SDO/HMI) in the period 2010\,--\,2024. Sunspots stood out in the images in the continuum. To accurately track the spots, we processed 5 images for each day. To determine the polarity of the magnetic field, we superimposed the contours of sunspots on observations of magnetic fields at the same time. This made it possible to track the movement of more than 210 thousand individual sunspots and pores. It is found that the rotation rate is influenced by the rotation rate of the solar atmosphere and the systematic proper motions of the spots. Sunspots and pores of the leading polarity have a rate of meridional movement $\approx 2.4\%$ faster than spots of the trailing polarity. We also found that regular sunspots, which have umbra and penumbra, rotate $\approx 1.5\%$ faster than solar pores, in which penumbra is absent. The dependence of the rotation rate on these area is found. For sunspots with an area of $S&gt; 10$ $\mu$hm, the rotation rate is practically independent of these area. Small sunspots, with an area of lower than $S&lt; 10$ $\mu$hm, rotate $\approx 1.7\%$ slower.</description>

      <title>The impact of disk-locking on convective turnover times of low-mass pre-main sequence and main sequence stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The impact of disk-locking on the stellar properties related to magnetic activity from the theoretical point of view is investigated. We use the ATON stellar evolution code to calculate theoretical values of convective turnover times ($\tau_{\rm c}$) and Rossby numbers ($Ro$, the ratio between rotation periods and $\tau_{\rm c}$) for pre-main sequence (pre-MS) and main sequence (MS) stars. We investigate how $\tau_{\rm c}$ varies with the initial rotation period and with the disk lifetime, using angular momentum conserving models and models simulating the disk-locking mechanism. In the latter case, the angular velocity is kept constant, during a given locking time, to mimic the magnetic locking effects of a circumstellar disk. The local convective turnover times generated with disk-locking models are shorter than those obtained with angular momentum conserving models. The differences are smaller in the early pre-MS, increase with stellar age and become more accentuated for stars with $M$$\geq$$1 {\rm M}_{\odot}$ and ages greater than 100 Myr. Our new values of $\tau_{\rm c}$ were used to estimate $Ro$ for a sample of stars selected from the literature in order to investigate the rotation-activity relationship. We fit the data with a two-part power-law function and find the best fitting parameters of this relation. The differences we found between both sets of models suggest that the star's disk-locking phase properties affect its Rossby number and its position in the rotation-activity diagram. Our results indicate that the dynamo efficiency is lower for stars that had undergone longer disk-locking phases.</description>

      <title>Transient Upstream Mesoscale Structures: Drivers of Solar-Quiet Space Weather</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, it has become increasingly clear that space weather disturbances can be triggered by transient upstream mesoscale structures (TUMS), independently of the occurrence of large-scale solar wind (SW) structures, such as interplanetary coronal mass ejections and stream interaction regions. Different types of magnetospheric pulsations, transient perturbations of the geomagnetic field and auroral structures are often observed during times when SW monitors indicate quiet conditions, and have been found to be associated to TUMS. In this mini-review we describe the space weather phenomena that have been associated with four of the largest-scale and the most energetic TUMS, namely hot flow anomalies, foreshock bubbles, travelling foreshocks and foreshock compressional boundaries. The space weather phenomena associated with TUMS tend to be more localized and less intense compared to geomagnetic storms. However, the quiet time space weather may occur more often since, especially during solar minima, quiet SW periods prevail over the perturbed times.</description>

      <title>VLTI/GRAVITY Observations of AF Lep b: Preference for Circular Orbits, Cloudy Atmospheres, and a Moderately Enhanced Metallicity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Direct imaging observations are biased towards wide-separation, massive companions that have degenerate formation histories. Although the majority of exoplanets are expected to form via core accretion, most directly imaged exoplanets have not been convincingly demonstrated to follow this formation pathway. We obtained new interferometric observations of the directly imaged giant planet AF Lep b with the VLTI/GRAVITY instrument. We present three epochs of 50$\mu$as relative astrometry and the K-band spectrum of the planet for the first time at a resolution of R=500. Using only these measurements, spanning less than two months, and the Hipparcos-Gaia Catalogue of Accelerations, we are able to significantly constrain the planet's orbit; this bodes well for interferometric observations of planets discovered by Gaia DR4. Including all available measurements of the planet, we infer an effectively circular orbit ($e&lt;0.02, 0.07, 0.13$ at $1, 2, 3 \sigma$) in spin-orbit alignment with the host, and a measure a dynamical mass of $M_\mathrm{p}=3.75\pm0.5\,M_\mathrm{Jup}$. Models of the spectrum of the planet show that it is metal rich ([M/H]$=0.75\pm0.25$), with a C/O ratio encompassing the solar value. This ensemble of results show that the planet is consistent with core accretion formation.</description>

      <title>A method based on Generative Adversarial Networks for disentangling physical and chemical properties of stars in astronomical spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data compression techniques focused on information preservation have become essential in the modern era of big data. In this work, an encoder-decoder architecture has been designed, where adversarial training, a modification of the traditional autoencoder, is used in the context of astrophysical spectral analysis. The goal of this proposal is to obtain an intermediate representation of the astronomical stellar spectra, in which the contribution to the flux of a star due to the most influential physical properties (its surface temperature and gravity) disappears and the variance reflects only the effect of the chemical composition over the spectrum. A scheme of deep learning is used with the aim of unraveling in the latent space the desired parameters of the rest of the information contained in the data. This work proposes a version of adversarial training that makes use of a discriminator per parameter to be disentangled, thus avoiding the exponential combination that occurs in the use of a single discriminator, as a result of the discretization of the values to be untangled. To test the effectiveness of the method, synthetic astronomical data are used from the APOGEE and Gaia surveys. In conjunction with the work presented, we also provide a disentangling framework (GANDALF) available to the community, which allows the replication, visualization, and extension of the method to domains of any nature.</description>

      <title>The COBREX archival survey: improved constraints on the occurrence rate of wide-orbit substellar companions. I. A uniform re-analysis of 400 stars from the GPIES survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Direct imaging (DI) campaigns are uniquely suited to probing the outer regions around young stars and looking for giant exoplanet and brown dwarf companions, hence providing key complementary information to radial velocity (RV) and transit searches for the purpose of demographic studies. However, the critical 5-20 au region, where most giant planets are thought to form, remains poorly explored, lying in-between RV and DI capabilities. Significant gains in detection performances can be attained at no instrumental cost by means of advanced post-processing techniques. In the context of the COBREX project, we have assembled the largest collection of archival DI observations to date in order to undertake a large and uniform re-analysis. In particular, this paper details the re-analysis of 400 stars from the GPIES survey operated at GPI@Gemini South. Following the pre-reduction of raw frames, GPI data cubes were processed by means of the PACO algorithm. Candidates were identified and vetted based on multi-epoch proper motion analysis -- whenever possible -- and by means of a suitable color-magnitude diagram. The conversion of detection limits into detectability maps allowed for an estimate of unbiased occurrence frequencies of giant planets and brown dwarfs. Deeper detection limits were derived compared to the literature, with up to a twofold gain in minimum detectable mass compared to previous GPI-based publications. Although no new substellar companion was confirmed, we identified two interesting planet candidates awaiting follow-up observations. We derive an occurrence rate of $1.7_{-0.7}^{+0.9}\%$ for $5$~\mjup$ &lt; m &lt; 13$~\mjup planets in $10~\text{au}&lt; a &lt; 100~\text{au}$, that raises to $2.2_{-0.8}^{+1.0}\%$ when including substellar objects up to 80 \mjup.(abridged)</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic 3D Simulation of Roche Lobe Overflow in High-mass X-Ray Binaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While binary merger events have been an active area of study in both simulations and observational work, the formation channels by which a high-mass star extends from Roche lobe overflow (RLO) in a decaying orbit of a black-hole (BH) companion to a binary black-hole (BBH) system merits further investigation. Variable length-scales must be employed to accurately represent the dynamical fluid transfer and morphological development of the primary star as it conforms to a diminishing Roche lobe under the runaway influence of the proximal BH. We have simulated and evolved binary mass flow under these conditions to better identify the key transitional processes from RLO to BBHs. We demonstrate a new methodology to model RLO systems to unprecedented resolution simultaneously across the envelope, donor wind, tidal stream, and accretion disk regimes without reliance upon previously universal symmetry, mass flux, and angular momentum flux assumptions. We have applied this method to the semidetached high-mass X-ray binary M33 X-7 in order to provide a direct comparison to recent observations of an RLO candidate system at two overflow states of overfilling factors f = 1.01 and f = 1.1. We found extreme overflow (f = 1.1) to be entirely conservative in both mass and angular momentum transport, forming a conical L1 tidal stream of density and deflected angle comparable to existing predictions. This case lies within the unstable mass transfer (MT) regime as recently proposed of M33 X-7. The f = 1.01 case differed in stream geometry, accretion disk size, and efficiency, demonstrating nonconservative stable MT through a ballistic uniform-width stream. The nonconservative and stable nature of the f = 1.01 case MT also suggests that existing assumptions of semidetached binaries undergoing RLO may mischaracterize their role and distribution as progenitors of BBHs and common envelopes.</description>

      <title>A shock crashing into confined dense circumstellar matter brightens the nascent SN 2023ixf</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Red supergiants may experience a short-lived period of episodic mass loss rather than steady winds before their core collapses, leading to dense circumstellar matter (CSM) close to core-collapse supernovae (SNe). Interaction of SN ejecta with such nearby CSM can generate additional radiation, appending to the cooling radiation from the shock breakout of the progenitor envelope, to brighten the nascent SN explosion. This phenomenon is conspicuous for SN 2023ixf as its V-band brightness showed a rapid increase of about three magnitudes from the first to the third day after the explosion, which is distinctive among type II SNe with flash ionized signatures. In this paper, we employ a Monte Carlo method to simulate the radiative diffusion process in the unshocked CSM. Considering a wide range of mass-loss rates from 10^-5 to 10^-2 Msun/yr, we found that the fast-rising light curve of SN 2023ixf can be fitted by the interaction of the SN ejecta with a CSM having a mass-loss rate of about 10^-2 Msun/yr located within 10^15 cm to the progenitor.</description>

      <title>Detection and Characterisation of Giant Planets with Gaia Astrometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Astrometric observations with Gaia are expected to play a valuable role in future exoplanet surveys. With current data from Gaia's third data release (DR3), we are sensitive to periods from less than 1 year to more than 4 years but, unlike radial velocity are not as restricted by the orbital inclination of a potential planet. The presence and potential properties of a companion affect the primary's renormalised unit weight error (RUWE) making this a valuable quantity in the search for exoplanets. Using this value and the fitted astrometric tracks from Gaia, we use Bayesian inference to constrain the mass and orbital parameters of companions in known systems. Combining this with radial velocity measurements, we show it is possible to independently measure mass and inclination and suggest HD 66141 b is a possible brown dwarf with maximum mass 23.9$^{+7.2}_{-6.4}$ M$_{\mathrm{J}}$. We show how this method may be applied to directly imaged planets in the future, using $\beta$-Pictoris c as an example but note that the host star is bright and active, making it difficult to draw clear conclusions. We show how the next Gaia data release, which will include epoch astrometry, will allow us to accurately constrain orbital parameters from astrometric data alone, revolutionising future searches for exoplanets. Combining predicted observational limits on planet mass with theoretical distributions, we estimate the probability that a star with a given RUWE will host a detectable planet, which will be highly valuable in planning future surveys.</description>

Abstract: Herbig Ae/Be stars are young contracting stars on the radiative track in the HR diagram on their way to the main sequence. These stars provide a valuable link between high and low mass stars. Here we review the progress that has been made in our understanding of these fascinating objects and their disks since the last major review on this topic published in 1998. We begin with a general overview of these stars and their properties. We then discuss the accretion of circumstellar material onto these stars. Next we discuss the dust and gas properties of the circumstellar disk before exploring the evidence for planet formation in these disks. We conclude with a brief discussion of future prospects for deepening our understanding of these sources and propose a new working definition of Herbig Ae/Be stars.</description>

      <title>Clues in Bailey Diagrams Indicate that the Horizontal Branch Evolutionary Effect Is the Direct Reason for Oosterhoff Phenomenon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00911v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Noticing the potential relationship between the pulsation amplitude of fundamental mode RR Lyrae stars and their average effective temperatures, we derived the relation between them from observational data. Using these relationships, we present the zero-age horizontal branch lines and corresponding evolutionary tracks in the Bailey diagrams. We first find that the trends of zero-age horizontal branch lines are consistent with the distributions of Oosterhoff I RR Lyrae stars, and there is a period shift effect in relatively metal-rich samples ([Fe/H] &gt; -1). Main results show that evolutionary effects are the direct cause of the Oosterhoff dichotomy. The vast majority of Oosterhoff I RR Lyrae stars are in the early stage of horizontal branch evolution, while most of the Oosterhoff II stars are near the end of the horizontal branch phase. Our Bailey diagrams can intuitively explain some Oosterhoff phenomena (e.g., long-period RR Lyrae stars in the metal-rich globular clusters NGC 6388 and NGC 6441), and also have the potential to become an important tool for in-depth study of RR Lyrae stars. Further research is needed on the Oosterhoff dichotomy to explore the formations and evolutionary processes of the Milky Way and its substructures.</description>

      <title>Spectro-Photometry and Radial Distribution of Multiple Stellar Populations in Globular Clusters from Gaia XP Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02755v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the formation of multiple populations in globular clusters (GCs) represents a challenge for stellar population studies. Nevertheless, the outermost cluster regions, likely to hold clues about the initial configuration of GC stars, remain underexplored. We use synthetic spectra reflecting the chemical compositions of first- and second-population (1P, 2P) stars in 47Tucanae to identify spectral regions sensitive to these populations. This led us to define new photometric bands that effectively distinguish 1P and 2P giant stars using Gaia XP spectra. Testing these filters, we constructed the pseudo two-color diagrams dubbed chromosome maps (ChMs) and, for the first time, identified 1P and 2P stars in the cluster's outermost regions and beyond its tidal radius. We constructed similar diagrams for NGC3201, NGC6121, NGC6752, and NGC6397, thus exploring GCs with different metallicities. The ChMs effectively distinguished multiple populations in the outer regions of all clusters, except for the metal-poor NGC6397. Our findings, together with literature results from more-internal regions, show that the 2P stars of 47Tucanae are more-centrally concentrated than the 1P. A similar pattern is seen for 2P stars with extreme chemical composition of NGC3201. The multiple populations of NGC6121, and NGC6752 share the same radial distributions. These radial behaviors are consistent with the GC formation scenarios where 2P stars originate in the central regions. Noticeably, results on NGC3201 are in tension with the conclusion from recent work that its 1P is more centrally concentrated than the 2P and might form with more central concentration.</description>

Using photometric data from the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae, the Zwicky Transient Facility, and the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, we identify Karachurin 12 as a new non-eclipsing IW And-type object with a cycle period of 35.69(3) days. We also report for the first time that Karachurin 12 is a negative superhump (NSH) system featuring a precessing tilted disks, with precession, orbital, and NSH periods of 4.9588(2) days, 0.3168895(13) days, and 0.2979861(8) days, respectively. Our analysis, using dips as index and NSHs as probe, reveals diverse cycle patterns in Karachurin 12, with NSH amplitude varying throughout the cycle. These findings offer new insights for studying tilted disks and the IW And-type phenomenon. The mass-transfer burst model has difficulty explaining the observed variations in NSH amplitude, especially given the uncertainty surrounding the origin of the mass transfer burst. Meanwhile, the tilted thermally unstable disk model indicates a possible connection to the IW And-type phenomenon, but it also struggles to account for the detailed variations in Karachurin 12. Therefore, a wider range of factors must be considered to fully understand the complex changes in Karachurin 12.</description>

      <title>JWST/MIRI detection of [Ne V], [Ne VI], and [O IV] wind emission in the O9V star 10 Lacertae</title>

Abstract: We report the detection of broad, flat-topped emission in the fine-structure lines of [Ne V], [Ne VI], and [O IV] in mid-infrared spectra of the O9 V star 10 Lacertae obtained with JWST/MIRI. Optically thin emission in these high ions traces a hot, low-density component of the wind. The observed line fluxes imply a mass-loss rate of &gt; 3 x 10^8 Msun/yr, which is an order of magnitude larger than previous estimates based on UV and optical diagnostics. The presence of this hot component reconciles measured values of the mass-loss rate with theoretical predictions, and appears to solve the "weak wind" problem for the particular case of 10 Lac.</description>

      <title>A tell-tale tracer for externally irradiated protoplanetary disks: comparing the [CI] 8727 A line and ALMA observations in proplyds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21018</link>

Abstract: The evolution of protoplanetary disks in regions with massive OB stars is influenced by externally driven winds that deplete the outer parts of disks. These winds have previously been studied via forbidden oxygen emission lines, which also arise in isolated disks in low-mass star forming-regions (SFRs) with weak external UV fields in photoevaporative or magnetic (internal) disk winds. It is crucial to determine how to disentangle external winds from internal ones. Here, we report a proxy for unambiguously identifying externally driven winds with a forbidden line of neutral atomic carbon, [C i] 8727 A. We compare for the first time the spatial location of the emission in the [O i] 5577 A, [O i] 6300 A, and [C i] 8727 A lines traced by VLT/MUSE-NFM, with the ALMA Band 7 continuum disk emission in a sample of 12 proplyds in the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC). We confirm that the [O i] 5577 A emission is co-spatial with the disk emission, whereas the [O i] 6300 A is emitted both on the disk surface and on the ionization front of the proplyds. We show for the first time that the [C i] 8727 A line is also co-spatial with the disk surface in proplyds, as seen in the MUSE and ALMA data comparison. To verify whether the [C i] 8727 A line is detected in regions where external photoevaporation is not expected, we examine VLT/X-Shooter spectra for young stars in low-mass SFRs. Although the [O i] lines are well detected in all these targets, there is &lt;&lt;10% detection rate in the case of the [C i] 8727 A line. This number increases substantially to a ~40% detection rate in sigma-Orionis, a region with intermediate UV radiation. The spatial location of the [C i] 8727 A line emission and the lack of its detection in isolated disks in low-mass SFRs strongly suggest that this line is a tell-tale tracer of externally driven photoevaporative winds, which agrees with recent excitation models.</description>

      <title>Merger Precursor: Year-long Transients Preceding Mergers of Low-mass Stripped Stars with Compact Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12472v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Binary mass transfer can occur at high rates due to rapid expansion of the donor's envelope. In the case where mass transfer is unstable, the binary can rapidly shrink its orbit and lead to a merger. In this work we consider the appearance of the system preceding merger, specifically for the case of a low-mass ($\approx 2.5$-$3~M_\odot$) helium star with a neutron star (NS) companion. Modeling the mass transfer history as well as the wind launched by super-Eddington accretion onto the NS, we find that such systems can power slowly rising transients with timescales as long as years, and luminosities of $\sim 10^{40}$-$10^{41}$ erg s$^{-1}$ from optical to UV. The final explosion following the merger (or core-collapse of the helium star in some cases) leads to an interaction-powered transient with properties resembling Type Ibn supernovae (SNe), possibly with a bright early peak powered by shock cooling emission for merger-powered explosions. We apply our model to the Type Ibn SN 2023fyq, that displayed a long-term precursor activity from years before the terminal explosion.</description>

      <title>AstroMLab 1: Who Wins Astronomy Jeopardy!?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11194v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive evaluation of proprietary and open-weights large language models using the first astronomy-specific benchmarking dataset. This dataset comprises 4,425 multiple-choice questions curated from the Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics, covering a broad range of astrophysical topics. Our analysis examines model performance across various astronomical subfields and assesses response calibration, crucial for potential deployment in research environments. Claude-3.5-Sonnet outperforms competitors by up to 4.6 percentage points, achieving 85.0% accuracy. For proprietary models, we observed a universal reduction in cost every 3-to-12 months to achieve similar score in this particular astronomy benchmark. open-weights models have rapidly improved, with LLaMA-3-70b (80.6%) and Qwen-2-72b (77.7%) now competing with some of the best proprietary models. We identify performance variations across topics, with non-English-focused models generally struggling more in exoplanet-related fields, stellar astrophysics, and instrumentation related questions. These challenges likely stem from less abundant training data, limited historical context, and rapid recent developments in these areas. This pattern is observed across both open-weights and proprietary models, with regional dependencies evident, highlighting the impact of training data diversity on model performance in specialized scientific domains. Top-performing models demonstrate well-calibrated confidence, with correlations above 0.9 between confidence and correctness, though they tend to be slightly underconfident. The development for fast, low-cost inference of open-weights models presents new opportunities for affordable deployment in astronomy. The rapid progress observed suggests that LLM-driven research in astronomy may become feasible in the near future.</description>

      <title>Massive Star Cluster Formation with Binaries. I. Evolution of Binary Populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07433v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the evolution of populations of binary stars within massive cluster-forming regions. We simulate the formation of young massive star clusters within giant molecular clouds with masses ranging from 2 x 10$^{4}$ to 3.2 x 10$^{5}$ M$_{\odot}$. We use Torch, which couples stellar dynamics, magnetohydrodynamics, star and binary formation, stellar evolution, and stellar feedback through the AMUSE framework. We find that the binary fraction decreases during cluster formation at all molecular cloud masses. The binaries' orbital properties also change, with stronger and quicker changes in denser, more massive clouds. Most of the changes we see can be attributed to the disruption of binaries wider than 100 au, although the close binary fraction also decreases in the densest cluster-forming region. The binary fraction for O stars remains above 90%, but exchanges and dynamical hardening are ubiquitous, indicating that O stars undergo frequent few-body interactions early during the cluster formation process. Changes to the populations of binaries are a by-product of hierarchical cluster assembly: most changes to the binary population take place when the star formation rate is high and there are frequent mergers between sub-clusters in the cluster-forming region. A universal primordial binary distribution based on observed inner companions in the Galactic field is consistent with the binary populations of young clusters with resolved stellar populations, and the scatter between clusters of similar masses could be explained by differences in their formation history.</description>
