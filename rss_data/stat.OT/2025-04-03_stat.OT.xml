Abstract: In this work, we study an integrated fault detection and classification framework called FARM for fast, accurate, and robust online chemical process monitoring. The FARM framework integrates the latest advancements in statistical process control (SPC) for monitoring nonparametric and heterogeneous data streams with novel data analysis approaches based on Riemannian geometry together in a hierarchical framework for online process monitoring. We conduct a systematic evaluation of the FARM monitoring framework using the Tennessee Eastman Process (TEP) dataset. Results show that FARM performs competitively against state-of-the-art process monitoring algorithms by achieving a good balance among fault detection rate (FDR), fault detection speed (FDS), and false alarm rate (FAR). Specifically, FARM achieved an average FDR of 96.97% while also outperforming benchmark methods in successfully detecting hard-to-detect faults that are previously known, including Faults 3, 9 and 15, with FDRs being 97.08%, 96.30% and 95.99%, respectively. In terms of FAR, our FARM framework allows practitioners to customize their choice of FAR, thereby offering great flexibility. Moreover, we report a significant improvement in average fault classification accuracy during online monitoring from 61% to 82% when leveraging Riemannian geometric analysis, and further to 84.5% when incorporating additional features from SPC. This illustrates the synergistic effect of integrating fault detection and classification in a holistic, hierarchical monitoring framework.</description>
