      <title>An Improved Height Difference Based Model of Height Profile for Drop-on-Demand 3D Printing With UV Curable Ink</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes an improved height profile model for drop-on-demand 3D printing with UV curable ink. It is extended from a previously validated model and computes height profile indirectly from volume and area propagation to ensure volume conservation. To accommodate 2D patterns using multiple passes, volume change and area change within region of interest are modeled as a piecewise function of height difference before drop deposition. Model coefficients are experimentally obtained and validated with bootstrapping of experimental samples. Six different drop patterns are experimentally validated. The RMS height profile errors for 2D patterns from the proposed model are consistently smaller than existing models from literature and are on the same level as 1D patterns reported in our previous publication.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of jet breakup and the resultant drop size distribution: effect of nozzle size and impingement velocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conduct systematic experiments to investigate the dynamics of liquid jet breakup and the resulting droplet size distribution, emphasizing the influence of liquid jet velocity and needle exit diameter. We precisely control jet formation using a pressurized water tank equipped with needles of different sizes. Our study quantifies breakup dynamics through dimensionless parameters such as the liquid Weber number and the needle exit area ratio. Our key findings identify three distinct breakup regimes, such as dripping, Rayleigh, and wind-induced, each dictated by the interplay of surface tension and aerodynamic forces for various combinations of liquid jet velocity and needle exit diameter. We construct a regime map to delineate different breakup behaviours in the We - Ar space. It is observed that lower jet velocities produce narrow probability density functions for jet breakup length due to stable jets, whereas higher velocities result in broader distributions. Increasing jet velocity extends breakup lengths for moderate flow rates due to enhanced stability in the Rayleigh regime, but higher velocities induce instability, leading to shorter breakup lengths. Additionally, we analyze the effects of the needle exit area ratio and liquid Weber number on droplet size distribution, highlighting the transition from mono-modal to bi-modal distribution under varying conditions.</description>

      <title>Coupling Machine Learning Local Predictions with a Computational Fluid Dynamics Solver to Accelerate Transient Buoyant Plume Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data-driven methods demonstrate considerable potential for accelerating the inherently expensive computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solvers. Nevertheless, pure machine-learning surrogate models face challenges in ensuring physical consistency and scaling up to address real-world problems. This study presents a versatile and scalable hybrid methodology, combining CFD and machine learning, to accelerate long-term incompressible fluid flow simulations without compromising accuracy. A neural network was trained offline using simulated data of various two-dimensional transient buoyant plume flows. The objective was to leverage local features to predict the temporal changes in the pressure field in comparable scenarios. Due to cell-level predictions, the methodology was successfully applied to diverse geometries without additional training. Pressure estimates were employed as initial values to accelerate the pressure-velocity coupling procedure. The results demonstrated an average improvement of 94% in the initial guess for solving the Poisson equation. The first pressure corrector acceleration reached a mean factor of 3, depending on the iterative solver employed. Our work reveals that machine learning estimates at the cell level can enhance the efficiency of CFD iterative linear solvers while maintaining accuracy. Although the scalability of the methodology to more complex cases has yet to be demonstrated, this study underscores the prospective value of domain-specific hybrid solvers for CFD.</description>

      <title>Inertial forces and elastohydrodynamic interaction of spherical particles in wall-bounded sedimentation experiments at low particle Reynolds number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wall-bounded sedimentation of spherical particles at low particle Reynolds numbers $Re_\text{P}\lessapprox 0.1$ under the influence of elastic deformation was investigated experimentally. The complete kinematics of both elastic and rigid spheres sedimenting from rest near a rigid or an elastic plane wall in a rectangular duct were recorded. Several specific phenomena related to both inertial and elastohydrodynamic effects were identified and discussed. Among these phenomena is an inertial wall attraction, i.e., particles approach the wall while being accelerated from rest. It was found, that this initial attraction was a universal, purely hydrodynamic phenomenon which occurred in all experiments at $Re_\text{P}\lessapprox 0.1$. After the initial stage, rigid spheres sedimenting at $Re_\text{P}\approx O(10^{-1}$) near the wall behaved in the classical way, showing linear migration due to hydrodynamic lift forces. Non-classic evolution of the particle velocity with respect to the wall distance was observed for both rigid and elastic spheres sedimenting at $Re_\text{P}\approx O(10^{-2}$). Sedimentation was persistently unsteady and the spheres decelerated although the wall distance was increased. Another phenomenon is that very soft spheres showed instationarities superimposed by nonlinearities. These peculiarities in the kinematics are attributed to the non-trivial coupling between particle-fluid inertial forces and elastic effects, i.e., to the existence of elastohydrodynamic memory. Instationarities were also observed during the sedimentation of rigid spheres along an elastic wall. For example, in the near-wall region, elastohydrodynamic interactions damped the dynamics during mass acceleration. Meanwhile, persistent undulating motion towards the wall was observed, i.e., elastohydrodynamic particle trapping instead of hydrodynamic lift was observed.</description>

      <title>Turbulent skin-friction drag reduction via spanwise forcing at high Reynolds number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the Reynolds-number dependence of the turbulent skin-friction drag reduction induced by streamwise-travelling waves of spanwise wall oscillations. The study relies on direct numerical simulations of drag-reduced flows in a plane open channel at friction Reynolds numbers in the range $1000 \le Re_\tau \le 6000$, which is the widest range considered so far in simulations with spanwise forcing. Our results corroborate the validity of the predictive model proposed by Gatti &amp; Quadrio, J. Fluid Mech. (2016): regardless of the control parameters, the drag reduction decreases monotonically with $Re$, at a rate that depends on the drag reduction itself and on the skin-friction of the uncontrolled flow. We do not find evidence in support of the results of Marusic et al., Nat. Comm. (2021), which instead report by experiments an increase of the drag reduction with $Re$ in turbulent boundary layers, for control parameters that target low-frequency, outer-scaled motions. Possible explanations for this discrepancy are provided, including obvious differences between open channel flows and boundary layers, and possible limitations of laboratory experiments.</description>

      <title>Surface roughness effects in a transonic axial flow compressor operating at near-stall conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface roughness is a major contributor to performance degradation in gas turbine engines. The fan and the compressor, as the first components in the engine's air path, are especially vulnerable to the effects of surface roughness. Debris ingestion, accumulation of grime, dust, or insect remnants, typically at low atmospheric conditions, over several cycles of operation are some major causes of surface roughness over the blade surfaces. The flow in compressor rotors is inherently highly complex. From the perspective of the component designers, it is thus important to study the effect of surface roughness on the performance and flow physics, especially at near-stall conditions. In this study, we examine the effect of surface roughness on flow physics such as shock-boundary layer interactions, tip and hub flow separations, the formation and changes in the critical points, and tip leakage vortices amongst other phenomena. Steady and unsteady Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) calculations are conducted at near-stall conditions for smooth and rough NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) rotor 67 blades. Surface streamlines, Q-criterion, and entropy contours aid in analyzing the flow physics qualitatively and quantitatively. It is observed that from the onset of stall, to fully stalled conditions, the blockage varies from 21.7\% to 59.6\% from 90\% span to the tip in the smooth case, and from 40.5\% to 75.2\% in the rough case. This significant blockage, caused by vortex breakdown and chaotic flow structures, leads to the onset of full rotor stall.</description>

      <title>Some effects of limited wall-sensor availability on flow estimation with 3D-GANs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we assess the impact of the limited availability of wall-embedded sensors on the full 3D estimation of the flow field in a turbulent channel with Re{\tau} = 200. The estimation technique is based on a 3D generative adversarial network (3D-GAN). We recently demonstrated that 3D-GANs are capable of estimating fields with good accuracy by employing fully-resolved wall quantities (pressure and streamwise/spanwise wall shear stress on a grid with DNS resolution). However, the practical implementation in an experimental setting is challenging due to the large number of sensors required. In this work, we aim to estimate the flow fields with substantially fewer sensors. The impact of the reduction of the number of sensors on the quality of the flow reconstruction is assessed in terms of accuracy degradation and spectral length-scales involved. It is found that the accuracy degradation is mainly due to the spatial undersampling of scales, rather than the reduction of the number of sensors per se. We explore the performance of the estimator in case only one wall quantity is available. When a large number of sensors is available, pressure measurements provide more accurate flow field estimations. Conversely, the elongated patterns of the streamwise wall shear stress make this quantity the most suitable when only few sensors are available. As a further step towards a real application, the effect of sensor noise is also quantified. It is shown that configurations with fewer sensors are less sensitive to measurement noise.</description>

      <title>Turbulence, Thermal Pressure, and Their Dynamical Effects on Cosmic Baryonic Fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We employ the IllustrisTNG simulation data to investigate the turbulent and thermal motions of the cosmic baryonic fluid. With continuous wavelet transform techniques, we define the pressure spectra, or density-weighted velocity power spectra, as well as the spectral ratios, for both turbulent and thermal motions. We find that the magnitude of the turbulent pressure spectrum grows slightly from $z=4$ to $2$ and increases significantly from $z=2$ to $1$ at large scales, suggesting progressive turbulence injection into the cosmic fluid, whereas from $z=1$ to $0$, the spectrum remains nearly constant, indicating that turbulence may be balanced by energy transfer and dissipation. The magnitude of the turbulent pressure spectra also increases with environmental density, with the highest density regions showing a turbulent pressure up to six times that of thermal pressure. We also explore the dynamical effects of turbulence and thermal motions, discovering that while thermal pressure provides support against structure collapse, turbulent pressure almost counteracts this support, challenging the common belief that turbulent pressure supports gas against overcooling.</description>

      <title>A compatible finite element discretisation for moist shallow water equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The moist shallow water equations offer a promising route for advancing understanding of the coupling of physical parametrisations and dynamics in numerical atmospheric models, an issue known as 'physics-dynamics coupling'. Without moist physics, the traditional shallow water equations are a simplified form of the atmospheric equations of motion and so are computationally cheap, but retain many relevant dynamical features of the atmosphere. Introducing physics into the shallow water model in the form of moisture provides a tool to experiment with numerical techniques for physics-dynamics coupling in a simple dynamical model. In this paper, we compare some of the different moist shallow water models by writing them in a general formulation. The general formulation encompasses three existing forms of the moist shallow water equations and also a fourth, previously unexplored formulation. The equations are coupled to a three-state moist physics scheme that interacts with the resolved flow through source terms and produces two-way physics-dynamics feedback. We present a new compatible finite element discretisation of the equations and apply it to the different formulations of the moist shallow water equations in three test cases. The results show that the models capture generation of cloud and rain and physics-dynamics interactions, and demonstrate some differences between moist shallow water formulations and the implications of these different modelling choices.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Taylor-Proudman constraint explains the flows into the Tangent Cylinder</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08840v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tangent Cylinders (TCs) have shaped our understanding of planetary dynamos and liquid cores. The Taylor-Proudman Constraint (TPC) due to planetary rotation creates these imaginary surfaces separating polar and equatorial regions but cannot explain the flows meandering through them. Here we establish and verify experimentally that magnetic fields aligned with rotation drive flows \emph{into} TCs, linked to the flows \emph{along} TCs by a \emph{magnetic} Taylor-Proudman constraint. This constraint explains and quantifies how magnetic fields reshape rotating flows in planetary interiors and magnetorotating flows in general.</description>

      <title>Non-homogeneous anisotropic bulk viscosity for acoustic wave attenuation in weakly compressible methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03475v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A major limitation of the weakly compressible approaches to simulate incompressible flows is the appearance of artificial acoustic waves that introduce a large mass conservation error and lead to spurious oscillations in the force coefficients. In this work, we propose a non-homogeneous anisotropic bulk viscosity term to effectively damp the acoustic waves. By implementing this term in a computational framework based on the recently proposed general pressure equation, we demonstrate that the non-homogeneous and anisotropic nature of the term makes it significantly more effective than the isotropic homogeneous version widely used in the literature. Moreover, it is computationally more efficient than the pressure (or mass) diffusion term, which is an alternative mechanism used to suppress acoustic waves. We simulate a range of benchmark problems to comprehensively investigate the performance of the bulk viscosity on the effective suppression of acoustic waves, mass conservation error, order of convergence of the solver, and computational efficiency. The proposed form of the bulk viscosity enables fairly accurate modelling of the initial transients of unsteady simulations, which is highly challenging for weakly compressible approaches, and to the best of our knowledge, existing approaches can't provide an accurate prediction of such transients.</description>

      <title>No sustained mean velocity in the boundary region of plane thermal convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12877v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of thermal and momentum boundary regions in three-dimensional direct numerical simulations of Rayleigh-B\'enard convection for the Rayleigh number range $10^5 \le Ra \le 10^{11}$ and $Pr=0.7$. Using a Cartesian slab with horizontal periodic boundary conditions and an aspect ratio of 4, we obtain statistical homogeneity in the horizontal $x$- and $y$-directions, thus approximating best an extended convection layer relevant for most geo- and astrophysical flow applications. We observe upon canonical use of combined long-time and area averages, with averaging periods of at least 100 free-fall times, that a global coherent mean flow is practically absent and that the magnitude of the velocity fluctuations is larger than the mean by up to 2 orders of magnitude. The velocity field close to the wall is a collection of differently oriented local shear-dominated flow patches interspersed by extensive shear-free incoherent regions which can be as large as the whole cross section, unlike for a closed cylindrical convection cell of aspect ratio of the order 1. The incoherent regions occupy a $60\%$ area fraction for all Rayleigh numbers investigated here. Rather than resulting in a pronounced mean with small fluctuations about such a mean, as found in small-aspect-ratio convection, the velocity field is dominated by strong fluctuations of all three components around a non-existent or weak mean. We discuss the consequences of these observations for convection layers with larger aspect ratios, including boundary layer instabilities and the resulting turbulent heat transport.</description>

      <title>Inferring parameters and reconstruction of two-dimensional turbulent flows with physics-informed neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01193v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Obtaining system parameters and reconstructing the full flow state from limited velocity observations using conventional fluid dynamics solvers can be prohibitively expensive. Here we employ machine learning algorithms to overcome the challenge. As an example, we consider a moderately turbulent fluid flow, excited by a stationary force and described by a two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equation with linear bottom friction. Using dense in time, spatially sparse and probably noisy velocity data, we reconstruct the spatially dense velocity field, infer the pressure and driving force up to a harmonic function and its gradient, respectively, and determine the unknown fluid viscosity and friction coefficient. Both the root-mean-square errors of the reconstructions and their energy spectra are addressed. We study the dependence of these metrics on the degree of sparsity and noise in the velocity measurements. Our approach involves training a physics-informed neural network by minimizing the loss function, which penalizes deviations from the provided data and violations of the governing equations. The suggested technique extracts additional information from velocity measurements, potentially enhancing the capabilities of particle image/tracking velocimetry.</description>

      <title>A gas-surface interaction algorithm for discrete velocity methods in predicting rarefied and multi-scale flows II: For Cercignani-Lampis boundary model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09636v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The discrete velocity method (DVM) for rarefied flows and unified methods based on the DVM framework for flows in all regimes have worked well as precise flow solvers over the past decades and have been successfully extended to other important physical fields. However, these methods primarily focus on modeling gas-gas interactions. For gas-surface interactions (GSI) at the wall boundary, they usually use the full accommodation diffuse reflection model, which cannot accurately describe the behavior of reflected gas molecules in rarefied flows. To overcome this bottleneck and extend the DVM and unified methods to more realistic boundary conditions, a Cercignani-Lampis (CL) boundary with different momentum and thermal energy accommodations is proposed and integrated into the DVM framework. In this work, by giving the macroscopic flux from the numerical quadrature of the incident molecular distribution, the reflected macroscopic flux can be obtained for the given accommodation coefficients. Then, an anisotropic Gaussian distribution can be found for the reflected molecules, whose parameters are determined by the calculated reflected macroscopic flux. These macroscopic flux and microscopic Gaussian distribution form a complete physical process for the reflected molecules. Furthermore, the CL boundary is integrated into the unified gas-kinetic scheme (UGKS), making it suitable for the simulation of both monatomic and diatomic gas flows, and it accommodates both the conventional Cartesian velocity space and the recently developed efficient unstructured velocity space. Moreover, this new GSI boundary is suitable for both explicit and implicit schemes, offering better performance for flow prediction. Finally, the performance of the new boundary is validated through a series of numerical tests covering a wide range of Knudsen and Mach numbers.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the coupling effects of the two-phase interface, viscosity ratio, and density ratio of the dispersed phase to the continuous phase on the flow statistics in two-phase Taylor-Couette turbulence at a system Reynolds number of 6000 and a system Weber number of 10 using interface-resolved three-dimensional direct numerical simulations with the volume-of-fluid method. Our study focuses on four different scenarios: neutral droplets, low-viscosity droplets, light droplets, and low-viscosity light droplets. We find that neutral droplets and low-viscosity droplets primarily contribute to drag enhancement through the two-phase interface, while light droplets reduce the system's drag by explicitly reducing Reynolds stress due to the density dependence of Reynolds stress. Additionally, low-viscosity light droplets contribute to greater drag reduction by further reducing momentum transport near the inner cylinder and implicitly reducing Reynolds stress. While interfacial tension enhances turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) transport, drag enhancement is not strongly correlated with TKE transport for both neutral droplets and low-viscosity droplets. Light droplets primarily reduce the production term by diminishing Reynolds stress, whereas the density contrast between the phases boosts TKE transport near the inner wall. Therefore, the reduction in the dissipation rate is predominantly attributed to decreased turbulence production, causing drag reduction. For low-viscosity light droplets, the production term diminishes further, primarily due to their greater reduction in Reynolds stress, while reduced viscosity weakens the density difference's contribution to TKE transport near the inner cylinder, resulting in a more pronounced reduction in the dissipation rate and consequently stronger drag reduction. Our findings provide new insights into the turbulence modulation in two-phase flow.</description>

      <title>Scaling laws for the sound generation of bio-inspired flapping wings</title>

Abstract: Bio-inspired flapping wings have been extensively studied for their remarkable aerodynamic performance. Recently, their noise emission has attracted growing interest, but a careful analysis of scaling laws for their sound generation is missing. This work presents scaling laws for the sound generation of bio-inspired flapping wings during hovering flight based on the potential flow theory and Ffowcs Williams-Hawkings acoustic analogy. Direct numerical simulations considering a range of parameters including the Reynolds number, Mach number and wing kinematics confirms that the proposed scaling laws capture the major physics involved and their predictions agree well with the numerical results. The scaling laws can be used as a powerful tool for engineers in the design of micro-aerial vehicles considering both aerodynamics and acoustics performances simultaneously.</description>
