      <title>Treatment effects at the margin: Everyone is marginal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a framework for identifying treatment effects when a policy simultaneously alters both the incentive to participate and the outcome of interest -- such as hiring decisions and wages in response to employment subsidies; or working decisions and wages in response to job trainings. This framework was inspired by my PhD project on a Belgian reform that subsidised first-time hiring, inducing entry by marginal firms yet meanwhile changing the wages they pay. Standard methods addressing selection-into-treatment concepts (like Heckman selection equations and local average treatment effects), or before-after comparisons (including simple DiD or RDD), cannot isolate effects at this shifting margin where treatment defines who is observed. I introduce marginality-weighted estimands that recover causal effects among policy-induced entrants, offering a policy-relevant alternative in settings with endogenous selection. This method can thus be applied widely to understanding the economic impacts of public programmes, especially in fields largely relying on reduced-form causal inference estimation (e.g. labour economics, development economics, health economics).</description>

      <title>Discovering Heterogeneous Treatment Effects in Regression Discontinuity Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.11640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.11640v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper proposes a causal supervised machine learning algorithm to uncover treatment effect heterogeneity in sharp and fuzzy regression discontinuity (RD) designs. We develop a criterion for building an honest ``regression discontinuity tree'', where each leaf contains the RD estimate of a treatment conditional on the values of some pre-treatment covariates. It is a priori unknown which covariates are relevant for capturing treatment effect heterogeneity, and it is the task of the algorithm to discover them, without invalidating inference, while employing a nonparametric estimator with expected MSE optimal bandwidth. We study the performance of the method through Monte Carlo simulations and apply it to uncover various sources of heterogeneity in the impact of attending a better secondary school in Romania.</description>

      <title>Specification testing with grouped fixed effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01950v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a Hausman test for the correct specification of unobserved heterogeneity in both linear and nonlinear fixed-effects panel data models. The null hypothesis is that heterogeneity is either time-invariant or, symmetrically, described by homogeneous time effects. We contrast the standard one-way fixed-effects estimator with the recently developed two-way grouped fixed-effects estimator, that is consistent in the presence of time-varying heterogeneity (or heterogeneous time effects) under minimal specification and distributional assumptions for the unobserved effects. The Hausman test compares jackknife corrected estimators, removing the leading term of the incidental parameters and approximation biases, and exploits bootstrap to obtain the variance of the vector of contrasts. We provide Monte Carlo on the size and good power properties of the test and illustrate its application in three empirical settings.</description>

      <title>Externally Valid Selection of Experimental Sites via the k-Median Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09187v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a decision-theoretic justification for viewing the question of how to best choose where to experiment in order to optimize external validity as a $k$-median problem, a popular problem in computer science and operations research. We present conditions under which minimizing the worst-case, welfare-based regret among all nonrandom schemes that select $k$ sites to experiment is approximately equal - and sometimes exactly equal - to finding the k most central vectors of baseline site-level covariates. The k-median problem can be formulated as a linear integer program. Two empirical applications illustrate the theoretical and computational benefits of the suggested procedure.</description>

      <title>Uniform Estimation and Inference for Nonparametric Partitioning-Based M-Estimators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05715v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents uniform estimation and inference theory for a large class of nonparametric partitioning-based M-estimators. The main theoretical results include: (i) uniform consistency for convex and non-convex objective functions; (ii) rate-optimal uniform Bahadur representations; (iii) rate-optimal uniform (and mean square) convergence rates; (iv) valid strong approximations and feasible uniform inference methods; and (v) extensions to functional transformations of underlying estimators. Uniformity is established over both the evaluation point of the nonparametric functional parameter and a Euclidean parameter indexing the class of loss functions. The results also account explicitly for the smoothness degree of the loss function (if any), and allow for a possibly non-identity (inverse) link function. We illustrate the theoretical and methodological results in four examples: quantile regression, distribution regression, $L_p$ regression, and Logistic regression. Many other possibly non-smooth, nonlinear, generalized, robust M-estimation settings are covered by our results. We provide detailed comparisons with the existing literature and demonstrate substantive improvements: we achieve the best (in some cases optimal) known results under improved (in some cases minimal) requirements in terms of regularity conditions and side rate restrictions. The supplemental appendix reports complementary technical results that may be of independent interest, including a novel uniform strong approximation result based on Yurinskii's coupling.</description>

      <title>A Non-Parametric Approach to Heterogeneity Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13721v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a non-parametric methodology to quantify preference heterogeneity in consumer choices. By repeatedly sampling individual observations and partitioning agents into groups consistent with the Generalized Axiom of Revealed Preferences (GARP), we construct a similarity matrix capturing latent preference structures. Under mild assumptions, this matrix consistently and asymptotically normally estimates the probability that any pair of agents share a common utility function. Leveraging this, we develop hypothesis tests to assess whether demographic characteristics systematically explain unobserved heterogeneity. Simulations confirm the test's validity. Applying the method to grocery expenditure data, we find robust evidence that larger families, higher income, and younger age are associated with greater similarity in revealed preferences, whereas low income and older age predict lower similarity.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Outlier Detection for Matrix-variate Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19515v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Anomalies in economic and financial data -- often linked to rare yet impactful events -- are of theoretical interest, but can also severely distort inference. Although outlier-robust methodologies can be used, many researchers prefer pre-processing strategies that remove outliers. In this work, an efficient sequential Bayesian framework is proposed for outlier detection based on the predictive Bayes Factor (BF). The proposed method is specifically designed for large, multidimensional datasets and extends univariate Bayesian model outlier detection procedures to the matrix-variate setting. Leveraging power-discounted priors, tractable predictive BF are obtained, thereby avoiding computationally intensive techniques. The BF finite sample distribution, the test critical region, and robust extensions of the test are introduced by exploiting the sampling variability. The framework supports online detection with analytical tractability, ensuring both accuracy and scalability. Its effectiveness is demonstrated through simulations, and three applications to reference datasets in macroeconomics and finance are provided.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Smoothed Quantile Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01738v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bayesian quantile regression (BQR) based on the asymmetric Laplace distribution (ALD) has two fundamental limitations: its posterior mean yields biased quantile estimates, and the non-differentiable check loss precludes gradient-based MCMC methods. We propose Bayesian smoothed quantile regression (BSQR), a principled reformulation that constructs a novel, continuously differentiable likelihood from a kernel-smoothed check loss, simultaneously ensuring a consistent posterior by aligning the inferential target with the smoothed objective and enabling efficient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) sampling. Our theoretical analysis establishes posterior propriety for various priors and examines the impact of kernel choice. Simulations show BSQR reduces predictive check loss by up to 50% at extreme quantiles over ALD-based methods and improves MCMC efficiency by 20-40% in effective sample size. An application to financial risk during the COVID-19 era demonstrates superior tail risk modeling. The BSQR framework offers a theoretically grounded, computationally efficient solution to longstanding challenges in BQR, with uniform and triangular kernels emerging as highly effective.</description>

      <title>Returns and Order Flow Imbalances: Intraday Dynamics and Macroeconomic News Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06788v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the interaction between returns and order flow imbalances in the S&amp;P 500 E-mini futures market using a structural VAR model identified through heteroskedasticity. The model is estimated at one-second frequency for each 15-minute interval, capturing both intraday variation and endogeneity due to time aggregation. We find that macroeconomic news announcements sharply reshape price-flow dynamics: price impact rises, flow impact declines, return volatility spikes, and flow volatility falls. Pooling across days, both price and flow impacts are significant at the one-second horizon, with estimates broadly consistent with stylized limit-order-book predictions. Impulse responses indicate that shocks dissipate almost entirely within a second. Structural parameters and volatilities also exhibit pronounced intraday variation tied to liquidity, trading intensity, and spreads. These results provide new evidence on high-frequency price formation and liquidity, highlighting the role of public information and order submission in shaping market quality.</description>
