      <title>Electrical and Structural Properties of In-Situ MOCVD Grown Al$_2$O$_3$/$\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ and Al$_2$O$_3$/$\beta$-(Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$)$_2$O$_3$ MOSCAPs</title>

Abstract: This study investigates the electrical and structural properties of MOSCAPs with in-situ MOCVD-grown Al$_2$O$_3$ dielectrics on (010) $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ and $\beta$-(Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$)$_2$O$_3$ films. The Al$_2$O$_3$/$\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ MOSCAPs showed a strong dependence on Al$_2$O$_3$ deposition temperature. At 900$^\circ$C, reduced voltage hysteresis ($\sim$0.3 V) and improved reverse breakdown voltage (74.5 V) were observed, with breakdown fields of 5.01 MV/cm in Al$_2$O$_3$ and 4.11 MV/cm in $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$. At 650$^\circ$C, higher hysteresis ($\sim$3.44 V) and lower reverse breakdown voltage (38.8 V) were observed, with breakdown fields of 3.69 MV/cm in Al$_2$O$_3$ and 2.87 MV/cm in $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$. However, forward breakdown fields improved from 5.62 MV/cm (900$^\circ$C) to 7.25 MV/cm (650$^\circ$C). STEM revealed improved crystallinity and sharper interfaces at 900$^\circ$C, enhancing reverse breakdown performance. For Al$_2$O$_3$/$\beta$-(Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$)$_2$O$_3$ MOSCAPs, increasing Al composition ($x$ = 5.5\% to 9.2\%) reduced carrier concentration and improved reverse breakdown fields from 2.55 to 2.90 MV/cm in $\beta$-(Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$)$_2$O$_3$ and 2.41 to 3.13 MV/cm in Al$_2$O$_3$. Forward breakdown fields in Al$_2$O$_3$ improved from 5.0 to 5.4 MV/cm as Al composition increased. STEM confirmed compositional homogeneity and excellent stoichiometry of Al$_2$O$_3$ and $\beta$-(Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$)$_2$O$_3$ layers. These findings highlight the robust electrical performance, high breakdown fields, and structural quality of Al$_2$O$_3$/$\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ and Al$_2$O$_3$/$\beta$-(Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$)$_2$O$_3$ MOSCAPs for high-power applications.</description>

      <title>Superconducting microwave oscillators as detectors for ESR spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microwave superconducting resonators are extensively studied in fields such as quantum computing and electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy. However, the integration of superconducting resonators with feedback mechanisms to create ultra-low noise oscillators is a relatively unexplored area, and the application of such oscillators in ESR spectroscopy has not yet been demonstrated. In this work, we report the design, fabrication, and application of microwave oscillators based on superconducting resonators for ESR spectroscopy. Specifically, ESR spectra are obtained by measuring the oscillator's frequency shift induced by the ESR effect as a function of the applied static magnetic field. The oscillators are composed of a single heterojunction bipolar transistor (HBT) or high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) coupled with NbTi or YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_7$ (YBCO) superconducting resonators. The fabricated oscillators operate at frequencies of 0.6 and 1.7 GHz and temperatures up to 80 K (for YBCO resonators) and 8 K (for NbTi resonators). The lowest measured frequency noise is about 9 mHz/Hz$^{1/2}$, the best spin sensitivity is about $1\times10^{10}$ spins/Hz$^{1/2}$, and the best concentration sensitivity is about $3\times10^{18}$ spins/Hz$^{1/2}$m$^3$. The approach proposed in this work should allow for significantly better spin and concentration sensitivities compared to those achievable with normal conductors, up to operating frequencies, magnetic fields, and temperatures where superconductors exhibit substantially lower effective microwave resistance than normal conductors.</description>

      <title>Mode shapes and sensitivity analysis of torsional vibrations in overhang- and T-shaped microcantilevers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The torsional mode of atomic force microscope (AFM) cantilevers plays a crucial role in a wide range of sensitive measurements. Despite their importance, the use of approximated frequencies and mode shapes for width-varying cantilevers often results in discrepancies between theoretical models and experimental observations. In this study, we present an analytical approach to accurately calculate the mode shapes and resonance frequencies of these cantilevers, including higher-order modes, then we derive the modal sensitivity. Our results reveal distinct changes in mode shapes and frequencies as the overhang length increases, with the mode shapes showing multiple maxima. Furthermore, we demonstrate that tuning the overhang length provides effective control over the resonant frequency. The relationship between modal sensitivity and the coupling strength between the cantilever and the surface is also established, aligning with previous experimental findings. This work offers valuable insights for optimizing cantilever geometry to achieve desired frequency responses in AFM applications.</description>

      <title>Fabrication of Poly ({\epsilon}-Caprolactone) 3D scaffolds with controllable porosity using ultrasound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D printing has progressed significantly, allowing objects to be produced using a wide variety of materials. Recent advances have employed focused ultrasound in 3D printing, to allow printing inside acoustically transparent materials. Here we introduce a Selective Ultrasonic Melting (SUM) method for 3D printing of poly ({\epsilon}-caprolactone) (PCL) powder mixed with water. The printing was done by mechanically moving a focused ultrasound transducer. The microstructure and porosity of the prints were analyzed with micro-computed tomography ({\mu}CT). The open porosity of the printed samples was determined using the water intrusion method and by passing fluorescent microspheres through the structure. The cytocompatibility of the printed structures was confirmed by seeding NIH-3T3 fibroblast cells on the scaffolds, followed by analysis using live/dead fluorescent assay. and visualization using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). We demonstrated that SUM is a viable technique to print structures with active control of their porosity This method provides an alternative to methods such as fused deposition modelling (FDM) and material jetting.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Trampoline Resonators from (La,Sr)MnO3 Single-Crystal Thin Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Micro-electro-mechanical resonators employing a magnetic element have been proposed for magnetic field sensing applications, but the integration of magnetic materials with standard semiconductor compounds is challenging and requires complex fabrication protocols. We present a different approach relying on (La0.7,Sr0.3)MnO3 (LSMO), an oxide compound that works both as structural element for the resonator and functional magnetic layer. Suspended trampolines are realized in a single step process from LSMO thin films and show quality factor up to 60k and fQ products reaching 10$^{10}$ Hz. Their magnetic properties are probed by a SQUID magnetometer and magnetic force microscopy, showing saturation magnetization of 240 kA/m at room temperature and in-plane magnetic domains with coercivity of 2.5 mT. Being entirely made from a magnetic material, these resonators exhibit a larger magnetic interaction volume compared to other solutions, making them ideal candidates as building blocks for high-sensitivity magnetic field sensors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mechanical stress control is becoming one of the major challenges for the future of micro and nanotechnologies. Micro scanning X-ray diffraction is one of the promising techniques that allows stress characterization in such complex structures at sub micron scales. Two types of MEMS structure have been studied: a bilayer cantilever composed of a gold film deposited on poly-silicon and a boron doped silicon bridge. X-ray diffraction results are discussed in view of numerical simulation experiments.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium of circular von-K\'arm\'an plate bonded with Kirchhoff rod</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A circular von Karman plate is considered bonded at its boundary to a circular Kirchhoff rod via a hinge like junction. There is a mismatch of dimension between the rod and the plate boundary in their respective stress free configurations. The process of gluing of the inextensible circular rod to the edge of the extensible plate causes the system to develop internal stress in the natural planar configuration. For some critical values of this mismatch the rod plate system, as expected, shows buckling behaviour in the interior or at the boundary of plate. In this paper, the corresponding bifurcation problem is formulated using the mismatch parameter as a bifurcation parameter. The non linear equations of equilibrium are linearized near the homogeneously deformed state and necessary conditions of bifurcation are solved for the critical geometric mismatch that is when non trivial solutions of the linearized equations exist. These critical points are candidates to be classified as bifurcation points. Additionally, the semi analytic nature of the analysis is exploited to perform a parametric study, relative to structure parameters in the problem formulation, of the critical points in the problem and the characteristic features are summarised. It is found that the rod plays an important role in determining the buckling behaviour when the plate's dimension is smaller than the looped rod, as in that case the rod buckles and the plate can bend or stretch depending on the planar or non planar nature of buckled mode of the rod. When the plate is larger, the rod effectively stimulates a rigid Dirichlet boundary condition due to its inextensibility; the critical points in this case are found to coincide with the case when buckling in the sole plate as a system is considered.</description>

      <title>Second harmonic generation in silicon nitride waveguides integrated with MoS$_2$ monolayers: the importance of a full vectorial modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrating 2D materials into on-chip photonic devices holds significant potential for nonlinear frequency conversion across various applications. The lack of inversion symmetry in monolayers of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD), such as MoS$_2$ and WS$_2$, is particularly attractive for enabling nonlinear phenomena based on $\chi^{(2)}$ in silicon photonic devices incorporated with these materials. Previous studies have demonstrated second-order nonlinearities in on-chip silicon-based devices integrated with transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). However, they have largely overlooked the nonlinear modal interaction that considers both the tensorial nature of the TMD's second-order susceptibility and the full vectorial nature of the electromagnetic fields. In this work, we investigate second-harmonic generation (SHG) in silicon nitride (SiN) waveguides integrated with a monolayer of MoS$_2$. We experimentally observed an enhancement in second-harmonic generation (SHG) in MoS$_2$-loaded waveguides compared to those without the monolayer. Notably, this enhancement occurred even when the primary electric field component of the pump and/or signal mode was orthogonal to the TMD plane, highlighting co- and cross-polarized SHG interactions. This phenomenon cannot be predicted by the traditionally used scalar models.In addition, we provide important guidelines for the design of MoS$_2$-loaded waveguides, taking into account phase-matching, interaction length and the MoS$_2$ crystal orientation with respect to the waveguide axis.</description>

      <title>THz Metal-Mesh Bandpass Filters with Diamond-shaped Apertures for Sensitive THz Receivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present high-performance terahertz (THz) metal-mesh bandpass filters developed to mitigate direct detection effects in sensitive THz receivers based on superconducting hot-electron bolometer (HEB) mixers. These metal-mesh filters are free-standing 5-micron thick sheets of copper perforated with a periodic array of diamond-shaped apertures. The simple aperture design minimizes the effect of fabrication (rounding) errors on filter performance, allowing precise engineering of the center frequency (1.5-5.5 THz) while maintaining high (&gt;90 %) peak power transmission at normal incidence and a relatively narrow bandwidth of 5-15 %. Based on finite-element method (FEM) simulation results, we provide simple design equations that can be used for rapid design with high accuracy. The measured transmission profiles of 1.9-THz, 2.5-THz, and 4.7-THz filters show excellent agreement with the simulation results. These filters are compatible with cryogenic operation and can substantially reduce the direct detection effects in HEB mixers.</description>

      <title>Metallicity and Anomalous Hall Effect in Epitaxially-Strained, Atomically-thin RuO2 Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The anomalous Hall effect (AHE), a hallmark of time-reversal symmetry breaking, has been reported in rutile RuO2, a debated metallic altermagnetic candidate. Previously, AHE in RuO2 was observed only in strain-relaxed thick films under extremely high magnetic fields (~50 T). Yet, in ultrathin strained films with distinctive anisotropic electronic structures, there are no reports, likely due to disorder and defects suppressing metallicity thus hindering its detection. Here, we demonstrate that ultrathin, fully-strained 2 nm TiO2/t nm RuO2/TiO2 (110) heterostructures, grown by hybrid molecular beam epitaxy, retain metallicity and exhibit a sizeable AHE at a significantly lower magnetic field (&lt; 9 T). Density functional theory calculations reveal that epitaxial strain stabilizes a non-compensated magnetic ground state and reconfigures magnetic ordering in RuO2 (110) thin films. These findings establish ultrathin RuO2 as a platform for strain-engineered magnetism and underscore the transformative potential of epitaxial design in advancing spintronic technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many applications, including medical diagnostics, sonar and navigation rely on the detection of acoustic waves. Photonic hydrophones demonstrate comparable sensitivity to piezoelectric-based hydrophones, but with significantly reduced size, weight and power requirements. In this paper we demonstrate a micron-sized free-standing silicon photonic hydrophone. We demonstrate sensitivity on the order of $\sim$mPa/$\sqrt{\textrm{Hz}}$ from 10-200 kHz, with a minimum detectable pressure of 145 $\mu$Pa/$\sqrt{\textrm{Hz}}$ at 22 kHz. We also deployed our hydrophone in a wave flume to evaluate its suitability for underwater measurement and communication. Our hydrophone matches the sensitivity of commercial hydrophones, but is many orders of magnitude smaller in volume, which could enable high spatial resolution imaging of micron-sized acoustic features (i.e., living cell vibrations). Our hydrophone could also be used in underwater communication and imaging applications.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Machine Learning for Efficient Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is a two-dimensional periodic structure integrated with a large number of reflective elements, which can manipulate electromagnetic waves in a digital way, offering great potentials for wireless communication and radar detection applications. However, conventional RIS designs highly rely on extensive full-wave EM simulations that are extremely time-consuming. To address this challenge, we propose a machine-learning-assisted approach for efficient RIS design. An accurate and fast model to predict the reflection coefficient of RIS element is developed by combining a multi-layer perceptron neural network (MLP) and a dual-port network, which can significantly reduce tedious EM simulations in the network training. A RIS has been practically designed based on the proposed method. To verify the proposed method, the RIS has also been fabricated and measured. The experimental results are in good agreement with the simulation results, which validates the efficacy of the proposed method in RIS design.</description>

      <title>Ultra-sensitive integrated circuit sensors based on high-order nonHermitian topological physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-precision sensors are of fundamental importance in modern society and technology.Although numerous sensors have been developed, obtaining sensors with higher levels of sensitivity and stronger robustness has always been expected. Here, we propose theoretically and demonstrate experimentally a novel class of sensors with superior performances based on exotic properties of highorder non-Hermitian topological physics. The frequency shift induced by perturbations for these sensors can show an exponential growth with respect to the size of the device, which can well beyond the limitations of conventional sensors. The fully integrated circuit chips have been designed and fabricated in a standard 65nm complementary metal oxide semiconductor process technology. The sensitivity of systems not only less than 0.001fF has been experimentally verified, they are also robust against disorders.Our proposed ultra-sensitive integrated circuit sensors can possess a wide range of applications in various fields and show an exciting prospect for next-generation sensing technologies.</description>

      <title>Influence of the pretreatment anneal on Co germanide Schottky contacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A thin cobalt layer is deposited by electron beam evaporation onto a germanium substrate after an in situ cleaning annealing at 400 or 700 C. The effect of these pretreatments on the Co/Ge Schottky barrier properties and on the germanide formation is investigated by using different techniques. A strong influence of the pre-treatment is observed. The pre-treatment at 700 C removes the native oxide but enhances the diffusion of contaminants. After post-metal deposition annealing, the sample pre-treated at 700 C shows a double layer structure due to interdiffusion, whereas some large isolated islands are present in the sample pre-treated at 400 C.</description>

Abstract: Systemic drug administration often causes off-target effects limiting the efficacy of advanced therapies. Targeted drug delivery approaches increase local drug concentrations at the diseased site while minimizing systemic drug exposure. We present a magnetically guided microrobotic drug delivery system capable of precise navigation under physiological conditions. This platform integrates a clinical electromagnetic navigation system, a custom-designed release catheter, and a dissolvable capsule for accurate therapeutic delivery. In vitro tests showed precise navigation in human vasculature models, and in vivo experiments confirmed tracking under fluoroscopy and successful navigation in large animal models. The microrobot balances magnetic material concentration, contrast agent loading, and therapeutic drug capacity, enabling effective hosting of therapeutics despite the integration complexity of its components, offering a promising solution for precise targeted drug delivery.</description>

      <title>Wafer-scale waveguide sidewall roughness scattering loss characterization by image processing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photonic integrated circuits (PICs) are vital for developing affordable, high-performance optoelectronic devices that can be manufactured at an industrial scale, driving innovation and efficiency in various applications. Optical loss of modes in thin film waveguides and devices is a critical measure of their performance. Thin films growth, lithography, masking, and etching processes are imperfect processes that introduce significant sidewall and top-surface roughness and cause dominating optical losses in waveguides and photonic structures. These roughness as perturbations couple light from guided to far-field radiation modes, leading to scattering losses that can be estimated from theoretical models. Typically, with UV-based lithography sidewall roughness is found to be significantly larger than wafer-top surface roughness. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging measurement gives 3D and high-resolution roughness profile but the measurement is inconvenient, costly, and unscalable for large-scale PICs and at wafer-scale. Here, we evaluate the sidewall roughness profile based on 2D high-resolution scanning electron microscope imaging. We characterized the loss on two homemade nitride and oxide films on 3-inch silicon wafers with 12 waveguide devices on each and co-related the scattering loss estimated from a 2D image-based sidewall profile and theoretical Payne model. The lowest loss of guided fundamental transverse electric (TE$_{0}$) is found at 0.075 dB/cm at 633 nm across 24 devices, which is a record at visible wavelength. Our work shows a 100% success in edge detection in image processing to estimate autocorrelation function and optical mode loss. These demonstrations offer valuable insights into waveguide sidewall roughness and comparison of experimental and 2D SEM image-processing-based loss estimations.</description>

      <title>Distributed Saddle-Point Dynamics in Multilayer Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multilayer networks provide a more advanced and comprehensive framework for modeling real-world systems compared to traditional single-layer and multiplex networks. Unlike single-layer models, multilayer networks have multiple interacting layers, each with unique topological features. In this paper, we generalize previously developed results for distributed optimization in multiplex networks to the more general case of multilayer networks by employing a tensor formalism to represent multilayer networks and their tensor-Laplacian diffusion dynamics. Although multiplex networks are a special case of multilayer networks, where each layer has the same number of replica nodes connected one-to-one, this generalized framework removes the need for replica nodes, allowing variability in both topology and number of nodes across layers. This approach provides a fully generalized structure for distributed optimization in multilayer networks and enables more complex interlayer connections. We derive the multilayer combinatorial Laplacian tensor and extend the distributed gradient descent algorithm. We provide a theoretical analysis of the convergence of algorithms. Numerical examples validate our approach, and we explore the impact of heterogeneous layer topologies and complex interlayer dynamics on consensus time, underscoring their implications for real-world multilayer systems.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal metasurfaces with epsilon-near-zero materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonreciprocal optics enables asymmetric transmission of light when its sources and detectors are exchanged. A canonical example -- optical isolator -- enables light propagation in only one direction, similar to how electrical diodes enable unidirectional flow of electric current. Nonreciprocal optics today, unlike nonreciprocal electronics, remains bulky. Recently, nonlinear metasurfaces opened up a pathway to strong optical nonreciprocity at the nanoscale. However, demonstrations to date were based on optically slow nonlinearities involving thermal effects or phase transition materials. In this work, we demonstrate a nonreciprocal metasurface with an ultra-fast optical response based on indium tin oxide in its epsilon-near-zero regime. It operates in the spectral range of 1200-1300 nm with incident power densities of 40-70 GW/cm$^2$. Furthermore, the nonreciprocity of the metasurface extends to both amplitude and phase of the forward/backward transmission opening a pathway to nonreciprocal wavefront control at the nanoscale.</description>

      <title>Modeling finite viscoelasticity based on the Green-Naghdi kinematic assumption and generalized strains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a modeling framework for finite viscoelasticity, inspired by the kinematic assumption made by Green and Naghdi in plasticity. This approach fundamentally differs from the widely used multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient, as the intermediate configuration, a concept that remains debated, becomes unnecessary. The advent of the concept of generalized strains allows the Green-Naghdi assumption to be employed with different strains, offering a flexible mechanism to separate inelastic deformation from total deformation. This leads to a constitutive theory in which the kinematic separation is adjustable and can be calibrated. For quadratic configurational free energy, the framework yields a suite of finite linear viscoelasticity models governed by linear evolution equations. Notably, these models recover established models, including those by Green and Tobolsky (1946) and Simo (1987), when the Seth-Hill strain is chosen with the strain parameter being -2 and 2, respectively. It is also related to the model of Miehe and Keck (2000) when the strain is of the Hencky type. We further extend the approach by adopting coercive strains, which allows us to define an elastic deformation tensor locally. This facilitates modeling the viscous branch using general forms of the configurational free energy, and we construct a micromechanical viscoelastic model as a representative instantiation. The constitutive integration algorithms of the proposed models are detailed. We employ the experimental data of VHB 4910 to examine the proposed models, which demonstrate their effectiveness and potential advantages in the quality of fitting and prediction. Three-dimensional finite element analysis is also conducted to assess the influence of different strains on the viscoelastic behavior.</description>

      <title>Wakefield-induced THz wave generation in a hybrid dielectric-plasma cylindrical waveguide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present study, the generation of THz radiation through wakefield excitation in a cylindrical dielectric plasma waveguide is investigated. The proposed hybrid dielectric-plasma wakefield structure combines the advantages of dielectric materials and plasma, creating a versatile platform for high-performance applications and advanced THz radiation generation. By leveraging the strengths of both techniques, this hybrid configuration achieves enhanced gradients and optimized THz wave output. The mechanism involves a high-energy laser pulse propagating through a plasma-loaded dielectric waveguide, inducing wakefields that drive THz wave emission. This dual capability underscores the versatility of the proposed structure, offering significant advancements in THz wave generation technologies. To support the theoretical analysis, numerical simulations were employed using the Fourier-Bessel Particle-In-Cell (FBPIC) method and the COMSOL Multiphysics package. The simulation modeled the wakefield generation process and validated the propagation of electromagnetic waves. A comprehensive parametric study examined the effects of various parameters including dielectric thickness, an external DC magnetic field, laser pulse length, driver beam radius, and total current, on the wakefield generated THz radiation. Through systematic variation of these parameters, the study aims to elucidate the controlled features of the resulting fields and optimize THz radiation.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the thermal transport mechanism in compressed plastic crystals assisted by deep potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The unique properties of plastic crystals highlight their potential for use in solid-state refrigeration. However, their practical applications are limited by thermal hysteresis due to low thermal conductivity. In this study, the effect of compressive strain on the thermal transport properties of plastic crystal [(CH3)4N][FeCl4] was investigated using molecular dynamic simulation with a deep neural network potential. It is found that a 9% strain along [001] direction enhances thermal conductivity sixfold. The underlying mechanisms are analyzed through vibrational density of states, spectral energy densities, and mean square displacements. The enhancement in thermal conductivity is primarily due to increased group velocity and reduced phonon scattering, driven by volume compression within the 0-1 THz. These findings offer theoretical insights for the practical application of plastic crystals in thermal management systems.</description>

      <title>Optimisation of design parameters to improve performance of a planar electromagnetic actuator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13436v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Planar electromagnetic actuators based on the principle of linear motors are widely employed for micro and nano positioning applications. These actuators usually employ a planar magnetic platform driven by a co-planar electromagnetic coil. While these actuators offer a large motion range and high positioning resolution, their actuation bandwidth is limited due to relatively small electromagnetic stiffness. We report optimization of the design parameters of the electromagnetic coil and the magnetic assembly to maximize the electromagnetic force and stiffness. Firstly, we derive closed-form expressions for the electromagnetic forces and stiffness, which enable us to express these quantities in terms of the design parameters of the actuator. Secondly, based on these derived expressions, we estimate the optimum values of the design parameters to maximize force and stiffness. Notably, for the optimum design parameters, the force and stiffness per unit volume can be increased by two and three orders of magnitude, respectively by reducing the pitch of the electromagnetic coil by a factor of 10. Lastly, we develop an electromagnetic actuator and evaluate its performance using a Microelectromechanical system (MEMS) based force sensor. By operating the force sensor in a feedback loop, we precisely measure the generated electromagnetic forces for different design parameters of the actuator. The experimental results obtained align closely with the analytical values, with an error of less than 15%.</description>

      <title>Laser-scanning of induction-melted Al alloys: are they representative of additively manufactured ones?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06138v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The bottleneck of alloy design for powder-based additive manufacturing (AM) resides in customized powder production - an expensive and time-consuming process hindering the rapid closed-loop design iterations. This study analyzed an expedited experimental workflow, i.e., multipath laser scanning of induction-melted samples, to mimic rapid solidification of AM to serve as an alternative approach to down-select from the design space. Using Al-Ni-Zr-Er model alloy, comprehensive multi-scale characterizations were performed to compare microstructural features between laser-scanned and laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) samples. Although demonstrating a difference in melt pool geometries, the microstructures in scanning electron microscopy (SEM)- and transmission electron microscopy (TEM)- scale demonstrate a high degree of similarity, in terms of microstructure morphology, grain size, presence of precipitates, and phase distribution. The mechanical performance was evaluated by microhardness tests. The results revealed a 20% reduction in laser-scanned samples compared to LPBF samples, attributed to the thermal history and potential differences in phase fractions. The decreasing trend was also observed in the benchmark alloy showing a 10% absolute error with respect to the model alloy. This study underscores the potential of this workflow to accelerate alloy design in AM by circumventing customized powder production and encourages further exploration across diverse materials and processing parameters.</description>

      <title>Spin Photonic Topological Insulator Antenna By Armchair Arrangement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15820v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new X-band leaky wave antenna has been developed using spin photonic topological insulators. This antenna features a hexagonal unit cell arranged in an armchair configuration. This arrangement provides advantages over the zigzag configuration, particularly by offering a wider leaky region and a more suitable pattern. To design the structure, a parametric study on the cell dimensions has been conducted, and another study has designed the transition region to couple the topological structure with the classical line. The proposed antenna has a low profile and illuminates two sides of the structure simultaneously. Additionally, it offers a 53-degree scanning range and a bandwidth of 2.7 GHz, making it a groundbreaking improvement over other leaky wave antennas that utilize photonic topological insulators. The proposed antenna is an unbalanced Composite Right/Left-Handed (CRLH) leaky wave antenna capable of radiating in both backward and forward directions. Notably, as it transitions through the broadside within its scanning range, there is no significant drop in performance, even in the presence of an open stop band. To the best of our knowledge, this characteristic is unique among unbalanced CRLH leaky wave antennas.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the nonlinear dynamics of spin wave active ring oscillators (SWAROs) injected with GHz drive signal. The injected signal frequency was swept over a 5 MHz wide frequency range across a magnetostatic surface spin wave (MSSW) dipole gap, with the drive power varying from -10 to 10 dBm. We measured the output power spectra from the SWARO at different gains for each drive power and frequency combination. Near the drive frequency, we observe the formation of sidebands, which are the products of the nonlinear scattering processes. Furthermore, at higher drive amplitudes, the spin wave nonlinearity in the ring oscillator is suppressed, and the SWARO spectrum is pulled toward the drive frequency.</description>

Abstract: Self-assembled nano and micro-structures, particularly those capable of responsive erasure and regeneration, have garnered significant interest for their applications in smart photonics and electronics. However, current techniques for modulating these architectures largely depend on network rearrangement, posing challenges for in situ regeneration. Furthermore, their common fabrication techniques are complex and uncontrolled with the structures formed not being amenable for large area applications, thus compromising their economic viability. Herein, we present a controlled thermal process strategy for fabricating large-area, dynamically tunable, 1D,2D and 3D micro and nanostructures on a wide range of compatible materials including metals, semiconductors and polymers. By tuning the temperature changes in the system, thermal expansion coefficients of thin films and substrates, surface energy, Youngs modulus and thickness of the thin films we achieve robust, uniform, periodic structures over extensive areas on soft and stretchable substrates. The process is further supported by a theoretical model that we developed and validated by experiments and simulations. To showcase the robustness of our approach, we present prototypes of dynamically tunable diffraction gratings, optical diffusers, large-area reflective displays, camouflage devices, out-coupling efficiency enhancers, wearable devices and mechanochromic sensors.</description>

      <title>Metamaterial sound absorbers based on microperforated panels: an approach toward enhanced flexibility and near-limit broadband performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07012v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional microperforated panels (MPPs) and metamaterial-based sound absorbers rely on local resonances or multi-resonator designs, which limit their bandwidth, angular applicability, and ease of fabrication. Leveraging the reciprocity theorem and cavity resonances, we introduce a new class of robust MPP absorbers, termed meta-MPPs, capable of achieving ultrabroadband near-total sound absorption across a range of 0.37 to 10 kHz. These absorbers demonstrate average performance exceeding that of traditional MPPs by over 100%, approaching the theoretical causality limit. Notably, their absorption performance can be tuned between angularly asymmetric and omnidirectional modes and remains highly robust to variations in MPP parameters and geometrical configurations. Validated through simulations and experiments, our findings present a simpler, more robust, and highly adaptable solution for noise control.</description>

      <title>Stochastic reconstruction of multiphase composite microstructures using statistics-encoded neural network for poro/micro-mechanical modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07083v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding microstructure-property relationships (MPRs) is essential for optimising the performance of multiphase composites. Image-based poro/micro-mechanical modelling provides a non-invasive approach to exploring MPRs, but the randomness of multiphase composites often necessitates extensive 3D microstructure datasets for statistical reliability. This study introduces a cost-effective machine learning framework to reconstruct numerous virtual 3D microstructures from limited 2D exemplars, circumventing the high costs of volumetric microscopy. Using feedforward neural networks, termed the statistics-encoded neural network (SENN), the framework encodes 2D morphological statistics and infers 3D morphological statistics via a 2D-to-3D integration scheme. Statistically equivalent 3D microstructures are synthesised using Gibbs sampling. Hierarchical characterisation enables seamless capture of features across multiple scales. Validation on three composites demonstrates strong statistical equivalence between reconstructed and reference microstructures, confirmed by morphological descriptors and simulated macroscopic properties (e.g., stiffness, permeability). The SENN-based framework is a high-fidelity tool for efficiently and accurately reconstructing multiphase microstructures.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Investigation of Cotton Fabric Behavior Modified by Straight and Zig-Zag Stitches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.13270v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we demonstrate a data-driven approach to investigate the behavior of cotton fabric modified by straight and zig-zag stitches. Existing literature in understanding the mechanical behavior of soft materials (e.g., textile-based fibers or fabrics) heavily relies on stress-strain analyses. However, the strain-induced deformation behavior can be further analyzed by taking advantage of data-driven constitutive models. Such an approach reveals intermolecular parameters that can be utilized further in design and development analyses. For that, we exhibit the altered mechanics of base cotton fabric induced by two types of singular stitches (straight and zig-zag). We have sewn simple straight and zig-zag cotton stitches to investigate the mechanics of the base cotton fabrics using uniaxial stress-strain experimental data. Then, we leveraged the constitutive models (i.e., three-network model, TNM) obtained from MCalibration software to reveal eleven intermolecular parameters for data-driven investigations. Our experimental analyses, combined with the data, suggest a 99.99% confidence in assessing the mechanical impact of stitches on cotton fabrics. We have also used distributed strain energy to analyze the mechanics and failure of the base and stitched fabrics. Once adopted, our study may contribute to an improved understanding of the production of smart wearables and e-textiles.</description>

      <title>Non-uniform wave momentum bandgap in biaxial anisotropic photonic time crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08206v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Photonic time crystals (PTCs) host momentum bandgaps enabling intriguing non-resonant light amplification in propagating waves, but opening substantial bandgaps demands refractive index changes too extreme for conventional nonlinear optics. Here, we introduce momentum bandgaps for non-uniform waves, including evanescent and ghost types, by extending PTCs to biaxial anisotropic photonic time crystals that periodically alternate between uniform biaxial anisotropy and isotropic media over time. We show that ghost waves, unlike evanescent waves, sustain only momentum bandgaps, opening wide bandgaps at even the smallest modulation depths. Moreover, we demonstrate momentum bandgap effects on non-uniform waves that can be amplified, or through decaying modes, selectively attenuated. We find that ghost wave momentum bandgaps uniquely boost refracted over reflected waves under one-way incidence, in stark contrast to balanced amplification seen in both propagating and evanescent waves. Our approach expands time-varying metamaterials by integrating wave characteristics, bridging the gap between conventional nonlinear optics and PTC momentum bandgaps, and shedding new light on extreme manipulation of surface polaritons.</description>

      <title>Numerical methods and improvements for simulating quasi-static elastoplastic materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10863v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hypo-elastoplasticity is a framework suitable for modeling the mechanics of many hard materials that have small elastic deformation and large plastic deformation. In most laboratory tests for these materials the Cauchy stress is in quasi-static equilibrium. Rycroft et al. discovered a mathematical correspondence between this physical system and the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, and developed a projection method similar to Chorin's projection method (1968) for incompressible Newtonian fluids. Here, we improve the original projection method to simulate quasi-static hypo-elastoplasticity, by making three improvements. First, drawing inspiration from the second-order projection method for incompressible Newtonian fluids, we formulate a second-order in time numerical scheme for quasi-static hypo-elastoplasticity. Second, we implement a finite element method for solving the elliptic equations in the projection step, which provides both numerical benefits and flexibility. Third, we develop an adaptive global time-stepping scheme, which can compute accurate solutions in fewer timesteps. Our numerical tests use an example physical model of a bulk metallic glass based on the shear transformation zone theory, but the numerical methods can be applied to any elastoplastic material.</description>

      <title>On Nanowire Morphological Instability and Pinch-Off by Surface Electromigration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01331v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Surface diffusion and surface electromigration may lead to a morphological instability of thin solid films and nanowires. In this paper two nonlinear analyses of a morphological instability are developed for a single-crystal cylindrical nanowire that is subjected to an axial current. These treatments extend the conventional linear stability analyses without surface electromigration, that manifest a Rayleigh-Plateau instability. A weakly nonlinear analysis is done slightly above the Rayleigh-Plateau (longwave) instability threshold. It results in a one-dimensional Sivashinsky amplitude equation that describes a blow-up of a surface perturbation amplitude in a finite time. This is a signature of a pinching singularity of a cylinder radius, which leads to a wire separation into a disjoint segments. The time- and electric field-dependent dimensions of the focusing self-similar amplitude profile approaching a blow-up are characterized via the scaling analysis. Also, a weakly nonlinear multi-scale analysis is done at the arbitrary distance above a longwave or a shortwave instability threshold. The time- and electric field-dependent Fourier amplitudes of the major instability modes are derived and characterized.</description>

      <title>Performance of Superconducting Resonators Suspended on SiN Membranes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01784v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Suspending devices on thin SiN membranes can limit their interaction with the bulk substrate and reduce parasitic capacitance to ground. While suspending devices on membranes is used in many fields including radiation detection using superconducting circuits, there has been less investigation into maximum membrane aspect ratios and achievable suspended device quality, metrics important to establish the applicable scope of the technique. Here, we investigate these metrics by fabricating superconducting coplanar waveguide resonators entirely atop thin ($\sim$110 nm) SiN membranes, where the membrane's shortest length to thickness yields an aspect ratio of approximately $7.4 \times 10^3$. We compare these membrane resonators to on-substrate resonators on the same chip, finding similar internal quality factors $\sim$$10^5$ at single photon levels. Furthermore, we confirm that these membranes do not adversely affect resonator thermalization and conduct further materials characterization. By achieving high quality superconducting circuit devices fully suspended on thin SiN membranes, our results help expand the technique's scope to potential uses including incorporating higher aspect ratio membranes for device suspension and creating larger footprint, high impedance, and high quality devices.</description>

      <title>Superconducting flip-chip devices using indium microspheres on Au-passivated Nb or NbN as under-bump metallization layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14655v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superconducting flip-chip interconnects are crucial for the three-dimensional integration of superconducting circuits in sensing and quantum technology applications. We demonstrate a simplified approach for a superconducting flip-chip device using commercially available indium microspheres and an in-house-built transfer stage for bonding two chips patterned with superconducting thin films. We use a gold-passivated niobium or niobium nitride layer as an under-bump metallization (UBM) layer between an aluminum-based superconducting wiring layer and the indium interconnect. At millikelvin temperatures, our flip-chip assembly can transport a supercurrent with tens of milliamperes, limited by the smallest geometric feature size and critical current density of the UBM layer and not by the indium interconnect. We show that the pressed indium interconnect itself can carry a supercurrent exceeding 1A due to its large size of about 500 micrometer diameter. Our flip-chip assembly does not require electroplating nor patterning of indium. The assembly process does not need a flip-chip bonder and can be realized with a transfer stage using a top chip with transparency or through-vias for alignment. These flip-chip devices can be utilized in applications that require few superconducting interconnects carrying large currents at millikelvin temperatures.</description>

      <title>Surface Chemistry-based Continuous Separation of Colloidal Particles via Diffusiophoresis and Diffusioosmosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00246v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The separation of colloidal particles based solely on their surface properties is a highly challenging task. This study demonstrates that diffusiophoresis and diffusioosmosis enable the continuous separation of carboxylate polystyrene particles with similar sizes and zeta potentials but distinct surface concentrations of carboxyl groups. The particles are exposed to salt concentration gradients generated in a double-junction microfluidic device. Through experimental and theoretical analyses, we demonstrate how the particle dynamics are influenced by their zeta potential sensitivity to the local salt concentration, which in turn is affected by surface conductance effects induced by the surface carboxyl groups. Consequently, colloids with comparable zeta potentials but differing surface concentrations of carboxyl groups can be separated with 100% efficiency. This approach, which employs a simple, easy-to-operate device, has discipline-spanning potential for the continuous separation of colloids distinguished solely by surface properties that influence their zeta potential sensitivities, like roughness, permeability, heterogeneity, and chemical composition.</description>
