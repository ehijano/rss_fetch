      <title>Hybrid Quantum Tabu Search for Solving the Vehicle Routing Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There has never been a more exciting time for the future of quantum computing than now. Near-term quantum computing usage is now the next XPRIZE. With that challenge in mind we have explored a new approach as a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for solving NP-Hard optimization problems. We have focused on the classic problem of the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) because of its real-world industry applications. Heuristics are often employed to solve this problem because it is difficult. In addition, meta-heuristic algorithms have proven to be capable of finding reasonable solutions to optimization problems like the CVRP. Recent research has shown that quantum-only and hybrid quantum/classical approaches to solving the CVRP are possible. Where quantum approaches are usually limited to minimal optimization problems, hybrid approaches have been able to solve more significant problems. Still, the hybrid approaches often need help finding solutions as good as their classical counterparts. In our proposed approach, we created a hybrid quantum/classical metaheuristic algorithm capable of finding the best-known solution to a classic CVRP problem. Our experimental results show that our proposed algorithm often outperforms other hybrid approaches.</description>

      <title>Towards quantum computing for clinical trial design and optimization: A perspective on new opportunities and challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Clinical trials are pivotal in the drug discovery process to determine the safety and efficacy of a drug candidate. The high failure rates of these trials are attributed to deficiencies in clinical model development and protocol design. Improvements in the clinical drug design process could therefore yield significant benefits for all stakeholders involved. This paper examines the current challenges faced in clinical trial design and optimization, reviews established classical computational approaches, and introduces quantum algorithms aimed at enhancing these processes. Specifically, the focus is on three critical aspects: clinical trial simulations, site selection, and cohort identification. This study aims to provide a comprehensive framework that leverages quantum computing to innovate and refine the efficiency and effectiveness of clinical trials.</description>

Abstract: Correlations between quantum theory and music theory - specifically between principles of quantum computing and musical harmony - can lead to new understandings and new methodologies for music theorists and composers. The quantum principle of superposition is shown to be closely related to different interpretations of musical meaning. Superposition is implemented directly in the authors' simulations of quantum computing, as applied in the decision-making processes of computer-generated music composition.</description>

      <title>LLMChain: Blockchain-based Reputation System for Sharing and Evaluating Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have witnessed rapid growth in emerging challenges and capabilities of language understanding, generation, and reasoning. Despite their remarkable performance in natural language processing-based applications, LLMs are susceptible to undesirable and erratic behaviors, including hallucinations, unreliable reasoning, and the generation of harmful content. These flawed behaviors undermine trust in LLMs and pose significant hurdles to their adoption in real-world applications, such as legal assistance and medical diagnosis, where precision, reliability, and ethical considerations are paramount. These could also lead to user dissatisfaction, which is currently inadequately assessed and captured. Therefore, to effectively and transparently assess users' satisfaction and trust in their interactions with LLMs, we design and develop LLMChain, a decentralized blockchain-based reputation system that combines automatic evaluation with human feedback to assign contextual reputation scores that accurately reflect LLM's behavior. LLMChain not only helps users and entities identify the most trustworthy LLM for their specific needs, but also provides LLM developers with valuable information to refine and improve their models. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a blockchain-based distributed framework for sharing and evaluating LLMs has been introduced. Implemented using emerging tools, LLMChain is evaluated across two benchmark datasets, showcasing its effectiveness and scalability in assessing seven different LLMs.</description>

      <title>Fuzzychain: An Equitable Consensus Mechanism for Blockchain Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Blockchain technology has become a trusted method for establishing secure and transparent transactions through a distributed, encrypted network. The operation of blockchain is governed by consensus algorithms, among which Proof of Stake (PoS) is popular yet has its drawbacks, notably the potential for centralising power in nodes with larger stakes or higher rewards. Fuzzychain, our proposed solution, introduces the use of fuzzy sets to define stake semantics, promoting decentralised and distributed processing control. This system selects validators based on their degree of membership to the stake fuzzy sets rather than just the size of their stakes. As a pioneer proposal in applying fuzzy sets to blockchain, Fuzzychain aims to rectify PoS's limitations. Our results indicate that Fuzzychain not only matches PoS in functionality but also ensures a fairer distribution of stakes among validators, leading to more inclusive validator selection and a better-distributed network.</description>

      <title>PristiQ: A Co-Design Framework for Preserving Data Security of Quantum Learning in the Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Benefiting from cloud computing, today's early-stage quantum computers can be remotely accessed via the cloud services, known as Quantum-as-a-Service (QaaS). However, it poses a high risk of data leakage in quantum machine learning (QML). To run a QML model with QaaS, users need to locally compile their quantum circuits including the subcircuit of data encoding first and then send the compiled circuit to the QaaS provider for execution. If the QaaS provider is untrustworthy, the subcircuit to encode the raw data can be easily stolen. Therefore, we propose a co-design framework for preserving the data security of QML with the QaaS paradigm, namely PristiQ. By introducing an encryption subcircuit with extra secure qubits associated with a user-defined security key, the security of data can be greatly enhanced. And an automatic search algorithm is proposed to optimize the model to maintain its performance on the encrypted quantum data. Experimental results on simulation and the actual IBM quantum computer both prove the ability of PristiQ to provide high security for the quantum data while maintaining the model performance in QML.</description>

      <title>Planning of Truck Platooning for Road-Network Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Truck platooning, a linking technology of trucks on the highway, has gained enormous attention in recent years due to its benefits in energy and operation cost savings. However, most existing studies on truck platooning limit their focus on scenarios in which each truck can serve only one customer demand and is thus with a specified origin-destination pair, so only routing and time schedules are considered. Nevertheless, in real-world logistics, each truck may need to serve multiple customers located at different places, and the operator has to determine not only the routing and time schedules of each truck but also the set of customers allocated to each truck and their sequence to visit. This is well known as a capacitated vehicle routing problem with time windows (CVRPTW), and considering the application of truck platooning in such a problem entails new modeling frameworks and tailored solution algorithms. In light of this, this study makes the first attempt to optimize the truck platooning plan for a road-network CVRPTW to minimize the total operation cost, including vehicles' fixed dispatch cost and energy cost, while fulfilling all delivery demands within their time window constraints. Specifically, the operation plan will dictate the number of trucks to be dispatched, the set of customers, and the routing and time schedules for each truck. In addition, the modeling framework is constructed based on a road network instead of a traditional customer node graph to better resemble and facilitate the platooning operation. A 3-stage algorithm embedded with a "route-then-schedule" scheme, dynamic programming, and modified insertion heuristic, is developed to solve the proposed model in a timely manner. Numerical experiments are conducted to validate the modeling framework, demonstrate the performance of the proposed solution algorithm, and quantify the benefit of truck platooning.</description>

      <title>A Practical Multilevel Governance Framework for Autonomous and Intelligent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous and intelligent systems (AIS) facilitate a wide range of beneficial applications across a variety of different domains. However, technical characteristics such as unpredictability and lack of transparency, as well as potential unintended consequences, pose considerable challenges to the current governance infrastructure. Furthermore, the speed of development and deployment of applications outpaces the ability of existing governance institutions to put in place effective ethical-legal oversight. New approaches for agile, distributed and multilevel governance are needed. This work presents a practical framework for multilevel governance of AIS. The framework enables mapping actors onto six levels of decision-making including the international, national and organizational levels. Furthermore, it offers the ability to identify and evolve existing tools or create new tools for guiding the behavior of actors within the levels. Governance mechanisms enable actors to shape and enforce regulations and other tools, which when complemented with good practices contribute to effective and comprehensive governance.</description>

      <title>Taming Server Memory TCO with Multiple Software-Defined Compressed Tiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Memory accounts for 33 - 50% of the total cost of ownership (TCO) in modern data centers. We propose a novel solution to tame memory TCO through the novel creation and judicious management of multiple software-defined compressed memory tiers.
  As opposed to the state-of-the-art solutions that employ a 2-Tier solution, a single compressed tier along with DRAM, we define multiple compressed tiers implemented through a combination of different compression algorithms, memory allocators for compressed objects, and backing media to store compressed objects. These compressed memory tiers represent distinct points in the access latency, data compressibility, and unit memory usage cost spectrum, allowing rich and flexible trade-offs between memory TCO savings and application performance impact. A key advantage with ntier is that it enables aggressive memory TCO saving opportunities by placing warm data in low latency compressed tiers with a reasonable performance impact while simultaneously placing cold data in the best memory TCO saving tiers. We believe our work represents an important server system configuration and optimization capability to achieve the best SLA-aware performance per dollar for applications hosted in production data center environments.
  We present a comprehensive and rigorous analytical cost model for performance and TCO trade-off based on continuous monitoring of the application's data access profile. Guided by this model, our placement model takes informed actions to dynamically manage the placement and migration of application data across multiple software-defined compressed tiers. On real-world benchmarks, our solution increases memory TCO savings by 22% - 40% percentage points while maintaining performance parity or improves performance by 2% - 10% percentage points while maintaining memory TCO parity compared to state-of-the-art 2-Tier solutions.</description>

      <title>ActSonic: Everyday Activity Recognition on Smart Glasses using Active Acoustic Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce ActSonic, an intelligent, low-power active acoustic sensing system integrated into eyeglasses. ActSonic is designed to recognize 27 different everyday activities (e.g., eating, drinking, toothbrushing). It only needs a pair of miniature speakers and microphones mounted on each hinge of eyeglasses to emit ultrasonic waves to create an acoustic aura around the body. Based on the position and motion of various body parts, the acoustic signals are reflected with unique patterns captured by the microphone and analyzed by a customized self-supervised deep learning framework to infer the performed activities. ActSonic was deployed in a user study with 19 participants across 19 households to evaluate its efficacy. Without requiring any training data from a new user (leave-one-participant-out evaluation), ActSonic was able to detect 27 activities with an inference resolution of 1 second, achieving an average F1-score of 86.6% in an unconstrained setting and 93.4% in a prompted setting.</description>

      <title>DE-LIoT: The Data-Energy Networking Paradigm for Sustainable Light-Based Internet of Things</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing demand for Internet of Things (IoT) networks has sparked interest in sustainable, zero-energy designs through Energy Harvesting (EH) to extend the lifespans of IoT sensors. Visible Light Communication (VLC) is particularly promising, integrating signal transmission with optical power harvesting to enable both data exchange and energy transfer in indoor network nodes. VLC indoor channels, however, can be unstable due to their line-of-sight nature and indoor movements. In conventional EH-based IoT networks, maximum Energy Storage (ES) capacity might halt further harvesting or waste excess energy, leading to resource inefficiency. Addressing these issues, this paper proposes a novel VLC-based WPANs concept that enhances both data and energy harvesting efficiency. The architecture employs densely distributed nodes and a central controller for simultaneous data and energy network operation, ensuring efficient energy exchange and resource optimisation. This approach, with centralised control and energy-state-aware nodes, aims for long-term energy autonomy. The feasibility of the Data-Energy Networking-enabled Light-based Internet of Things (DE-LIoT) concept is validated through real hardware implementation, demonstrating its sustainability and practical applicability. Results show significant improvements in the lifetime of resource-limited nodes, confirming the effectiveness of this new data and energy networking model in enhancing sustainability and resource optimisation in VLC-based WPANs.</description>

Abstract: As quantum technology is advancing, the efficient design of quantum circuits has become an important area of research. This paper provides an introduction to the MCT quantum circuit design problem for reversible Boolean functions without assuming a prior background in quantum computing. While this is a well-studied problem, optimization models that minimize the true objective have only been explored recently. This paper introduces a new optimization model and symmetry-breaking constraints that improve solving time by up to two orders of magnitude compared to earlier work when a Constraint Programming solver is used. Experiments with up to seven qubits and using up to 15 quantum gates result in several new best-known circuits for well-known benchmarks. Finally, an extensive comparison with other approaches shows that optimization models may require more time but can provide superior circuits with optimality guarantees.</description>

Abstract: The ever-increasing amount of data from ubiquitous smart devices fosters data-centric and cognitive algorithms. Traditional digital computer systems have separate logic and memory units, resulting in a huge delay and energy cost for implementing these algorithms. Memristors are programmable resistors with a memory, providing a paradigm-shifting approach towards creating intelligent hardware systems to handle data-centric tasks. Spintronic nanodevices are promising choices as they are high-speed, low-power, highly scalable, robust, and capable of constructing dynamic complex systems. In this Review, we survey spintronic devices from a memristor point of view. We introduce spintronic memristors based on magnetic tunnel junctions, nanomagnet ensemble, domain walls, topological spin textures, and spin waves, which represent dramatically different state spaces. They can exhibit steady, oscillatory, stochastic, and chaotic trajectories in their state spaces, which have been exploited for in-memory logic, neuromorphic computing, stochastic and chaos computing. Finally, we discuss challenges and trends in realizing large-scale spintronic memristive systems for practical applications.</description>

Abstract: We present an algorithm for solving tridiagonal Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems and Quadratic Unconstrained Discrete Optimization (QUDO) problems with one-neighbor interactions using the quantum-inspired technology of tensor networks. Our method is based on the simulation of a quantum state to which we will apply an imaginary time evolution and perform a series of partial traces to obtain the state of maximum amplitude, since it will be the optimal state.

Abstract: Neuromorphic sensors, also known as event cameras, are a class of imaging devices mimicking the function of biological visual systems. Unlike traditional frame-based cameras, which capture fixed images at discrete intervals, neuromorphic sensors continuously generate events that represent changes in light intensity or motion in the visual field with high temporal resolution and low latency. These properties have proven to be interesting in modeling human faces, both from an effectiveness and a privacy-preserving point of view. Neuromorphic face analysis however is still a raw and unstructured field of research, with several attempts at addressing different tasks with no clear standard or benchmark. This survey paper presents a comprehensive overview of capabilities, challenges and emerging applications in the domain of neuromorphic face analysis, to outline promising directions and open issues. After discussing the fundamental working principles of neuromorphic vision and presenting an in-depth overview of the related research, we explore the current state of available data, standard data representations, emerging challenges, and limitations that require further investigation.

Abstract: The rapid advancement in neurotechnology in recent years has created an emerging critical intersection between neurotechnology and security. Implantable devices, non-invasive monitoring, and non-invasive therapies all carry with them the prospect of violating the privacy and autonomy of individuals' cognition. A growing number of scientists and physicians have made calls to address this issue, but applied efforts have been relatively limited. A major barrier hampering scientific and engineering efforts to address Cognitive Security is the lack of a clear means of describing and analyzing relevant problems. In this paper we develop Cognitive Security, a mathematical framework which enables such description and analysis by drawing on methods and results from multiple fields. We demonstrate certain statistical properties which have significant implications for Cognitive Security, and then present descriptions of the algorithmic problems faced by attackers attempting to violate privacy and autonomy, and defenders attempting to obstruct such attempts.</description>
