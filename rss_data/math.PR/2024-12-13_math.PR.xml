      <title>On domination for (non-symmetric) Dirichlet forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The primary aim of this article is to investigate the domination relationship between two $L^2$-semigroups using probabilistic methods. According to Ouhabaz's domination criterion, the domination of semigroups can be transformed into relationships involving the corresponding Dirichlet forms. Our principal result establishes the equivalence between the domination of Dirichlet forms and the killing transformation of the associated Markov processes, which generalizes and completes the results in \cite{Y962} and \cite{Y96}. Based on this equivalence, we provide a representation of the dominated Dirichlet form using the bivariate Revuz measure associated with the killing transformation and further characterize the sandwiched Dirichlet form within the broader Dirichlet form framework. In particular, our findings apply to the characterization of operators sandwiched between the Dirichlet Laplacian and the Neumann Laplacian. For the local boundary case, we eliminate all technical conditions identified in the literature \cite{AW03} and deliver a complete representation of all sandwiched operators governed by a Robin boundary condition determined by a specific quasi-admissible measure. Additionally, our results offer a comprehensive characterization of related operators in the non-local Robin boundary case, specifically resolving an open problem posed in the literature \cite{OA21}.</description>

      <title>Gaussian heat kernel asymptotics for conditioned random walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a random walk $S_n=\sum_{i=1}^n X_i$ with independent and identically distributed real-valued increments with zero mean, finite variance and moment of order $2 + \delta$ for some $\delta&gt;0$. For any starting point $x\in \mathbb R$, let $\tau_x = \inf \left\{ k\geq 1: x+S_{k} &lt; 0 \right\}$ denote the first time when the random walk $x+S_n$ exits the half-line $[0,\infty)$. We investigate the uniform asymptotic behavior over $x\in \mathbb R$ of the persistence probability $\mathbb P (\tau_x &gt;n)$ and the joint distribution $\mathbb{P} \left( x + S_n \leq u, \tau_x &gt; n \right)$, for $u\geq 0$, as $n \to \infty$. New limit theorems for these probabilities are established based on the heat kernel approximations. Additionally, we evaluate the rate of convergence by proving Berry-Esseen type bounds.</description>

      <title>Phase transition and critical behavior in hierarchical integer-valued Gaussian and Coulomb gas models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a square box $\Lambda_n\subseteq\mathbb Z^2$ of side-length $L^n$ with $L,n&gt;1$, we study hierarchical random fields $\{\phi_x\colon x\in\Lambda_n\}$ with law proportional to ${\rm e}^{\frac12\beta(\varphi,\Delta_n\phi)}\prod_{x\in\Lambda_n}\nu({\rm d}\phi_x)$, where $\beta&gt;0$ is the inverse temperature, $\Delta_n$ is a hierarchical Laplacian on $\Lambda_n$, and $\nu$ is a non-degenerate $1$-periodic measure on $\mathbb R$. Our setting includes the integer-valued Gaussian field (a.k.a. DG-model or Villain Coulomb gas) and the sine-Gordon model. Relying on renormalization group analysis we derive sharp asymptotic formulas, in the limit as $n\to\infty$, for the covariance $\langle\phi_x\phi_y\rangle$ and the fractional charge $\langle{\rm e}^{2\pi{\rm i}\alpha(\phi_x-\phi_y)}\rangle$ in the subcritical $\beta&lt;\beta_{\rm c}:=\pi^2/\log L$, critical $\beta=\beta_{\rm c}$ and slightly supercritical $\beta&gt;\beta_{\rm c}$ regimes. The field exhibits logarithmic correlations throughout albeit with a distinct $\beta$-dependence of the variance and fractional-charge exponents in the sub/supercritical regimes. Explicit logarithmic corrections appear at the critical point.</description>

      <title>General Markovian randomized equilibrium existence and construction in zero-sum Dynkin games for diffusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the most classical games for stochastic processes is the zero-sum Dynkin (stopping) game. We present a complete equilibrium solution to a general formulation of this game with an underlying one-dimensional diffusion. A key result is the construction of a characterizable global $\epsilon$-Nash equilibrium in Markovian randomized stopping times for every $\epsilon &gt; 0$. This is achieved by leveraging the well-known equilibrium structure under a restrictive ordering condition on the payoff functions, leading to a novel approach based on an appropriate notion of randomization that allows for solving the general game without any ordering condition. Additionally, we provide conditions for the existence of pure and randomized Nash equilibria (with $\epsilon=0$). Our results enable explicit identification of equilibrium stopping times and their corresponding values in many cases, illustrated by several examples.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic expansions for normal deviations of random walks conditioned to stay positive</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a one-dimensional random walk $S_n$ having i.i.d. increments with zero mean and finite variance. We continue our study of asymptotic expansions for local probabilities $\mathbf P(S_n=x,\tau_0&gt;n)$, which has been started in \cite{DTW23}. Obtained there expansions make sense in the zone $x=o(\frac{\sqrt{n}}{\log^{1/2} n})$ only. In the present paper we derive an alternative expansion, which deals with $x$ of order $\sqrt{n}$.</description>

      <title>Time inhomogeneous Poisson equations and non-autonomous multi-scale stochastic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a new tool, the time inhomogeneous Poisson equation in the whole space and with a terminal condition at infinity, to study the asymptotic behavior of the non-autonomous multi-scale stochastic system with irregular coefficients, where both the fast and the slow equation depend on the highly oscillating time component. In particular, periodic, quasi-periodic and almost periodic coefficients are allowed. The strong convergence of double averaging principle as well as the functional central limit theorem with homogenized-averaged diffusion coefficient are established. Moreover, we also obtain rates of convergence, which do not depend on the regularities of the coefficients with respect to the time component and the fast variable.</description>

      <title>A semiconcavity approach to stability of entropic plans and exponential convergence of Sinkhorn's algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study stability of optimizers and convergence of Sinkhorn's algorithm in the framework of entropic optimal transport. We show entropic stability for optimal plans in terms of the Wasserstein distance between their marginals under a semiconcavity assumption on the sum of the cost and one of the two entropic potentials. When employed in the analysis of Sinkhorn's algorithm, this result gives a natural sufficient condition for its exponential convergence, which does not require the ground cost to be bounded. By controlling from above the Hessians of Sinkhorn potentials in examples of interest, we obtain new exponential convergence results. For instance, for the first time we obtain exponential convergence for log-concave marginals and quadratic costs for all values of the regularization parameter. Moreover, the convergence rate has a linear dependence on the regularization: this behavior is sharp and had only been previously obtained for compact distributions arXiv:2407.01202. Other interesting new applications include subspace elastic costs [Cuturi et al. PMLR 202(2023)], weakly log-concave marginals, marginals with light tails, where, under reinforced assumptions, we manage to improve the rates obtained in arXiv:2311.04041, the case of unbounded Lipschitz costs, and compact Riemannian manifolds.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of Harish-Chandra transform and infinitesimal freeness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the last ten years a technique of Schur generating functions and Harish-Chandra transforms was developed for the study of the asymptotic behavior of discrete particle systems and random matrices. In the current paper we extend this toolbox in several directions. We establish general results which allow to access not only the Law of Large Numbers, but also next terms of the asymptotic expansion of averaged empirical measures. In particular, this allows to obtain an analog of a discrete Baik-Ben Arous-Peche phase transition. A connection with infinitesimal free probability is shown and a quantized version of infinitesimal free probability is introduced. Also, we establish the Law of Large Numbers for several new regimes of growth of a Harish-Chandra transform.</description>

      <title>On the moderate deviation principles in the sparse multi-type Erd\H{o}s R\'enyi random graph</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the sparse multi-type Erd\H{o}s R\'enyi random graphs. Despite that the corresponding central limit results are unknown, we are able to prove the moderate deviation principles for the size of the largest connected component, the number of a certain type of connected components, as well as the total number of the connected components. The rate functions are given explicitly. The proof relies on a careful study of a conditional multi-dimensional compound Poisson process. The properties of the related multi-type branching processes are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Percolation on the stationary distributions of the voter model with stirring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The voter model with stirring is a variant of the classical voter model with two possible opinions (0 and 1) that allows voters to interchange opinions at rate $\mathsf{v} \ge 0$. In [Astoquillca,24], it was proved that for this model on $\mathbb Z^d$ for $d \ge 3$ and any $\mathsf{v}$, the set of extremal stationary measures is given by a family $\{ \mu_{\alpha,\mathsf{v}}: \alpha \in [0,1] \}$, where $\alpha$ is the density of voters with opinion 1. Sampling a configuration $\xi$ from $\mu_{\alpha, \mathsf v}$, we study $\xi$ as a site percolation model on $\mathbb Z^d$ where the set of occupied sites is the set of voters with opinion 1 in $\xi$. Letting $\alpha_c(\mathsf v)$ be the supremum of all the values of $\alpha$ for which percolation does not occur $\mu_{\alpha, \mathsf v}$-a.s., we prove that $\alpha_c(\mathsf{v})$ converges to $p_c$, the critical density for classical Bernoulli site percolation, as $\mathsf{v}$ tends to infinity. As a consequence, for $\mathsf v$ large enough, the probability of the existence of an infinite percolation cluster of 1's exhibits a phase transition in $\alpha$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extending a previous result of the first two authors, we prove a local limit theorem for the joint distribution of subgraph counts in the Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi random graph $G(n,p)$. This limit can be described as a nonlinear transformation of a multivariate normal distribution, where the components of the multivariate normal correspond to the graph factors of Janson. As an application, we show a number of results concerning the existence and enumeration of proportional graphs and related concepts, answering various questions of Janson and collaborators in the affirmative.</description>

      <title>Log-Ergodic Dynamics in Stochastic Monetary Velocity: Theoretical Insights and Economic Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We suggest employing log-ergodic processes to simulate the velocity of money in an ergodic manner. Our approach sheds light on economic behavior, policy implications, and financial dynamics by maintaining long-term stability. By bridging theory and practice, the partially ergodic model helps analysts and policymakers comprehend and forecast velocity of money. The empirical analysis, using historical U.S. GDP and money supply data, demonstrates the model's effectiveness in capturing the long-term stability of the velocity of money. Key findings indicate that the log-ergodic model offers superior predictive power compared to traditional models, making it a valuable tool for policymakers to control economic factors in vital situations.</description>

Abstract: We determine the distribution of the number of saddle connections on a random translation surface of large genus. More specifically, for genus $g$ going to infinity, the number of saddle connections with lengths in a given interval $[\frac{a}{g}, \frac{b}{g}]$ converges in distribution to a Poisson distributed random variable. Furthermore, the numbers of saddle connections associated to disjoint intervals are independent.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mu_1, \mu_2$ be finitely supported probability measures on $\mathrm{Diff}^1_+(S^1)$ such that their supports genererate groups acting proximally on $S^1$. Let $f^n_\omega, f^n_{\omega'}, n \in \mathbb{N}$ be two independent realizations of the random walk driven by $\mu_1, \mu_2$ respectively. We show that almost surely there is an $N \in \mathbb{N}$ such that for all $n \geq N$ the elements $f^n_\omega, f^n_{\omega'}$ generate a nonabelian free group. The proof adapts the strategy by R. Aoun for linear groups and work of A. Gorodetski, V. Kleptsyn and G. Monakov, and of K. Gelfert and G. Salcedo. The theorem is still true for infinitely supported measures on $\mathrm{Diff}_+^{1 + \tau}(S^1)$ subject to moment conditions, and a weaker but similar statement holds for measures supported on $\mathrm{Homeo}_+(S^1)$ with no moment conditions.</description>

      <title>Universal finite-size scaling in high-dimensional critical phenomena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new unified theory of critical finite-size scaling for lattice statistical mechanical models with periodic boundary conditions above the upper critical dimension. The universal finite-size scaling is inherited from the scaling of the system unwrapped to the infinite lattice. A Wilsonian renormalisation group analysis determines a universal profile for the susceptibility and two-point function plateau. Our theory is based on recent mathematically rigorous results for linear and branched polymers, multi-component spin systems, and percolation. Both short-range and long-range interactions are included. With free boundary conditions, the universal scaling applies at a pseudocritical point.</description>

      <title>Multivariate Aspects of Phylogenetic Comparative Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This thesis concerns multivariate phylogenetic comparative methods. We investigate two aspects of them. The first is the bias caused by measurement error in regression studies of comparative data. We calculate the formula for the bias and show how to correct for it. We also study whether it is always advantageous to correct for the bias as correction can increase the mean square error of the estimate. We propose a criterion, which depends on the observed data, that indicates whether it is beneficial to correct or not. Accompanying the results is an R program that offers the bias correction tool.
  The second topic is a multivariate model for trait evolution which is based on an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck type stochastic process, often used for studying trait adaptation, co-evolution, allometry or trade-offs. Alongside the description of the model and presentation of its most important features we present an R program estimating the model's parameters. To the best of our knowledge our program is the first program that allows for nearly all combinations of key model parameters providing the biologist with a flexible tool for studying multiple interacting traits in the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck framework. There are numerous packages available that include the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process but their multivariate capabilities seem limited.

      <title>Stochastic models in phylogenetic comparative methods: analytical properties and parameter estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phylogenetic comparative methods are well established tools for using inter-species variation to analyse phenotypic evolution and adaptation. They are generally hampered, however, by predominantly univariate approaches and failure to include uncertainty and measurement error in the phylogeny as well as the measured traits. This thesis addresses all these three issues.
  First, by investigating the effects of correlated measurement errors on a phylogenetic regression. Second, by developing a multivariate Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model combined with a maximum-likelihood estimation package in R. This model allows, uniquely, a direct way of testing adaptive coevolution.
  Third, accounting for the often substantial phylogenetic uncertainty in comparative studies requires an explicit model for the tree. Based on recently developed conditioned branching processes, with Brownian and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck evolution on top, expected species similarities are derived, together with phylogenetic confidence intervals for the optimal trait value. Finally, inspired by these developments, the phylogenetic framework is illustrated by an exploration of questions concerning "time since hybridization", the distribution of which proves to be asymptotically exponential.

      <title>Random Tur\'an Problems for $K_{s,t}$ Expansions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $K_{s,t}^{(r)}$ denote the $r$-uniform hypergraph obtained from the graph $K_{s,t}$ by inserting $r-2$ new vertices inside each edge of $K_{s,t}$. We prove essentially tight bounds on the size of a largest $K_{s,t}^{(r)}$-subgraph of the random $r$-uniform hypergraph $G_{n,p}^r$ whenever $r\ge 2s/3+2$, giving the first random Tur\'an results for expansions that go beyond a natural "tight-tree barrier." In addition to this, our methods yield optimal supersaturation results for $K_{s,t}^{(3)}$ for sufficiently dense host hypergraphs, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Pfaffian Schur processes and last passage percolation in a half-quadrant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.00525</link>
      <description>arXiv:1606.00525v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study last passage percolation in a half-quadrant, which we analyze within the framework of Pfaffian Schur processes. For the model with exponential weights, we prove that the fluctuations of the last passage time to a point on the diagonal are either GSE Tracy-Widom distributed, GOE Tracy-Widom distributed, or Gaussian, depending on the size of weights along the diagonal. Away from the diagonal, the fluctuations of passage times follow the GUE Tracy-Widom distribution. We also obtain a two-dimensional crossover between the GUE, GOE and GSE distribution by studying the multipoint distribution of last passage times close to the diagonal when the size of the diagonal weights is simultaneously scaled close to the critical point. We expect that this crossover arises universally in KPZ growth models in half-space. Along the way, we introduce a method to deal with diverging correlation kernels of point processes where points collide in the scaling limit.</description>

      <title>Facilitated exclusion process</title>

      <description>arXiv:1707.01923v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Facilitated TASEP, an interacting particle system on the one dimensional integer lattice. We prove that starting from step initial condition, the position of the rightmost particle has Tracy Widom GSE statistics on a cube root time scale, while the statistics in the bulk of the rarefaction fan are GUE. This uses a mapping with last-passage percolation in a half-quadrant which is exactly solvable through Pfaffian Schur processes.
  Our results further probe the question of how first particles fluctuate for exclusion processes with downward jump discontinuities in their limiting density profiles. Through the Facilitated TASEP and a previously studied MADM exclusion process we deduce that cube-root time fluctuations seem to be a common feature of such systems. However, the statistics which arise are shown to be model dependent (here they are GSE, whereas for the MADM exclusion process they are GUE).
  We also discuss a two-dimensional crossover between GUE, GOE and GSE distribution by studying the multipoint distribution of the first particles when the rate of the first one varies. In terms of half-space last passage percolation, this corresponds to last passage times close to the boundary when the size of the boundary weights is simultaneously scaled close to the critical point.</description>

      <title>Focusing $\Phi^4_3$-model with a Hartree-type nonlinearity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2009.03251v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: (Due to the limit on the number of characters for an abstract set by arXiv, the full abstract can not be displayed here. See the abstract in the paper.) Lebowitz, Rose, and Speer (1988) initiated the study of focusing Gibbs measures, which was continued by Brydges and Slade (1996), Bourgain (1997, 1999), and Carlen, Fr\"ohlich, and Lebowitz (2016) among others. In this paper, we complete the program on the (non-)construction of the focusing Hartree Gibbs measures in the three-dimensional setting. More precisely, we study a focusing $\Phi^4_3$-model with a Hartree-type nonlinearity, where the potential for the Hartree nonlinearity is given by the Bessel potential of order $\beta$. We first construct the focusing Hartree $\Phi^4_3$-measure for $\beta &gt; 2$, while we prove its non-normalizability for $\beta &lt; 2$. Furthermore, we establish the following phase transition at the critical value $\beta = 2$: normalizability in the weakly nonlinear regime and non-normalizability in the strongly nonlinear regime. We then study the canonical stochastic quantization of the focusing Hartree $\Phi^4_3$-measure, namely, the three-dimensional stochastic damped nonlinear wave equation (SdNLW) with a cubic nonlinearity of Hartree-type, forced by an additive space-time white noise, and prove almost sure global well-posedness and invariance of the focusing Hartree $\Phi^4_3$-measure for $\beta &gt; 2$ (and $\beta = 2$ in the weakly nonlinear regime). In view of the non-normalizability result, our almost sure global well-posedness result is sharp. In Appendix, we also discuss the (parabolic) stochastic quantization for the focusing Hartree $\Phi^4_3$-measure.
  We also construct the defocusing Hartree $\Phi^4_3$-measure for $\beta &gt; 0$.</description>

      <title>Stochastic quantization of the $\Phi^3_3$-model</title>

Abstract: (Due to the limit on the number of characters for an abstract set by arXiv, the full abstract can not be displayed here. See the abstract in the paper.) We study the construction of the $\Phi^3_3$-measure and complete the program on the (non-)construction of the focusing Gibbs measures, initiated by Lebowitz, Rose, and Speer (1988). This problem turns out to be critical, exhibiting the following phase transition. In the weakly nonlinear regime, we prove normalizability of the $\Phi^3_3$-measure and show that it is singular with respect to the massive Gaussian free field. Moreover, we show that there exists a shifted measure with respect to which the $\Phi^3_3$-measure is absolutely continuous. In the strongly nonlinear regime, by further developing the machinery introduced by the authors (2020), we establish non-normalizability of the $\Phi^3_3$-measure. Due to the singularity of the $\Phi^3_3$-measure with respect to the massive Gaussian free field, this non-normalizability part poses a particular challenge as compared to our previous works. In order to overcome this issue, we first construct a $\sigma$-finite version of the $\Phi^3_3$-measure and show that this measure is not normalizable. Furthermore, we prove that the truncated $\Phi^3_3$-measures have no weak limit in a natural space, even up to a subsequence.
  We also study the dynamical problem. By adapting the paracontrolled approach, in particular from the works by Gubinelli, Koch, and the first author (2018) and by the authors (2020), we prove almost sure global well-posedness of the hyperbolic $\Phi^3_3$-model and invariance of the Gibbs measure in the weakly nonlinear regime. In the globalization part, we introduce a new, conceptually simple and straightforward approach, where we directly work with the (truncated) Gibbs measure, using the variational formula and ideas from theory of optimal transport.</description>

      <title>Extreme singular values of inhomogeneous sparse random rectangular matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.12271v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a unified approach to bounding the largest and smallest singular values of an inhomogeneous random rectangular matrix, based on the non-backtracking operator and the Ihara-Bass formula for general random Hermitian matrices with a bipartite block structure. We obtain probabilistic upper (respectively, lower) bounds for the largest (respectively, smallest) singular values of a large rectangular random matrix $X$. These bounds are given in terms of the maximal and minimal $\ell_2$-norms of the rows and columns of the variance profile of $X$. The proofs involve finding probabilistic upper bounds on the spectral radius of an associated non-backtracking matrix $B$. The two-sided bounds can be applied to the centered adjacency matrix of sparse inhomogeneous Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi bipartite graphs for a wide range of sparsity, down to criticality. In particular, for Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi bipartite graphs $G(n,m,p)$ with $p=\omega(\log n)/n$, and $m/n\to y \in (0,1)$, our sharp bounds imply that there are no outliers outside the support of the Mar\v{c}enko-Pastur law almost surely. This result extends the Bai-Yin theorem to sparse rectangular random matrices.</description>

Abstract: We prove well-posedness results for backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs) and reflected BSDEs with an optional obstacle process in the case of appropriately weighted $\mathbb{L}^2$-data when the generator is integrated with respect to a possibly purely discontinuous process. This leads to a unified treatment of discrete-time and continuous-time (reflected) BSDEs. We compare our well-posedness results with the current literature and highlight that our results are sharp and cannot be improved within the framework presented here. Finally, we provide sufficient conditions for a comparison principle.</description>

Abstract: We define the Schwarzian Field Theory as a finite measure on $\mathrm{Diff}^1(\mathbb{T})/\mathrm{PSL}(2,\mathbb{R})$ and compute its generalised partition functions exactly using methods of stochastic analysis. Our results rigorously implement an approach by Belokurov--Shavgulidze. The Schwarzian Field Theory has attracted recent attention due to its role in the analysis of the Sachdev--Ye--Kitaev model and as the proposed holographic dual to Jackiw--Teitelboim gravity. In two companion papers by Losev, the predicted exact cross-ratio correlation functions for non-crossing Wilson lines and the large deviations are derived from the probability measure.</description>

Abstract: We prove a large deviations principle for the probabilistic Schwarzian Field Theory at low temperatures. We demonstrate that the good rate function is equal to the action of the Schwarzian Field Theory, and we find its minimisers. In addition, we define an analogue of the H\"{o}lder condition on the functional space $\mathrm{Diff}^1(\mathbb{T})/\mathrm{PSL}(2,\mathbb{R})$ in terms of cross-ratio observables, characterise them in terms of the usual H\"{o}lder property on the space of continuous functions, and deduce the corresponding compact embedding theorem. We also show that the Schwarzian measure concentrates on functions satisfying the defined condition.</description>

Abstract: We study correlation functions of the probabilistic Schwarzian Field Theory. We compute cross-ratio correlation functions exactly in the case when the corresponding Wilson lines do not intersect, confirming predictions made in the physics literature via limit of the conformal bootstrap and the DOZZ formula. Moreover, we prove that these correlation functions characterise the measure uniquely. We use them to define and compute the stress-energy tensor correlation functions, and demonstrate, in particular, that these agree with the results obtained earlier by formal differentiation of the partition function.</description>

      <title>Convex combinations of random variables stochastically dominate the parent for a new class of heavy-tailed distributions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14926v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stochastic dominance of a random variable by a convex combination of its independent copies has recently been shown to hold within the relatively narrow class of distributions with concave odds function, and later extended to broader families of distributions. A simple consequence of this surprising result is that the sample mean can be stochastically larger than the underlying random variable. We show that a key property for this stochastic dominance result to hold is the subadditivity of the cumulative distribution function of the reciprocal of the random variable of interest, referred to as the inverted distribution. By studying relations and inclusions between the different classes for which the stochastic dominance was proved to hold, we show that our new class can significantly enlarge the applicability of the result, providing a relatively mild sufficient condition.</description>

Abstract: (Due to the limit on the number of characters for an abstract set by arXiv, the full abstract can not be displayed here. See the abstract in the paper.) We study convergence problems for the intermediate long wave equation (ILW), with the depth parameter $\delta &gt; 0$, in the deep-water limit ($\delta \to \infty$) and the shallow-water limit ($\delta \to 0$) from a statistical point of view. In particular, we establish convergence of invariant Gibbs dynamics for ILW in both the deep-water and shallow-water limits. For this purpose, we first construct the Gibbs measures for ILW, $0 &lt; \delta &lt; \infty$. As they are supported on distributions, a renormalization is required. With the Wick renormalization, we carry out the construction of the Gibbs measures for ILW. We then prove that the Gibbs measures for ILW converge in total variation to that for the Benjamin-Ono equation (BO) in the deep-water limit. In the shallow-water regime, after applying a scaling transformation, we prove that, as $\delta \to 0$, the Gibbs measures for the scaled ILW converge weakly to that for the Korteweg-de Vries equation (KdV). We point out that this second result is of particular interest since the Gibbs measures for the scaled ILW and KdV are mutually singular (whereas the Gibbs measures for ILW and BO are equivalent).
  We also discuss convergence of the associated dynamical problem.
  Lastly, we point out that our results also apply to the generalized ILW equation in the defocusing case, converging to the generalized BO in the deep-water limit and to the generalized KdV in the shallow-water limit. In the non-defocusing case, however, our results can not be extended to a nonlinearity with a higher power due to the non-normalizability of the corresponding Gibbs measures.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic $P(\Phi)_2$-model on the plane</title>

Abstract: We study the hyperbolic $\Phi^{k+1}_2$-model on the plane. By establishing coming down from infinity for the associated stochastic nonlinear heat equation (SNLH) on the plane, we first construct a $\Phi^{k+1}_2$-measure on the plane as a limit of the $\Phi^{k+1}_2$-measures on large tori. We then study the canonical stochastic quantization of the $\Phi^{k+1}_2$-measure on the plane thus constructed, namely, we study the defocusing stochastic damped nonlinear wave equation forced by an additive space-time white noise (= the hyperbolic $\Phi^{k+1}_2$-model) on the plane. In particular, by taking a limit of the invariant Gibbs dynamics on large tori constructed by the first two authors with Gubinelli and Koch (2021), we construct invariant Gibbs dynamics for the hyperbolic $\Phi^{k+1}_2$-model on the plane. Our main strategy is to develop further the ideas from a recent work on the hyperbolic $\Phi^3_3$-model on the three-dimensional torus by the first two authors and Okamoto (2021), and to study convergence of the so-called enhanced Gibbs measures, for which coming down from infinity for the associated SNLH with positive regularity plays a crucial role. By combining wave and heat analysis together with ideas from optimal transport theory, we then conclude global well-posedness of the hyperbolic $\Phi^{k+1}_2$-model on the plane and invariance of the associated Gibbs measure. As a byproduct of our argument, we also obtain invariance of the limiting $\Phi^{k+1}_2$-measure on the plane under the dynamics of the parabolic $\Phi^{k+1}_2$-model.</description>

      <title>Alternating minimization algorithm with initialization analysis for r-local and k-sparse unlabeled sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.07621v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unlabeled sensing is a linear inverse problem with permuted measurements. We propose an alternating minimization (AltMin) algorithm with a suitable initialization for two widely considered permutation models: partially shuffled/$k$-sparse permutations and $r$-local/block diagonal permutations. Key to the performance of the AltMin algorithm is the initialization. For the exact unlabeled sensing problem, assuming either a Gaussian measurement matrix or a sub-Gaussian signal, we bound the initialization error in terms of the number of blocks $s$ and the number of shuffles $k$. Experimental results show that our algorithm is fast, applicable to both permutation models, and robust to choice of measurement matrix. We also test our algorithm on several real datasets for the linked linear regression problem and show superior performance compared to baseline methods.</description>

      <title>Injectivity of ReLU networks: perspectives from statistical physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.14112v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When can the input of a ReLU neural network be inferred from its output? In other words, when is the network injective? We consider a single layer, $x \mapsto \mathrm{ReLU}(Wx)$, with a random Gaussian $m \times n$ matrix $W$, in a high-dimensional setting where $n, m \to \infty$. Recent work connects this problem to spherical integral geometry giving rise to a conjectured sharp injectivity threshold for $\alpha = \frac{m}{n}$ by studying the expected Euler characteristic of a certain random set. We adopt a different perspective and show that injectivity is equivalent to a property of the ground state of the spherical perceptron, an important spin glass model in statistical physics. By leveraging the (non-rigorous) replica symmetry-breaking theory, we derive analytical equations for the threshold whose solution is at odds with that from the Euler characteristic. Furthermore, we use Gordon's min--max theorem to prove that a replica-symmetric upper bound refutes the Euler characteristic prediction. Along the way we aim to give a tutorial-style introduction to key ideas from statistical physics in an effort to make the exposition accessible to a broad audience. Our analysis establishes a connection between spin glasses and integral geometry but leaves open the problem of explaining the discrepancies.</description>

      <title>Schr\"odinger's control and estimation paradigm with spatio-temporal distributions on graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05679v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The problem of reconciling a prior probability law on paths with data was introduced by E. Schr\"odinger in 1931/32. It represents an early formulation of a maximum likelihood problem. This specific formulation can also be seen as the control problem to modify the law of a diffusion process so as to match specifications on marginal distributions at given times. Thereby, in recent years, this so-called Schr\"odinger's bridge problem has been at the center of the uncertainty control development. However, an understudied facet of this program has been to address uncertainty in space (state) and time, modeling the effect of tasks being completed contingent on meeting a certain condition at some random time instead of imposing specifications at fixed times. The present work is a study to extend Schr\"odinger's paradigm on such an issue, and herein, it is tackled in the context of random walks on directed graphs. Specifically, we study the case where one marginal is the initial probability distribution on a Markov chain, while others are marginals of stopping (first-arrival) times at absorbing states, signifying completion of tasks. We show when the prior law on paths is Markov, a Markov policy is once again optimal to satisfy those marginal constraints with respect to a likelihood cost following Schr\"odinger's dictum. Based on this, we present the mathematical formulation involving a Sinkhorn-type iteration to construct the optimal probability law on paths matching the spatio-temporal marginals.</description>

      <title>Slow Mixing of Quantum Gibbs Samplers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04300v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Preparing thermal (Gibbs) states is a common task in physics and computer science. Recent algorithms mimic cooling via system-bath coupling, where the cost is determined by mixing time, akin to classical Metropolis-like algorithms. However, few methods exist to demonstrate slow mixing in quantum systems, unlike the well-established classical tools for systems like the Ising model and constraint satisfaction problems. We present a quantum generalization of these tools through a generic bottleneck lemma that implies slow mixing in quantum systems. This lemma focuses on quantum measures of distance, analogous to the classical Hamming distance but rooted in uniquely quantum principles and quantified either through Bohr spectrum jumps or operator locality.
  Using our bottleneck lemma, we establish unconditional lower bounds on the mixing times of Gibbs samplers for several families of Hamiltonians at low temperatures. For classical Hamiltonians with mixing time lower bounds $T_\mathrm{mix} = \exp[\Omega(n^\alpha)]$, we prove that quantum Gibbs samplers also have $T_\mathrm{mix} = \exp[\Omega(n^\alpha)]$. This applies to models like random $K$-SAT instances and spin glasses. For stabilizer Hamiltonians, we provide a concise proof of exponential lower bounds $T_\mathrm{mix} = \exp[\Omega(n)]$ on mixing times of good $n$-qubit stabilizer codes at low constant temperature. Finally, we consider constant-degree classical Hamiltonians and show how to lift classical slow mixing results in the presence of a transverse field using Poisson Feynman-Kac techniques. We show generic results for models with linear free energy barriers, and we demonstrate that our techniques extend to models with sublinear free energy barriers by proving $T_\mathrm{mix} = \exp[n^{1/2-o(1)}]$ for the ferromagnetic 2D transverse field Ising model.</description>
