      <title>Robustness of Boolean networks to update modes: an application to hereditary angioedema</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many familial diseases are caused by genetic accidents, which affect both the genome and its epigenetic environment, expressed as an interaction graph between the genes as that involved in one familial disease we shall study, the hereditary angioedema. The update of the gene states at the vertices of this graph (1 if a gene is activated, 0 if it is inhibited) can be done in multiple ways, well studied over the last two decades: parallel, sequential, block-sequential, block-parallel, random, etc. We will study a particular graph, related to the familial disease proposed as an example, which has subgraphs which activate in an intricate manner (\emph{i.e.}, in an alternating block-parallel mode, with one core constantly updated and two complementary subsets of genes alternating their updating), of which we will study the structural aspects, robust or unstable, in relation to some classical periodic update modes.</description>

      <title>$4K_1$-free graph with the cop number $3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The game of cops and robber is a two-player turn-based game played on a graph where the cops try to capture the robber. The cop number of a graph $G$, denoted by $c(G)$ is the minimum number of cops required to capture the robber. For a given class of graphs ${\cal F}$, let $c({\cal F}):=\sup\{c(F)|F\in {\cal F}\}$, and let Forb$({\cal F})$ denote the class of ${\cal F}$-free graphs. We show that the complement of the Shrikhande graph is $(4K_1,C_{\ell}$)-free for any $\ell \geq 6$ and has the cop number~$3$. This provides a counterexample for the conjecture proposed by Sivaraman (arxiv, 2019) which states that if $G$ is $C_{\ell}$-free for all $\ell\ge 6$, then $c(G)\le 2$. This also gives a negative answer to the question posed by Turcotte (Discrete Math. 345:112660 (2022)) 112660. to check whether $c($Forb$(pK_1))=p-2$. Turcotte also posed the question to check whether $c($Forb$(pK_1+K_2))\leq p+1$, for $p\geq 3$. We prove that this result indeed holds. We also generalize this result for Forb$(pK_1+qK_2)$. Motivated by the results of Baird et al. (Contrib. Discrete Math. 9:70--84 (2014)) and Turcotte and Yvon (Discrete Appl. Math. 301:74--98 (2021)), we define the upper threshold degree and lower threshold degree for a particular class of graphs and show some computational advantage to find the cop number using these.</description>

      <title>Creation of fixed points in block-parallel Boolean automata networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of discrete dynamical systems and their applications, fixed points often have a clear interpretation. This is indeed a central topic of gene regulatory mechanisms modeled by Boolean automata networks (BANs), where a xollection of Boolean entities (the automata) update their state depending on the states of others. Fixed points represent phenotypes such as differentiated cell types. The interaction graph of a BAN captures the architecture of dependencies among its automata. A first seminal result is that cycles of interactions (so called feedbacks) are the engines of dynamical complexity. A second seminal result is that fixed points are invariant under block-sequential update schedules, which update the automata following an ordered partition of the set of automata. In this article we study the ability of block-parallel update schedules (dual to the latter) to break this fixed point invariance property, with a focus on the simplest feedback mechanism: the canonical positive cycle. We quantify numerically the creation of new fixed points, and provide families of block-parallel update schedules generating exponentially many fixed points on this elementary structure of interaction.</description>

      <title>Families of tractable problems with respect to vertex-interval-membership width and its generalisations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temporal graphs are graphs whose edges are labelled with times at which they are active. Their time-sensitivity provides a useful model of real networks, but renders many problems studied on temporal graphs more computationally complex than their static counterparts. To contend with this, there has been recent work devising parameters for which temporal problems become tractable. One such parameter is vertex-interval-membership width. Broadly, this gives a bound on the number of vertices we need to keep track of at any time in order to solve any of a family of problems. Our contributions are two-fold. Firstly, we introduce a new parameter, tree-interval-membership-width, that generalises both vertex-interval-membership-width and several existing generalisations. Secondly, we provide meta-algorithms for both parameters which can be used to prove fixed-parameter-tractability for large families of problems, bypassing the need to give involved dynamic programming arguments for every problem. We apply these algorithms to temporal versions of Hamiltonian path, matching, edge deletion to limit maximum reachability, and firefighting.</description>

      <title>Strong odd colorings in graph classes of bounded expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that for every $d\in \mathbb{N}$ and a graph class of bounded expansion $\mathscr{C}$, there exists some $c\in \mathbb{N}$ so that every graph from $\mathscr{C}$ admits a proper coloring with at most $c$ colors satisfying the following condition: in every ball of radius $d$, every color appears either zero times or an odd number of times. For $d=1$, this provides a positive answer to a question raised by Goetze, Klute, Knauer, Parada, Pe\~na, and Ueckerdt [ArXiv 2505.02736] about the boundedness of the strong odd chromatic number in graph classes of bounded expansion. The key technical ingredient towards the result is a proof that the strong odd coloring number of a sets system can be bounded in terms of its semi-ladder index, 2VC dimension, and the maximum subchromatic number among induced subsystems.</description>

      <title>Minimum blocking sets for families of partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A $3$-partition of an $n$-element set $V$ is a triple of pairwise disjoint nonempty subsets $X,Y,Z$ such that $V=X\cup Y\cup Z$. We determine the minimum size $\varphi_3(n)$ of a set $\mathcal{E}$ of triples such that for every 3-partition $X,Y,Z$ of the set $\{1,\dots,n\}$, there is some $\{x,y,z\}\in \mathcal{E}$ with $x\in X$, $y\in Y$, and $z\in Z$. In particular, $$\varphi_3(n)=\left\lceil{\frac{n(n-2)}{3}}\right\rceil.$$ For $d&gt;3$, one may define an analogous number $\varphi_d(n)$. We determine the order of magnitude of $\varphi_d(n)$, and prove the following upper and lower bounds, for $d&gt;3$: $$\frac{2 n^{d-1}}{d!} -o(n^{d-1}) \leq \varphi_d(n) \leq \frac{0.86}{(d-1)!}n^{d-1}+o(n^{d-1}).$$</description>

      <title>First-order transducibility among classes of sparse graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove several negative results about first-order transducibility for classes of sparse graphs:
  - for every $t \in \mathbb{N}$, the class of graphs of treewidth at most $t+1$ is not transducible from the class of graphs of treewidth at most $t$;
  - for every $t \in \mathbb{N}$, the class of graphs with Hadwiger number at most $t+2$ is not transducible from the class of graphs with Hadwiger number at most $t$; and
  - the class of graphs of treewidth at most $4$ is not transducible from the class of planar graphs.
  These results are obtained by combining the known upper and lower bounds on the weak coloring numbers of the considered graph classes with the following two new observations:
  - If a weakly sparse graph class $\mathscr D$ is transducible from a class $\mathscr C$ of bounded expansion, then for some $k \in \mathbb{N}$, every graph $G \in \mathscr D$ is a $k$-congested depth-$k$ minor of a graph $H^\circ$ obtained from some $H\in \mathscr C$ by adding a universal vertex.
  - The operations of adding a universal vertex and of taking $k$-congested depth-$k$ minors, for a fixed $k$, preserve the degree of the distance-$d$ weak coloring number of a graph class, understood as a polynomial in $d$.</description>

      <title>Two-person Positive Shortest Path Games Have Nash Equilibria in Pure Stationary Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09257v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that every finite two-person shortest path game, where the local cost of every move is positive for each player, has a Nash equilibrium (NE) in pure stationary strategies, which can be computed in polynomial time. We also extend the existence result to infinite graphs with finite out-degrees. Moreover, our proof gives that a terminal NE (in which the play is a path from the initial position to a terminal) exists provided at least one of the two players can guarantee reaching a terminal. If none of the players can do it, in other words, if each of the two players has a strategy that separates all terminals from the initial position $s$, then, obviously, a cyclic NE exists, although its cost is infinite for both players, since we restrict ourselves to positive games. We conjecture that a terminal NE exists too, provided there exists a directed path from $s$ to a terminal. However, this is open.
  We extend our result to short paths interdiction games, where at each vertex, we allow one player to block some of the arcs and the other player to choose one of the non-blocked arcs. Assuming that blocking sets are chosen from an independence system given by an oracle, we give an algorithm for computing a NE in time $O(|E|(\log|V|+\tau))$, where $V$ is the set of vertices, $E$ is the set of arcs, and $\tau$ is the maximum time taken by the oracle on any input.</description>

      <title>On near optimal colorable graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13932v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A class of graphs $\cal G$ is said to be \emph{near optimal colorable} if there exists a constant $c\in \mathbb{N}$ such that every graph $G\in \cal G$ satisfies $\chi(G) \leq \max\{c, \omega(G)\}$, where $\chi(G)$ and $\omega(G)$ respectively denote the chromatic number and clique number of $G$. The class of near optimal colorable graphs is an important subclass of the class of $\chi$-bounded graphs which is well-studied in the literature. In this paper, we show that the class of ($F, K_4-e$)-free graphs is near optimal colorable, where $F\in \{P_1+2P_2,2P_1+P_3,3P_1+P_2\}$. Furthermore, using these results with some earlier known results, we also provide an alternate proof to the fact that the \textsc{Chromatic Number} problem for the class of ($F, K_4-e$)-free graphs is solvable in polynomial time, where $F\in \{P_1+2P_2,2P_1+P_3,3P_1+P_2\}$.</description>

      <title>Sparsest cut and eigenvalue multiplicities on low degree Abelian Cayley graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17115v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Whether or not the Sparsest Cut problem admits an efficient $O(1)$-approximation algorithm is a fundamental algorithmic question with connections to geometry and the Unique Games Conjecture. Revisiting spectral algorithms for Sparsest Cut, we present a novel, simple algorithm that combines eigenspace enumeration with a new algorithm for the Cut Improvement problem. The runtime of our algorithm is parametrized by a quantity that we call the cut dimension $\text{CD}_\varepsilon(G)$: the smallest $k$ such that the subspace spanned by the first $k$ Laplacian eigenvectors contains all but $\varepsilon$ fraction of a sparsest cut. Our algorithm matches the guarantees of prior methods based on the threshold-rank paradigm, while also extending beyond them. To illustrate this, we study its performance on low degree Cayley graphs over Abelian groups -- canonical examples of graphs with poor expansion properties. We prove that low degree Abelian Cayley graphs have small cut dimension, yielding an algorithm that computes a $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation to the uniform Sparsest Cut of a degree-$d$ Cayley graph over an Abelian group of size $n$ in time $n^{O(1)}\cdot\exp(d/\varepsilon)^{O(d)}$. Along the way to bounding the cut dimension of Abelian Cayley graphs, we analyze their sparse cuts and spectra, proving that the collection of $O(1)$-approximate sparsest cuts has an $\varepsilon$-net of size $\exp(d/\varepsilon)^{O(d)}$ and that the multiplicity of $\lambda_2$ is bounded by $2^{O(d)}$. The latter bound is tight and improves on a previous bound of $2^{O(d^2)}$ by Lee and Makarychev.</description>

      <title>Effective Sampling for Robot Motion Planning Through the Lens of Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04908v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sampling-based methods for motion planning, which capture the structure of the robot's free space via (typically random) sampling, have gained popularity due to their scalability, simplicity, and for offering global guarantees, such as probabilistic completeness and asymptotic optimality. Unfortunately, the practicality of those guarantees remains limited as they do not provide insights into the behavior of motion planners for a finite number of samples (i.e., a finite running time). In this work, we harness lattice theory and the concept of $(\delta,\epsilon)$-completeness by Tsao et al. (2020) to construct deterministic sample sets that endow their planners with strong finite-time guarantees while minimizing running time. In particular, we introduce a highly-efficient deterministic sampling approach based on the $A_d^*$ lattice, which is the best-known geometric covering in dimensions $\leq 21$. Using our new sampling approach, we obtain at least an order-of-magnitude speedup over existing deterministic and uniform random sampling methods for complex motion-planning problems. Overall, our work provides deep mathematical insights while advancing the practical applicability of sampling-based motion planning.</description>

      <title>Counterexamples to two conjectures on Venn diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18554v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1984, Winkler conjectured that every simple Venn diagram with $n$ curves can be extended to a simple Venn diagram with $n+1$ curves. His conjecture is equivalent to the statement that the dual graph of any simple Venn diagram has a Hamilton cycle. In this work, we construct counterexamples to Winkler's conjecture for all $n\geq 6$. As part of this proof, we computed all 3.430.404 simple Venn diagrams with $n=6$ curves (even their number was not previously known), among which we found 72 counterexamples. While working on Winkler's conjecture, Pruesse and Ruskey considered the (multi)graph whose vertices are the crossings of the curves of a Venn diagram and curve segments between consecutive crossings form the edges. They proved that this graph has a Hamilton cycle for every simple Venn diagram with $n$ curves, and conjectured that this also holds for non-simple diagrams. We construct counterexamples to this conjecture for all $n\geq 4$.</description>

      <title>A composition theory for upward planar orders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13865v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An upward planar order on an acyclic directed graph $G$ is a special linear extension of the edge poset of $G$ that satisfies the nesting condition. This order was introduced to combinatorially characterize upward plane graphs and progressive plane graphs (commonly known as plane string diagrams). In this paper, motivated by the theory of graphical calculus for monoidal categories, we establish a composition theory for upward planar orders. The main result is that the composition of upward planar orders is an upward planar order. This theory provides a practical method to calculate the upward planar order of a progressive plane graph or an upward plane graph.</description>
