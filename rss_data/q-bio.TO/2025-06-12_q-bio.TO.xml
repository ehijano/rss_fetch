      <title>Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL): Immunotherapy and Cell Therapy approaches</title>

Abstract: This article focuses on current and emerging therapeutics for CADASIL (Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy). CADASIL is an inherited vascular disease that impairs blood flow in the small cerebral vessels of the brain, leading to strokes and other neurological deficits. The disease is caused by a mutation in the NOTCH3 gene located on chromosome 19. NOTCH3 encodes a transmembrane receptor expressed on vascular smooth muscle cells. In CADASIL, mutations in the NOTCH3 gene lead to the accumulation and deposition of the receptor, affecting the number of cysteine residues in its extracellular domain. These mutations result in the loss or gain of a cysteine residue within the epidermal growth factor-like repeat (EGFr) domains of the NOTCH protein. Beyond traditional symptomatic treatments for stroke, this work highlights advances in disease modifying approaches including gene editing, cell therapies, and immune-based interventions aimed at altering the course of CADASIL. It also examines ongoing clinical trials and recent patents related to these novel strategies. In addition to summarizing diagnostic methods and molecular mechanisms, the article emphasizes the translational potential of current research and the experimental models driving therapeutic development. The goal is to offer a comprehensive overview of CADASIL and emerging interventions that hold promise for improving long-term outcomes.</description>

      <title>A Cytology Dataset for Early Detection of Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Oral squamous cell carcinoma OSCC is a major global health burden, particularly in several regions across Asia, Africa, and South America, where it accounts for a significant proportion of cancer cases. Early detection dramatically improves outcomes, with stage I cancers achieving up to 90 percent survival. However, traditional diagnosis based on histopathology has limited accessibility in low-resource settings because it is invasive, resource-intensive, and reliant on expert pathologists. On the other hand, oral cytology of brush biopsy offers a minimally invasive and lower cost alternative, provided that the remaining challenges, inter observer variability and unavailability of expert pathologists can be addressed using artificial intelligence. Development and validation of robust AI solutions requires access to large, labeled, and multi-source datasets to train high capacity models that generalize across domain shifts. We introduce the first large and multicenter oral cytology dataset, comprising annotated slides stained with Papanicolaou(PAP) and May-Grunwald-Giemsa(MGG) protocols, collected from ten tertiary medical centers in India. The dataset is labeled and annotated by expert pathologists for cellular anomaly classification and detection, is designed to advance AI driven diagnostic methods. By filling the gap in publicly available oral cytology datasets, this resource aims to enhance automated detection, reduce diagnostic errors, and improve early OSCC diagnosis in resource-constrained settings, ultimately contributing to reduced mortality and better patient outcomes worldwide.</description>
