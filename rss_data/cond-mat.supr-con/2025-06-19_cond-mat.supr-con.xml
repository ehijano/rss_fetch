      <title>Interplay of Zeeman field, Rashba spin-orbit interaction, and superconductivity: spin susceptibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a self-consistent theory to calculate the static and uniform spin susceptibility in superconductors under simultaneous Zeeman magnetic fields and Rashba-type spin-orbit coupling (SOC). Employing a single-band Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonian, we solve the gap equation for both conventional $s$-wave spin-singlet and six representative $p$-wave spin-triplet pairing states, categorized into opposite-spin-pairing (OSP) and equal-spin-pairing (ESP) classes. The Kubo formula, decomposed into intra- and interband particle-hole and particle-particle channels, provides two key constraints: at zero temperature, only particle-particle terms contribute, while at the critical temperature $T_c$, only particle-hole terms remain, ensuring $\chi(T_c^{-}) = \chi_N$ for continuous phase transitions. For $s$-wave pairing, a Zeeman field reduces $T_c$, whereas Rashba SOC preserves $T_c$ but yields a residual zero temperature spin susceptibility $\chi(0)$ which approaches $2\chi_N/3$ in the strong SOC limit; combined fields create a Bogoliubov Fermi surface, resulting in a kink in $\chi(0)$. In contrast, $p$-wave states exhibit strong anisotropy: OSP states mimic spin-singlet pairing behavior for parallel Zeeman fields and ESP for transverse ones, while ESP states show the opposite, with Rashba SOC potentially changing the quasiparticle nodal structure, lowering $T_c$, or causing $\chi_{zz}(0)$ divergences. This framework offers quantitative benchmarks for Knight-shift experiments in non-centrosymmetric superconductors like A$_2$Cr$_3$As$_3$ (A = Na, K, Rb, and Cs), enabling diagnostics to disentangle pairing symmetry, SOC strength, and Zeeman effects.</description>

      <title>Strongly coupled interface ferroelectricity and interface superconductivity in LAO/KTO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interfaces can differ from their parent compounds in terms of charge, spin, and orbital orders and are fertile ground for emergent phenomena, strongly correlated physics, and device applications. Here, we discover that ferroelectric order resides at the interface of two oxides, LaAlO3/KTaO3(111) (LAO/KTO), where two seemingly mutually exclusive orders-ferroelectricity and superconductivity-coexist. Moreover, manipulating ferroelectricity can change the interfacial conductivity by more than 1000 times, simultaneously causing superconductivity to diminish and reappear due to the coupling between these phenomena. The ferroelectricity is confirmed by scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), second harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy, and piezoelectric force microscopy (PFM). STEM reveals K ions are displaced relative to Ta ions, with the help of oxygen vacancies at the LAO/KTO interface. The resultant electric polarization is locally switchable by applying a voltage between the PFM tip and the LAO film. The ferroelectric hysteresis correlates with hysteresis change in interfacial conductivity and the superconducting transition temperature (Tc). The loss and reentrance of superconductivity are accounted for by orders of magnitude change in the Hall mobility induced by the polarization switching. These findings open the door to ferroelectric superconductivity with broken inversion symmetry and non-volatile modulation of superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Strain-tuning for superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent discovery of high-transition temperature ($T_\mathrm{c}$) superconductivity in pressurized La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ bulk crystals has attracted keen attention due to its characteristic energy diagram of $e_{g}$ orbitals, containing nearly half-filled $d_{3z^2 - r^2}$ and quarter-filled $d_{x^2 - y^2}$ orbitals. This finding provides valuable insights into the orbital contributions and interlayer interactions in double NiO$_{6}$ octahedra, offering opportunities to control the electronic structure via ligand field variations. Here, we demonstrate strain-tuning of $T_\mathrm{c}$ over a range of 50 K in La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ films grown on different oxide substrates under 20 GPa. As the $c/a$ ratio increases, the onset $T_\mathrm{c}$ systematically rises from 10 K in the tensile-strained film on SrTiO$_{3}$ to a maximum of about 60 K in the compressively strained film on LaAlO$_{3}$. These systematic variations suggest that strain engineering is a promising strategy for expanding superconductivity in bilayer nickelates by tuning the orbital energy landscape toward high-$T_\mathrm{c}$ superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Supercurrent modulation in InSb nanoflag-based Josephson junctions by scanning gate microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: InSb nanoflags represent an interesting platform for quantum transport and have recently been exploited in the study of hybrid planar Josephson junctions. Due to the uncovered semiconductor surface, they are also good candidates for surface probe techniques. Here, we report the first Scanning Gate Microscopy (SGM) experiments on Nb-contacted InSb nanoflag-based Josephson junctions. In the normal state, sizable conductance modulation via the charged tip of the SGM is recorded. In the superconducting state, we report the first application of Scanning Gate Microscopy to superconducting weak links, demonstrating the possibility of manipulating the supercurrent flow across a semiconductor-superconductor heterostructure at a local level. The experimental findings are consistent with theoretical predictions and establish a new way of investigating the behavior of superconducting weak links, towards the local imaging of supercurrent flow.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Josephson coupling of d-vectors arising from interplay with frustrated spin textures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a Cooper pair analogue of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya's anisotropic coupling for $d$-vectors in an inhomogeneous unconventional superconductor, which can arise when itinerant electrons couple to a local exchange field of frustrated spin moments. Using perturbative Green's function methods, we examine an $s$-$d$ model on a geometrically frustrated lattice with noncollinear spin texture that breaks time-reversal and parity symmetries, leading to spin-triplet pairing correlations. The effective Josephson tunneling in the presence of such an exchange field leads to an anisotropic Josephson coupling between $d$-vectors, which prefers a spatially inhomogeneous pairing order. Furthermore, we discuss anomalous vortices arising from the spatially inhomogeneous $d$-vector in the absence of a magnetic field for nonunitary triplet pairing order. We also propose a Josephson diode effect in which the diode efficiency is proportional to the spin chirality of the local exchange field. Our results can help understand the experiments in superconducting proximitized Mn$_3$Ge and in 4Hb-TaS$_2$.</description>

      <title>Theory of universal Planckian metal in t-J model: application for high-Tc cuprate superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mysterious quantum-critical Planckian bad metal phase with perfect T-linear resistivity persisting beyond the quasi-particle limit and universal T-linear scattering rate has been observed in various high-Tc cuprate superconductors. Here, we develop a realistic theoretical approach to this phase in an analytically solvable large-N multi-channel Kondo lattice model, derived from a heavy-fermion formulated conventionaL t-J model, known for qualitatively describing cuprates. This phase is originated from critical charge Kondo fluctuations where disordered local bosonic charge fluctuations couple to spinon and heavy conduction-electron Fermi surfaces near a charge-Kondo-breakdown local quantum critical point associated with pseudogap-to-Fermi liquid transition. Our results show excellent agreement with experiments and offer broad implications for other unconventional superconductors.</description>

      <title>The interplay of phase fluctuations and nodal quasiparticles: ubiquitous Fermi arcs in two-dimensional d-wave superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.05376v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose that the pseudogap and Fermi arcs can universally emerge due to thermal (static) phase fluctuations in the normal state of 2D nodal superconductors. By considering a minimal phenomenological model with spatially fluctuating superconducting pairings, we theoretically investigate the role of superconducting phase fluctuations in generic 2D superconductors with disorder-average technique. It is shown for nodal d-wave superconductors that phase fluctuations mediate the scattering of d-wave quasiparticles, smearing out the nodal quasiparticle gap and further leading to pseudogap and Fermi arcs. Moreover, the evolution of Fermi arcs is quantitatively described by two emergent characteristic length scales of the system: one is the finite superconducting correlation length $\xi(T)$, and another the nodal BCS coherence length $\xi_\text{BCS}(k)$. To support our theoretical findings, we numerically report the observation of Fermi arcs in a Hubbard-like model, proposed originally by X. Y. Xu and T. Grover in Phys. Rev. Lett. $\textbf{126}$, 217002 (2021), with sign-problem-free determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) calculations. As far as we noticed, it is the first time in a correlated model that Fermi arcs are identified with unbiased simulations. The numerical results for the scattering rate $\Gamma_\text{pf}$ of Cooper pairs exhibit excellent agreements with our theoretical predictions, where $\Gamma_\text{pf}$ is expected to scale linearly with the inverse superconducting correlation length $\xi(T)^{-1}$. This convergence of theory and numerics thereby strongly validates the universal connection between phase fluctuations and Fermi arcs in 2D nodal superconductors.</description>

      <title>Octupolar Weyl Superconductivity from Electron-electron Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06932v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unconventional superconductivity arising from electron-electron interaction can manifest exotic symmetry and topological properties. We investigate the superconducting pairing symmetry problem based on the 3D cubic $O_h$ symmetry with both weak- and strong-coupling approaches. The dominant pairing symmetries belong to the two-dimensional $E_g$ representation at low and intermediate doping levels, and the complex mixing gap function of the $d_{3z^2-r^2}+id_{x^2-y^2}$-type is energetically favored in the ground state. Cooper pairs with such a symmetry do not possess orbital angular momentum (OAM) moments, which is different from other time-reversal symmetry breaking pairings such as $p_x+ip_y$ (e.g $^3$He-A) and $d_{x^2-y^2}+id_{xy}$ under the planar hexagonal symmetry. Instead, they develop the octupolar $O_{xyz}$ component of OAM, which results in 8 nodal points along the body diagonal directions exhibiting an alternating distribution of monopole charges $\pm 1$. This leads to an intriguing 3D Weyl topological SC, which accommodates nontrivial surface states of Majorana arcs. Our results appeal for material realizations and experimental tests in optical lattices.</description>

Abstract: We have investigated the normal and superconducting states of the technologically important compound Nb$_3$Sn using $^{93}$Nb nuclear magnetic resonance. From spin-lattice relaxation we find strong suppression of the zero-temperature superconducting order parameter by magnetic field. Additionally we have identified an anomalously large electron-nuclear exchange interaction from spin-spin relaxation measurements, an order of magnitude beyond that of the nuclear dipolar coupling. This RKKY interaction evolves from normal to superconducting states, becoming essentially Lorentzian in the low temperature limit.</description>

      <title>IsoME: Streamlining High-Precision Eliashberg Calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03559v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces the Julia package IsoME, an easy-to-use yet accurate and robust computational tool designed to calculate superconducting properties. Multiple levels of approximation are supported, ranging from the basic McMillan-Allen-Dynes formula and its machine learning-enhanced variant to Eliashberg theory including static Coulomb interactions derived from $GW$ calculations, offering a fully ab initio approach to determine superconducting properties, such as the critical superconducting temperature ($T_\text{c}$) and the superconducting gap function ($\Delta$). We validate IsoME by benchmarking it against various materials, demonstrating its versatility and performance across different theoretical levels. The findings indicate that the previously held assumption that Eliashberg theory overestimates $T_\text{c}$ is no longer valid when $\mu^*$ is appropriately adjusted to account for the finite Matsubara frequency cutoff. Furthermore, we conclude that the constant density of states (DOS) approximation remains accurate in most cases. By unifying multiple approximation schemes within a single framework, IsoME combines first-principles precision with computational efficiency, enabling seamless integration into high-throughput workflows through its $T_\text{c}$ search mode. This makes IsoME a powerful and reliable tool for advancing superconductivity research.</description>

      <title>BCS-like formula for $T_c$ does not necessarily imply BCS pairing mechanism: the case of magnetically-mediated quantum-critical pairing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07750v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the BCS theory of superconductivity, an instability towards pairing develops at arbitrary weak dimensionless coupling $\lambda$ due to a divergence of logarithmic perturbative series for the pairing susceptibility (Cooper logarithms) at $T_c \sim \omega_0 e^{-1/\lambda}$, where $\omega_0$ is an energy cutoff. On the contrary, in many models of superconductivity out of a non-Fermi liquid, Cooper logarithm is absent and superconductivity emerges only when $\lambda$ exceeds a certain threshold. We argue that there are situations when there is no threshold and at weak coupling the formula for $T_c$ is BCS-like, yet the origin of the pairing instability is fundamentally different from that in the BCS scenario. As an example, we revisit superconductivity in a metal at the onset of $(\pi,\pi)$ spin-density-wave order. Earlier studies of this problem found no threshold and a BCS-like expression for $T_c$ at weak coupling. We argue that, despite this, the pairing is not caused by the Cooper logarithm and in many respects is qualitatively similar to that in non-Fermi liquids.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07241v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The emergence of superconductivity with strong correlation is one of the most attracted issues in condensed-matter physics, as seen in various unconventional superconductors. Here we show a new strongly correlated superconductor Li1-xNbO2 with rich characteristics such as two-dimensional, geometrically frustrated, and triangular NbO2 lattice and correlated flat-band-like electronic states. We revealed the electronic phase diagram by implementing Li-ion electrochemical cells with LiNbO2 epitaxial films. The Li-ion deintercalation increased the hole-doping level in NbO2 layer, along which a band insulator LiNbO2 underwent to a Fermi-liquid (FL) metal and superconductor associated with non-Fermi liquid (NFL) characters. The evolution of the NFL state coincided with the suppression of the Kondo-singlet formation near the superconducting dome, which linked superconductivity with quantum criticality. The obtained phase diagram involves general aspects of strongly correlated superconductors and bridges the gap between various systems.</description>

      <title>Circular-polarization-selective perfect reflection from chiral superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01793v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Integrating mirrors with magnetic components is crucial for constructing chiral optical cavities, which provide tunable platforms for time-reversal-asymmetric light-matter interactions. Here, we introduce single-crystal circular-polarization-selective mirrors based on chiral superconductors, which break time-reversal symmetry themselves, eliminating the need for additional components. We show that a circular-polarization-selective perfect reflection (CSPR) occurs for strong-coupling superconductors in the BCS-BEC crossover regime or beyond if the optical Hall conductivity is significant in the unit of conductivity quantum per unit layer, $e^2/ha_z$, where $a_z$ is the lattice constant along the surface normal. While the optical Hall conductivity in chiral superconductors is typically tiny, we classify three routes to obtain a large value. We demonstrate the significant optical Hall conductivity and the resulting CSPR with two examples: (1) superconductivity in doped quantum Hall insulators and (2) chiral pairing that preserves the Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces in the weak-pairing limit. We also discuss the application of our theory to the recently discovered chiral superconducting phase in rhombohedral graphene. Our theory reveals the potential of these classes of chiral superconductors as promising elements for building high-quality-factor terahertz chiral cavities.</description>
