      <title>Modal reduction principles: a parametric shift to graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph-based frames have been introduced as a logical framework which internalizes an inherent boundary to knowability. They also support the interpretation of lattice-based (modal) logics as hyper-constructive logics of evidential reasoning. Conceptually, the present paper proposes graph-based frames as a formal framework suitable for generalizing Pawlak's rough set theory to a setting in which inherent limits to knowability need to be considered. Technically, the present paper establishes systematic connections between the first-order correspondents of Sahlqvist modal reduction principles on Kripke frames, and on the more general relational environments of graph-based and polarity-based frames. This work is part of a research line aiming at: (a) comparing and inter-relating the various (first-order) conditions corresponding to a given (modal) axiom in different relational semantics (b) recognizing when first-order sentences in the frame-correspondence languages of different relational structures encode the same modal content (c) meaningfully transferring relational properties across different semantic contexts. The present paper develops these results for the graph-based semantics, polarity-based semantics, and all Sahlqvist modal reduction principles. As an application, we study well known modal axioms in rough set theory on graph-based frames and show that, although these axioms correspond to different first-order conditions on graph-based frames, their intuitive meaning is retained.This allows us to introduce the notion of hyperconstructivist approximation spaces as the subclass of graph-based frames defined by the first-order conditions corresponding to the same modal axioms defining classical generalized approximation spaces, and to transfer the properties and the intuitive understanding of different approximation spaces to graph-based frames.</description>

      <title>Modal logic, fundamentally</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-classical generalizations of classical modal logic have been developed in the contexts of constructive mathematics and natural language semantics. In this paper, we discuss a general approach to the semantics of non-classical modal logics via algebraic representation theorems. We begin with complete lattices $L$ equipped with an antitone operation $\neg$ sending $1$ to $0$, a completely multiplicative operation $\Box$, and a completely additive operation $\Diamond$. Such lattice expansions can be represented by means of a set $X$ together with binary relations $\vartriangleleft$, $R$, and $Q$, satisfying some first-order conditions, used to represent $(L,\neg)$, $\Box$, and $\Diamond$, respectively. Indeed, any lattice $L$ equipped with such a $\neg$, a multiplicative $\Box$, and an additive $\Diamond$ embeds into the lattice of propositions of a frame $(X,\vartriangleleft,R,Q)$. Building on our recent study of "fundamental logic", we focus on the case where $\neg$ is dually self-adjoint ($a\leq \neg b$ implies $b\leq\neg a$) and $\Diamond \neg a\leq\neg\Box a$. In this case, the representations can be constrained so that $R=Q$, i.e., we need only add a single relation to $(X,\vartriangleleft)$ to represent both $\Box$ and $\Diamond$. Using these results, we prove that a system of fundamental modal logic is sound and complete with respect to an elementary class of bi-relational structures $(X,\vartriangleleft, R)$.</description>

      <title>The equational theory of the Weihrauch lattice with multiplication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the equational theory of the Weihrauch lattice with multiplication, meaning the collection of equations between terms built from variables, the lattice operations $\sqcup$, $\sqcap$, the product $\times$, and the finite parallelization $(-)^*$ which are true however we substitute Weihrauch degrees for the variables. We provide a combinatorial description of these in terms of a reducibility between finite graphs, and moreover, show that deciding which equations are true in this sense is complete for the third level of the polynomial hierarchy.</description>

      <title>Associative ideals in monoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The article investigates the properties of associative ideals in monoids. Such ideals have some applications in the logic of non-standard sequences and category theory. The relations of these ideals with the verbal structure of words over generators are examined. Finitely and infinitely generated monoids are treated separately.</description>

      <title>Complexity of the Model Checking problem for inquisitive propositional and modal logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to study the complexity of the model checking problem MC for inquisitive propositional logic InqB and for inquisitive modal logic InqM, that is, the problem of deciding whether a given finite structure for the logic satisfies a given formula. In recent years, this problem has been thoroughly investigated for several variations of dependence and teams logics, systems closely related to inquisitive logic. Building upon some ideas presented by Yang, we prove that the model checking problems for InqB and InqM are both AP-complete.</description>

      <title>Every finite-dimensional analytic space is $\sigma$-homogeneous</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: All spaces are assumed to be separable and metrizable. Building on work of van Engelen, Harrington, Michalewski and Ostrovsky, we obtain the following results: (1) Every finite-dimensional analytic space is $\sigma$-homogeneous with analytic witnesses, (2) Every finite-dimensional analytic space is $\sigma$-homogeneous with pairwise disjoint $\mathbf{\Delta}^1_2$ witnesses. Furthermore, the complexity of the witnesses is optimal in both of the above results. This completes the picture regarding $\sigma$-homogeneity in the finite-dimensional realm. It is an open problem whether every analytic space is $\sigma$-homogeneous. We also investigate finite unions of homogeneous spaces.</description>

      <title>Finite final segments of the d.c.e. Turing degrees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04254v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that every finite distributive lattice is isomorphic to a final segment of the d.c.e. Turing degrees (i.e., the degrees of differences of computably enumerable sets). As a corollary, we are able to infer the undecidability of the EAE-theory of the d.c.e. degrees in the language of partial ordering.</description>
