      <title>FM-RME: Foundation Model Empowered Radio Map Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional radio map estimation (RME) techniques fail to capture multi-dimensional and dynamic characteristics of complex spectrum environments. Recent data-driven methods achieve accurate RME in spatial domain, but ignore physical prior knowledge of radio propagation, limiting data efficiency especially in multi-dimensional scenarios. To overcome such limitations, we propose a new foundation model, characterized by self-supervised pre-training on diverse data for zero-shot generalization, enabling multi-dimensional radio map estimation (FM-RME). Specifically, FM-RME builds an effective synergy of two core components: a geometry-aware feature extraction module that encodes physical propagation symmetries, i.e., translation and rotation invariance, as inductive bias, and an attention-based neural network that learns long-range correlations across the spatial-temporal-spectral domains. A masked self-supervised multi-dimensional pre-training strategy is further developed to learn generalizable spectrum representations across diverse wireless environments. Once pre-trained, FM-RME supports zero-shot inference for multi-dimensional RME, including spatial, temporal, and spectral estimation, without scenario-specific retraining. Simulation results verify that FM-RME exhibits desired learning performance across diverse datasets and zero-shot generalization capabilities beyond existing RME methods.</description>

      <title>Full Waveform Inversion using the Wasserstein metric for ultrasound transducer array based NDT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrasonic imaging methods often assume linear direct models, while in reality, many nonlinear phenomena are present, e.g. multiple reflections. A family of imaging methods called Full Waveform Inversion (FWI), which has been developed in the field of seismic imaging, uses full acoustic wave simulations as direct models, taking into account virtually all nonlinearities, which can ultimately enhance the accuracy of ultrasonic imaging. However, the problem of cycle skipping -- the existence of many local minima of the Least Squares (L2) misfit function due to the oscillatory nature of the signals -- is worsened when FWI is applied to ultrasound data because of a lack of low-frequency components. In this paper, we explore the use of the squared Wasserstein (W2) Optimal Transport Distance as the metric for the misfit between the acquired and the synthetic data, applying the method to Nondestructive Evaluation with ultrasonic phased arrays. An analytical continuous time-domain derivation of the adjoint acoustic field related to the W2 misfit is presented and used for the computation of the gradients. To cope with the computational burden of FWI, we apply a low-memory strategy that allows for the computation of the gradients without the storage of the full simulated fields. The GPU implementation of the method (in CUDA language) is detailed, and the source code is made available. Six prototypical cases are presented, and the corresponding sound speed maps are reconstructed with FWI using both the L2 and the W2 misfit functionals. In five of the six cases, the pixel-wise sum of squared errors obtained with W2 was at least one order of magnitude lower than that obtained with W2, with an increase in the gradient computation time not exceeding 2\%. The results highlight both the adequacy of the W2 misfit for ultrasonic FWI with phased arrays and its computational feasibility.</description>

      <title>CSI-RFF: Leveraging Micro-Signals on CSI for RF Fingerprinting of Commodity WiFi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces CSI-RFF, a new framework that leverages micro-signals embedded within Channel State Information (CSI) curves to realize Radio-Frequency Fingerprinting of commodity off-the-shelf (COTS) WiFi devices for open-set authentication. The micro-signals that serve as RF fingerprints are termed ``micro-CSI''. Through experimentation, we have found that the presence of micro-CSI can primarily be attributed to imperfections in the RF circuitry. Furthermore, this characteristic signal is detectable in WiFi 4/5/6 network interface cards (NICs). We have conducted further experiments to determine the most effective CSI collection configurations to stabilize micro-CSI. Yet, extracting micro-CSI for authentication purposes poses a significant challenge. This complexity arises from the fact that CSI measurements inherently include both micro-CSI and the distortions introduced by wireless channels. These two elements are intricately intertwined, making their separation non-trivial. To tackle this challenge, we have developed a signal space-based extraction technique for line-of-sight (LoS) scenarios, which can effectively separate the distortions caused by wireless channels and micro-CSI. Over the course of our comprehensive CSI data collection period extending beyond one year, we found that the extracted micro-CSI displays unique characteristics specific to each WiFi device and remains invariant over time. This establishes micro-CSI as a suitable candidate for device fingerprinting. Finally, we conduct a case study focusing on area access control for mobile robots. Our experimental results demonstrate that the micro-CSI-based authentication algorithm can achieve an average attack detection rate close to 99% with a false alarm rate of 0% in both static and mobile conditions when using 20 CSI measurements to construct one fingerprint.</description>

      <title>Constructing Knowledge Map for MIMO-OFDM Clustered Channel Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Channel knowledge map (CKM) exploits environ-ment information to assist channel estimation during communi-cation. For clustered channels, which represent a typical type ofwireless propagation environment, there has been no researchdevoted to designing an appropriate CKM to enhance theirestimation. To exploit environment information for clusteredchannel, improve channel estimation accuracy and reduce pilotoverhead, we propose ClusterCKM, a CKM providing the rangeof clustered multipath parameters for any pair of transmitter-receiver links in the region of interest. Firstly, we construct Clus-terCKM through estimating the spatial range of scatterer clustersfrom historical channel information. From these spatial range ofscatterer clusters, ClusterCKM infers the range of multipathparameters for the target link. Furthermore, a ClusterCKM-based channel estimation algorithm is developed to utilize theparameter range provided by ClusterCKM. Simulation resultsshow that, more accurate channel estimation can be achievedand pilot overhead can also be reduced by ClusterCKM and theClusterCKM-based estimation algorithm.</description>

      <title>A guided residual search for nonlinear state-space identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parameter estimation of nonlinear state-space models from input-output data typically requires solving a highly non-convex optimization problem prone to slow convergence and suboptimal solutions. This work improves the reliability and efficiency of the estimation process by decomposing the overall optimization problem into a sequence of tractable subproblems. Based on an initial linear model, nonlinear residual dynamics are first estimated via a guided residual search and subsequently refined using multiple-shooting optimization. Experimental results on two benchmarks demonstrate competitive performance relative to state-of-the-art black-box methods and improved convergence compared to naive initialization.</description>

      <title>Digital Twin-Based Beamforming for Interference Mitigation in AF Relay MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Beamforming in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems should take interference mitigation into account. However, for beamform design, accurate channel state information (CSI) is needed, which is often difficult to obtain due to channel variability, feedback overhead, or hardware constraints. For example, amplify-and-forward (AF) relays passively forward signals without measurement, precluding full CSI acquisition to and from the relay. To address these issues, this paper introduces a novel prediction-assisted optimization (PAO) framework for beamform design in AF relay-assisted multiuser MIMO systems. The proposed solution in the AF relay aims at maximizing the signal-plus-interference-to-noise ratio (SINR). Unlike other methods, PAO relies solely on received power measurements, making it suitable for scenarios where CSI is unreliable or unavailable. PAO consists of two stages: a supervised-learning-based neural network (NN) that predicts the positions of transmitters using signal observations, and an optimization algorithm, guided by a digital twin (DT), that iteratively refines the beam direction of the relay in a simulated radio environment. As a key contribution, we validate the proposed framework using realistic measurements collected on a custom-built experimental millimeter wave (mmWave) platform, which enables training of the NN model under practical wireless conditions. The estimated information is then used to update the digital twin with knowledge of the surrounding environment, enabling online optimization. Numerical results show the trade-off between localization accuracy and beamforming performance and confirm that PAO maintains robustness even in the presence of localization errors while reducing the need for real-world measurements.</description>

      <title>Scattering Transform for Auditory Attention Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of hearing aids will increase in the coming years due to demographic change. One open problem that remains to be solved by a new generation of hearing aids is the cocktail party problem. A possible solution is electroencephalography-based auditory attention decoding. This has been the subject of several studies in recent years, which have in common that they use the same preprocessing methods in most cases. In this work, in order to achieve an advantage, the use of a scattering transform is proposed as an alternative to these preprocessing methods. The two-layer scattering transform is compared with a regular filterbank, the synchrosqueezing short-time Fourier transform and the common preprocessing. To demonstrate the performance, the known and the proposed preprocessing methods are compared for different classification tasks on two widely used datasets, provided by the KU Leuven (KUL) and the Technical University of Denmark (DTU). Both established and new neural-network-based models, CNNs, LSTMs, and recent Transformer/graph-based models are used for classification. Various evaluation strategies were compared, with a focus on the task of classifying speakers who are unknown from the training. We show that the two-layer scattering transform can significantly improve the performance for subject-related conditions, especially on the KUL dataset. However, on the DTU dataset, this only applies to some of the models, or when larger amounts of training data are provided, as in 10-fold cross-validation. This suggests that the scattering transform is capable of extracting additional relevant information.</description>

      <title>A Scaling Law for Bandwidth Under Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a scaling law relating ADC bit depth to effective bandwidth for signals with $1/f^\alpha$ power spectra. Quantization introduces a flat noise floor whose intersection with the declining signal spectrum defines an effective cutoff frequency $f_c$. We show that each additional bit extends this cutoff by a factor of $2^{2/\alpha}$, approximately doubling bandwidth per bit for $\alpha = 2$. The law requires that quantization noise be approximately white, a condition whose minimum bit depth $N_{\min}$ we show to be $\alpha$-dependent. Validation on synthetic $1/f^\alpha$ signals for $\alpha \in \{1.5, 2.0, 2.5\}$ yields prediction errors below 3\% using the theoretical noise floor $\Delta^2/(6f_s)$, and approximately 14\% when the noise floor is estimated empirically from the quantized signal's spectrum. We illustrate practical implications on real EEG data.</description>

      <title>Analog Time Multiplexing for Digital-to-Analog Conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The signal bandwidth of Digital to Analog Converters based on Sigma Delta Modulation is limited by speed constrains. Time-Interleaving allows coping with complexity vs. speed by replacing the original architecture by M parallel paths. These path are clocked at a frequency M times smaller and their digital outputs time multiplexed. This is then converted to analog by means of a Digital to Analog Converter clocked at the high rate. This preprint proposes that time multiplexing be performed in the analog domain. As a result robustness against dynamic effects is achieved.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.23338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microwave sounding is the leading driver of global numerical weather forecasting, but is limited by the scalability of such instruments. With modern machining and commercial microwave components, it is now possible to design low size, weight, power, and cost (SWaP-C) microwave spectrometers while maintaining wide bandwidth performance. Here we report on the status of CubeSounder, a spectrometer tailored for water vapor radiometry that utilizes passive wave guide filter banks. After developing a prototype and high altitude balloon payload, we demonstrated CubeSounder on commercial stratospheric balloon flights. We report on our design process, especially the simulation and fabrication of the custom millimeter-wave filter banks. We also report the initial results of the data collected from the balloon flights.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.22248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The next generation of particle physics experiments will face a new era of challenges in data acquisition, due to unprecedented data rates and volumes along with extreme environments and operational constraints. Harnessing this data for scientific discovery demands real-time inference and decision-making, intelligent data reduction, and efficient processing architectures beyond current capabilities. Crucial to the success of this experimental paradigm are several emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) and silicon microelectronics, and the advent of quantum algorithms and processing. Their intersection includes areas of research such as low-power and low-latency devices for edge computing, heterogeneous accelerator systems, reconfigurable hardware, novel codesign and synthesis strategies, readout for cryogenic or high-radiation environments, and analog computing. This white paper presents a community-driven vision to identify and prioritize research and development opportunities in hardware-based ML systems and corresponding physics applications, contributing towards a successful transition to the new data frontier of fundamental science.</description>

      <title>X-REFINE: XAI-based RElevance input-Filtering and archItecture fiNe-tuning for channel Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AI-native architectures are vital for 6G wireless communications. The black-box nature and high complexity of deep learning models employed in critical applications, such as channel estimation, limit their practical deployment. While perturbation-based XAI solutions offer input filtering, they often neglect internal structural optimization. We propose X-REFINE, an XAI-based framework for joint input-filtering and architecture fine-tuning. By utilizing a decomposition-based, sign-stabilized LRP epsilon rule, X-REFINE backpropagates predictions to derive high-resolution relevance scores for both subcarriers and hidden neurons. This enables a holistic optimization that identifies the most faithful model components. Simulation results demonstrate that X-REFINE achieves a superior interpretability-performance-complexity trade-off, significantly reducing computational complexity while maintaining robust bit error rate (BER) performance across different scenarios.</description>

      <title>Agentic AI for Intent-driven Optimization in Cell-free O-RAN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Agentic artificial intelligence (AI) is emerging as a key enabler for autonomous radio access networks (RANs), where multiple large language model (LLM)-based agents reason and collaborate to achieve operator-defined intents. The open RAN (O-RAN) architecture enables the deployment and coordination of such agents. However, most existing works consider simple intents handled by independent agents, while complex intents that require coordination among agents remain unexplored. In this paper, we propose an agentic AI framework for intent translation and optimization in cell-free O-RAN. A supervisor agent translates the operator intents into an optimization objective and minimum rate requirements. Based on this information, a user weighting agent retrieves relevant prior experience from a memory module to determine the user priority weights for precoding. If the intent includes an energy-saving objective, then an open radio unit (O-RU) management agent will also be activated to determine the set of active O-RUs by using a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm. A monitoring agent measures and monitors the user data rates and coordinates with other agents to guarantee the minimum rate requirements are satisfied. To enhance scalability, we adopt a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method that enables the same underlying LLM to be used for different agents. Simulation results show that the proposed agentic AI framework reduces the number of active O-RUs by 41.93% when compared with three baseline schemes in energy-saving mode. Using the PEFT method, the proposed framework reduces the memory usage by 92% when compared with deploying separate LLM agents.</description>

      <title>HARU-Net: Hybrid Attention Residual U-Net for Edge-Preserving Denoising in Cone-Beam Computed Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) is widely used in dental and maxillofacial imaging, but low-dose acquisition introduces strong, spatially varying noise that degrades soft-tissue visibility and obscures fine anatomical structures. Classical denoising methods struggle to suppress noise in CBCT while preserving edges. Although deep learning-based approaches offer high-fidelity restoration, their use in CBCT denoising is limited by the scarcity of high-resolution CBCT data for supervised training. To address this research gap, we propose a novel Hybrid Attention Residual U-Net (HARU-Net) for high-quality denoising of CBCT data, trained on a cadaver dataset of human hemimandibles acquired using a high-resolution protocol of the 3D Accuitomo 170 (J. Morita, Kyoto, Japan) CBCT system. The novel contribution of this approach is the integration of three complementary architectural components: (i) a hybrid attention transformer block (HAB) embedded within each skip connection to selectively emphasize salient anatomical features, (ii) a residual hybrid attention transformer group (RHAG) at the bottleneck to strengthen global contextual modeling and long-range feature interactions, and (iii) residual learning convolutional blocks to facilitate deeper, more stable feature extraction throughout the network. HARU-Net consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods including SwinIR and Uformer, achieving the highest PSNR (37.52 dB), highest SSIM (0.9557), and lowest GMSD (0.1084). This effective and clinically reliable CBCT denoising is achieved at a computational cost significantly lower than that of the SOTA methods, offering a practical advancement toward improving diagnostic quality in low-dose CBCT imaging.</description>

      <title>Relating the Neural Representations of Vocalized, Mimed, and Imagined Speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigated the relationship among neural representations of vocalized, mimed, and imagined speech recorded using publicly available stereotactic EEG recordings. Most prior studies have focused on decoding speech responses within each condition separately. Here, instead, we explore how responses across conditions relate by training linear spectrogram reconstruction models for each condition and evaluate their generalization across conditions. We demonstrate that linear decoders trained on one condition generally transfer successfully to others, implying shared speech representations. This commonality was assessed with stimulus-level discriminability by performing a rank-based analysis demonstrating preservation of stimulus-specific structure in both within- and across-conditions. Finally, we compared linear reconstructions to those from a nonlinear neural network. While both exhibited cross-condition transfer, linear models achieve superior stimulus-level discriminability.</description>

      <title>Molecule Mixture Detection and Design for MC Systems with Non-linear, Cross-reactive Receiver Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Air-based molecular communication (MC) has the potential to be one of the first MC systems to be deployed in real-world applications, enabled by commercially available sensors. However, these sensors usually exhibit non-linear and cross-reactive behavior, contrary to the idealizing assumption of linear and perfectly molecule type-specific sensing often made in the MC literature. To address this mismatch, we propose several detectors and transmission schemes for a molecule mixture communication system where the receiver (RX) employs non-linear, cross-reactive sensors. All proposed schemes are based on the first- and second-order moments of the symbol likelihoods that are fed through the non-linear RX using the Unscented Transform. In particular, we propose an approximate maximum likelihood (AML) symbol-by-symbol detector for inter-symbol-interference (ISI)-free transmission scenarios and a complementary mixture alphabet design algorithm which accounts for the RX characteristics. When significant ISI is present at high data rates, the AML detector can be adapted to exploit statistical ISI knowledge. Additionally, we propose a sequence detector which combines information from multiple symbol intervals. For settings where sequence detection is not possible due to extremely limited computational power at the RX, we propose an adaptive transmission scheme which can be combined with symbol-by-symbol detection. Using computer simulations, we validate all proposed detectors and algorithms based on the responses of commercially available sensors as well as artificially generated sensor data incorporating the characteristics of metal-oxide semiconductor sensors. By employing a general system model that accounts for transmitter noise, ISI, and general non-linear, cross-reactive RX arrays, this work enables reliable communication for a large class of MC systems.</description>

      <title>Reflectance Multispectral Imaging for Soil Composition Estimation and USDA Texture Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Soil texture is a foundational attribute that governs water availability and erosion in agriculture, as well as load bearing capacity, deformation response, and shrink-swell risk in geotechnical engineering. Yet texture is still typically determined by slow and labour intensive laboratory particle size tests, while many sensing alternatives are either costly or too coarse to support routine field scale deployment. This paper proposes a robust and field deployable multispectral imaging (MSI) system and machine learning framework for predicting soil composition and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) texture classes. The proposed system uses a cost effective in-house MSI device operating from 365 nm to 940 nm to capture thirteen spectral bands, which effectively capture the spectral properties of soil texture. Regression models use the captured spectral properties to estimate clay, silt, and sand percentages, while a direct classifier predicts one of the twelve USDA textural classes. Indirect classification is obtained by mapping the regressed compositions to texture classes via the USDA soil texture triangle. The framework is evaluated on mixture data by mixing clay, silt, and sand in varying proportions, using the USDA classification triangle as a basis. Experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves a coefficient of determination R^2 up to 0.99 for composition prediction and over 99% accuracy for texture classification. These findings indicate that MSI combined with data-driven modeling can provide accurate, non-destructive, and field deployable soil texture characterization suitable for geotechnical screening and precision agriculture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.22914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although the circulatory system functions as a continuous source of physiological data, contemporary diagnostics remain bound to intermittent, time-delayed assessments. To resolve this, we present a framework for ubiquitous hematological profiling driven by Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC). We demonstrate how electromagnetic signals can be exploited to monitor blood in real-time, effectively converting them into diagnostic tools. We analyze the biological foundations of blood, review existing Complete Blood Count (CBC) and sensing technologies, and detail a novel pipeline for continuous blood monitoring. Furthermore, we discuss the potential applications of deploying these devices to enable real-time CBC and biomarker detection, ultimately revolutionizing how we predict, detect, and manage individual and public health.</description>

      <title>Effective sample size approximations as entropy measures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.22954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we analyze alternative effective sample size (ESS) metrics for importance sampling algorithms, and discuss a possible extended range of applications. We show the relationship between the ESS expressions used in the literature and two entropy families, the R\'enyi and Tsallis entropy. The R\'enyi entropy is connected to the Huggins-Roy's ESS family introduced in \cite{Huggins15}. We prove that that all the ESS functions included in the Huggins-Roy's family fulfill all the desirable theoretical conditions. We analyzed and remark the connections with several other fields, such as the Hill numbers introduced in ecology, the Gini inequality coefficient employed in economics, and the Gini impurity index used mainly in machine learning, to name a few.
  Finally, by numerical simulations, we study the performance of different ESS expressions contained in the previous ESS families in terms of approximation of the theoretical ESS definition, and show the application of ESS formulas in a variable selection problem.</description>

      <title>A note on the area under the likelihood and the fake evidence for model selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Improper priors are not allowed for the computation of the Bayesian evidence $Z=p({\bf y})$ (a.k.a., marginal likelihood), since in this case $Z$ is not completely specified due to an arbitrary constant involved in the computation. However, in this work, we remark that they can be employed in a specific type of model selection problem: when we have several (possibly infinite) models belonging to the same parametric family (i.e., for tuning parameters of a parametric model). However, the quantities involved in this type of selection cannot be considered as Bayesian evidences: we suggest to use the name ``fake evidences'' (or ``areas under the likelihood'' in the case of uniform improper priors). We also show that, in this model selection scenario, using a diffuse prior and increasing its scale parameter asymptotically to infinity, we cannot recover the value of the area under the likelihood, obtained with a uniform improper prior. We first discuss it from a general point of view. Then we provide, as an applicative example, all the details for Bayesian regression models with nonlinear bases, considering two cases: the use of a uniform improper prior and the use of a Gaussian prior, respectively. A numerical experiment is also provided confirming and checking all the previous statements.</description>

      <title>An automatic counting algorithm for the quantification and uncertainty analysis of the number of microglial cells trainable in small and heterogeneous datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Counting immunopositive cells on biological tissues generally requires either manual annotation or (when available) automatic rough systems, for scanning signal surface and intensity in whole slide imaging. In this work, we tackle the problem of counting microglial cells in lumbar spinal cord cross-sections of rats by omitting cell detection and focusing only on the counting task. Manual cell counting is, however, a time-consuming task and additionally entails extensive personnel training. The classic automatic color-based methods roughly inform about the total labeled area and intensity (protein quantification) but do not specifically provide information on cell number. Since the images to be analyzed have a high resolution but a huge amount of pixels contain just noise or artifacts, we first perform a pre-processing generating several filtered images {(providing a tailored, efficient feature extraction)}. Then, we design an automatic kernel counter that is a non-parametric and non-linear method. The proposed scheme can be easily trained in small datasets since, in its basic version, it relies only on one hyper-parameter. However, being non-parametric and non-linear, the proposed algorithm is flexible enough to express all the information contained in rich and heterogeneous datasets as well (providing the maximum overfit if required). Furthermore, the proposed kernel counter also provides uncertainty estimation of the given prediction, and can directly tackle the case of receiving several expert opinions over the same image. Different numerical experiments with artificial and real datasets show very promising results. Related Matlab code is also provided.</description>

      <title>Spectrotemporal Feature Extraction in EHG Signals and Tocograms for Enhanced Preterm Birth Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07432v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Preterm birth (PTB), defined as delivery before 37 weeks of gestation, is a leading cause of neonatal mortality and long term health complications. Early detection is essential for enabling timely medical interventions. Electrohysterography (EHG) and tocography (TOCO) are promising non invasive tools for PTB prediction, but prior studies often suffer from class imbalance, improper oversampling, and reliance on features with limited physiological relevance. This work presents a machine learning (ML) pipeline incorporating robust preprocessing, physiologically grounded feature extraction, and rigorous evaluation. Features were extracted from EHG (and TOCO) signals using Mel frequency cepstral coefficients, statistical descriptors of wavelet coefficients, and peaks of the normalized power spectrum. Signal quality was enhanced via Karhunen Loeve Transform (KLT) denoising through eigenvalue based subspace decomposition. Multiple classifiers, including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Multilayer Perceptron, and CatBoost, were evaluated on the TPEHGT dataset. The CatBoost classifier with KLT denoising achieved the highest performance on fixed interval segments of the TPEHGT dataset, reaching 97.28% accuracy and an AUC of 0.9988. Ablation studies confirmed the critical role of both KLT denoising and physiologically informed features. Comparative analysis showed that including TOCO signals did not substantially improve prediction over EHG alone, highlighting the sufficiency of EHG for PTB detection. These results demonstrate that combining denoising with domain-relevant features can yield highly accurate, robust, and clinically interpretable models, supporting the development of cost-effective and accessible PTB prediction tools, particularly in low-resource healthcare settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.20942v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate timing and synchronization, typically enabled by GPS, are essential for modern wireless communication systems. However, many emerging applications must operate in GPS-denied environments where signals are unreliable or disrupted, resulting in oscillator drift and carrier frequency impairments. To address these challenges, we present BenchLink, a System-on-Chip (SoC)-based benchmark for resilient communication links that functions without GPS and supports adaptive pilot density and modulation. Unlike traditional General Purpose Processor (GPP)-based software-defined radios (e.g. USRPs), the SoC-based design allows for more precise latency control. We implement and evaluate BenchLink on Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoCs, and demonstrate its effectiveness in both ground and aerial environments. A comprehensive dataset has also been collected under various conditions. We will make both the SoC-based link design and dataset available to the wireless community. BenchLink is expected to facilitate future research on data-driven link adaptation, resilient synchronization in GPS-denied scenarios, and emerging applications that require precise latency control, such as integrated radar sensing and communication.</description>

      <title>Visible Light Positioning With Lam\'e Curve LEDs: A Generic Approach for Camera Pose Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01577v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Camera-based visible light positioning (VLP) is a promising technique for accurate and low-cost indoor camera pose estimation (CPE). To reduce the number of required light-emitting diodes (LEDs), advanced methods commonly exploit LED shape features for positioning. Although interesting, they are typically restricted to a single LED geometry, leading to failure in heterogeneous LED-shape scenarios. To address this challenge, this paper investigates Lam\'e curves as a unified representation of common LED shapes and proposes a generic VLP algorithm using Lam\'e curve-shaped LEDs, termed LC-VLP. In the considered system, multiple ceiling-mounted Lam\'e curve-shaped LEDs periodically broadcast their curve parameters via visible light communication, which are captured by a camera-equipped receiver. Based on the received LED images and curve parameters, the receiver can estimate the camera pose using LC-VLP. Specifically, an LED database is constructed offline to store the curve parameters, while online positioning is formulated as a nonlinear least-squares problem and solved iteratively. To provide a reliable initialization, a correspondence-free perspective-n-points (FreePnP) algorithm is further developed, enabling approximate CPE without any pre-calibrated reference points. The performance of LC-VLP is verified by both simulations and experiments. Simulations show that LC-VLP outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both circular- and rectangular-LED scenarios, achieving reductions of over 40% in position error and 25% in rotation error. Experiments further show that LC-VLP can achieve an average position accuracy of less than 4 cm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.20317v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Next-generation fusion facilities like ITER face a "data deluge," generating petabytes of multi-diagnostic signals daily that challenge manual analysis. We present a "signals-first" self-supervised framework for the automated extraction of coherent and transient modes from high-noise time-frequency data across a variety of sensors. We also develop a general-purpose method and tool for extracting coherent, quasi-coherent, and transient modes for fluctuation measurements in tokamaks by employing non-linear optimal techniques in multichannel signal processing with a fast neural network surrogate on fast magnetics, electron cyclotron emission, CO2 interferometers, and beam emission spectroscopy measurements from DIII-D. Results are tested on data from DIII-D, TJ-II, and non-fusion spectrograms. With an inference latency of 0.5 seconds, this framework enables real-time mode identification and large-scale automated database generation for advanced plasma control.

Using a recently defined notion of ``strength" as a power measure, we derive the rate-distortion function for $\alpha$-stable sources subject to a constraint on the strength of the error and show it to be logarithmic in the strength-to-distortion ratio. We show how our framework paves the way for finding optimal quantizers for $\alpha$-stable sources and other general heavy-tailed ones. In addition, we study high-rate scalar quantizers and show that uniform ones are asymptotically optimal under the error-strength distortion measure. We compare uniform Gaussian and Cauchy quantizers and show that more representation points for the Cauchy source are required to guarantee the same quantization quality. Our findings generalize the well-known results of rate-distortion and quantization of Gaussian sources ($\alpha = 2$) under a quadratic distortion measure.</description>

      <title>Optimum Spectrum Extension for PAPR Reduction of DFT-s-OFDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19064v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Uplink coverage in cellular networks is constrained by the maximum UE transmit power, making peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) reduction essential. While DFT-s-OFDM with frequency-domain spectral shaping (FDSS) achieves significantly lower PAPR than OFDM, especially with pi/2-BPSK, the PAPR remains too high for higher-rate transmission. Spectrum extension (SE) combined with FDSS (FDSS-SE) can further reduce the PAPR for higher-order QAM. This paper considers FDSS-SE with parametrized FDSS windows spanning a range of possible power ripples, as well as arbitrary circular shifts of the subcarrier coefficients. We optimize both the frequency shift and the SE size, and show that there exists an optimal SE size for reducing the PAPR and another one for increasing the rate. Analysis and simulations reveal that both optima largely depend on the window attenuation but are nearly invariant in proportion to the bandwidth. While the PAPR-optimal SE size is nearly invariant to the constellation order of regular QAM, the rate-optimal SE size depends also on the SNR. These insights provide practical guidelines for beyond-5G uplink coverage enhancement, highlighting that SE size should be individually configured according to the user's FDSS window and link quality.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis of Cell-Free Massive MIMO under Imperfect LoS Phase Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11179v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the impact of imperfect line-of-sight (LoS) phase tracking on the uplink performance of cell-free massive MIMO networks. Unlike prior works that assume perfectly known or completely unknown phases, we consider a realistic regime where LoS phases are estimated with residual uncertainty due to hardware impairments, mobility, and synchronization errors. To this end, we propose a Rician fading model where LoS components are rotated by imperfect phase estimates and attenuated by a deterministic \textit{phase-error penalty factor}.
  We derive a linear MMSE channel estimator that accounts for statistical phase errors and unifies prior results, reducing to the Bayesian MMSE estimator when phase is perfectly known and to a zero-mean model when no phase information is available. To address the non-Gaussian setting, we introduce a virtual uplink model that preserves second-order statistics of channel estimation, enabling the derivation of tractable virtual centralized and distributed MMSE beamformers. To ensure fair assessment of network performance, we apply these virtual beamformers to the operational uplink model that reflects the actual physical channel and compute the spectral efficiency bounds available in the literature.
  Numerical results show that our framework bridges idealized assumptions and practical tracking limitations, providing rigorous performance benchmarks and design insights for 6G cell-free networks.</description>
