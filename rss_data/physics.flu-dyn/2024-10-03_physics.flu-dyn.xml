      <title>Role of Duty Cycle in Burst-Modulated Synthetic Jet Flow Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an experimental study on flow reattachment over a stalled airfoil using an array of microblowers operating as synthetic jet actuators (SJAs). The effects of burst duty cycle (DC) and blowing ratio, alongside power requirements, are examined in relation to SJA-induced vortical structures and aerodynamic performance. Results show that increasing the DC or blowing ratio can achieve the threshold momentum coefficient required for flow reattachment. While both DC and blowing ratios impact control efficacy, achieving a specific momentum coefficient generally corresponds to a consistent lift coefficient, regardless of the individual parameter values. Substantial lift improvements are observed at DCs as low as 5%, indicating that brief, high-momentum perturbations to the flow are sufficient for reattachment, resulting in significant power savings. However, analysis of the flow dynamics reveals that low-DC control strategies result in unsteady, phase-dependent flow behavior due to the induced vortices' rapid dissipation and inconsistent evolution. Higher DCs produce stronger, more persistent vortices that remain closer to the airfoil surface, leading to a more stable and effective control strategy. The study also highlights the challenge of achieving full spanwise control across the finite-span array, as even high-power strategies could not achieve a control length greater than 40% of the array's span. Additionally, a strong correlation between the lift coefficient and the suction peak pressure coefficient is observed, indicating that single-point measurements suffice for rapid assessment of control effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Attenuation mechanism of wall-bounded turbulence by heavy finite-size particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To elucidate the attenuation mechanism of wall-bounded turbulence due to heavy small particles, we conduct direct numerical simulations (DNS) of turbulent channel flow laden with finite-size solid particles. When particles cannot follow the swirling motions of wall-attached vortices, vortex rings are shed around the particles. These shedding vortices lead to additional energy dissipation, reducing the turbulent energy production from the mean flow. This mechanism results in the attenuation of turbulent kinetic energy, which is more significant when the Stokes number of particles is larger or particle size is smaller. Moreover, we propose the method to quantitatively predict the degree of turbulence attenuation without using DNS data by estimating the additional energy dissipation rate in terms of particle properties.</description>

      <title>Role of triad interactions in spectral evolution of surface gravity waves in deep water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is generally accepted that the evolution of deep-water surface gravity wave spectrum is governed by quartet resonant and quasi-resonant interactions. However, it has also been reported in both experimental and computational studies that non-resonant triad interactions can play a role, e.g., generation of bound waves. In this study, we investigate the effects of triad and quartet interactions on the spectral evolution, by numerically tracking the contributions from quadratic and cubic terms in the dynamical equation. In a finite time interval, we find that the contribution from triad interactions follows the trend of that from quartet resonances (with comparable magnitude) for most wavenumbers, except that it peaks at low wavenumbers with very low initial energy. This result reveals two effects of triad interactions: (1) the non-resonant triad interactions can be connected to form quartet resonant interactions (hence exhibiting the comparable trend), which is a reflection of the normal form transformation applied in wave turbulence theory of surface gravity waves. (2) the triad interactions can fill energy into the low energy portion of the spectrum (low wavenumber part in this case) on a very fast time scale, with energy distributed in both bound and free modes at the same wavenumber. We further analyze the latter mechanism using a simple model with two initially active modes in the wavenumber domain. Analytical formulae are provided to describe the distribution of energy in free and bound modes with numerical validations.</description>

      <title>Effect of span size in Scale Resolving Simulations of airfoil stall and post-stall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In aerodynamic design, the use of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) tools has long relied on Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) and Unsteady RANS (URANS) turbulence models. However, these methods face limitations in predicting massively separated flow regions. As a result, there is growing emphasis on scale-resolving methods such as Large Eddy Simulation (LES), which have become more feasible due to advancements in computational resources. This study focuses on the LES of airfoil flows, specifically analyzing the influence of the spanwise extent of the computational domain on aerodynamic forces. We examine the NREL S826 airfoil at a chord Reynolds number of $Re_c = 10^5$ under different angles of attack, with simulations performed using the PyFR solver. Our results highlight the importance of adequate spanwise resolution, particularly in post-stall flow conditions, where larger span sizes are necessary to accurately capture three-dimensional flow structures. The findings suggest that for certain flow regimes, traditional two-dimensional statistical representations may not be sufficient, necessitating further investigation into 3D flow phenomena.</description>

      <title>Towards eliminating the nonlinear Kelvin wake</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nonlinear disturbance caused by a localised forcing moving at constant speed on the free surface of a liquid of finite depth is investigated using the forced Kadometsev-Petviashvili equation. The presence of a steady v-shaped Kelvin wave pattern downstream of the forcing is established for this model equation, and the wedge angle is characterised as a function of the Froude number. Inspired by this analysis, it is shown that the wake can be eliminated via a careful choice of the forcing distribution and that, significantly, the corresponding nonlinear wave-free solution is stable so that it could potentially be seen in a physical experiment. The stability is demonstrated via the numerical solution of an initial value problem for which the steady wave-free state is attained in the long-time limit.</description>

      <title>The Sound Radiated by Tip Clearances Submerged in a Boundary Layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present study investigates the behaviour of the far-field sound radiated by low Mach number tip clearance flow induced by placing a stationary cambered airfoil adjacent to a stationary wall. The tip clearance heights ranged from 14% to 30% of the incoming, undisturbed boundary layer thickness and the clearance heights based Reynolds numbers were between 2,600 and 16,000. The far-field sound measured using a microphone array was beamformed to reveal the dominant noise sources and how they behave when the flow Mach number, angle of attack and the clearance height were varied. The near-field behaviour was also examined through PIV measurements and surface pressure fluctuation measurements on the tip. The results show that the mid-to-high frequency noise generated by tip clearances is dominated by the leakage flow in the mid-chord and leading-edge regions, while a distinct low-frequency noise source with a different scaling behaviour exists close to the trailing-edge of the tip clearance. The origin of this low-frequency noise source is believed to be the tip separation vortex that resides close to the trailing-edge and induces significant turbulence levels in the region. The strength of this noise source decreases with clearance height which is consistent with a reduction in turbulence levels associated with the separation vortex. The magnitude of the mid-frequency clearance noise which scales with the sixth power of the Mach number, decreases with tip clearance height due to a reduction in the fluctuating pressure on the airfoil tip surface. The time-scale of this sound was independent of the flow velocity, implying that the source is non-compact. Smaller tip clearances were also found to generate louder high-frequency noise due to intense turbulence and pressure fluctuation levels concentrated near the leading-edge of the clearance.</description>

      <title>Cascades and Kolmogorov's lognormal scaling in two-dimensional bacterial turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collective movements of bacteria exhibit a remarkable pattern of turbulence-like vortices, in which the Richardson cascade plays an important role. In this work, we examine the energy and enstrophy cascades and their associated lognormal statistics using experimental velocity field data. The coherent structure observed on a large scale is due to the presence of the inverse energy cascade; while the kinetic energy is dissipated at all scales, since these active movements occur below the fluid viscosity scale. The forward enstrophy cascade occurs with injection at all scales and may be represented by other nonlinear interactions that are not captured by the existing experimental data. Furthermore, the lognormal statistics for both energy dissipation and enstrophy fields are verified in accordance with the Kolmogorov 1962 refined theory of turbulence. Their scaling exponents can be well described by the lognormal formula with intermittency parameters comparable with those of the three-dimensional hydrodynamic turbulence. The joint analysis of the multifractal measures of the energy dissipation rate and enstrophy follows an ellipse model from the lognormal statistics. Our results confirm the coexistence of the inverse energy cascade and the intermittency correction of the velocity scaling in this active fluid system. An inverse energy cascade diagram below the fluid viscosity is summarized to describe the observed two-dimensional bacterial turbulence. Our work provides an example of an active-flow model benchmark.</description>

      <title>Reduced Representations of Rayleigh-B\'enard Flows via Autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyzed the performance of Convolutional Autoencoders in generating reduced-order representations of 2D Rayleigh-B\'enard flows at $Pr=1$ and Rayleigh numbers extending from $10^6$ to $10^8$, capturing the range where the flow transitions to turbulence. We present a way of estimating the minimum number of dimensions needed by the Autoencoders to capture all the relevant physical scales of the system that is more apt for highly multiscale flows than previous criteria applied to lower dimensional systems. We compare our architecture with two regularized variants as well as with linear methods, and find that manually fixing the dimension of the latent space produces the best results. We show how the estimated minimum dimension presents a sharp increase around $Ra\sim 10^7$, when the flow starts to transition to turbulence. Furthermore, we show how this dimension does not follow the same scaling as the physically relevant scales, such as the dissipation lengthscale and the thermal boundary layer.</description>

      <title>The effect of gravity on bubble-particle collisions in turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bubble-particle collisions in turbulence are key to the froth flotation process that is employed industrially on a vast scale to separate hydrophobic from hydrophilic materials. In our previous study (Chan et al., J. Fluid Mech., vol. 959, 2023, A6), we elucidated the collision mechanisms and critically reviewed the collision models in the no-gravity limit. In reality, gravity may play a role since ultimately separation is achieved through buoyancy induced rising of the bubbles. This effect has been included in several collision models, which have remained without a proper validation thus far due to a scarcity of available data. We therefore conduct direct numerical simulations of bubble and particles in homogeneous isotropic turbulence with various Stokes, Froude, and Reynolds numbers using the point-particle approximation. Generally, we find that turbulence enhances the collision rate compared to the pure relative settling case by increasing the collision velocity. Surprisingly, however, we observe that for certain parameters the collision rate is lower with turbulence compared to without. This is due to turbulence-induced bubble-particle spatial segregation, which is most prevalent at weak relative gravity and decreases as gravitational effects become more dominant, and reduced bubble slip velocity in turbulence. The existing bubble-particle collision models only qualitatively capture the trends in our numerical data. To improve on this, we extend the model by Dodin &amp; Elperin (Phys. Fluids, vol. 14, no. 8, 2002, pp.2921-2924) to the bubble-particle case and found excellent quantitative agreement for small Stokes numbers when segregation is accounted for.</description>

      <title>Highly deformable flapping membrane wings suppress the leading edge vortex in hover to perform better</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Airborne insects flap their wings to create a leading edge vortex on top of their wings which aids to keep them aloft. The leading edge vortex is a coherent accumulation of vorticity and a low pressure region which enhances the lift that is generated by flapping wings compared to fixed wings with the same geometries. In this study, we present a flexible membrane wing design for flapping wing flight that passively deforms under fluid dynamic loading and maintains a positive camber during the front and backstroke in hover. We observe experimentally that the unsteady deformation of the wing suppresses the formation of a coherent leading edge vortex as flexibility increases. At the lift and energy optimal aeroelastic conditions, there is no leading edge vortex anymore. Instead, the vorticity accumulates in a bound shear layer covering the wing's upper surface from the leading to the trailing edge. Despite the absence of a leading edge vortex, the optimal flexible membrane wings show enhanced lift and power economy compared to their rigid counterparts. We relate the force production on the wings with their deformation through scaling analyses. Additionally, we identify the geometric angles at the leading and trailing edges as observable indicators of the flow state and use them to map out the transitions of the flow topology and their aerodynamic performance for a wide range of aeroelastic conditions.</description>

      <title>Data-driven prediction of large-scale spatiotemporal chaos with distributed low-dimensional models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex chaotic dynamics, seen in natural and industrial systems like turbulent flows and weather patterns, often span vast spatial domains with interactions across scales. Accurately capturing these features requires a high-dimensional state space to resolve all the time and spatial scales. For dissipative systems the dynamics lie on a finite-dimensional manifold with fewer degrees of freedom. Thus, by building reduced-order data-driven models in manifold coordinates, we can capture the essential behavior of chaotic systems. Unfortunately, these tend to be formulated globally rendering them less effective for large spatial systems. In this context, we present a data-driven low-dimensional modeling approach to tackle the complexities of chaotic motion, Markovian dynamics, multi-scale behavior, and high numbers of degrees of freedom within large spatial domains. Our methodology involves a parallel scheme of decomposing a spatially extended system into a sequence of local `patches', and constructing a set of coupled, local low-dimensional dynamical models for each patch. Here, we choose to construct the set of local models using autoencoders (for constructing the low-dimensional representation) and neural ordinary differential equations, NODE, for learning the evolution equation. Each patch, or local model, shares the same underlying functions (e.g., autoencoders and NODEs) due to the spatial homogeneity of the underlying systems we consider. We apply this method to the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation and 2D Kolmogorov flow, and reduce state dimension by up to two orders of magnitude while accurately capturing both short-term dynamics and long-term statistics.</description>

      <title>Phase Transition From Turbulence To Zonal Flows In The Hasegawa-Wakatani System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The transition between two-dimensional hydrodynamic turbulence and quasi-one-dimensional zonostrophic turbulence is examined in the modified Hasegawa-Wakatani system, which is considered as a minimal model of $\beta$-plane-like drift-wave turbulence with an intrinsic instability. Extensive parameter scans were performed across a wide range of values for the adiabaticity parameter $C$ describing the strength of coupling between the two equations. A sharp transition from 2D isotropic turbulence to a quasi-1D system, dominated by zonal flows, is observed using the fraction of the kinetic energy of the zonal modes as the order parameter, at $C\approx0.1$. It is shown that this transition exhibits a hysteresis behaviour around the transition point, where the adiabaticity parameter plays the role of the control parameter of its non-linear self-organisation. It was also observed that the radial particle flux scales with the adiabaticity parameter following two different power law dependencies in the two regimes. A simple quasi-linear saturation rule, which accounts for the presence of zonal flows, is proposed, and is shown to agree very well with the observed nonlinear fluxes. Motivated by the phenomenon of quasi-one dimensionalisation of the system at high $C$, a number of reduction schemes based on a limited number of modes were investigated and the results were compared to direct numerical simulations. In particular, it was observed that a minimal reduced model consisting of 2 poloidal and 2 radial modes was able to replicate the phase transition behaviour, while further reduction failed to capture it.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Breaking in Chemical Systems: Engineering Complexity through Self-Organization and Marangoni Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18006v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Far from equilibrium, chemical and biological systems can form complex patterns and waves through reaction-diffusion coupling. Fluid motion often tends to disrupt these self-organized concentration patterns. In this study, we investigate the influence of Marangoni-driven flows in a thin layer of fluid ascending the outer surfaces of hydrophilic obstacles on the spatio-temporal dynamics of chemical waves in the modified Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction. Our observations reveal that circular waves originate nearly simultaneously at the obstacles and propagate outward. In a covered setup, where evaporation is minimal, the wavefronts maintain their circular shape. However, in an uncovered setup with significant evaporative cooling, the interplay between surface tension-driven Marangoni flows and gravity destabilizes the wavefronts, creating distinctive flower-like patterns around the obstacles. Our experiments further show that the number of petals formed increases linearly with the obstacle's diameter, though a minimum diameter is required for these instabilities to appear. These findings demonstrate the potential to 'engineer' specific wave patterns, offering a method to control and direct reaction dynamics. This capability is especially important for developing microfluidic devices requiring precise control over chemical wave propagation.</description>

      <title>Supersonic turbulence simulations with GPU-based high-order Discontinuous Galerkin hydrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06841v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the numerical performance of a Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) hydrodynamics implementation when applied to the problem of driven, isothermal supersonic turbulence. While the high-order element-based spectral approach of DG is known to efficiently produce accurate results for smooth problems (exponential convergence with expansion order), physical discontinuities in solutions, like shocks, prove challenging and may significantly diminish DG's applicability to practical astrophysical applications. We consider whether DG is able to retain its accuracy and stability for highly supersonic turbulence, characterized by a network of shocks. We find that our new implementation, which regularizes shocks at sub-cell resolution with artificial viscosity, still performs well compared to standard second-order schemes for moderately high Mach number turbulence, provided we also employ an additional projection of the primitive variables onto the polynomial basis to regularize the extrapolated values at cell interfaces. However, the accuracy advantage of DG diminishes significantly in the highly supersonic regime. Nevertheless, in turbulence simulations with a wide dynamic range that start with supersonic Mach numbers and can resolve the sonic point, the low numerical dissipation of DG schemes still proves advantageous in the subsonic regime. Our results thus support the practical applicability of DG schemes for demanding astrophysical problems that involve strong shocks and turbulence, such as star formation in the interstellar medium. We also discuss the substantial computational cost of DG when going to high order, which needs to be weighted against the resulting accuracy gain. For problems containing shocks, this favours the use of comparatively low DG order.</description>
