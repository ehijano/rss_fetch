      <title>Generalised Burnside and Dixon algorithms for irreducible projective representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on the recently proposed character theory of projective representations of finite groups proposed, we generalise several algorithms for computing character tables and matrices of irreducible linear representations to projective representations. In particular, we present an algorithm based on that of Burnside to compute the characters of all irreducible projective representations of a finite group with a given Schur multiplier, and transpose it to exact integer arithmetic following Dixon's character table algorithm. We also describe an algorithm based on that of Dixon to split a projective representation into irreducible subspaces in floating-point arithmetic, and discuss how it can be used to compute matrices for all projective irreps with a given multiplier. Our algorithms bypass the construction of the representation group of the Schur multiplier, which makes them especially attractive for floating-point computations, where exact values of the multiplier are not necessarily available.</description>

      <title>To Be or Not To Be: Vector ontologies as a truly formal ontological framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since Edmund Husserl coined the term "Formal Ontologies" in the early 20th century, a field that identifies itself with this particular branch of sciences has gained increasing attention. Many authors, and even Husserl himself have developed what they claim to be formal ontologies. I argue that under close inspection, none of these so claimed formal ontologies are truly formal in the Husserlian sense. More concretely, I demonstrate that they violate the two most important notions of formal ontology as developed in Husserl's Logical Investigations, namely a priori validity independent of perception and formalism as the total absence of content. I hence propose repositioning the work previously understood as formal ontology as the foundational ontology it really is. This is to recognize the potential of a truly formal ontology in the Husserlian sense. Specifically, I argue that formal ontology following his conditions, allows us to formulate ontological structures, which could capture what is more objectively without presupposing a particular framework arising from perception. I further argue that the ability to design the formal structure deliberately allows us to create highly scalable and interoperable information artifacts. As concrete evidence, I showcase that a class of formal ontology, which uses the axioms of vector spaces, is able to express most of the conceptualizations found in foundational ontologies. Most importantly, I argue that many information systems, specifically artificial intelligence, are likely already using some type of vector ontologies to represent reality in their internal worldviews and elaborate on the evidence that humans do as well. I hence propose a thorough investigation of the ability of vector ontologies to act as a human-machine interoperable ontological framework that allows us to understand highly sophisticated machines and machines to understand us.</description>

      <title>Linearized Polynomial Chinese remainder codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new family of codes relevent for rank and sum-rank metrics. These codes are based on an effective Chinese remainders theorem for linearized polynomials over finite fields. We propose a decoding algorithm for some instances of these codes.</description>

      <title>A New Bound on Cofactors of Sparse Polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.03885v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that for polynomials $f, g, h \in \mathbb{Z}[x]$ satisfying $f = gh$ and $f(0) \neq 0$, the $\ell_2$-norm of the cofactor $h$ is bounded by $\|h\|_2 \leq \|f\|_1 \cdot\left( \widetilde{O}\left(\|g\|_0^3 \frac{\text{deg }{(f)}^2}{\sqrt{\text{deg }{(g)}}}\right)\right)^{\|g\|_0 - 1}$, where $\|g\|_0$ is the number of nonzero coefficients of $g$ (its sparsity). We also obtain similar results for polynomials over $\mathbb{C}$.
  This result significantly improves upon previously known exponential bounds (in $\text{deg }{(f)}$) for general polynomials. It further implies that, under exact division, the polynomial division algorithm runs in quasi-linear time with respect to the input size and the number of terms in the quotient $h$. This resolves a long-standing open problem concerning the exact divisibility of sparse polynomials.
  In particular, our result demonstrates a quadratic separation between the runtime (and representation size) of exact and non-exact divisibility by sparse polynomials. Notably, prior to our work, it was not even known whether the representation size of the quotient polynomial could be bounded by a sub-quadratic function of its number of terms, specifically of $\text{deg }{(f)}$.</description>
