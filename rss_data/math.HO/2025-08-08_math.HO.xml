      <title>Alg\`ebre lin\'eaire</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: After the language of module and theirs morphisms, this short course presents matricial calculus and determinants in a commutative ring as appliction of ``remarquable identities'' in the ring of polynomials with integer coefficients with variable coefficients and second member of the ``general Gauss method'' requiring the factoriality of such polynomial rings, here obtained by a modification of Zermolo's proof of the factoriality of the integers. As third part, using the, today almost forgotten, presentation in the first edition of N. Bourbaki's Algebra of rational structures for a subfield, one gets, without central simple algebras, the baba of skewfields, and the theorems of Wederburn and Erd\"os-Kaplanski (commutativity of finite fields and dimension of the dual).</description>

      <title>Brushstrokes and Tensor Products: Painting with a Monoidal Category</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article offers an intuitive introduction to monoidal categories through the lens of painting, presenting abstract mathematical concepts with visual and tactile analogies. Aimed at curious undergraduates and non-specialists, it seeks to demystify category theory by showing how ideas like the tensor product, associators, and braidings can be understood as compositional tools on a canvas.</description>

      <title>Is mathematics like a game?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12478v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We re-examine the old question to what extent mathematics may be compared with a game. Mainly inspired by Hilbert and Wittgenstein, our answer is that mathematics is something like a rhododendron of language games, where the rules are inferential. The pure side of mathematics is essentially formalist, where we propose that truth is not carried by theorems corresponding to whatever independent reality and arrived at through proof, but is defined by correctness of rule-following (and as such is objective given these rules). Goedel's theorems, which are often seen as a threat to formalist philosophies of mathematics, actually strengthen our concept of truth. The applied side of mathematics arises from two practices: first, the dual nature of axiomatization as taking from heuristic practices like physics and informal mathematics whilst giving proofs and logical analysis; and second, the ability of using the inferential role of theorems to make surrogative inferences about natural phenomena. Our framework is pluralist, combining various (non-referential) philosophies of mathematics.</description>
