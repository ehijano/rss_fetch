      <title>Obviously Strategy-Proof Multi-Dimensional Allocation and the Value of Choice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A principal must allocate a set of heterogeneous tasks (or objects) among multiple agents. The principal has preferences over the allocation. Each agent has preferences over which tasks they are assigned, which are their private information. The principal is constrained by the fact that each agent has the right to demand some status-quo task assignment. I characterize the conditions under which the principal can gain by delegating some control over the assignment to the agents. Within a large class of delegation mechanisms, I then characterize those that are obviously strategy-proof (OSP), and provide guidance for choosing among OSP mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Mechanism Design without Monetary Transfers: A Queueing Theory Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the design of optimal allocation mechanisms in an environment where agents and goods arrive stochastically. Agents have private types that determine the principal payoff. Either agents or goods can be held in a queue at a flow cost until allocation. The principal cannot use monetary transfers, but can verify agents types at a cost. We characterize the optimal mechanism at the steady state of the system. It is a dynamic threshold mechanism in which the principal sets type thresholds for agent admission and goods allocation. These thresholds depend on the current state of the mechanism. The model applies to public programs such as public housing and grant allocation, and to allocation problems within organizations such as capital budgeting.</description>

      <title>Learning about a changing state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03607v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A long-lived Bayesian agent observes costly signals of a time-varying state. He chooses the signals' precisions sequentially, balancing their costs and marginal informativeness. I compare the optimal myopic and forward-looking precisions when the state follows a Brownian motion. I also compare the myopic precisions induced by other Gaussian processes.</description>

      <title>Data Trade and Consumer Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12457v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies optimal mechanisms for collecting and trading data. Consumers benefit from revealing information about their tastes to a service provider because this improves the service. However, the information is also valuable to a third party as it may extract more revenue from the consumer in another market called the product market. The paper characterizes the constrained optimal mechanism for the service provider subject to incentive feasibility. It is shown that although the service provider sometimes sells no information or only partial information in order to preserve profits in the service market, selling full information is optimal when the data-sourcing market is highly differentiated. Moreover, a ban on data trade may reduce social welfare because it makes it harder to price discriminate in the product market. Instead, reducing the intermediary's bargaining power can protect privacy without hurting social welfare, which suggests that the regulation of market power is more efficient than the regulation of data sharing.</description>

      <title>Long-Run Behavior of Equilibrium in Tirole (1985)'s Model with Dividend-Paying Asset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16560v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the classic paper of Tirole "Asset Bubbles and Overlapping Generations" (1985, Econometrica), which shows that the emergence of asset bubbles solves the capital over-accumulation problem. While Tirole's main insight holds with pure bubbles (assets without dividends), we argue that his original analysis with a dividend-paying asset contains some issues. We provide a fairly complete analysis of Tirole's model with general dividends such as equilibrium existence, uniqueness, and long-run behavior under weaker but explicit assumptions and complement with examples based on closed-form solutions. Some of the claims in Tirole (1985) require qualifications including (i) after the introduction of an asset with negligible dividends, the economy may collapse towards zero capital stock ("resource curse") and (ii) the necessity of bubbles is less clear-cut.</description>

      <title>Comment on 'Asset Bubbles and Overlapping Generations'</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12477v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tirole (1985) studied an overlapping generations model with capital accumulation and showed that the emergence of asset bubbles solves the capital over-accumulation problem. His Proposition 1(c) claims that if the dividend growth rate is above the bubbleless interest rate (the steady-state interest rate in the economy without the asset) but below the population growth rate, then bubbles are necessary in the sense that there exists no bubbleless equilibrium but there exists a unique bubbly equilibrium. We show that this result (as stated) is incorrect by presenting an example economy that satisfies all assumptions of Proposition 1(c) but its unique equilibrium is bubbleless. We also restore Proposition 1(c) under the additional assumptions that initial capital is sufficiently large and dividends are sufficiently small. We show through examples that these conditions are essential.</description>

      <title>Screening with damages and ordeals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04456v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A welfare-maximizing designer allocates two kinds of goods using two wasteful screening instruments: ordeals, which enter agents' utilities additively, and damages, which harm agents in proportion to their values for the goods. If agents have common valuations for one of the goods, damages always lead to Pareto-dominated mechanisms: any allocation using damages can be implemented with ordeals alone, while leaving higher rents to inframarginal types. However, damages can be optimal when agents' valuations for both goods are heterogeneous: with multidimensional types, the two devices differ in how they sort agents into the available options, and optimal sorting can sometimes require damages. I nevertheless identify distributional conditions under which damages are not optimal. In those cases, the optimal mechanism produces an efficient allocation by posting ``market-clearing'' ordeals for each good.</description>
