      <title>Two-color Ytterbium MOT in a compact dual-chamber setup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an experimental scheme for producing ultracold Ytterbium atoms in a compact dual-chamber setup. A dispenser-loaded two-dimensional (2D) magneto-optical trap (MOT) using permanent magnets and operating on the broad $^1S_0\to {}^1P_1$ singlet transition delivers over $10^7$ atoms per second through a differential pumping stage into a three-dimensional (3D) MOT. The two-color 3D MOT uses the broad singlet transition to accumulate $\sim\!2\times 10^7$ atoms of $^{174}\text{Yb}$ within $2.5~\text{s}$ and subsequently the narrow $^1S_0\to {}^3P_1$ intercombination line to cool the atomic cloud to below $10~\mathrm{\mu K}$. We report optimized parameters for each stage of the atom collection sequence, achieving high transfer efficiency. We find that shelving into the triplet state during the broad-transition MOT almost doubles the number of trapped atoms.</description>

      <title>Quantum simulation of dynamical gauge theories in periodically driven Rydberg atom arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulating quantum dynamics of lattice gauge theories (LGTs) is an exciting frontier in quantum science. Programmable quantum simulators based on neutral atom arrays are a promising approach to achieve this goal, since strong Rydberg blockade interactions can be used to naturally create low energy subspaces that can encode local gauge constraints. However, realizing regimes of LGTs where both matter and gauge fields exhibit significant dynamics requires the presence of tunable multi-body interactions such as those associated with ring exchange, which are challenging to realize directly. Here, we develop a method for generating such interactions based on time-periodic driving. Our approach utilizes controlled deviations from time-reversed trajectories, which are accessible in constrained PXP-type models via the application of frequency modulated global pulses. We show that such driving gives rise to a family of effective Hamiltonians with multi-body interactions whose strength is non-perturbative in their respective operator weight. We apply this approach to a two-dimensional U(1) LGT on the Kagome lattice, where we engineer strong six-body magnetic plaquette terms that are tunable relative to the kinetic energy of matter excitations, demonstrating access to previously unexplored dynamical regimes. Potential generalizations and prospects for experimental implementations are discussed.</description>

      <title>Floquet engineering of interactions and entanglement in periodically driven Rydberg chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutral atom arrays driven into Rydberg states constitute a promising approach for realizing programmable quantum systems. Enabled by strong interactions associated with Rydberg blockade, they allow for simulation of complex spin models and quantum dynamics. We introduce a new Floquet engineering technique for systems in the blockade regime that provides control over novel forms of interactions and entanglement dynamics in such systems. Our approach is based on time-dependent control of Rydberg laser detuning and leverages perturbations around periodic many-body trajectories as resources for operator spreading. These time-evolved operators are utilized as a basis for engineering interactions in the effective Hamiltonian describing the stroboscopic evolution. As an example, we show how our method can be used to engineer strong spin exchange, consistent with the blockade, in a one-dimensional chain, enabling the exploration of gapless Luttinger liquid phases. In addition, we demonstrate that combining gapless excitations with Rydberg blockade can lead to dynamic generation of large-scale multi-partite entanglement. Experimental feasibility and possible generalizations are discussed.</description>

      <title>Path-integral calculation of the third dielectric virial coefficient of helium based on ab initio three-body polarizability and dipole surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a surface for the electric dipole moment of three interacting helium atoms and use it, together with state-of-the-art potential and polarizability surfaces, to compute the third dielectric virial coefficient, $C_\varepsilon$, for both $^4$He and $^3$He isotopes. Our results agree with previously published data computed using an approximated form for the three-body polarizability, and are extended to the low-temperature regime by including exchange effects. Additionally, the uncertainty of $C_\varepsilon$ is rigorously determined for the first time by propagating the uncertainties of the potential and polarizability surfaces; this uncertainty is much larger than the contribution from the dipole-moment surface to $C_\varepsilon$. Our results compare reasonably well with the limited experimental data. The first-principles values of $C_\epsilon$ computed in this work will enhance the accuracy of primary temperature and pressure metrology based on measurements of the dielectric constant of helium.</description>

      <title>A non-Hermitian quantum mechanics approach for extracting and emulating continuum physics based on bound-state-like calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work develops a new method for computing a finite quantum system's continuum states and observables by applying a subspace projection (or reduced basis) method used in model order reduction studies to ``discretize'' the system's continuous spectrum. The method extracts the continuum physics from solving Schr\"odinger equations with bound-state-like boundary conditions and emulates this extraction in the space of the input parameters. This parameter emulation can readily be adapted to emulate other continuum calculations as well, e.g., those based on complex energy or Lorentz integral transform methods. Here, I give an overview of the key aspects of the formalism and some informative findings from numerical experimentation with two- and three-body systems, which indicates the non-Hermitian quantum mechanics nature of the method. A potential connection with (near-)optimal rational approximation studied in Math literature is also discussed. Further details are provided in a separate paper.</description>

      <title>Laser cooling of a fermionic molecule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12145v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Only bosonic molecular species have been directly laser cooled to date, primarily due to an abundance of bosonic isotopes in nature and to their simpler hyperfine structure. Fermionic molecules provide new opportunities for ultracold chemistry, quantum simulation, and precision measurements. Here we report direct laser cooling of a fermionic molecular isotopologue, calcium monodeuteride (CaD). With a nuclear spin I = 1, only 5 hyperfine states need to be addressed for rotational closure in optical cycling. These hyperfine states are unresolved for typical experimental linewidths. We present a method for efficiently producing alkaline-earth metal hydrides and deuterides. We demonstrate rotational closure and show magnetically assisted Sisyphus cooling in one dimension for a beam of CaD molecules. Our results indicate that the experimental complexity for laser cooling CaD is similar to that of calcium monohydride (CaH). Laser cooling of CaD is a promising first step for production of ultracold and trapped atomic deuterium.</description>

      <title>Boson sampling with ultracold atoms in a programmable optical lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.12253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.12253v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sampling from a quantum distribution can be exponentially hard for classical computers and yet could be performed efficiently by a noisy intermediate-scale quantum device. A prime example of a distribution that is hard to sample is given by the output states of a linear interferometer traversed by $N$ identical boson particles. Here, we propose a scheme to implement such a boson sampling machine with ultracold atoms in a polarization-synthesized optical lattice. We experimentally demonstrate the basic building block of such a machine by revealing the Hong-Ou-Mandel interference of two bosonic atoms in a four-mode interferometer. To estimate the sampling rate for large $N$, we develop a theoretical model based on a master equation that accounts for particle losses, but not include technical errors. Our results show that atomic samplers have the potential to achieve quantum advantage over today's best supercomputers with $N \gtrsim 40$.</description>

      <title>Microwave-optical spectroscopy of Rydberg excitons in the ultrastrong driving regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18674v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the ultrastrong driving of Rydberg excitons in Cu$_2$O by a microwave field. The effect of the field is studied using optical absorption spectroscopy, and through the observation of sidebands on the transmitted laser light. A model based on Floquet theory is constructed to study the system beyond the rotating wave approximation. We obtain near quantitative agreement between theory and experiment across a 16-fold range of microwave field strengths spanning from the perturbative to the ultrastrong driving regime. Compared to Rydberg atoms, the large non-radiative widths of Rydberg excitons leads to new behaviour such as the emergence of an absorption continuum without ionization.</description>
