      <title>A networked small-gain theorem based on discrete-time diagonal stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new sufficient condition for finite-gain $L_2$ input-to-output stability of a networked system. The condition requires a matrix, that combines information on the $L_2$ gains of the sub-systems and their interconnections, to be discrete-time diagonally stable (DTDS). We show that the new result generalizes the standard small gain theorem for the negative feedback connection of two sub-systems. An important advantage of the new result is that known sufficient conditions for DTDS can be applied to derive sufficient conditions for networked input-to-output stability. We demonstrate this using several examples. We also derive a new necessary and sufficient condition for a matrix that is a rank one perturbation of a Schur diagonal matrix to be DTDS.</description>

      <title>Digital Twin for Autonomous Surface Vessels: Enabler for Safe Maritime Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous surface vessels (ASVs) are becoming increasingly significant in enhancing the safety and sustainability of maritime operations. To ensure the reliability of modern control algorithms utilized in these vessels, digital twins (DTs) provide a robust framework for conducting safe and effective simulations within a virtual environment. Digital twins are generally classified on a scale from 0 to 5, with each level representing a progression in complexity and functionality: Level 0 (Standalone) employs offline modeling techniques; Level 1 (Descriptive) integrates sensors and online modeling to enhance situational awareness; Level 2 (Diagnostic) focuses on condition monitoring and cybersecurity; Level 3 (Predictive) incorporates predictive analytics; Level 4 (Prescriptive) embeds decision-support systems; and Level 5 (Autonomous) enables advanced functionalities such as collision avoidance and path following. These digital representations not only provide insights into the vessel's current state and operational efficiency but also predict future scenarios and assess life endurance. By continuously updating with real-time sensor data, the digital twin effectively corrects modeling errors and enhances decision-making processes. Since DTs are key enablers for complex autonomous systems, this paper introduces a comprehensive methodology for establishing a digital twin framework specifically tailored for ASVs. Through a detailed literature survey, we explore existing state-of-the-art enablers across the defined levels, offering valuable recommendations for future research and development in this rapidly evolving field.</description>

      <title>Privacy Preserving Mechanisms for Coordinating Airspace Usage in Advanced Air Mobility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) operations are expected to transform air transportation while challenging current air traffic management practices. By introducing a novel market-based mechanism, we address the problem of on-demand allocation of capacity-constrained airspace to AAM vehicles with heterogeneous and private valuations. We model airspace and air infrastructure as a collection of contiguous regions with constraints on the number of vehicles that simultaneously enter, stay, or exit each region. Vehicles request access to the airspace with trajectories spanning multiple regions at different times. We use the graph structure of our airspace model to formulate the allocation problem as a path allocation problem on a time-extended graph. To ensure the cost information of AAM vehicles remains private, we introduce a novel mechanism that allocates each vehicle a budget of "air-credits" and anonymously charges prices for traversing the edges of the time-extended graph. We seek to compute a competitive equilibrium that ensures that: (i) capacity constraints are satisfied, (ii) a strictly positive resource price implies that the sector capacity is fully utilized, and (iii) the allocation is integral and optimal for each AAM vehicle given current prices, without requiring access to individual vehicle utilities. However, a competitive equilibrium with integral allocations may not always exist. We provide sufficient conditions for the existence and computation of a fractional-competitive equilibrium, where allocations can be fractional. Building on these theoretical insights, we propose a distributed, iterative, two-step algorithm that: 1) computes a fractional competitive equilibrium, and 2) derives an integral allocation from this equilibrium. We validate the effectiveness of our approach in allocating trajectories for two emerging urban air mobility services: drone delivery and air taxis.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Preserving Resilient Vector Consensus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies privacy-preserving resilient vector consensus in multi-agent systems against faulty agents, where normal agents can achieve consensus within the convex hull of their initial states while protecting state vectors from being disclosed. Specifically, we consider a modification of an existing algorithm known as Approximate Distributed Robust Convergence Using Centerpoints (ADRC), i.e., Privacy-Preserving ADRC (PP-ADRC). Under PP-ADRC, each normal agent introduces multivariate Gaussian noise to its state during each iteration. We first provide sufficient conditions to ensure that all normal agents' states can achieve mean square convergence under PP-ADRC. Then, we analyze convergence accuracy from two perspectives, i.e., the Mahalanobis distance of the final value from its expectation and the Hausdorff distance based alteration of the convex hull caused by noise when only partial dimensions are added with noise. Then, we employ concentrated geo-privacy to characterize privacy preservation and conduct a thorough comparison with differential privacy. Finally, numerical simulations demonstrate the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Static structural behaviour of wire bearings: comparison with conventional bearings and study of design and operational parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In wire bearings the rolling process occurs on raceways machined on steel wires, and the rings are made of light materials such as aluminium. This particular architecture provides both weight and inertia savings, but also significantly different behaviour with respect to conventional bearings. For this reason, specific design and analysis tools must be developed; as a first step, this work uses Finite Element models to study the influence of different parameters on the static structural response of wire bearings. Thus, bearing stiffness, load capacity and contact status (contact force and angle, and ellipse truncation) have been evaluated for several combinations of conformity, friction coefficient and boundary conditions. The results have been compared with an equivalent conventional bearing, shedding light on the main structural features of wire bearings.</description>

      <title>Wire twisting stiffness modelling with application in wire race ball bearings. Derivation of analytical formula and Finite Element validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since Erich Franke produced the first wire race bearings in 1934, they have not been used profusely until these last years in applications such as computerized tomography, X-ray machines, wheels with direct drive... where low weight and inertia constraints are important. Accounting for the structural behaviour of the bearing, there exist a key phenomenon not present in other kind of more known bearings, which is the wire twisting under load; this wire twisting steers the force transmission among the bearing rings and the rolling elements. In this sense, for design and selection purposes, if a complete structural model of the bearing is to be done in an efficient way to assess bearing stiffness and load distribution over the rolling elements, the twisting stiffness of the wire has to be modelled properly. This work develops a simple analytical expression of that stiffness to be used in structural models, derived from an evidence-based deformation assumption at differential level for the section of the wire.</description>

      <title>Analyzing Ultra-Low Inter-Core Crosstalk Fibers in Band and Space Division Multiplexing EONs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the ultra-low inter-core crosstalk working zone of terrestrial multi-band and multi-core fiber (MCF) elastic optical networks (EONs), the ICXT in all channels of all cores remains below the ICXT threshold of the highest modulation format level (64QAM) for long-haul distances (10000 km). This paper analyzes the performance of this type of MCF in multi-band EONs (MB-EONs). We investigate two band and space division multiplexing (BSDM) scenarios: MCF and a bundle of multi-fiber pairs (BuMFP). Furthermore, the UL-ICXT performance of two MCFs, one with the standard cladding diameter (CD = 125 micrometers) with 4 cores and another with a nonstandard larger CD with 7 cores, is evaluated in the US backbone network. Our findings show that, with careful design of the MCFs physical structure, even with a standard CD, it is possible to achieve UL-ICXT in C, L, and S-band long-haul BSDM EONs. Additionally, the simulation results show that network throughput for BSDM EONs with MCFs in the UL-ICXT regime is up to 12 percent higher than the BuMFP scenario, with capacity increasing linearly with the number of cores.</description>

      <title>Reachability analysis for piecewise affine systems with neural network-based controllers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural networks (NN) have been successfully applied to approximate various types of complex control laws, resulting in low-complexity NN-based controllers that are fast to evaluate. However, when approximating control laws using NN, performance and stability guarantees of the original controller may not be preserved. Recently, it has been shown that it is possible to provide such guarantees for linear systems with NN-based controllers by analyzing the approximation error with respect to a stabilizing base-line controller or by computing reachable sets of the closed-loop system. The latter has the advantage of not requiring a base-line controller. In this paper, we show that similar ideas can be used to analyze the closed-loop behavior of piecewise affine (PWA) systems with an NN-based controller. Our approach builds on computing over-approximations of reachable sets using mixed-integer linear programming, which allows to certify that the closed-loop system converges to a small set containing the origin while satisfying input and state constraints. We also show how to modify a given NN-based controller to ensure asymptotic stability for the controlled PWA system.</description>

      <title>Koopman-based control using sum-of-squares optimization: Improved stability guarantees and data efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel controller design approach for unknown nonlinear systems using the Koopman operator. In particular, we use the recently proposed stability- and certificate-oriented extended dynamic mode decomposition (SafEDMD) architecture to generate a data-driven bilinear surrogate model with certified error bounds. Then, by accounting for the obtained error bounds in a controller design based on the bilinear system, one can guarantee closed-loop stability for the true nonlinear system. While existing approaches over-approximate the bilinearity of the surrogate model, thus introducing conservatism and providing only local guarantees, we explicitly account for the bilinearity by using sum-of-squares (SOS) optimization in the controller design. More precisely, we parametrize a rational controller stabilizing the error-affected bilinear surrogate model and, consequently, the underlying nonlinear system. The resulting SOS optimization problem provides explicit data-driven controller design conditions for unknown nonlinear systems based on semidefinite programming. Our approach significantly reduces conservatism by establishing a larger region of attraction and improved data efficiency. The proposed method is evaluated using numerical examples, demonstrating its advantages over existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Direct Adaptive Control of Grid-Connected Power Converters via Output-Feedback Data-Enabled Policy Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Power electronic converters are gradually becoming the main components of modern power systems due to the increasing integration of renewable energy sources. However, power converters may become unstable when interacting with the complex and time-varying power grid. To deal with this problem, an adaptive control design scheme for power converters is preferable, which can capture the closed-loop dynamical interaction between the converter and the grid via online data. In this paper, we propose an adaptive data-driven control method, called data-enabled policy optimization (DeePO), to stabilize power converters by using only online input-output data. Our contributions are threefold. First, we propose a covariance parameterization of partially observed linear systems with input-output data. Second, we develop a DeePO algorithm, which updates the parameterized policy with data-based gradient descent to achieve computationally efficient adaptive control. Third, we use high-fidelity simulations to verify that DeePO can effectively stabilize grid-connected power converters and quickly adapt to the changes in the power grid.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Virtual Inertia and Damping Control for Zero-Inertia Grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper virtual synchronous generation (VSG) approach is investigated in application to low- and zero-inertia grids operated by grid-forming (GFM) inverters. The key idea here is to introduce dynamic inertia and damping constants in order to keep power gird stable during different types of faults, islanding or large power balance oscillations. In order to achieve such robustness, we introduce frequency and phase angle shift functions to VSG along with dynamics virtual generator parameters. The stability of such approach is theoretically proven and theoretical results are supported by detailed case studies in RTDS (Real-Time Digital Simulator) NovaCor 1.0 with GFM inverters dynamics simulated with 1-3 microseconds timestep using two-level universal inverter model. Case studies include all aforementioned types of faults and demonstrate increased power grid robustness and survivability in comparison with traditional synchronous generation of comparable size.</description>

      <title>Predicting and Publishing Accurate Imbalance Prices Using Monte Carlo Tree Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing reliance on renewable energy sources, particularly solar and wind, has introduced challenges due to their uncontrollable production. This complicates maintaining the electrical grid balance, prompting some transmission system operators in Western Europe to implement imbalance tariffs that penalize unsustainable power deviations. These tariffs create an implicit demand response framework to mitigate grid instability. Yet, several challenges limit active participation. In Belgium, for example, imbalance prices are only calculated at the end of each 15-minute settlement period, creating high risk due to price uncertainty. This risk is further amplified by the inherent volatility of imbalance prices, discouraging participation. Although transmission system operators provide minute-based price predictions, the system imbalance volatility makes accurate price predictions challenging to obtain and requires sophisticated techniques. Moreover, publishing price estimates can prompt participants to adjust their schedules, potentially affecting the system balance and the final price, adding further complexity. To address these challenges, we propose a Monte Carlo Tree Search method that publishes accurate imbalance prices while accounting for potential response actions. Our approach models the system dynamics using a neural network forecaster and a cluster of virtual batteries controlled by reinforcement learning agents. Compared to Belgium's current publication method, our technique improves price accuracy by 20.4% under ideal conditions and by 12.8% in more realistic scenarios. This research addresses an unexplored, yet crucial problem, positioning this paper as a pioneering work in analyzing the potential of more advanced imbalance price publishing techniques.</description>

      <title>A Comparative Study of Deep Reinforcement Learning for Crop Production Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crop production management is essential for optimizing yield and minimizing a field's environmental impact to crop fields, yet it remains challenging due to the complex and stochastic processes involved. Recently, researchers have turned to machine learning to address these complexities. Specifically, reinforcement learning (RL), a cutting-edge approach designed to learn optimal decision-making strategies through trial and error in dynamic environments, has emerged as a promising tool for developing adaptive crop management policies. RL models aim to optimize long-term rewards by continuously interacting with the environment, making them well-suited for tackling the uncertainties and variability inherent in crop management. Studies have shown that RL can generate crop management policies that compete with, and even outperform, expert-designed policies within simulation-based crop models. In the gym-DSSAT crop model environment, one of the most widely used simulators for crop management, proximal policy optimization (PPO) and deep Q-networks (DQN) have shown promising results. However, these methods have not yet been systematically evaluated under identical conditions. In this study, we evaluated PPO and DQN against static baseline policies across three different RL tasks, fertilization, irrigation, and mixed management, provided by the gym-DSSAT environment. To ensure a fair comparison, we used consistent default parameters, identical reward functions, and the same environment settings. Our results indicate that PPO outperforms DQN in fertilization and irrigation tasks, while DQN excels in the mixed management task. This comparative analysis provides critical insights into the strengths and limitations of each approach, advancing the development of more effective RL-based crop management strategies.</description>

      <title>Designing Robust Cyber-Defense Agents with Evolving Behavior Trees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern network defense can benefit from the use of autonomous systems, offloading tedious and time-consuming work to agents with standard and learning-enabled components. These agents, operating on critical network infrastructure, need to be robust and trustworthy to ensure defense against adaptive cyber-attackers and, simultaneously, provide explanations for their actions and network activity. However, learning-enabled components typically use models, such as deep neural networks, that are not transparent in their high-level decision-making leading to assurance challenges. Additionally, cyber-defense agents must execute complex long-term defense tasks in a reactive manner that involve coordination of multiple interdependent subtasks. Behavior trees are known to be successful in modelling interpretable, reactive, and modular agent policies with learning-enabled components. In this paper, we develop an approach to design autonomous cyber defense agents using behavior trees with learning-enabled components, which we refer to as Evolving Behavior Trees (EBTs). We learn the structure of an EBT with a novel abstract cyber environment and optimize learning-enabled components for deployment. The learning-enabled components are optimized for adapting to various cyber-attacks and deploying security mechanisms. The learned EBT structure is evaluated in a simulated cyber environment, where it effectively mitigates threats and enhances network visibility. For deployment, we develop a software architecture for evaluating EBT-based agents in computer network defense scenarios. Our results demonstrate that the EBT-based agent is robust to adaptive cyber-attacks and provides high-level explanations for interpreting its decisions and actions.</description>

      <title>Chance-Constrained Convex MPC for Robust Quadruped Locomotion Under Parametric and Additive Uncertainties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in quadrupedal locomotion have focused on improving stability and performance across diverse environments. However, existing methods often lack adequate safety analysis and struggle to adapt to varying payloads and complex terrains, typically requiring extensive tuning. To overcome these challenges, we propose a Chance-Constrained Model Predictive Control (CCMPC) framework that explicitly models payload and terrain variability as distributions of parametric and additive disturbances within the single rigid body dynamics (SRBD) model. Our approach ensures safe and consistent performance under uncertain dynamics by expressing the model friction cone constraints, which define the feasible set of ground reaction forces, as chance constraints. Moreover, we solve the resulting stochastic control problem using a computationally efficient quadratic programming formulation. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations of quadrupedal locomotion across varying payloads and complex terrains demonstrate that CCMPC significantly outperforms two competitive benchmarks: Linear MPC (LMPC) and MPC with hand-tuned safety margins to maintain stability, reduce foot slippage, and track the center of mass. Hardware experiments on the Unitree Go1 robot show successful locomotion across various indoor and outdoor terrains with unknown loads exceeding 50% of the robot body weight, despite no additional parameter tuning. A video of the results and accompanying code can be found at: https://cc-mpc.github.io/.</description>

Abstract: This paper describes open-source scientific contributions in python surrounding the numerical solutions to hyperbolic Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) partial differential equations viz., their implicit representation on co-dimension one surfaces; dynamics evolution with levelsets; spatial derivatives; total variation diminishing Runge-Kutta integration schemes; and their applications to the theory of reachable sets. They are increasingly finding applications in multiple research domains such as reinforcement learning, robotics, control engineering and automation. We describe the library components, illustrate usage with an example, and provide comparisons with existing implementations. This GPU-accelerated package allows for easy portability to many modern libraries for the numerical analyses of the HJ equations. We also provide a CPU implementation in python that is significantly faster than existing alternatives.</description>

      <title>Can Robotic Cues Manipulate Human Decisions? Exploring Consensus Building via Bias-Controlled Non-linear Opinion Dynamics and Robotic Eye Gaze Mediated Interaction in Human-Robot Teaming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although robots are becoming more advanced with human-like anthropomorphic features and decision-making abilities to improve collaboration, the active integration of humans into this process remains under-explored. This article presents the first experimental study exploring decision-making interactions between humans and robots with visual cues from robotic eyes, which can dynamically influence human opinion formation. The cues generated by robotic eyes gradually guide human decisions towards alignment with the robot's choices. Both human and robot decision-making processes are modeled as non-linear opinion dynamics with evolving biases. To examine these opinion dynamics under varying biases, we conduct numerical parametric and equilibrium continuation analyses using tuned parameters designed explicitly for the presented human-robot interaction experiment. Furthermore, to facilitate the transition from disagreement to agreement, we introduced a human opinion observation algorithm integrated with the formation of the robot's opinion, where the robot's behavior is controlled based on its formed opinion. The algorithms developed aim to enhance human involvement in consensus building, fostering effective collaboration between humans and robots. Experiments with 51 participants (N = 51) show that human-robot teamwork can be improved by guiding human decisions using robotic cues. Finally, we provide detailed insights on the effects of trust, cognitive load, and participant demographics on decision-making based on user feedback and post-experiment interviews.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Safe Bipedal Robot Navigation using Linear Discrete Control Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Safe navigation in real-time is an essential task for humanoid robots in real-world deployment. Since humanoid robots are inherently underactuated thanks to unilateral ground contacts, a path is considered safe if it is obstacle-free and respects the robot's physical limitations and underlying dynamics. Existing approaches often decouple path planning from gait control due to the significant computational challenge caused by the full-order robot dynamics. In this work, we develop a unified, safe path and gait planning framework that can be evaluated online in real-time, allowing the robot to navigate clustered environments while sustaining stable locomotion. Our approach uses the popular Linear Inverted Pendulum (LIP) model as a template model to represent walking dynamics. It incorporates heading angles in the model to evaluate kinematic constraints essential for physically feasible gaits properly. In addition, we leverage discrete control barrier functions (DCBF) for obstacle avoidance, ensuring that the subsequent foot placement provides a safe navigation path within clustered environments. To guarantee real-time computation, we use a novel approximation of the DCBF to produce linear DCBF (LDCBF) constraints. We validate the proposed approach in simulation using a Digit robot in randomly generated environments. The results demonstrate that our approach can generate safe gaits for a non-trivial humanoid robot to navigate environments with randomly generated obstacles in real-time.</description>

      <title>Fatigue performance of prosthetic screws used in dental implant restorations: Rolled versus cut threads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Statement of problem. Cold rolling is widely used for screw thread manufacturing in industry but is less common in implant dentistry, where cutting is the preferred manufacturing method. Purpose. The purpose of this in vitro study was to compare the surface finish and mechanical performance of a specific model of prosthetic screw used for direct restorations manufactured by thread rolling and cutting. Material and methods. The thread profiles were measured in an optical measuring machine, the residual stresses in an X-ray diffractometer, the surface finish in a scanning electron microscope, and then fatigue and static load tests were carried out in a direct stress test bench according to the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 14801. Finally, linear regression models and 95% interval confidence bands were calculated and compared through ANCOVA for fatigue tests while the t test was used for statistical comparisons (a=.05). Results. The surface finish was smoother, and compressive residual stresses were higher for the roll-threaded screws. Linear regression models showed a fatigue life 9 times higher for roll-threaded screws (P=1) without affecting static behavior, which showed statistically similar static strengths (P=.54). However, the thread profile in the roll-threaded screws was not accurately reproduced, but this should be easily corrected in future prototypes. Conclusions. Rolling was demonstrated to be a better thread-manufacturing process for prosthetic screws, producing improved surface quality and fatigue behavior.</description>

      <title>Biomechanics-Aware Trajectory Optimization for Navigation during Robotic Physiotherapy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robotic devices hold promise for aiding patients in orthopedic rehabilitation. However, current robotic-assisted physiotherapy methods struggle including biomechanical metrics in their control algorithms, crucial for safe and effective therapy. This paper introduces BATON, a Biomechanics-Aware Trajectory Optimization approach to robotic Navigation of human musculoskeletal loads. The method integrates a high-fidelity musculoskeletal model of the human shoulder into real-time control of robot-patient interaction during rotator cuff tendon rehabilitation. We extract skeletal dynamics and tendon loading information from an OpenSim shoulder model to solve an optimal control problem, generating strain-minimizing trajectories. Trajectories were realized on a healthy subject by an impedance-controlled robot while estimating the state of the subject's shoulder. Target poses were prescribed to design personalized rehabilitation across a wide range of shoulder motion avoiding high-strain areas. BATON was designed with real-time capabilities, enabling continuous trajectory replanning to address unforeseen variations in tendon strain, such as those from changing muscle activation of the subject.</description>

Abstract: The Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) architecture is reshaping the telecommunications landscape by enhancing network flexibility, openness, and intelligence. This paper establishes the requirements, evaluates the design tradeoffs, and introduces a scalable architecture and prototype of an open-source O-RAN experimentation platform within the Aerial Experimentation and Research Platform for Advanced Wireless (AERPAW), an at scale testbed that integrates unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with advanced wireless network technologies, offering experimentation in both outdoor testbed and emulation via a custom digital twin (DT). Through a series of aerial experiments, we evaluate FlexRIC, an open-source RAN Intelligent Controller, within the AERPAW hardware-software platform for network data monitoring, providing valuable insights into the proposed integration and revealing opportunities for leveraging O-RAN to create custom service based optimizations for cellular connected UAVs. We discuss the challenges and potential use cases of this integration and demonstrate the use of a generative artificial intelligence model for generating realistic data based on collected real-world data to support AERPAW's DT.</description>

      <title>Design and control of a robotic payload stabilization mechanism for rocket flights</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The use of parallel manipulators in aerospace engineering has gained significant attention due to their ability to provide improved stability and precision. This paper presents the design, control, and analysis of 'STEWIE', which is a three-degree-of-freedom (DoF) parallel manipulator robot developed by members of the thrustMIT rocketry team, as a payload stabilization mechanism for their sounding rocket, 'Altair'. The goal of the robot was to demonstrate the attitude control of the parallel plate against the continuous change in orientation experienced by the rocket during its flight, stabilizing the payloads. At the same time, the high gravitational forces (G-forces) and vibrations experienced by the sounding rocket are counteracted. A novel design of the mechanism, inspired by a standard Stewart platform, is proposed which was down-scaled to fit inside a 4U CubeSat within its space constraints. The robot uses three micro servo motors to actuate the links that control the alignment of the parallel plate. In addition to the actuation mechanism, a robust control system for its manipulation was developed for the robot. The robot represents a significant advancement in the field of space robotics in the aerospace industry by demonstrating the successful implementation of complex robotic mechanisms in small, confined spaces such as CubeSats, which are standard form factors for large payloads in the aerospace industry.</description>

Abstract: This paper reports a theory of Koopman operators for a class of hybrid dynamical systems with globally asymptotically stable periodic orbits, called hybrid limit-cycling systems. We leverage smooth structures intrinsic to the hybrid dynamical systems, thereby extending the existing theory of Koopman operators for smooth dynamical systems. Rigorous construction of an observable space is carried out to preserve the inherited smooth structures of the hybrid dynamical systems. Complete spectral characterization of the Koopman operators acting on the constructed space is then derived where the existence and uniqueness of their eigenfunctions are ensured. Our results facilitate global analysis of hybrid dynamical systems using the Koopman operator.</description>

      <title>Non-Pyrotechnic Radial Deployment Mechanism for Payloads in Sounding Rockets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19673v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A novel, non-pyrotechnic payload deployment mechanism tailored for sounding rockets is introduced in this research paper. The mechanism addresses the challenge of efficiently and compactly deploying payloads radially during a single launch, featuring a cylindrical carrier structure actuated by a rack-pinion mechanism. Powered by a servo motor, the carrier structure translates to enable radial ejection of payloads. The paper presents the mechanism's design and conducts a comprehensive performance analysis, including structural stability, system dynamics and power requirements. A simulation model is developed to assess payload deployment behavior under various conditions, demonstrating the mechanism's viability and efficiency for deploying multiple payloads within a single sounding rocket launch. The mechanism's adaptability to accommodate diverse payload types, sizes and weights enhances its versatility, while its radial deployment capability allows payloads to be released at different altitudes, offering greater flexibility for scientific experiments. The paper concludes that this innovative payload radial deployment mechanism represents a significant advancement in sounding rocket technology and holds promise for a wide array of applications in both scientific and commercial missions.</description>

      <title>A Safe and Data-efficient Model-based Reinforcement Learning System for HVAC Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12195v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Model-Based Reinforcement Learning (MBRL) has been widely studied for Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) control in buildings. One of the critical challenges is the large amount of data required to effectively train neural networks for modeling building dynamics. This paper presents CLUE, an MBRL system for HVAC control in buildings. CLUE optimizes HVAC operations by integrating a Gaussian Process (GP) model to model building dynamics with uncertainty awareness. CLUE utilizes GP to predict state transitions as Gaussian distributions, effectively capturing prediction uncertainty and enhancing decision-making under sparse data conditions. Our approach employs a meta-kernel learning technique to efficiently set GP kernel hyperparameters using domain knowledge from diverse buildings. This drastically reduces the data requirements typically associated with GP models in HVAC applications. Additionally, CLUE incorporates these uncertainty estimates into a Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) algorithm, enabling the selection of safe, energy-efficient control actions. This uncertainty-aware control strategy evaluates and selects action trajectories based on their predicted impact on energy consumption and human comfort, optimizing operations even under uncertain conditions. Extensive simulations in a five-zone office building demonstrate that CLUE reduces the required training data from hundreds of days to just seven while maintaining robust control performance. It reduces comfort violations by an average of 12.07% compared to existing MBRL methods, without compromising on energy efficiency.</description>

      <title>Optimal planning for heterogeneous autonomous teams with precedence and compatibility constraints and its application on power grid inspection with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20849v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we address the optimal planning of autonomous teams for general purpose tasks including a wide spectrum of situations: from project management of human teams to the coordination of an automated assembly lines, focusing in the automated inspection of power grids. There exist many methods for task planning. However, the vast majority of such methods are conceived for very specific problems or situations and are often based in certain assumptions and simplifications. Consider for example all the different algorithms developed to solve the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) for all the different vehicles and environment characteristics. This means that no robust general planning method exists and that a possible extension of any of them to a more general situation is often not a trivial task. To address this, we propose a new truly general method ultimately based on a generalization of the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). We call this new model the Heterogeneous Multi-worker Task Planning Problem (HMWTPP). It provides a natural framework to model many situations typical in task planning of all kinds. Task-Worker compatibility, precedence/order and time-windows constraints are already encoded into the HMWTPP while it can be easily extended to include weight capacity or battery per node constraints in an intuitive manner. Several classical TSP problems included in the TSPLIB library are solved for validation and performance analysis of HMWTPP showing a comparable numerical performance to that of existing models. In addition, a synthetic example modeling an automated assembly line is analyzed to prove the potential capabilities of the HMWTPP in real-life scenarios. Ultimately, we focus in the computation of the optimal plan of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) specifically in the context of automated inspection of electrical power grids.</description>

Abstract: Socio-technical networks represent emerging cyber-physical infrastructures that are tightly interwoven with human networks. The coupling between human and technical networks presents significant challenges in managing, controlling, and securing these complex, interdependent systems. This paper investigates game-theoretic frameworks for the design and control of socio-technical networks, with a focus on critical applications such as misinformation management, infrastructure optimization, and resilience in socio-cyber-physical systems (SCPS). Core methodologies, including Stackelberg games, mechanism design, and dynamic game theory, are examined as powerful tools for modeling interactions in hierarchical, multi-agent environments. Key challenges addressed include mitigating human-driven vulnerabilities, managing large-scale system dynamics, and countering adversarial threats. By bridging individual agent behaviors with overarching system goals, this work illustrates how the integration of game theory and control theory can lead to robust, resilient, and adaptive socio-technical networks. This paper highlights the potential of these frameworks to dynamically align decentralized agent actions with system-wide objectives of stability, security, and efficiency.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, a novel optimal control-based baseline function is presented for the policy gradient method in deep reinforcement learning (RL). The baseline is obtained by computing the value function of an optimal control problem, which is formed to be closely associated with the RL task. In contrast to the traditional baseline aimed at variance reduction of policy gradient estimates, our work utilizes the optimal control value function to introduce a novel aspect to the role of baseline -- providing guided exploration during policy learning. This aspect is less discussed in prior works. We validate our baseline on robot learning tasks, showing its effectiveness in guided exploration, particularly in sparse reward environments.</description>

      <title>Contraction Theory for Nonlinear Stability Analysis and Learning-based Control: A Tutorial Overview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.00675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.00675v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Contraction theory is an analytical tool to study differential dynamics of a non-autonomous (i.e., time-varying) nonlinear system under a contraction metric defined with a uniformly positive definite matrix, the existence of which results in a necessary and sufficient characterization of incremental exponential stability of multiple solution trajectories with respect to each other. By using a squared differential length as a Lyapunov-like function, its nonlinear stability analysis boils down to finding a suitable contraction metric that satisfies a stability condition expressed as a linear matrix inequality, indicating that many parallels can be drawn between well-known linear systems theory and contraction theory for nonlinear systems. Furthermore, contraction theory takes advantage of a superior robustness property of exponential stability used in conjunction with the comparison lemma. This yields much-needed safety and stability guarantees for neural network-based control and estimation schemes, without resorting to a more involved method of using uniform asymptotic stability for input-to-state stability. Such distinctive features permit systematic construction of a contraction metric via convex optimization, thereby obtaining an explicit exponential bound on the distance between a time-varying target trajectory and solution trajectories perturbed externally due to disturbances and learning errors. The objective of this paper is therefore to present a tutorial overview of contraction theory and its advantages in nonlinear stability analysis of deterministic and stochastic systems, with an emphasis on deriving formal robustness and stability guarantees for various learning-based and data-driven automatic control methods. In particular, we provide a detailed review of techniques for finding contraction metrics and associated control and estimation laws using deep neural networks.</description>

      <title>A First-Order Gradient Approach for the Connectivity Analysis of Markov Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11744v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Weighted graphs are commonly used to model various complex systems, including social networks, power grids, transportation networks, and biological systems. In many applications, the connectivity of these networks can be expressed through the Mean First Passage Times (MFPTs) of a Markov chain modeling a random walker on the graph. In this paper, we generalize the network metrics based on Markov chains' MFPTs and extend them to networks affected by uncertainty, in which edges may fail and hence not be present according to a pre-determined stochastic model. To find optimally connected Markov chains, we present a parameterization-free method for optimizing the MFPTs of the Markov chain. More specifically, we present an efficient Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (SPSA) algorithm in the context of Markov chain optimization. The proposed algorithm is suitable for both fixed and random networks. Using various numerical experiments, we demonstrate scalability compared to established benchmarks. Importantly, our algorithm finds an optimal solution without requiring prior knowledge of edge failure probabilities, allowing for an online optimization approach.</description>

      <title>A Semi-Lagrangian Approach for Time and Energy Path Planning Optimization in Static Flow Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16859v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficient path planning for autonomous mobile robots is a critical problem across numerous domains, where optimizing both time and energy consumption is paramount. This paper introduces a novel methodology that considers the dynamic influence of an environmental flow field and considers geometric constraints, including obstacles and forbidden zones, enriching the complexity of the planning problem. We formulate it as a multi-objective optimal control problem, propose a novel transformation called Harmonic Transformation, and apply a semi-Lagrangian scheme to solve it. The set of Pareto efficient solutions is obtained considering two distinct approaches: a deterministic method and an evolutionary-based one, both of which are designed to make use of the proposed Harmonic Transformation. Through an extensive analysis of these approaches, we demonstrate their efficacy in finding optimized paths.</description>

      <title>Open Problem: Active Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03845v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce the concept of Active Representation Learning, a novel class of problems that intertwines exploration and representation learning within partially observable environments. We extend ideas from Active Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (active SLAM), and translate them to scientific discovery problems, exemplified by adaptive microscopy. We explore the need for a framework that derives exploration skills from representations that are in some sense actionable, aiming to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of data collection and model building in the natural sciences.</description>

      <title>The Bouc-Wen Model for Binary Direct Collinear Collisions of Convex Viscoplastic Bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08147v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study mathematical models of binary direct collinear collisions of convex viscoplastic bodies based on two incremental collision laws that employ the Bouc-Wen differential model of hysteresis to represent the elastoplastic behavior of the materials of the colliding bodies. These collision laws are the Bouc-Wen-Simon-Hunt-Crossley collision law (BWSHCCL) and the Bouc-Wen-Maxwell collision law (BWMCL). The BWSHCCL comprises of the Bouc-Wen model amended with a nonlinear Hertzian elastic spring element and connected in parallel to a nonlinear displacement-dependent and velocity-dependent energy dissipation element. The BWMCL comprises of the Bouc-Wen model amended with a nonlinear Hertzian elastic spring element and connected in series to a linear velocity-dependent energy dissipation element. The mathematical models of the collision process are presented in the form of finite-dimensional initial value problems. We show that the models possess favorable analytical properties (e.g., global existence, uniqueness, and boundedness of the solutions) under suitable restrictions on the values of their parameters. Furthermore, we show that excellent agreement can be achieved between experimental data and numerical approximations of the behavior of the mathematical models across a wide range of initial relative velocities of the colliding bodies while using parameterizations of the models that are independent of the initial relative velocity.</description>
