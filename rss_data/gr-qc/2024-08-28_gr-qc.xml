      <title>Deep Einstein@Home search for Continuous Gravitational Waves from the Central Compact Objects in the Supernova Remnants Vela Jr. and G347.3-0.5 using LIGO public data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a search for continuous nearly monochromatic gravitational waves from the central compact objects associated with the supernova remnants Vela Jr. and G347.3 using LIGO O2 and O3 public data. Over $10^{18}$ different waveforms are considered, covering signal frequencies between 20-1300 Hz (20-400 Hz) for G347.3-0.5 (Vela Jr) and a very broad range of frequency derivatives. Thousands of volunteers donating compute cycles through the computing project Einstein@Home have made this endeavour possible. Following the Einstein@Home search, we perform multi-stage follow-ups of over 5 million waveforms. The selection threshold is set so that a signal could be confirmed using the first half of the LIGO O3 data. We find no significant signal candidate for either targets. Based on this null result, for G347.3-0.5, we set the most constraining upper limits to date on the amplitude of gravitational wave signals, corresponding to deformations below $10^{-6}$ in a large part of the search band. At the frequency of best strain sensitivity, near $161$ Hz, we set 90\%\ confidence upper limits on the gravitational wave intrinsic amplitude of $h_0^{90\%}\approx 6.2\times10^{-26}$. Over most of the frequency range our upper limits are a factor of 10 smaller than the indirect age-based upper limit. For Vela Jr., near $163$ Hz, we set $h_0^{90\%}\approx 6.4\times10^{-26}$. Over most of the frequency range our upper limits are a factor of 15 smaller than the indirect age-based upper limit. The Vela Jr. upper limits presented here are slightly less constraining than the most recent upper limits of \cite{ligo_o3a_c_v} but they apply to a broader set of signals.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Dynamics in Interacting Scalar-Torsion f(T,$\phi$) Gravity: Investigating Energy and Momentum Couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the cosmological dynamics of a homogeneous scalar field non-minimally coupled to torsion gravity, which also interacts with cold dark matter through energy and momentum transfer. The matter and radiation perfect fluids are modeled using the Sorkin-Schutz formalism. We identify scaling regimes of the field during both the radiation and matter eras. Additionally, we discovered a field-dominated scaling attractor; however, it does not exhibit accelerated expansion, making it unsuitable for describing dark energy. Nevertheless, we find two attractor solutions that do exhibit accelerated expansion: one is a quintessence-like fixed point, and the other is a de Sitter fixed point.</description>

      <title>Universal phenomenological relations between spherical harmonic modes in non-precessing eccentric binary black hole merger waveforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using publicly available numerical relativity (NR) simulations for non-spinning eccentric binary black hole (BBH) mergers, Ref \cite{Islam:2024rhm} demonstrated that the eccentricity-induced modulations in the amplitudes and frequencies of different spherical harmonic modes are mutually consistent and can be modeled using a single time series modulation. We extend the validity of the results to all non-precessing binaries by using 83 NR simulations from the SXS, RIT, and MAYA catalogs for aligned-spin eccentric BBH mergers with mass ratios ranging from $1:1$ to $1:4$. Based on these phenomenological relations, we provide a framework named gwNRXHME to compute multi-modal eccentric non-precessing waveforms using two inputs: quadrupolar eccentric waveforms, and the corresponding multi-modal quasi-circular non-precessing waveforms. Furthermore, we compute an overall degree of departure in SXS, RIT, and MAYA NR data from these relations and find that SXS NR simulations generally adhere to these relations more strictly than RIT and MAYA data. We also show that these relations can offer a cost-effective way to filter out noisy higher-order spherical harmonic modes extracted from NR data. Our framework is publicly available through the gwModels package.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous branes formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a study of brane formation in six-dimensional space. There is no a priori assumption of the brane(s) existence. However, the analysis of the generalized Einstein equations reveals that there are a set of metrics describing two static branes even in the absence of matter fields. The trapping of massive particles on branes is a consequence of the metric structure, which prevents these particles from moving between branes.
  It is shown that the communication between charged particles located on different branes provides by photons. Such positron-electron annihilation could be experimentaly study at the LHC collider.
  The Higgs field is distributed between the branes in such a way that it can serve as a Higgs portal connecting two worlds located on different branes. The values of the 4D physical parameters depend on the extra metric structure near the branes. A particular metric of the extra space was found to provide the observed value of the Higgs vacuum average.
  We also found a non-trivial effect of decompactification of the extra space when the Hubble parameter is varied.</description>

      <title>Quantum BPS Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There has been much discussion about the initial conditions of the early Universe in the context of quantum theory. In this paper, we construct the wave function and probability distribution by adopting the quantum version of the BPS equation instead of the usual Wheeler-DeWitt equation in a minisuperspace quantum cosmology with spatially uniform scalar fields. Although the model treated in this study is technically valid for a limited form of scalar potential, we show that it is possible to construct a conserved probability current in our model. We also examine classical and quantum aspects of models with the Dirac-Born-Infeld type scalar fields.</description>

      <title>Analysing Hubble Tension and Gravitational Waves for $f(Q,T)$ Gravity Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we examine viable models of $f(Q,T)$ gravity theories against observational data with the aim to constrain the parameter space of these models. We have analysed five different models of $f(Q,T)$ gravity and tested them against Type Ia supernovae, Cosmic Chronometer data, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations data and Pantheon data. We put stringent constraints on the $f(Q,T)$ gravity models, $f(Q,T) = Q^{n} +\beta T$ $(n=1,2,3)$, $f(Q,T)=-\alpha Q-\beta T^{2}$ and $f(Q,T)=Q^{-2}T^{2}$ along with other cosmological parameters such as deceleration parameter, equation of state parameter and demonstrate their alignment with the $\Lambda CDM$ model and the observational data. We show that these models have the capability to alleviate the Hubble tension, by predicting the present value of the Hubble parameter close to $74$km/s/Mpc. $f(Q,T)$ gravity theory introduces alterations in the background evolution and imposes a friction term in the propagation of gravitational waves, this phenomenon has also been examined. We have shown their agreement with the Gravitational Wave (GW) luminosity distance with the Electromagnetic (EM) counter part data from Advanced LIGO and Advanced VIRGO across different observing runs capturing coalescence of Binary Neutron Stars (BNS), mergers of Binary Black Holes (BBHs), and Neutron Star-Black Hole (NSBH) binaries with EM counterparts.</description>

      <title>Stability of the Einstein Static Universe in Zero-Point Length Cosmology with Topological Defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-singular cosmological models, particularly the idea of emergent cosmology have been explored to describe the non-singular origin of the Universe. Recently, zero-point length cosmology has shown some positive insights into some non-singular aspects of the early Universe. In addition, topological defects are well-known for their major impact on the early Universe and may play a significant role by its presence as a part of the energy content of the Universe. We investigate the stability of the Einstein static phase of the emergent Universe scenario in a generalized framework of zero-point length cosmology in the presence of topological defects in the very early Universe. We derive the modified Friedmann equations, where the energy momentum tensor includes an extra energy density term arising from $n$-dimensional topological defects. We study the possibility of graceful exit of the Einstein Static Universe (ESU) into the standard inflationary cosmology and its stability on the basis of dynamical system analysis. We also study the stability of the ESU against homogeneous scalar perturbation and also its possible graceful exit mechanism. We analyse the stability of the ESU against density, vector and tensor perturbations. Through the stability analysis, it has been shown that indeed the model parameters associated with zero-point length setting and $n$-dimensional topological defects play a visible role in the graceful exit mechanism of the ESU to the standard inflationary Universe. Also, interestingly it is found that there exists a mutual interplay between the zero-point length parameter, and the dimension of topological defect on the stability of the ESU on the basis of inhomogeneous density perturbation. Finally, the stability is also tested against vector and tensor perturbation, which shows that the ESU is stable against such perturbations.</description>

      <title>Combining underground and on-surface third-generation gravitational-wave interferometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, detailed studies have been made to compare the performance of the European next generation GW observatory Einstein Telescope (ET) in a single-site triangular configuration with the performance of a configuration featuring two L-shaped detectors in different sites, still taken to have all other ET characteristics except for the geometry, in particular, underground and composed of a low-frequency interferometer working at cryogenic temperatures and a high-frequency interferometer working at room temperature. Here we study a further possibility for a European network, made by a single L-shaped underground detector, like one of the detectors considered for the 2L version of ET, and a single third-generation 20-km L-shaped interferometer on the surface. We compare the performances of such a network to those of the triangle and of the 2L-underground ET configurations. We then examine the performance of an intercontinental network made by a 40-km CE in the US, together with any of these European networks.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Systems Analysis of f(R,G) Cosmological Model with Dark Sector Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we examine the dynamical system of $f(R,\mathcal{G})$ gravity model. This $f(R,G)$ model framework is composed of the interactions between dark matter and scalar field through the linear coupling term. The key objective of present study is to describe the cosmological viability of modified gravity theory formulated with the $ f(R, \mathcal{G}) $ gravity. We transform the cosmological equations into an autonomous system of ordinary differential equations by suitable transformation of variables. The $ f(R,\mathcal{G})$ model governed by $ f(R, \mathcal{G}) = \alpha R^m + \beta \mathcal{G}^n $ has been investigated in detail to characterize the stability properties of the critical points of the autonomous system. The model may explain the late-time accelerating universe expansion corresponding to the attractor in model. Depending on the effective equation of state parameter values corresponding to the critical points, we study the observational viability of model using low-redshift observational data such as the observational Hubble data and Pantheon data. Furthermore, we investigate the effects of parameters by using the effective equation of state parameter and statefinder diagnostics.</description>

      <title>The constraint on modified black holes with extreme mass ratio inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The low-energy effective action of String Theory introduces corrections to the dilaton-graviton sector, resulting in deformed black holes beyond general relativity. We analyze extreme mass-ratio inspiral systems (EMRIs), where a stellar-mass object spirals into a slowly rotating supermassive black hole including a distinct deviation parameter. This study examines the effects of this deformation on gravitational wave fluxes, orbital evolution, and phase dynamics, incorporating leading-order post-Newtonian corrections. With one-year observations of EMRIs, we employ the Fisher information matrix method to evaluate the potential for detecting deviations from general relativity through space-based gravitational wave detectors that utilize time-delay interferometry to suppress laser noise. The constraint on modified black holes, $\Delta\alpha \preceq 10^{-5}$, is almost the same with and without the time-delay interferometry combination. This analysis enhances our understanding and underscores the crucial role of observations in advancing gravitational phenomena within String Theory.</description>

      <title>Evolution of spherical perturbations in the cosmological environment of the Higgs scalar field and an ideal scalar charged fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A mathematical model of the evolution of spherical perturbations in a cosmological ideal scalar-charged fluid with scalar Higgs interaction is constructed. A closed mathematical model of linear spherical perturbations in a cosmological medium of a scalar-charged ideal fluid with scalar Higgs interaction is formulated. It is shown that spherical perturbations of the Friedmann metric are possible only in the presence of an isotropic fluid. At singular points of the background cosmological model, perturbations of the metric do not occur and perturbations are described by a vacuum-field model. Exact ones at singular points of the cosmological system are obtained and it is shown that in the case of a stable singular point of the cosmological system, perturbations of the scalar field represent traveling waves, and in the case of an unstable singular point, perturbations represent exponentially growing standing waves. Using numerical modeling, the formation of a stratified halo in the form of growing standing waves is shown.
  Key words: scalar charged plasma, cosmological model, scalar Higgs field, gravitational stability, spherical perturbations.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a discussion of the periodicity in imaginary time of maximally extended black hole spacetimes without reference to Euclidean manifolds. As motivation, we first demonstrate our approach for the Rindler geometry in flat space before then applying it for the case of Schwarzschild time in the maximally extended Kruskal geometry. One notable advantage of our approach is that it can be utilized in the Kerr case, again without reference to a Euclidean manifold, and without complexifying the angular momentum parameter, $a$. One unusual feature of our application in the Kerr case is that, even for the purely Lorentzian geometry, it is developed in terms of explicitly complex coordinates which are associated with distinct families of $\alpha-$surfaces. Moreover, coordinatization of these gives a single set of coordinates which cover the entire geometry outside the inner horizon.</description>

      <title>Can Baby Universe Absorption Explain Dark Energy?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been proposed that the accelerated expansion of the universe can be explained by the merging of our universe with baby universes, resulting in dark energy with a phantom-like equation of state. However, the evidence in favor of it did not include the full set of cosmological observables. Here we examine the implications of this model for both early and late universe cosmology using data from Planck collaboration, DESI 2024 and other experiments. We find that the pure baby universe model gives a poor fit to current data. Extending it to include a contribution from the cosmological constant, we find two allowed regions of parameter space: one close to $\Lambda$CDM, and another with $\Lambda &lt;0$ plus the exotic dark energy component. The two regions can be significantly favored over $\Lambda$CDM, depending on the choice of supernova datasets, and they can ameliorate the Hubble tension to the level of $2\sigma$, depending on the supernova dataset. The model with $\Lambda&lt;0$ features an equation of state $w(a)$ with a pole singularity at early times.</description>

      <title>Gravix: Active Learning for Gravitational Waves Classification Algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This project explores the integration of Bayesian Optimization (BO) algorithms into a base machine learning model, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), for classifying gravitational waves among background noise. The primary objective is to evaluate whether optimizing hyperparameters using Bayesian Optimization enhances the base model's performance. For this purpose, a Kaggle [1] dataset that comprises real background noise (labeled 0) and simulated gravitational wave signals with noise (labeled 1) is used. Data with real noise is collected from three detectors: LIGO Livingston, LIGO Hanford, and Virgo. Through data preprocessing and training, the models effectively classify testing data, predicting the presence of gravitational wave signals with a remarkable score, of 83.61%. The BO model demonstrates comparable accuracy to the base model, but its performance improvement is not very significant (84.34%). However, it is worth noting that the BO model needs additional computational resources and time due to the iterations required for hyperparameter optimization, requiring additional training on the entire dataset. For this reason, the BO model is less efficient in terms of resources compared to the base model in gravitational wave classification</description>

      <title>Quasitopological Lifshitz dilaton black brane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a new class of $(n+1)$-dimensional Lifshitz dilaton black brane solutions in the presence of the cubic quasitopological gravity for a flat boundary. The related action supports asymptotically Lifshitz solutions by applying some conditions which are used throughout the paper. We have to add a new boundary term and some new counterterms to the bulk action to have finite solutions. Then we define a finite stress tensor complex by which we can calculate the energy density of the quasitopological Lifshitz dilaton black brane. It is not possible to obtain analytical solutions, and so we use some expantions to probe the functions behaviors near the horizon and at the infinity. Combining the equations, we can attain a total constant along the coordinate $r$. At the horizon, this constant is proportional to the product of the temperature and the entropy and at the infinity, the total constant shows the energ density of the quasitopological Lifshitz dilaton black brane. Therefore, we can reach to a relation between the conserved quantities temperature, entropy and the energy density and get a smarr-type formula. Using the first law of thermodynamics, we can find a relation between the entropy and the temperature and then ontain the heat capacity. Our results show that the quasitopological Lifshitz dilaton black brane solutions are thermally stable for each positive values of the dynamical critiacl exponent, $z$.</description>

      <title>Kasner eons with matter: holographic excursions to the black hole singularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent work has shown that introducing higher-curvature terms to the Einstein-Hilbert action causes the approach to a space-like singularity to unfold as a sequence of Kasner eons. Each eon is dominated by emergent physics at an energy scale controlled by higher-curvature terms of a given order, transitioning to higher-order eons as the singularity is approached. The purpose of this paper is twofold. First, we demonstrate that the inclusion of matter dramatically modifies the physics of eons compared to the vacuum case. We illustrate this by considering a family of quasi-topological gravities of arbitrary order minimally coupled to a scalar field. Second, we investigate Kasner eons in the interior of black holes with field theory duals and analyze their imprints on holographic observables. We show that the behavior of the thermal $a$-function, two-point functions of heavy operators, and holographic complexity can capture distinct signatures of the eons, making them promising tools for diagnosing stringy effects near black hole singularities.</description>

      <title>Scalar Gravitational Aharonov-Bohm Effect: Generalization of the Gravitational Redshift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Aharonov-Bohm effect is a quantum mechanical phenomenon that demonstrates how potentials can have observable effects even when the classical fields associated with those potentials are absent. Initially proposed for electromagnetic interactions, this effect has been experimentally confirmed and extensively studied over the years. More recently, the effect has been observed in the context of gravitational interactions using atom interferometry. Additionally, recent predictions suggest that temporal variations in the phase of an electron wave function will induce modulation sidebands in the energy levels of an atomic clock, solely driven by a time-varying scalar gravitational potential [1]. In this study, we consider the atomic clock as a two-level system undergoing continuous Rabi oscillations between the electron's ground and excited state. We assume the photons driving the transition are precisely frequency-stabilized to match the transition, enabling accurate clock comparisons. Our analysis takes into account, that when an atom transitions from its ground state to an excited state, it absorbs energy, increasing its mass according to the mass-energy equivalence principle. Due to the mass difference between the two energy levels, we predict that an atomic clock in an eccentric orbit will exhibit a constant frequency shift relative to a ground clock corresponding to the orbit's average gravitational redshift, with additional modulation sidebands due to the time-varying gravitational potential.</description>

      <title>The impact of dark matter on tidal signatures in neutron star mergers with Einstein Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: If dark matter (DM) accumulates inside neutron stars (NS), it changes their internal structure and causes a shift of the tidal deformability from the value predicted by the dense-matter equation of state (EOS). In principle, this shift could be observable in the gravitational-wave (GW) signal of binary neutron star (BNS) mergers. We investigate the effect of fermionic, non-interacting DM when observing a large number of GW events from DM-admixed BNSs with the precision of the proposed Einstein telescope (ET). Specifically, we study the impact on the recovery of the baryonic EOS and whether DM properties can be constrained. For this purpose, we create event catalogues of BNS mock events with DM fraction up to 1%, from which we reconstruct the posterior uncertainties with the Fisher matrix approach. Using this data, we perform joint Bayesian inference on the baryonic EOS, DM particle mass, and DM particle fraction in each event. Our results reveal that when falsely ignoring DM effects, the EOS posterior is biased towards softer EOSs, though the offset is rather small. Further, we find that within our assumptions of our DM model and population, ET will likely not be able to test the presence of DM in BNSs, even when combining many events and adding Cosmic Explorer (CE) to the next-generation detector network. Likewise, the potential constraints on the DM particle mass will remain weak because of degeneracies with the fraction and EOS.</description>

      <title>Energy-dependent intrinsic time delay of gamma-ray bursts on testing Lorentz invariance violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-energy photons of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) might be emitted at different intrinsic times with energy dependence at the source. In this letter, we expand the model from previous works on testing the Lorentz Invariance Violation (LV) with the observed GRB data from the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope. We reanalyze the previous data with the full Bayesian parameter estimation method and get consistent results by assuming that the time delays are due to an LV term and a constant intrinsic time delay term. Subsequently, we neglect the LV effect and only consider the intrinsic time delay effect. We assume a common intrinsic time delay term along with a source energy correlated time delay of high-energy photons. We find that the energy-dependent emission times can also explain the observed GRB data of high-energy photon events. Finally, we integrate these two physical mechanisms into a unified model to distinguish and evaluate their respective contributions using the observed GRB data.</description>

      <title>A dynamical Einstein-Born-Infeld-dilaton model and holographic quarkonium melting in a magnetic field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We generalize the potential reconstruction method to set up a dynamical Einstein-Born-Infeld-dilaton model, which we then use to study holographic quarkonium melting in an external magnetic field. The non-linear nature of the model allows to couple the magnetic field to the quarkonium inner structure without having to introduce back-reacting charged flavour degrees of freedom. The magnetic field dependent melting temperature is computed from the spectral functions and suggests a switch from magnetic to inverse magnetic catalysis when the magnetic field increases. We also discuss the differences due to the anisotropy brought in by the external field.</description>

      <title>MEET-U project II: Curvature perturbations from kinetic preheating after $\alpha$-attractor inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Preheating at the end of inflation is a violent nonlinear process that efficiently transfers the energy of the inflaton to a second field, the preheat field. When the preheat field is light during inflation and its background value modulates the preheating process, the superhorizon isocurvature perturbations of the preheat field may be converted to curvature perturbations that leave an imprint on the cosmic microwave background and the large-scale structure of the universe. We use high-precision lattice simulations to study kinetic preheating after $\alpha$-attractor inflation, a case where the effective mass of the preheat field is naturally suppressed during inflation. By comparing the expansion e-folds between different Hubble patches, we find that the conversion from isocurvature perturbations to curvature perturbations is very inefficient and can hardly be detected by cosmological observations.</description>

      <title>Inflation with the Chern-Simons term in the Palatini formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the Chern-Simons term coupled to the inflaton in the Palatini formulation of general relativity. In contrast to the metric formulation, here the Chern-Simons term affects also the background evolution. We approximately solve for the connection, insert it back into the action, and reduce the order of the equations to obtain an effective theory in the gradient approximation. We consider three cases: when the connection is unconstrained, and when non-metricity or torsion is put to zero. In the first two cases, the inflaton kinetic term is modified with a term proportional to the square of the potential. For polynomial potentials dominated by the highest power of the field, the Chern-Simons term solves the problem that higher order corrections spoil the flatness of the potential. For Higgs inflation, the tensor-to-scalar ratio can as large as the current observational bound, and the non-minimal coupling to the Ricci scalar can be as small as in the metric case. The Palatini contribution cures the known instability of the tensor modes due the Chern-Simons term in the metric formulation.</description>

      <title>Beltrami fields, dispersive electromagnetic waves and gravitational spheromaks from chiral anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note we focus on the backreaction effects due to the chiral anomaly. The chiral anomaly gives rise to certain modifications in the conserved currents. In the case of the Maxwell gauge fields there appears a new contribution to the electric current proportional to the background magnetic field. This phenomenon is known as the chiral magnetic effect and it is widely discussed in the current literature. In the case of the gravitational field, the anomaly, as we show here, induces a new contribution to the stress-energy tensor. We analyze the possible manifestations of these modifications in the gravitational field and in hydrodynamics in the chiral media. We also make some comments regarding the backreaction effects in the electrodynamics in the chiral media. In each of these directions we observe the systematical appearance of the Beltrami type fields. In electrodynamics or in hydrodynamics the Beltrami field (e.g., magnetic field or fluid velocity) is a vector that is parallel to its own curl. We suggest a generalization of the Beltrami fields for the tensorial gravitational perturbations. The respective solutions to the gravitational equations we call gravitational spheromaks by analogy with a similar phenomenon in electrodynamics. In the modified hydrodynamics in the chiral media the vorticity is asymptotically a Beltrami vector field in a generalized Gromeka-Beltrami flow.</description>

      <title>Speed of sound bounds and first-order phase transitions in compact stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present study we employ three distinct physically motivated speed of sound bounds in order to construct hybrid models where the high density phase is described by the maximally stiff equation of state. In particular, we consider the bounds related to special relativity, relativistic kinetic theory and conformality. The low density hadronic phase is described by a state-of-the-art microscopic relativistic Brueckner-Hartree-Fock theory. This work aims to access the effect of the different speed of sound constraints on the relevant parameter space of the key parameters of first-order phase transitions by utilising recent astronomical data. This involves a systematic analysis that also includes two distinct schemes for the construction of hybrid models, namely the Maxwell and Gibbs methods. Finally, a relevant discussion is conducted on the possible occurrence of a thermodynamic inconsistency that is related to the stability of the high density phase over hadronic matter at large densities.</description>

      <title>Why do newer degrees of freedom appear in higher-order truncated hydrodynamic theory?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An exact derivation of relativistic hydrodynamics from an underlying microscopic theory has been shown to be an all-order theory. From the relativistic transport equation of kinetic theory, the full expressions of hydrodynamic viscous fluxes have been derived which turn out to include all orders of out-of-equilibrium derivative corrections. It has been shown, that for maintaining causality, it is imperative that the temporal derivatives must include all orders, which can be resummed in non-local, relaxation operator-like forms and finally `integrated in' introducing newer degrees of freedom. The theory can of course be truncated at any higher spatial orders, but the power over the the infinite temporal sum increases correspondingly such that the causality is respected. As a result, the theory truncated at any higher order of spatial gradient, requires newer degrees of freedom for each increasing order.</description>

      <title>Simultaneously Constraining the Neutron Star Equation of State and Mass Distribution through Multimessenger Observations and Nuclear Benchmarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With ongoing advancements in nuclear theory and experimentation, together with a growing body of neutron star (NS) observations, a wealth of information on the equation of state (EOS) for matter at extreme densities has become accessible. Here, we utilize a hybrid EOS formulation that combines an empirical parameterization centered around the nuclear saturation density with a generic three-segment piecewise polytrope model at higher densities. We incorporate data derived from chiral effective field theory ($\chi$EFT), perturbative quantum chromodynamics (pQCD), and from experiments such as PREX-II and CREX. Furthermore, we examine the influence of a total of 129 NS mass measurements up to April 2023, as well as simultaneous mass and radius measurements derived from the X-ray emission from surface hot spots on NSs. Additionally, we consider constraints on tidal properties inferred from the gravitational waves emitted by coalescing NS binaries. To integrate this extensive and varied array of constraints, we utilize a hierarchical Bayesian statistical framework to simultaneously deduce the EOS and the distribution of NS masses. We find that incorporating data from $\chi$EFT significantly tightens the constraints on the EOS of NSs near or below the nuclear saturation density. However, constraints derived from pQCD computations and nuclear experiments such as PREX-II and CREX have minimal impact.</description>

Abstract: The single field Ekpyrosis of Khoury and Steinhardt \cite{khoury}-\cite{khoury1} admits a Jordan frame scalar field with a double well potential. After the end of the ekpyrotic phase, as energy density increases we find a phase transition scenario to a symmetric phase at the conformal coupling fixed point leads to a non-singular bounce in Einstein frame. This scenario could admit a simple prescription for the small value of dark energy.</description>

      <title>Collapsing scenarios of K-essence generalized Vaidya spacetime under $f(\bar{R},\bar{T})$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.13574v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper investigates the collapse of the generalized emergent Vaidya spacetime in the setting of $f(\bar{R}, \bar{T})$ gravity, specifically in K-essence theory. In this study, the Dirac-Born-Infeld type non-standard Lagrangian is used to calculate the emergent metric $\bar{G}_{\mu\nu}$, which is not conformally equivalent to the conventional gravitational metric. We use the function $f(\bar{R}, \bar{T})$ to reflect the additive nature of the emergent Ricci scalar ($\bar{R}$) and the trace of the emergent energy-momentum tensor ($\bar{T}$). Our study demonstrates that certain choices of $f(\bar{R}, \bar{T})$ may result in the existence of a naked singularity caused by gravitational collapse. The alternative $f(\bar{R}, \bar{T})$ values resulted in an accelerating universe dominated by dark energy. Moreover, the investigation showed the presence of both positive and negative masses, which might suggest the coexistence of dark matter and dark energy. Furthermore, for a given quantity of kinetic part of the K-essence scalar field, mass is completely changed into energy, meaning that spacetime is Minkowskian. The K-essence theory may also be employed as a dark energy framework and a basic gravitational theory, making it possible for researchers to investigate a wide ranges of cosmic phenomena.</description>

Abstract: In this study, we examine the phenomenon of photon axion conversion occurring in the spacetime surrounding a black hole. Specifically, we focus on the potential existence of a magnetic field around the supermassive black hole M87*, which could facilitate the conversion of photons into axions in close proximity to the photon sphere. While photons traverse through the curved spacetime, they spend time near the photon sphere, where conversion of these photons into axions takes place. Consequently, this process leads to a decrease in the intensity of the black hole's photon ring. To explore the possibilities of detecting these hypothetical axion particles, we propose observing the photon sphere using higher resolution telescopes. By doing so, we can gain valuable insights into the conversion mechanism as well as the nature of the spherically symmetric black hole geometry. Moreover, we also investigate how the photon ring luminosities are affected if the black hole possesses a charge parameter. For instance apart from U(1) electric charge, the presence of extra dimension may induce a {\em tidal charge} with a characteristic signature. It is important to note that the success of the conversion mechanism relies on the axion-photon coupling and mass. As a result, the modified luminosity of the black hole's photon ring offers a valuable means of constraining the axion's mass and coupling parameter within a certain range. Thus our findings contribute to a better understanding of photon axion conversion in the environment of a black hole spacetime and helps us explore the possible existence of extra spatial dimension.</description>

      <title>Post-Minkowskian Theory Meets the Spinning Effective-One-Body Approach for Two-Body Scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12342v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Effective-one-body (EOB) waveforms employed by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration have primarily been developed by resumming the post-Newtonian expansion of the relativistic two-body problem. Given the recent significant advancements in post-Minkowskian (PM) theory and gravitational self-force formalism, there is considerable interest in creating waveform models that integrate information from various perturbative methods in innovative ways. This becomes particularly crucial when tackling the accuracy challenge posed by upcoming ground-based detectors (such as the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer) and space-based detectors (such as LISA, TianQin or Taiji) expected to operate in the next decade. In this context, we present the derivation of the first spinning EOB Hamiltonian that incorporates PM results up to three-loop order: the SEOB-PM model. The model accounts for the complete hyperbolic motion, encompassing nonlocal-in-time tails. To evaluate its accuracy, we compare its predictions for the conservative scattering angle, augmented with dissipative contributions, against numerical-relativity data of non-spinning and spinning equal-mass black holes. We observe very good agreement, comparable, and in some cases slightly better to the recently proposed $w_{\rm EOB}$-potential model, of which the SEOB-PM model is a resummation around the probe limit. Indeed, in the probe limit, the SEOB-PM Hamiltonian and scattering angles reduce to the one of a test mass in Kerr spacetime. Once complemented with nonlocal-in-time contributions for bound orbits, the SEOB-PM Hamiltonian can be utilized to generate waveform models for spinning black holes on quasi-circular orbits.</description>

Abstract: We study scalar cosmological perturbations in $f(R, T)$ modified gravity theories being $T$ the trace of the energy-momentum tensor. We provide detailed equations for the matter energy density contrast. We solve then numerically to promote a comparison with available large scale structure (LSS) formation observational data on $f \sigma_8$ and also addressing the $S_8$ tension. We identify $f(R,T)$ models that lead either to growth enhancement or suppression. Since recent results in the literature indicate a preference for the latter feature, this type of analysis is quite useful to select viable modifications of gravity. We studied class of such $f(R,T)$ models are either ruled out or severely restricted.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Purity Lost: Perturbative and Resummed Late-Time Inflationary Decoherence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12240v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the rate with which unobserved fields decohere other fields to which they couple, both in flat space and in de Sitter space, for spectator scalar fields prepared in their standard adiabatic vacuum. The process is very efficient in de Sitter space once the modes in question pass outside the Hubble scale, displaying the tell-tale phenomenon of secular growth that indicates the breakdown of perturbative methods on a time scale parameterically long compared with the Hubble time. We show how to match the perturbative evolution valid at early times onto a late-time Lindblad evolution whose domain of validity extends to much later times, thereby allowing a reliable resummation of the perturbative result beyond the perturbative regime. Super-Hubble modes turn out to be dominantly decohered by unobserved modes that are themselves also super-Hubble. Although our calculation is done for spectator fields, if applied to curvature perturbations during inflation our observations here could close a potential loophole in recent calculations of the late-time purity of the observable primordial fluctuations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05289v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the scalar induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) from a chiral scalar-tensor theory of gravity. The parity-violating (PV) Lagrangian contains the Chern-Simons (CS) term and PV scalar-tensor terms, which are built of the quadratic Riemann tensor term and first-order derivatives of a scalar field. We consider SIGWs in two cases, in which the semi-analytic expression to calculate SIGWs can be obtained. Then, we calculate the fractional energy density of SIGWs with a monochromatic power spectrum for the curvature perturbation. We find that the SIGWs in chiral scalar-tensor gravity behave differently from those in GR before and after the peak frequency, which results in a large degree of circular polarization.</description>

      <title>Evidence for eccentricity in the population of binary black holes observed by LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14286v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Binary black holes (BBHs) in eccentric orbits produce distinct modulations the emitted gravitational waves (GWs). The measurement of orbital eccentricity can provide robust evidence for dynamical binary formation channels. We analyze 57 GW events from the first, second and third observing runs of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) Collaboration using a multipolar aligned-spin inspiral-merger-ringdown waveform model with two eccentric parameters: eccentricity and relativistic anomaly. This is made computationally feasible with the machine-learning code DINGO which accelerates inference by 2-3 orders of magnitude compared to traditional inference. First, we find eccentric aligned-spin versus quasi-circular aligned-spin $\log_{10}$ Bayes factors of 1.84 to 4.75 (depending on the glitch mitigation) for GW200129, 3.0 for GW190701 and 1.77 for GW200208_22. We measure $e_{\text{gw}, 10Hz}$ to be $0.27_{-0.12}^{+0.10}$ to $0.17_{-0.13}^{+0.14}$ for GW200129, $0.35_{-0.11}^{+0.32}$ for GW190701 and $0.35_{-0.21}^{+0.18}$ for GW200208_22. Second, we find $\log_{10}$ Bayes factors between the eccentric aligned-spin versus quasi-circular precessing-spin hypothesis between 1.43 and 4.92 for GW200129, 2.61 for GW190701 and 1.23 for GW200208_22. Third, our analysis does not show evidence for eccentricity in GW190521, which has an eccentric aligned-spin against quasi-circular aligned-spin $\log_{10}$ Bayes factor of 0.04. Fourth, we estimate that if we neglect the spin-precession and use an astrophysical prior, the probability of one out of the 57 events being eccentric is greater than 99.5% or $(100 - 8.4 \times 10^{-4})$% (depending on the glitch mitigation). Fifth, we study the impact on parameter estimation when neglecting either eccentricity or higher modes in eccentric models. These results underscore the importance of including eccentric parameters in the characterization of BBHs for GW detectors.</description>

      <title>Peculiar velocities in Friedmann universes with nonzero spatial curvature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19046v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the earlier linear studies of cosmological peculiar velocities to Friedmann universes with nonzero spatial curvature. In the process, we also compare our results with those obtained in cosmologies with Euclidean spatial sections. Employing relativistic cosmological perturbation theory, we first provide the differential formulae governing the evolution of peculiar velocities on all Friedmann backgrounds. The technical complexities of the curved models, however, mean that analytic solutions are possible only in special, though characteristic, moments in the lifetime of these universes. Nevertheless, our solutions exhibit persistent patterns that make us confident enough to generalise them. Thus, we confirm earlier claims that, compared to the Newtonian studies, the relativistic analysis supports considerably stronger linear growth-rates for peculiar-velocity perturbations. This result holds irrespective of the background curvature. Moreover, for positive curvature, the peculiar growth-rate is found to be faster than that obtained in a spatially flat Friedman universe. In contrast, linear peculiar velocities appear to grow at a slower pace when their Friedmann host is spatially open. Extrapolating them to the present, our results seem to suggest faster bulk peculiar motions in overdense, rather than in underdense, regions of the universe.</description>

Abstract: Time-delay interferometry (TDI) is a data processing technique for space-based gravitational-wave detectors to create laser-noise-free equal-optical-path-length interferometers virtually on the ground. It relies on the interspacecraft signal propagation delays, which are delivered by intersatellite ranging monitors. Also delays due to onboard signal propagation and processing have a nonnegligible impact on the TDI combinations. However, these onboard delays were only partially considered in previous TDI-related research; onboard optical path lengths have been neglected so far. In this paper, we study onboard optical path lengths in TDI. We derive analytical models for their coupling to the second-generation TDI Michelson combinations and verify these models numerically. Furthermore, we derive a compensation scheme for onboard optical path lengths in TDI and validate its performance via numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Birefringence from Fuzzy Dark Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13394v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational wave (GW) birefringence is a remarkable phenomenon that can be used to test the parity violation in gravity. By coupling the fuzzy dark matter (FDM) scalar to the gravitational Chern-Simons term, we explore the GW birefringence effects in the FDM background. In particular, in light of the highly oscillating granular FDM structure at the galactic scale, we are led to investigating the GW propagation in the Chern-Simons gravity over the general nontrivial scalar profile, which is a natural extension of previous studies on the homogeneous and isotropic configurations. As a result, it is found that GWs of both circularly polarized modes propagate in the straight line with the speed of light, and does not show any velocity birefringence. However, when considering the imaginary part of the dispersion relation, GWs exhibit the amplitude birefringence in which one circular polarization is enhanced while the other suppressed. Due to its local nature, the FDM-induced amplitude birefringence only depends on the GW frequency without any reliance on the GW event distance. More importantly, the birefringence factor shows a periodic time variation with the period reflecting the FDM scalar mass, which is the smoking gun for testing this new birefringence mechanism. Finally, we also study the extra-galactic FDM contribution to the GW birefringence, which is shown to be suppressed by the cosmological DM density and thus subdominant compared with the galactic counterpart.</description>

Abstract: We employ the isomonodromic method to study linear scalar massive perturbations of Kerr black holes for generic scalar masses $M\mu$ and generic black hole spins $a/M$. A degeneracy between the longest-living quasinormal mode and the first overtone is found for $(M\mu)_c \simeq 0.3704981$ and $(a/M)_c\simeq 0.9994660$. We show that the longest-living mode and the first overtone change continuously into each other as we vary the parameters around the point of degeneracy, providing evidence for the existence of a geometric phase around an exceptional point. We interpret our findings through a thermodynamic analogy.</description>

Abstract: In this study, we investigate the quasinormal modes, pseudospectrum and time evolution of a massive vector field around a quantum corrected black hole in de-Sitter spacetime. We start by parameterization and using orthonormal tetrads to get the effective potential. Methodologically we use the hyperboloidal framework together with discretizing the non-selfadjoint operator through Chebyshev-Gauss-Labatto grid to attain the QNMs. We explore the parametric instability of QNMs caused by quantum correction, cosmological constant and Proca mass, and these three factors show very different influences on the QNMs' migration flow. On the other hand, we discuss the instability of QNMs with arbitrary-shape perturbation and the effectiveness of numerical results through pseudospectrum. We use high frequency approximation to attain the expression of the time domain Green function and clarify the origin of two different stages in time evolution. Through numerical methods we confirm that no power-law late time tail is expected, and the possible impact on time evolution caused by quantum correction is discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08349v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superradiant instability can form clouds around rotating black holes (BHs) composed of ultralight bosonic fields, such as axions. A BH with such a cloud in a binary system exhibits rich phenomena, and gravitational waves (GWs) from the BH merger provide a means to probe axions. For the first time, we study the evolution of axion clouds in a binary system during the inspiral phase, including axion self-interaction effects. When the self-interaction is significant, unlike in the negligible case, two types of clouds coexist through mode coupling. We examine the evolution of the system considering the effects of dissipation caused by both self-interaction and tidal interaction. For tidal interaction, in addition to the processes of emission to infinity and absorption by the BH, indirect emission via transitions (both resonant and off-resonant) is also considered as a second-order perturbation. Our results demonstrate that the signatures of axion self-interaction are imprinted in the modification of the GW phase. Furthermore, we find the possibility of a dynamical instability called bosenova during the binary inspiral phase.</description>

      <title>Resolving FLRW Cosmology Through Effective Equations of State in $f(T)$ Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13792v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article explores the cosmological scenario of the universe in the context of the $f(T)$ power law model, where $T$ represent the torsion scalar. To obtain the deterministic solution of the field equations we parametrized the effective Equation-of-State with two parameters $m$ and $k$ as suggested by A. Mukherjee in a flat FLRW environment. We impose constraints on the free parameters of the derived solution by utilizing MCMC analysis assuming the $CC, Pantheon+SH0ES$, and $CC+Pantheon+SH0ES$ as data samples. We explore the dynamics of cosmological parameters. The evolutionary profile of the deceleration parameter exhibits the transition %from the decelerated to the accelerated phase. The effective Equation-of-State parameter indicates the model remains in the quintessence era and gradually becomes the Einsteins-de-Sitter model. In addition to this, we also explore the jerk, snap, and lerk parameters. Furthermore, the $Om(z)$ diagnostic shows that the model has a consistent positive slope across the entire evolution, but resembles the standard $\Lambda$CDM model in the near future. At last, we conclude that the power law function of the modified $f(T)$ gravity model in the framework of the FLRW universe aligns more closely with the $\Lambda$CDM model for given observational data.</description>

Abstract: We examine possible additive corrections to the Bekenstein-Hawking (BH) entropy of black holes due to very general classical and quantal modifications of general relativity. In general, black hole entropy is subject to the Generalized Second Law of Thermodynamics. For the case of binary black hole coalescence, the difference in corrections to the inspiral and remnant black hole entropies is shown, within this law, to be bounded by the difference in the corresponding BH entropies. This latter difference has been measured by several groups attempting to validate Hawking's Area Theorem on black hole horizons, by analyzing gravitational wave data from possible binary black hole mergers. The former difference - that between corrections to remnant and inspiral black hole entropies beyond the BH entropy, is thus constrained by a bound measured from observational data. We examine the implications of this constraint for general binary black hole coalesence. If calculated entropy corrections follow the essential pattern of BH entropies dictated by the Hawking Area Theorem, consistency with the observational bound is shown to be guaranteed. If they do not, these corrections are then nontrivially constrained by the observational bound.</description>

      <title>Massive scalar perturbations in Kerr Black Holes: near extremal analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13964v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study quasinormal modes of massive scalar perturbations in Kerr black holes using the isomonodromic method. For arbitrary scalar masses $M \mu$ and black hole spins $a/M$, we numerically determine the quasinormal frequencies for various orbital $\ell$, azimuthal $m$, and overtone $n$ numbers. In particular, we derive an analytic expression for frequencies of the zero-damping modes near the extremal limit $a/M \rightarrow 1$. For $\ell=m=1$, we reveal that the fundamental mode becomes a damped mode (rather than a zero-damping mode) if the scalar field is sufficiently heavy. By exploring the parameter space, we find numerical evidence for level-crossing between the longest-living mode and the first overtone at an exceptional point $(M\mu)_c \simeq 0.3704981$ and $(a/M)_c\simeq 0.9994660$.</description>

      <title>Gravity from entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14391v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravity is derived from an entropic action coupling matter fields with geometry. The fundamental idea is to relate the metric of Lorentzian spacetime to a density matrix. The matter fields curve spacetime, defining a metric induced by the matter fields. The entropic action is the quantum relative entropy between the metric of spacetime and the metric induced by the matter fields. The modified Einstein equations obtained reduce to the Einstein equations in the regime of low coupling. To simplify the theory, exclusively scalar matter fields are considered. This theoretical framework can be extended in different directions, for instance by including fermionic matter fields and gauge fields. A canonical quantization of this field theory could bring new insights into quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Conversion of protons to positrons by a black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.01689v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The conversion of protons to positrons at the horizon of a black hole (BH) is considered. It is shown that the process may efficiently proceed for BHs with masses in the range $\sim 10^{18}$ -- $10^{21}$ g. It is argued that the electric charge of BH acquired by the proton accretion to BH could create electric field near BH horizon close to the critical Schwinger one. It leads to efficient electron-positron pair production, when electrons are back captured by the BH while positrons are emitted into outer space. Annihilation of these positrons with electrons in the interstellar medium may at least partially explain the origin of the observed 511 keV line.</description>

      <title>Extremal Black Hole Decay in de Sitter Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13742v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The decay of extremal charged black holes has been a useful guidance to derive consistency conditions in quantum gravity. In de Sitter space it has been argued that requiring (extremal) charged Nariai black holes to decay without forming a big crunch singularity yields the Festina Lente (FL) bound: particles with mass $m_s$ and charge $q$ should satisfy $m_s^2 \gg M_pHq$, where $M_p$ is the Planck mass and $H$ the Hubble parameter. Using a tunneling approach we show that the decay probability of charged black holes in de Sitter space in the s-wave sector is $P\sim \exp(\Delta S_b)$, where~$\Delta S_b$ is the change in the black hole entropy. We find that the FL bound corresponds to $\Delta S_b \leq -1$ in the Nariai and probe limit. However, taking into account backreaction we identify unsuppressed decay channels, which might be subdominant, that violate this bound but nonetheless do not result in a big crunch for every observer.</description>

      <title>Coexistence Test of Primordial Black Holes and Particle Dark Matter from Diffractive Lensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17829v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: If dark matter (DM) consists of primordial black holes (PBHs) and particles simultaneously, PBHs are generically embedded within particle DM halos. Such ``dressed PBHs'' (dPBHs) are subject to modified constraints compared to PBHs and can contribute to significant DM abundance in the mass range $10^{-1} - 10^2 M_\odot$. We show that diffractive lensing of chirping gravitational waves (GWs) from binary mergers can not only discover, but can also identify dPBH lenses and discriminate them from bare PBHs on the event-by-event basis, with potential to definitively establish the coexistence of subdominant PBHs and particle DM.</description>

      <title>Upper Bound on Thermal Gravitational Wave Backgrounds from Hidden Sectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13855v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hot viscous plasmas unavoidably emit a gravitational wave background, similar to electromagnetic black body radiation. We study the contribution from hidden particles to the diffuse background emitted by the primordial plasma in the early universe. While this contribution can easily dominate over that from Standard Model particles, we find that both are capped by a generic upper bound that makes them difficult to detect with interferometers in the foreseeable future. We illustrate our results for axions and heavy neutral leptons. Finally, our results suggest that previous works overestimated the gravitational wave background from particle decays out of thermal equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Renormalisation of postquantum-classical gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17844v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the obstacles to reconciling quantum theory with general relativity, is constructing a theory which is both consistent with observation, and and gives finite answers at high energy, so that the theory holds at arbitrarily short distances. Quantum field theory achieves this through the process of renormalisation, but famously, perturbative quantum gravity fails to be renormalisable, even without coupling to matter. Recently, an alternative to quantum gravity has been proposed, in which the geometry of spacetime is taken to be classical rather than quantum, while still being coupled to quantum matter fields [1, 2]. This can be done consistently, provided the dynamics is fundamentally stochastic. Here, we find that the pure gravity theory is formally renormalisable. We do so via the path integral formulation by relating the classical-quantum action to that of quadratic gravity which is renormalisable. Because the action induces stochastic dynamics of space-time, rather than deterministic evolution of a quantum field, the classical-quantum theory is free of tachyons and negative norm ghosts. The key remaining question is whether the renormalisation prescription retains completely positive (CP) dynamics. This consideration appears to single out the scale invariant and asymptotically free theory. We give further evidence that the theory is CP, by showing that the two-point function of the scalar mode is positive. To support the use of precision accelerometers in testing the quantum nature of spacetime, we also compute the power spectral density of the acceleration. The results presented here have a number of implications for inflation, CMB data, and experiments to test the quantum nature of spacetime. They may also provide a way to compute probabilities in the regime of quantum gravity where spacetime can be treated as effectively classical.</description>

      <title>Quantum 2D Liouville Path-Integral Is a Sum over Geometries in AdS$_3$ Einstein Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03179v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is a renowned solution of the modular bootstrap that defines the UV complete quantum Liouville theory. We triangulate the path-integral of this Liouville CFT on any 2D surface $\mathcal{M}$, by proposing a shrinkable boundary condition for this special CFT that allows small holes to close, analogous to the proposal in rational CFTs [1-3]. This is essentially a tensor network that admits an interpretation of a state-sum of a 3D topological theory constructed with quantum 6j symbols of $\mathcal{U}_q(SL(2,\mathbb{R}))$ with non-trivial boundary conditions, and it reduces to a sum over 3D geometries weighted by the Einstein-Hilbert action to leading order in large $c$. The boundary conditions of quantum Liouville theory specifies a very special sum over bulk geometries to faithfully reproduce the CFT path-integral. The triangulation coincides with producing a network of geodesics in the AdS bulk, which can be changed making use of the pentagon identity and orthogonality condition satisfied by the 6j symbols, and arranged into a precise holographic tensor network.</description>

      <title>On the measurements in Quantum Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16017v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this essay, we argue that certain aspects of the measurement require revision in Quantum Gravity. Using entropic arguments, we propose that the number of measurement outcomes and the accuracy (or the range) of the measurement are limited by the entropy of the black hole associated with the observer scale. This also implies the necessity of modifying the algebra of commutation relationships to ensure a finite representation of observables, changing the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle in this manner.</description>

      <title>Bounding the Cosmological Constant using Galactic Rotation Curves from the SPARC Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16650v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dark energy (and its simplest model, the Cosmological Constant or $\Lambda$) acts as a repulsive force that opposes gravitational attraction. Assuming galaxies maintain a steady state over extended periods, the estimated upper limit on $\Lambda$ studies its pushback to the attractive gravitational force of dark matter. From the SPARC dataset, we select galaxies that are best fitted by the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) and Hernquist density models. Introducing the presence of $\Lambda$ in these galaxies helps to establish the upper limit on its repulsive force. This upper limit on $\Lambda$ is around $\rho_{\left(&lt;\Lambda\right)} \sim 10^{-25}$~kg/m$^3$, only two orders of magnitude higher than the one measured by Planck. {We show that for galaxies with detectable velocities far from the galaxy core, the upper limit on $\Lambda$ is lower. Furthermore, we show that galaxies and other systems follow the same principle: for larger orbital periods the upper limit on $\Lambda$ is lower. Consequently, we address the implications for future measurements on the upper limit and the condition for detecting the impact of $\Lambda$ on galactic scales.</description>

      <title>Waves and strings in an interacting conformal chiral 2-form theory in six dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20375v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In six dimensions there exists a unique one-parameter family of non-linear conformal electrodynamics for a chiral 2-form gauge field which includes (in a free-field limit) the linear chiral 2-form theory and is related, by dimensional reduction, to the four-dimensional ModMax electrodynamics. In this work, we present the first exact solutions of this theory in presence of gravity. In particular, we will consider plane-wave, Robinson-Trautman, and self-dual dyonic string configurations, generalizing well-known solutions of this type in six-dimensional supergravities with linear chiral 2-form multiplets.</description>
