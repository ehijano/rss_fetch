      <title>Anomaly Detection Based on Machine Learning for the CMS Electromagnetic Calorimeter Online Data Quality Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A real-time autoencoder-based anomaly detection system using semi-supervised machine learning has been developed for the online Data Quality Monitoring system of the electromagnetic calorimeter of the CMS detector at the CERN LHC. A novel method is introduced which maximizes the anomaly detection performance by exploiting the time-dependent evolution of anomalies as well as spatial variations in the detector response. The autoencoder-based system is able to efficiently detect anomalies, while maintaining a very low false discovery rate. The performance of the system is validated with anomalies found in 2018 and 2022 LHC collision data. Additionally, the first results from deploying the autoencoder-based system in the CMS online Data Quality Monitoring workflow during the beginning of Run 3 of the LHC are presented, showing its ability to detect issues missed by the existing system.</description>

      <title>On characterizing X-ray detectors for low-dose imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The last decade has seen a renewed exploration of semiconductor materials for X-ray detection, foremost focusing on lead-based perovskites and other metal halides as direct-conversion materials and scintillators. However, the reported performance characteristics are often incomplete or misleading in assessing the practical utility of materials. This Perspective offers guidelines for choosing, estimating and presenting the relevant figures of merit. We also provide ready-to-used tools for calculating these figures of merit: MATLAB application, Mathcad worksheet and a website. The X-ray detectors for medical imaging are at focus for their increasing societal value and since they bring about the most stringent requirements as the image shall be acquired at as low as reasonably attainable (i.e. ALARA principle) dose received by the patient.</description>

      <title>Design of High-speed readout electronics for the DarkSHINE electromagnetic calorimeter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The DarkSHINE experiment aims to search for dark photons by measuring the energy loss of the electrons recoiled from fixed-target. Its electromagnetic calorimeter is primarily responsible for accurately reconstructing the energy of the recoil electrons and bremsstrahlung photons. The performance of the electromagnetic calorimeter is crucial, as its energy measurement precision directly determines the sensitivity to the search for dark photons. The DarkSHINE electromagnetic calorimeter uses LYSO crystals to form a fully absorptive electromagnetic calorimeter. It utilizes SiPMs to detect scintillation light in the crystals, and its readout electronics system deduces the deposited energy in the crystals by measuring the number of photoelectric signals generated by the SiPMs. The DarkSHINE electromagnetic calorimeter aims to operate at an event rate of 1-10 MHz, detecting energies ranging from 1 MeV to 1 GeV. To meet the requirements of high energy measurement precision, high event rate, and large dynamic range, we have researched and designed a readout electronics system based on dual-channel high-speed ADCs and a customized DAQ. The front-end amplification part of this system uses low-noise trans-impedance amplifiers to achieve high-precision waveform amplification. It successfully achieves a dynamic range up to a thousandfold through a double-gain readout scheme. The digital part uses 1 GSPS high-speed ADCs to achieve non-dead-time, high-precision waveform digitization. The DAQ part uses JESD204B high-speed serial protocol to read out the signal from ADC, and transmit it to PC software for processing and storage. Test results show a signal-to-noise ratio greater than 66 dBFS and an ENOB greater than 10.6 bits. Energy spectra measurements have been conducted using LYSO crystals and SiPMs, and an energy resolution of 5.96% at the 2.6 MeV gamma peak of Th-232 has been achieved.</description>

      <title>Development of a time correction algorithm for a precise synchronization of a free-running Rubidium atomic clock with the GPS Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present results of our study devoted to the development of a time correction algorithm needed to precisely synchronize a free-running Rubidium atomic clock with the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). This R&amp;D is performed in view of the Hyper-Kamiokande (HK) experiment currently under construction in Japan, which requires a synchronization with UTC and between its different experimental sites with a precision better than $100$ ns. We use a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receiver to compare a PPS and a $10$ MHz signal, generated by a free-running Rubidium clock, to the Global Positioning System (GPS) Time signal. We use these comparisons to correct the time series (time stamps) provided by the Rubidium clock signal. We fit the difference between Rubidium and GPS Time with polynomial functions of time over a certain integration time window to extract a correction of the Rubidium time stamps in offline or online mode. In online mode, the latest fit results are used for the correction until a new comparison to the GPS Time becomes available. We show that with an integration time window of around $10^4$ seconds, we can correct the time stamps drift caused by the frequency random walk noise of the free running Rubidium clock so that the time difference with respect to the GPS Time stay within a $\pm5$ ns range in both offline or online correction mode.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Charge Transport Simulation for Deep Learning Enhanced Spatial Resolution of the M\"ONCH Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning has the potential to significantly enhance the spatial resolution of hybrid detectors for electrons, as demonstrated for electron microscopy using 200 keV electrons with the M\"ONCH 25 {\mu}m pitch charge integration pixel detector. The deep learning models have been trained using both simulation data, which are more straightforward to generate with varied parameters, and measurement data, which are more cumbersome to acquire due to the required specialized setup of the electron microscope. However, challenges arise when comparing simulation-based deep learning models to measurement-based models for electrons, as the spatial resolution achieved through simulations is notably inferior to that from measurements. Discrepancies are also observed when directly comparing X-ray simulations with measurements, particularly in the spectral output of single pixels. These observations collectively suggest that current simulations require optimization.
  To address this, a Monte Carlo simulation was conducted to model the dynamics of charge carriers within the silicon sensor, aiming to refine charge transport modeling. The simulation encompasses the initial generation of the charge cloud, charge cloud drift, charge diffusion and repulsion, and electronic noise. The simulation results were validated with measurements from the M\"ONCH detector for X-rays, and consistencies between the simulation and the measurements were significantly improved by accounting for the charge repulsion.</description>

      <title>Results from ON-OFF analysis of the Neutrinos-Angra detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Neutrinos Angra Experiment, a water-based Cherenkov detector, is located at the Angra dos Reis nuclear power plant in Brazil. Designed to detect electron antineutrinos produced in the nuclear reactor, the primary objective of the experiment is to demonstrate the feasibility of monitoring reactor activity using an antineutrino detector. This effort aligns with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) program to identify potential and novel technologies applicable to nonproliferation safeguards. Operating on the surface presents challenges such as high noise rates, necessitating the development of very sensitive, yet small-scale detectors. These conditions make the Angra experiment an excellent platform for both developing the application and gaining expertise in new technologies and analysis methods. The detector employs a water-based target doped with gadolinium to enhance its sensitivity to antineutrinos. In this work, we describe the main features of the detector and the electronics chain, including front-end and data acquisition components. We detail the data acquisition strategies and the methodologies applied for signal processing and event selection. Preliminary physics results suggest that the detector can reliably monitor reactor operations by detecting the inverse beta decay induced by electron antineutrinos from the reactor.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear response of telecom-wavelength superconducting single-photon detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We measure the nonlinearity of a telecom-wavelength superconducting nanowire single-photon detector via incoherent beam combination. At typical photon count rates and detector bias current, the observed relative deviation from a perfectly linear response is in the order of 0.1% when the flux is doubled. This arises from a balance between the counteracting nonlinearities of deadtime-induced detector saturation and of multi-photon detections. The observed behaviour is modelled empirically, which suffices for a correction of measured data. In addition, statistical simulations, taking into account the measured recovery of the detection efficiency, provide insight into possible mechanisms of multi-photon detection.</description>

      <title>Substrate stiffness modulates bacterial adhesion and diversity of adherent phenotypes across growth stages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surface-adhesion and stiffness of underlying substrates mediate geometry, mechanics and self-organization of bacterial colonies. Recent studies have qualitatively indicted that stiffness may impact bacterial attachment, yet the variation of cell-to-surface adhesion with substrate stiffness remains to be quantified. Here, by developing a cell-level Force Distance Spectroscopy (FDS) technique based on Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), we simultaneously quantify the cell-surface adhesion alongside stiffness of the underlying substrates to reveal stiffness-dependent adhesion in phototrophic bacterium Chromatium okenii. As stiffness of the soft substrate, modelled via low-melting-point (LMP) agarose pad, was varied between 20 kPa and 120 kPa by changing agarose concentrations, we observe a progressive increase of the mean adhesion force by over an order of magnitude, from 0.21 (+/-0.10) nN to 2.42 (+/-1.16) nN. In contrast, passive polystyrene (PS) microparticles of comparable dimensions showed no perceptible change in their surface adhesion. Furthermore, for Escherichia coli, the cell-surface adhesion varied between 0.29 (+/-0.17) nN to 0.39 (+/-0.20) nN, showing a weak dependence on the substrate stiffness, thus suggesting that the stiffness-modulated adhesion is a species-specific trait. Finally, by quantifying the adhesion of C. okenii populations across growth stages, we report an emergent co-existence of weak and strongly adherent sub-populations, demonstrating a diversification of adherent phenotypes over time. Taken together, these findings suggest that bacteria, depending on the species and their physiological stage, actively modulate cell-to-surface adhesion in response to substrate stiffness, and leverage it as a functional trait to modulate initial attachment and colonization on soft substrates during early stages of biofilm development.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14790v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In Particle and Nuclear Physics research and related applications, organic scintillators provide a cost-effective technology for the detection of ionising radiation. The next generation of experiments in this field is driving fundamental research and development on these materials, demanding improved light yield, radiation hardness, and fast response. Common materials such as PEN and PET have been found to offer scintillation properties competitive to commercial alternatives without the use of dopants. Motivated by their complementarity in terms of light yield, radiation hardness, and response time, there is an increasing interest in investigating PET:PEN mixtures to ascertain whether they exhibit synergistic blending. This paper presents results from the systematic development of samples of PET, PEN, and PET:PEN mixtures with varied mass proportions. The manufacturing technique, involving injection moulding of granule raw material, is detailed. The effects of doping the polymer base substrate with fluorescent dopants are explored. Finally, the emission spectra of the different material compositions and their relative light output are presented.</description>

Abstract: The Time-Of-Propagation (TOP) counter is a ring-imaging Cherenkov detector designed to identify the charged hadrons in the barrel region of the Belle II detector. The Belle II experiment collected data delivered by the SuperKEKB accelerator from March 2019 to June 2022. After the first run period (Run1) a long shutdown (LS1) was dedicated to implement several accelerator and detector upgrades. The second collision period (Run2), started in January 2024. The components of the TOP detector and the performance during the Run1 will be reported, the detector upgrade during LS1 and future upgrades will be described.</description>
