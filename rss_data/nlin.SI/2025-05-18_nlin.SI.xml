      <title>The Beauty of Self-Duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-duality plays a very important role in many applications in field theories possessing topological solitons. In general, the self-duality equations are first order partial differential equations such that their solutions satisfy the second order Euler-Lagrange equations of the theory. The fact that one has to perform one integration less to construct self-dual solitons, as compared to the usual topological solitons, is not linked to the use of any dynamically conserved quantity. It is important that the topological charge admits an integral representation, and so there exists a density of topological charge. The homotopic invariance of it leads to local identities, in the form of second order differential equations. The magic is that such identities become the Euler-Lagrange equations of the theory when the self-duality equations are imposed. We review some important structures underlying the concept of self-duality, and show how it can be applied to kinks, lumps, monopoles, Skyrmions and instantons.</description>

      <title>Theta classes: generalized topological recursion, integrability and $\mathcal{W}$-constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the intersection theory of the $\Theta^{r,s}$-classes, where $r \geq 2$ and $1 \le s \le r-1$, which are cohomological field theories obtained as the top degrees of Chiodo classes. We show that the recently introduced generalized topological recursion on the $(r,s)$ spectral curves computes the descendant integrals of the $\Theta^{r,s}$-classes. As a consequence, we deduce that the descendant potential of the $\Theta^{r,s}$-classes is a tau function of the $r$-KdV hierarchy, generalizing the Br\'ezin--Gross--Witten tau function (the special case $r=2$, $s=1$). We also explicitly compute the $\mathcal{W}$-constraints satisfied by the descendant potential, obtained as differential representations of the $\mathcal{W}(\mathfrak{gl}_r)$-algebra at self-dual level. This work extends previously known results on the Witten $r$-spin class, the $r$-spin $\Theta$-classes (the case $s=r-1$), and the Norbury $\Theta$-classes (the special case $r=2$, $s=1$).</description>

      <title>Exactly solvable dissipative dynamics and one-form strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking in interacting two-dimensional spin systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dissipative dynamics of a class of interacting "gamma-matrix" spin models coupled to a Markovian environment. For spins on an arbitrary graph, we construct a Lindbladian that maps to a non-Hermitian model of free Majorana fermions hopping on the graph with a background classical $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge field. We show, analytically and numerically, that the steady states and relaxation dynamics are qualitatively independent of the choice of the underlying graph, in stark contrast to the Hamiltonian case. We also show that the exponentially many steady states provide a concrete example of mixed-state topological order, in the sense of strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking of a one-form symmetry. While encoding only classical information, the steady states still exhibit long-range quantum correlations. Afterward, we examine the relaxation processes toward the steady state by numerically computing decay rates, which we generically find to be finite, even in the dissipationless limit. We however identify symmetry sectors where fermion-parity conservation is enhanced to fermion-number conservation, where we can analytically bound the decay rates and prove that they vanish in the limits of both infinitely weak and infinitely strong dissipation. Finally, we show that while the choice of coherent dynamics is very flexible, exact solvability strongly constrains the allowed form of dissipation. Our work establishes an analytically tractable framework to explore nonequilibrium quantum phases of matter and the relaxation mechanisms toward them.</description>

      <title>The N-species integrable Volterra system as a maximally superintegrable Hamiltonian system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09487v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The results presented in this paper are a natural developments of those described in the paper {\it The Volterra Integrable case. Novel analytical and numerical results} (OCNMP Vol.4 (2024) pp 188-211), where the authors reconsidered the integrable case of the Hamiltonian $N$-species Lotka-Volterra system, introduced by Vito Volterra in 1937. There, an alternative approach for constructing the integrals of motion has been proposed, and compared with the old Volterra approach. Here we go beyond, and show that in fact the model introduced by Volterra and studied by us is not just integrable, but is maximally superintegrable and reducible to a system with only one degree of freedom regardless the number of species considered. We present both analytical and numerical results.</description>

      <title>On continual classes of evolution equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/nlin/0501038</link>
      <description>arXiv:nlin/0501038v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The original Miura transformation, considered as a nonlinear potential transformation, is applicable to a continual class of evolution equations, not only to discrete integrable equations and their hierarchies. The same continual class of evolution equations appears from a different problem, namely, from the gauge-invariant description of a zero-curvature representation with a definite x-part containing no essential parameter.</description>

      <title>On $\mathbb N$-Coefficient Binomial Polynomiality of Hurwitz Numbers and Generalized Dessin Counting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03212v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a certain type of Hurwitz numbers which count branched covers over the Riemann sphere admitting several branch points with fixed ramification types, one branch point with a fixed number of preimages, and one branch point with an arbitrary ramification type. We prove that the dependence of this kind of Hurwitz numbers on parts of the ramification type over the last point is a polynomial. Moreover, when expanding this polynomial in terms of products of binomial coefficients, we show that the coefficients are always non-negative integers via a pure combinatorial method. Our result generalizes the polynomiality in several models, including the one-part double Hurwitz numbers studied by Goulden-Jackson-Vakil, the one-part double Hurwitz numbers with completed cycles studied by Shadrin-Spitz-Zvonkine, and the generalized dessin counting.</description>
