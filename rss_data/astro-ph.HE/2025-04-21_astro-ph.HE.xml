      <title>JWST Discovery of a High-Redshift Tidal Disruption Event Candidate in COSMOS-Web</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rates and properties of tidal disruption events (TDEs) provide valuable insights into their host galaxy central stellar densities and the demographics of their central supermassive black holes (SMBHs). TDEs have been observed only at low redshifts ($z \lesssim 1$), due to the difficulty in conducting deep time-domain surveys. In this work, we present the discovery of a high-redshift TDE candidate, HZTDE-1, in the COSMOS-Web survey with JWST's NIRCam, using a novel selection technique based on color and morphology. We first outline a methodology for identifying high-z TDEs in deep infrared imaging surveys, leveraging their unique spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and morphologies of these transients. We apply this technique to COSMOS-Web in filters F115W, F150W, F277W, and F444W, and identify HZTDE-1, a transient point source relative to archival UltraVISTA infrared observations. If we assume it is a TDE, we estimate its photometric redshift to be $z=5.02^{+1.32}_{-1.11}$. HZTDE-1 cannot be explained by reasonable supernova or AGN models. However, we cannot rule out a superluminous supernova at $z\gtrsim3$. If confirmed with follow-up observations, HZTDE-1 would represent the highest-redshift TDE discovery to date, and would suggest an enhancement of the TDE rate in the high-redshift universe. Our method, which can be applied to future deep surveys with JWST and Roman, offers a pathway to identify TDEs at $z&gt;4$ and probe black hole demographics at early cosmic times.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity of BEACON to Ultra-High Energy Diffuse and Transient Neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-high energy neutrinos ($E&gt;10^{17}$ eV) can provide insight into the most powerful accelerators in the universe, however their flux is extremely low. The Beamforming Elevated Array for COsmic Neutrinos (BEACON) is a detector concept which efficiently achieves sensitivity to this flux by employing phased radio arrays on mountains, which search for the radio emission of up-going extensive air showers created by Earth-skimming tau neutrinos. Here, we calculate the point-source effective area of BEACON and characterize its sensitivity to transient neutrino fluences with both short ($&lt;15$ min) and long ($&gt; 1$ day) durations. Additionally, by integrating the effective area, we provide an updated estimate of the diffuse flux sensitivity. With just 100 stations, BEACON achieves sensitivity to short-duration transients such as nearby short gamma-ray bursts. With 1000 stations, BEACON achieves a sensitivity to long-duration transients, as well as the cosmogenic flux, ten times greater than existing experiments at 1 EeV. With an efficient design optimized for ultrahigh energy neutrinos, BEACON is capable of discovering the sources of neutrinos at the highest energies.</description>

      <title>Revealing the Accretion Flow in M87*: Insights from Faraday Rotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Faraday rotation measure (RM) is a commonly used tool to trace electron number density and magnetic fields in hot accretion flows, particularly in low-luminosity accreting supermassive black holes. We focus on the nuclear region of M87, which was observed at 230 GHz (1.3 mm) by the Event Horizon Telescope in 2019. It remains unclear whether this emission originates from the accretion flow, the jet base, or both. To probe the presence of an accretion flow, we explore the scenario where the linearly polarized emission from the counter-jet, visible at 43 GHz (7 mm), is Faraday-rotated by the accretion flow. We calculate theoretical predictions for counter-jet polarization using analytical and numerical models. In all cases, we find a Faraday-thick flow at 43 GHz (7 mm), with $\mathrm{RM} \sim 10^6$ rad m$^{-2}$, and a polarization angle that follows a linear relationship with wavelength squared, consistent with external Faraday rotation. The more realistic model, which includes turbulence and magnetic field fluctuations, predicts that the polarization pattern should be time-dependent, and that the counter-jet emission is depolarized due to Faraday depth fluctuations across the accretion flow. Despite the Faraday thick regime and strong depolarization, the linear relationship persists, enabling us to constrain the flow's physical properties. Comparing the counter-jet and forward-jet linear polarization states should enable detection of M87's accretion flow and provide lower limits on electron density, magnetic field strength, and mass accretion rate.</description>

      <title>A two-step strategy to identify episodic sources of gravitational waves and high energy neutrinos in starburst galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supermassive black hole mergers with spin-flips accelerate energetic particles through their precessing relativistic jets, producing high energy neutrinos and finally gravitational waves. In star formation massive stars come in pairs, triplets and quadruplets, allowing second generation mergers of the remnants with discrepant spin directions. The Gravitational Wave (GW) data support such a scenario. Earlier we suggested that stellar mass black hole mergers (visible in M82) with an associated spin-flip analogously allow the acceleration of energetic particles, with ensuing high energy neutrinos and high energy photons, and finally producing gravitational waves. At cosmic distances only the gravitational waves and the neutrinos remain detectable. Here we generalize the argument to starburst and normal galaxies throughout their cosmic evolution, and show that these galaxies may dominate over Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) in the flux of ultra-high energy particles observed at Earth. All these sources contribute to the cosmic neutrino background, as well as the gravitational wave background (they detected the lower frequencies). We outline a search strategy to find such episodic sources, which requires to include both luminosity and flux density.</description>

      <title>SRGAJ230631.0+155633: an extremely X-ray luminous, heavily obscured, radio-loud quasar at z=0.44 discovered by SRG/ART-XC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on a detailed study of a luminous, heavily obscured ($N_{\rm H} \sim 2 \times 10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$), radio-loud quasar SRGAJ230631.0+155633, discovered in the 4--12 keV energy band by the Mikhail Pavlinsky ART-XC telescope aboard the SRG observatory during the first two years of its all-sky X-ray survey in 2020--2021. The object is located at $z=0.4389$ and is a type 2 AGN according to optical spectroscopy (SDSS, confirmed by DESI). Our analysis combines data from the radio to the X-ray energy range, including quasi-simultaneous pointed observations with the SRG/ART-XC and Swift/XRT telescopes, conducted in June 2023. During these follow-up observations, the source was found in a significantly fainter but still very luminous state ($L_{\rm X}=1.0^{+0.8}_{-0.3} \times 10^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$, absorption corrected, 2--10 keV) compared to its discovery during the all-sky survey ($L_{\rm X}=6^{+6}_{-3}\times10^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$), which indicates significant intrinsic variability on a rest-frame time scale of $\sim 1$ year. The radio data show a complex morphology with a core and two extended radio lobes, indicating a giant FRII radio galaxy. Using multiwavelength photometry and the black hole--bulge mass scaling relation, we estimate the bolometric luminosity of the quasar at $\sim 6\times 10^{46}$ erg s$^{-1}$ and the mass of its central black hole at $\sim 1.4 \times 10^9$ $M_\odot$. This implies that the black hole is accreting at $\sim 30$ of the Eddington limit. Overall, SRGAJ230631.0+155633 proves to be one of the most luminous obscured quasars in the observable Universe out to $z=0.5$ (i.e. over the last 5 billion years of cosmic time). As such, it can serve as a valuable testbed for in-depth exploration of the physics of such objects, which were much more abundant in the younger Universe.</description>

      <title>Deriving the Energy Function of Non-repeaters from CHIME/FRB Baseband Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are radio pulses that originate from cosmological distance. Over 800 FRB sources with thousands of bursts have been detected, yet their origins remain unknown. Analyse of the energy function and the redshift evolution of volumetric rate could provide crucial insights into FRB progenitors. In this paper, we present the energy functions of non-repeaters selected from the CHIME/FRB baseband data using the $V_\mathrm{max}$ method. The $V_\mathrm{max}$ method allows us to measure redshift evolution without prior assumptions. We observed Schechter-like shapes in the energy function at low redshift region, while high redshift regions show a relatively small slope ($\gamma\approx -2$). The redshift evolution of volumetric rates shows an ambiguous trend, indicating that the population of non-repeaters is still not well understood. In the future, more samples and accurate measurements are needed to clarify these trends.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Evolution of Fast Radio Bursts and The Star Formation Rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the cosmological evolution of the luminosity and redshift of FRBs. As is the case for all extragalactic sources, we are dealing with data that are truncated by observational selection effects, the most important being the flux limit, which introduces the so-called Eddington-Malmquist bias. In addition, for FRBs, there is a significant uncertainty in the redshifts obtained from the observed dispersion measures. To correct for the truncation we use the non-parametric, non-binning Efron- Petrosian and Lynden-Bell methods, which give unbiased distributions of luminosities and redshifts and their cosmological evolution. To quantify the redshift uncertainty, we use a data set, which in addition to a mean redshift, gives the one-sigma errors. We construct three samples with lower, mean, and upper redshifts and apply the above methods to each. For the three samples, we find similar (1) &gt; 2.5{\sigma} evidence for luminosity evolution, (2) a luminosity function that can be fit by a simple broken power law, and (3) a comoving density formation rate that decreases rapidly with redshift unlike the cosmic star formation rate (SFR). This rate is similar to that of short gamma-ray bursts, which are believed to result from compact star mergers with a formation rate delayed relative to the SFR. This may further support the hypothesis that magnetars are the progenitors of FRBs.</description>

      <title>Geometric and Thermodynamic Properties of Frolov Black Holes with Topological Defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigated a modified Frolov black hole (BH) model that incorporates both a global monopole (GM) and a cosmic string (CS) to explore the interplay between non-singular BH regularization and topological defect effects. In our study, we derived a spacetime metric characterized by a regulated core through a length scale parameter $\alpha$ and introduced additional modifications via the GM parameter $\eta$ and the CS parameter $a$, which collectively alter the horizon structure and causal geometry of the BH. We analyzed the thermodynamic properties by deriving expressions for the mass function, Hawking temperature, and entropy, and found that the inclusion of GM and CS significantly deviates the BH entropy from the conventional Bekenstein-Hawking area law, while numerical investigations showed that the shadow radius exhibits contrasting behaviors: the Frolov parameters tend to reduce the shadow size whereas the topological defects enhance it. Furthermore, we examined the dynamics of scalar and electromagnetic perturbations by solving the massless Klein-Gordon equation in the BH background and computed the quasinormal modes (QNMs) using the WKB approximation, which confirmed the BH's stability and revealed that the oscillation frequencies and damping rates are strongly dependent on the parameters $\alpha$, $q$, $\eta$, and $a$. Our results suggest that the distinct observational signatures arising from this composite BH model may provide a promising avenue for testing modified gravity theories in the strong-field regime.</description>

      <title>Detection of two TeV gamma-ray outbursts from NGC 1275 by LHAASO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01215v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Water Cherenkov Detector Array (WCDA) is one of the components of Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) and can monitor any sources over two-thirds of the sky for up to 7 hours per day with &gt;98\% duty cycle. In this work, we report the detection of two outbursts of the Fanaroff-Riley I radio galaxy NGC 1275 that were detected by LHAASO-WCDA between November 2022 and January 2023 with statistical significance of 5.2~$\sigma$ and 8.3~$\sigma$. The observed spectral energy distribution in the range from 500 GeV to 3 TeV is fitted by a power-law with a best-fit spectral index of $\alpha=-3.37\pm0.52$ and $-3.35\pm0.29$, respectively. The outburst flux above 0.5~TeV was ($4.55\pm 4.21)\times~10^{-11}~\rm cm^{-2}~s^{-1}$ and ($3.45\pm 1.78)\times~10^{-11}~\rm cm^{-2}~s^{-1}$, corresponding to 60\%, 45\% of Crab Nebula flux. Variation analysis reveals the variability time-scale of days at the TeV energy band. A simple test by one-zone synchrotron self-Compton model reproduces the data in the gamma-ray band well.</description>

      <title>Physics of Pair Producing Gaps in Black Hole Magnetospheres: Two Dimensional General Relativistic Particle-in-cell Simulations</title>

Abstract: Black holes can launch powerful jets through the Blandford-Znajek process. This relies on enough plasma in the jet funnel to conduct the necessary current. However, in some low luminosity active galactic nuclei, the plasma supply near the jet base may be an issue. It has been proposed that spark gaps -- local regions with unscreened electric field -- can form in the magnetosphere, accelerating particles to initiate pair cascades, thus filling the jet funnel with plasma. In this paper, we carry out 2D general relativistic particle-in-cell (GRPIC) simulations of the gap, including self-consistent treatment of inverse Compton scattering and pair production. We observe gap dynamics that is fully consistent with our earlier 1D GRPIC simulations. We find strong dependence of the gap power on the soft photon spectrum and energy density, as well as the strength of the horizon magnetic field. We derive physically motivated scaling relations, and applying to M87, we find that the gap may be energetically viable for the observed TeV flares. For Sgr A$^*$, the energy dissipated in the gap may also be sufficient to power the X-ray flares.</description>

      <title>Symmetries of Vanishing Nonlinear Love Numbers of Schwarzschild Black Holes</title>

Abstract: The tidal Love numbers parametrize the conservative induced tidal response of self-gravitating objects. It is well established that asymptotically-flat black holes in four-dimensional general relativity have vanishing Love numbers. In linear perturbation theory, this result was shown to be a consequence of ladder symmetries acting on black hole perturbations. In this work, we show that a black hole's tidal response induced by a static, parity-even tidal field vanishes for all multipoles to all orders in perturbation theory. Our strategy is to focus on static and axisymmetric spacetimes for which the dimensional reduction to the fully nonlinear Weyl solution is well-known. We define the nonlinear Love numbers using the point-particle effective field theory, matching with the Weyl solution to show that an infinite subset of the static, parity-even Love number couplings vanish, to all orders in perturbation theory. This conclusion holds even if the tidal field deviates from axisymmetry. Lastly, we discuss the symmetries underlying the vanishing of the nonlinear Love numbers. An $\mathfrak{sl}(2,\mathbb R)$ algebra acting on a covariantly-defined potential furnishes ladder symmetries analogous to those in linear theory. This is because the dynamics of the potential are isomorphic to those of a static, massless scalar on a Schwarzschild background. We comment on the connection between the ladder symmetries and the Geroch group that is well-known to arise from dimensional reduction.</description>
