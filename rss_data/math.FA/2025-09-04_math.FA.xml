      <title>The Multiplicative Kowalski-Slodkowski Theorem for Hermitian Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove, for Hermitian algebras, the multiplicative version of the Kowalski-S\l{}odkowski Theorem which identifies the characters among the collection of all complex valued functions on a Banach algebra $A$ in terms of a spectral condition. Specifically, we show that, if $A$ is a Hermitian algebra, and if $\phi:A\mapsto\mathbb C$ is a continuous function satisfying $\phi(x)\phi(y) \in \sigma(xy)$ for all $x,y\in A$ (where $\sigma$ denotes the spectrum), then either $\phi$ or $-\phi$ is a character of $A$; of course the converse holds as well. Our proof depends fundamentally on the existence of positive elements and square roots in these algebras.</description>

      <title>Structure and Applications of $(p, q)$-Derivations in Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate $(p, q)$-derivations in both general algebras and Banach algebras. Our main result extends the Singer-Wermer theorem to $(p, q)$-derivations, proving that their ranges are contained in the radical of the algebra. As a direct consequence, we prove that the range of any left derivation lies within the radical of the algebra even without assuming continuity. This improves a result due to Bra\v{s}er and Vukman. For Banach algebras, we show that primitive ideals remain invariant under bounded $(p, q)$-derivations. Finally, we study $(p, q)$-derivations of group algebras and give an answer to the question posed.</description>

      <title>On stochastic forms of functional isoperimetric inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a probabilistic interpretation of several functional isoperimetric inequalities within the class of $p$-concave functions, building on random models for such functions introduced by P. Pivovarov and J. Rebollo-Bueno. First, we establish a stochastic isoperimetric inequality for a functional extension of the classical quermassintegrals, which yields a Sobolev-type inequality in this random setting as a particular case. Motivated by the latter, we further show that Zhang's affine Sobolev inequality holds in expectation when dealing with these random models of $p$-concave functions. Finally, we confirm that our results recover both their geometric analogues and deterministic counterparts. As a consequence of the latter, we establish a generalization of Zhang's affine Sobolev inequality restricted to $p$-concave functions in the context of convex measures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we prove interpolation results for $BMO$ in Lorentz spaces. From these results, we derive interpolation theorems in Besov spaces, the space $BV$, and fractional Sobolev spaces. As an application, we obtain geometric information about the jump set of functions in $BV \cap BMO$.</description>

      <title>Polynomial Stability of Non-Linearly Damped Contraction Semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the stability properties of an abstract class of semi-linear systems. Our main result establishes rational rates of decay for classical solutions assuming a certain non-uniform observability estimate for the linear part and suitable conditions on the non-linearity. We illustrate the strength of our abstract results by applying them to a one-dimensional wave equation with weak non-linear damping and to an Euler-Bernoulli beam with a tip mass subject to non-linear damping.</description>

      <title>An Approach to Sub-Gaussian Heat Kernel Estimates via Analysis on Metric Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we establish a new characterization of sub-Gaussian heat kernel estimates for Dirichlet forms on metric measure spaces. Our formulation is based on the newly introduced \emph{cutoff energy condition}, which provides a simpler and more transparent alternative for earlier technical energy inequalities, in particular the cutoff Sobolev inequality. The main idea of our approach is to reinterpret the cutoff Sobolev inequality as a certain Poincar\'e type inequality, and analyze it using Haj{\l}asz--Koskela techniques from analysis on metric spaces. We present a broad class of new examples in which the sub-Gaussian heat kernel estimates are verified.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the HRT conjecture holds when the Gabor system consists of a 4-point set in the time-frequency plane and a square-integrable function that is ultimately positive. We also prove the conjecture for Gabor systems generated by an ultimately positive function and translation sets, whose frequencies satisfy at most one linear dependence over $\mathbb{Z}$, improving a result of Benedetto and Bourouihiya.</description>

      <title>The toral contractions and $\Gamma$-distinguished $\Gamma$-contractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.08380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.08380v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A pair of commuting Hilbert space contractions $(T_1,T_2)$ is said to be toral if there is a polynomial $p \in \mathbb C[z_1,z_2]$ such that its zero set $Z(p)$ defines a distinguished variety in the bidisc $\mathbb D^2$ and $p(T_1,T_2)=0$. A pair of commuting Hilbert space operators $(S,P)$ is said to be a $\Gamma$-contraction if the closed symmetrized bidisc \[ \Gamma=\{ (z_1+z_2,z_1z_2)\,:\, |z_1|, \, |z_2| \leq 1 \} \] is a spectral set for $(S,P)$. A $\Gamma$-contraction $(S,P)$ is called $\Gamma$-distinguished if $q(S,P)=0$ for some polynomial $q\in \mathbb C[z_1,z_2]$ whose zero set $Z(q)$ gives rise to a distinguished variety in the symmetrized bidisc $\mathbb G_2$. We find necessary and sufficient conditions such that a toral pair of contractions dilates to a toral pair of isometries. In the same spirit, we characterize all $\Gamma$-distinguished $\Gamma$-contractions that admit dilation to $\Gamma$-distinguished $\Gamma$-isometries. The distinguished boundary of a distinguished variety in $\mathbb D^2$ and $\mathbb G_2$ is determined. Examples are provided at places to show the contrasts between the theory of toral contractions and $\Gamma$-distinguished $\Gamma$-contractions.</description>

      <title>Operator Decompositions and Weighted Frame Inequalities for Total Sequences in Hilbert Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01978v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study total sequences in Hilbert spaces and their relation to frame inequalities. Building on the recent theorem of Ozawa, which established that every total sequence can be rescaled to satisfy the lower frame inequality, we develop an operator--decomposition framework that both clarifies the proof strategy and extends the result.
  Our approach constructs a tail--adapted orthonormal system and a sequence of tail--supported approximants, leading to a canonical rank--one resolution of the identity in the strong operator topology. From this decomposition we derive a general weighted lower frame inequality: for any sequence of positive weights, one obtains a rescaling of the total sequence that ensures frame--type stability. In addition, we provide explicit formulas for the frame coefficients, expressed in terms of perturbation bounds and tail expansions, which render the construction constructive and quantitative.
  Taken together, these results reorganize Ozawa's argument into a transparent operator framework, extend it to general weighted inequalities, and provide explicit coefficient formulas. The main conclusion is that total sequences are not only rescalable into frames, but their stability can be quantified and localized along the tails of the sequence.</description>

      <title>Spectral comparison of compound cocycles generated by delay equations in Hilbert spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.02537v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study linear cocycles generated by nonautonomous delay equations in a proper Hilbert space and their extensions (compound cocycles) to exterior powers. Armed with the recently developed version of the Frequency Theorem, we develop analytic perturbation techniques for comparison of spectral properties (e.g., uniform exponential dichotomies) between such cocycles and cocycles generated by stationary equations. In the basis, there lies an interplay between regularity and structure in PDEs associated with delay equations. In particular, the developed machinery results in effective robust criteria for the absence of closed invariant contours on global attractors arising in nonlinear problems.</description>

      <title>The best approximation pair problem relative to two subsets in a normed space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18767v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the classical best approximation pair (BAP) problem, one is given two nonempty, closed, convex and disjoint subsets in a finite- or an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space, and the goal is to find a pair of points, each from each subset, which realizes the distance between the subsets. We discuss the problem in more general normed spaces and with possibly non-convex subsets, and focus our attention on the issues of uniqueness and existence of the solution to the problem. As far as we know, these fundamental issues have not received much attention. We present several sufficient geometric conditions for the (at most) uniqueness of a BAP. These conditions are related to the structure and the relative orientation of the boundaries of the subsets and to the norm. We also present many sufficient conditions for the existence of a BAP. Our results significantly extend the horizon of a recent algorithm for solving the BAP problem [Censor, Mansour, Reem, J. Approx. Theory (2024)]. The paper also shows, perhaps for the first time, how wide is the scope of the BAP problem in terms of the scientific communities which are involved in it (frequently independently) and in terms of its applications.</description>

      <title>New results related to cutters and to an extrapolated block-iterative method for finding a common fixed point of a collection of them</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20448v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a Hilbert space and a finite family of operators defined on the space, the common fixed point problem (CFPP) is to find a point in the intersection of the fixed point sets of these operators. Instances of the problem have numerous applications in science and engineering. We consider an extrapolated block-iterative method with dynamic weights for solving the CFPP assuming the operators belong to a wide class of operators called cutters. Global convergence is proved in two different scenarios, one of them is under a seemingly new condition on the weights which is less restrictive than a condition suggested in previous works. In order to establish convergence, we derive various new results of independent interest related to cutters, some of them extend, generalize and clarify previously published results.</description>

      <title>$\Lambda_p$ Style Bounds in Orlicz Spaces Close to $L^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00155v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $(\varphi_i)_{i=1}^n$ be mutually orthogonal functions on a probability space such that $\|\varphi_i\|_\infty \leq 1 $ for all $i \in [n]$. Let $\alpha &gt; 0$. Let $\Phi(u) = u^2 \log^{\alpha}(u)$ for $u \geq u_{0}$, and $\Phi(u) = c(\alpha) u^2$ otherwise. $u_0 \geq e$ and $c(\alpha)$ are constants chosen so that $\Phi$ is a Young function, depending only on $\alpha$. Our main result shows that with probability at least $1/4$ over subsets $I$ of $[n]$, where $I$ is constructed by choosing each index of $[n]$ independently from a Bernoulli distribution, the following holds: $|I| \geq \frac{n}{e \log^{\alpha+1}(n)} $ and for any $a \in \mathbb{C}^n$, $$ \left \|\sum_{i \in I} a_i \varphi_i \right \|_{\Phi} \leq K(\alpha) \log^{\frac{\alpha}{2}}(\log n) \cdot \|a\|_2. $$ $K(\alpha)$ is a constant depending only on $\alpha$.
  In the main Theorem of \cite{Ryou22}, Ryou proved the result above to a constant factor, depending on $p$ and $\alpha$, when the Orlicz space is a $L^p(\log L)^{p\alpha}$ space for $p &gt; 2$ where $|I| \sim \frac{n^{2/p}}{\log^{2 \alpha /p}(n)}$. However, their work did not extend to the case where $p=2$, an open question in \cite{Iosevich25}. Our result resolves the latter question up to $\log \log n$ factors. Moreover, our result sharpens the constants of Limonova's main result in \cite{Limonova23} from a factor of $\log n$ to a factor of $\log \log n$, if the orthogonal functions are bounded by a constant. In addition, our proof is much shorter and simpler than the latter's.
  Finally, to complement our main result, we give a probabilistic lower bound (subsets of $[n]$ are selected by a Bernoulli distribution over $[n]$'s indices) that matches our main result's upper bound.</description>
