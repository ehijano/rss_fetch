      <title>Probing the onset of collectivity via scaled particle spectra in ultrarelativistic nuclear collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We identify a novel scaling in the transverse momentum spectra of produced particles, obtained by removing the global scales of multiplicity and mean transverse momentum. Hydrodynamic simulations and experimental data reveal an almost universal scaled spectrum across centralities, systems, and even small systems, pointing to its origin in the collective, fluid-like dynamics of the QGP. Comparing this observable with Bayesian a priori distributions shows its independent constraining power on QCD transport properties, while also exposing limitations of current models. A detailed posterior analysis will be pursued in future work, opening a new avenue to refine our understanding of collectivity in heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>SMASH: Results from hadronic transport for heavy-ion collisions at high densities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This mini-review summarizes the general setup and some highlight results from the hadronic transport approach SMASH (Simulating Many Accelerated Strongly-interacting Hadrons). We start by laying out the software development structures as well as the particle properties and how they are determined by elementary collisions. The different ways to produce light clusters in SMASH, either by coalescence or dynamic multi-particle reactions, are explained. The constraints on nuclear mean fields and the corresponding equation of state from collective flow observables are discussed. In addition, we show how fluctuations associated with a potential critical endpoint survive through the hadronic rescattering stage. Besides hadronic observables, electromagnetic probes offer nice possibilities to study the properties of matter. We present results on collisional broadening of resonances and elliptic flow of dileptons. Last but not least, we review how SMASH can be employed as part of a hybrid approach including a Bayesian analysis for transport coefficients as a function of temperature and chemical potential. We end with an outlook how the hybrid approach has been recently extended to lower collision energies by dynamical fluidization initial conditions.</description>

      <title>Relativistic plane wave predictions of polarization transfer observables for ($\vec{p},2\vec{p}\,$) knockout reactions from the 3s$_{1/2}$ state in $^{208}$Pb at 392 MeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exclusive ($\vec{p},2\vec{p}$) reactions are often described within the Relativistic Distorted Wave Impulse Approximation (RDWIA) model to include nuclear distortion effects. The Relativistic Plane Wave Impulse Approximation (RPWIA) model, on the other hand, neglects these effects on the incident and outgoing proton wave functions. Our aim is to identify kinematic regions where the RPWIA model quantitatively describes energy-sharing analyzing power (A$_y$) and qualitatively describes the unpolarized triple differential cross section ($\sigma$) data. Where no data exist, we also seek regions where RPWIA gives similar results of the complete set of polarization transfer observables (D$_{i'j}$) compared to RDWIA. The sensitivity of the RPWIA predictions to different Relativistic Mean Field (RMF) models will be assessed. For an incident 392 MeV proton beam and coplanar scattering angles, $\theta_{a'} = 32.5^\circ$ and $\theta_{b'} = -50.0^\circ$, the RPWIA predictions of $\sigma$ and A$_y$ are compared to published data for ($\vec{p},2\vec{p}$) knockout from the 3s$_{1/2}$ state in $^{208}$Pb. In the RPWIA model the proton wave functions are treated as Dirac plane waves, the $NN$ interaction is modeled using the relativistic IA1 parameterization of the Relativistic Impulse Approximation (RIA) framework, and the boundstate wave functions are extracted from the RMF models. We found that within a range of $\pm10$ MeV around the peak of $\sigma$, the RPWIA and RDWIA models quantitatively describe the A$_y$ data and qualitatively the $\sigma$. Here, the RPWIA and RDWIA predictions agree for D$_{i'j}$. While $\sigma$ is sensitive to the RMF models, D$_{i'j}$ is not. Thus concluding that RPWIA can be applied to quantitative description of D$_{i'j}$ in a limited range for proton knockout from the 3s$_{1/2}$ state in $^{208}$Pb, and qualitatively describe the shape of $\sigma$.</description>

      <title>Small $x$ behavior in QCD from maximal entanglement and conformal invariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent evidence suggests that, at small Bjorken $x$, QCD evolution drives the proton into a state of maximal entanglement. If the evolution kernel is assumed to be conformally invariant -- as is the case for the Balitsky-Fadin-Kuraev-Lipatov (BFKL) equation -- we can describe it by a conformal field theory. Moreover, the central charge $c$ of the corresponding conformal field theory emerges as the key parameter governing the $x$-dependence of both the entanglement entropy and the structure function. Here we apply the exact Bethe Ansatz methods to the quantum spin chain dual to Lipatov's high energy effective action to extract the central charge of the theory, and find that $c=1$. This implies the $\sim x^{-1/3}$ small $x$ behavior for the structure function -- the prediction that can be tested at the forthcoming Electron-Ion Collider.</description>

      <title>Neutron Dark Decay in Neutron Stars: The Role of the Symmetry Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We conduct a systematic investigation of the influence of the nuclear symmetry energy on the proposed neutron decay into dark matter particles within the cores of neutron stars. Unlike the majority of previous studies that considered only pure neutron matter, the present analysis is extended to encompass $\beta$-stable nuclear matter. Furthermore, in relation to previous studies, the interactions between dark matter and baryons are incorporated and systematically studied regarding their effect on the structure of neutron stars. Our findings indicate that the nuclear symmetry energy plays a critical role in shaping the total equation of state (EoS) for dense neutron star matter containing dark sector components. The strength of interactions among dark matter particles, as well as between dark matter and baryons, is shown to be pivotal in determining both the composition and the macroscopic properties of neutron stars. The concurrent tuning of interaction strengths alongside the symmetry energy parameters may facilitate a more accurate reproduction of recent observational data relevant to neutron star properties. In any case, the extent to which the proposed dark decay of the neutron is affected by the extreme conditions prevailing in the interior of neutron stars remains an open problem.</description>

      <title>Novel Application of Neutrinos to Evaluate U.S. Nuclear Weapons Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11804v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is a growing realization that neutrinos can be used as a diagnostic tool to better understand the inner workings of a nuclear weapon. Robust estimates demonstrate that an Inverse Beta Decay (IBD) neutrino scintillation detector built at the Nevada Test Site of 1000-ton active target mass at a standoff distance of 500 m would detect thousands of neutrino events per kTe of nuclear yield. This would provide less than 4% statistical error on measured neutrino rate and 5% error on neutrino energy. Extrapolating this to an error on the test device explosive yield requires knowledge from evaluated nuclear databases, non-equilibrium fission rates, and assumptions on internal neutron fluxes. Initial calculations demonstrate that prompt neutrino rates from a short pulse of Pu-239 fission is about a factor of two less than that from a steady state assumption. As well, there are significant energy spectral differences as a function of time after the pulse that needs to be considered. In the absence of nuclear weapons testing, many of the technical and theoretical challenges of a full nuclear test could be mitigated with a low cost smaller scale 20 ton fiducial mass IBD demonstration detector placed near a TRIGA pulsed reactor. The short duty cycle and repeatability of pulses would provide critical real environment testing and the measured neutrino rate as a function of time data would provide unique constraints on fission databases and equilibrium assumptions.</description>

      <title>Ultra-cold neutron simulation framework for the free neutron lifetime experiment $\tau$SPECT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15239v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The precise determination of the free neutron lifetime is of great significance in modern precision physics. This key observable is linked to the mixing of up and down quarks via the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix element $V_{ud}$, and the abundance of primordial elements after the Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis. However, the two leading measurement techniques for the neutron lifetime currently yield incompatible results, a discrepancy referred to as the neutron lifetime puzzle. To address the systematic uncertainties arising from neutron interactions with material walls, the $\tau$SPECT experiment employs a fully magnetic trap for ultra-cold neutrons (UCNs).
  UCNs are extremely low-energy neutrons with typical velocities below $8\,\textrm{m/s}$, which can be manipulated using magnetic fields, gravity, and suitable material guides, whose surface can reflect them at any angle of incidence. To precisely study and characterize UCN behavior during production, guidance, storage, and detection in $\tau$SPECT, we have developed a dedicated simulation framework. This framework is built upon the externally developed UCN Monte Carlo software package PENTrack and is enhanced with two companion tools: one for flexible and parametrizable upstream configuration of PENTrack such that the simulation's input settings can be adjusted to reproduce the experimental observations. The second package is used for analyzing, visualizing, and animating simulation data.
  The simulation results align well with experimental data obtained with $\tau$SPECT at the Paul Scherrer Institute and serve as a powerful resource for identifying systematic uncertainties and guiding future improvements to the current experimental setup.</description>
