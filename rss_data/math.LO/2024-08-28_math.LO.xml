      <title>Rule-Elimination Theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cut-elimination theorems constitute one of the most important classes of theorems of proof theory. Since Gentzen's proof of the cut-elimination theorem for the system $\mathbf{LK}$, several other proofs have been proposed. Even though the techniques of these proofs can be modified to sequent systems other than $\mathbf{LK}$, they are essentially of a very particular nature; each of them describes an algorithm to transform a given proof to a cut-free proof. However, due to its reliance on heavy syntactic arguments and case distinctions, such an algorithm makes the fundamental structure of the argument rather opaque. We, therefore, consider rules abstractly, within the framework of logical structures familiar from universal logic \`a la Jean-Yves B\'eziau, and aim to clarify the essence of the so-called ``elimination theorems''. To do this, we first give a non-algorithmic proof of the cut-elimination theorem for the propositional fragment of $\mathbf{LK}$. From this proof, we abstract the essential features of the argument and define something called ``normal sequent structures'' relative to a particular rule. We then prove a version of the rule-elimination theorem for these. Abstracting even more, we define ``abstract sequent structures'' and show that for these structures, the corresponding version of the ``rule''-elimination theorem has a converse as well.</description>

      <title>Uncountable sets and an infinite linear order game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An infinite game on the set of real numbers appeared in Matthew Baker's work [Math. Mag. 80 (2007), no. 5, pp. 377--380] in which he asks whether it can help characterize countable subsets of the reals. This question is in a similar spirit to how the Banach-Mazur Game characterizes meager sets in an arbitrary topological space.
  In a recent paper, Will Brian and Steven Clontz prove that in Baker's game, Player II has a winning strategy if and only if the payoff set is countable. They also asked if it is possible, in general linear orders, for Player II to have a winning strategy on some uncountable set.
  To this we give a positive answer and moreover construct, for every infinite cardinal $\kappa$, a dense linear order of size $\kappa$ on which Player II has a winning strategy on all payoff sets. We finish with some future research questions, further underlining the difficulty in generalizing the characterization of Brian and Clontz to linear orders.</description>

      <title>Morse theory in definably complete d-minimal structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a definable complete d-minimal expansion $(F, &lt;, +, \cdot, 0, 1, \dots,)$ of an oredered field $F$. Let $X$ be a definably compact definably normal definable $C^r$ manifold and $2 \le r &lt;\infty$. We prove that the set of definable Morse functions is open and dense in the set of definable $C^r$ functions on $X$ with respect to the definable $C^2$ topology.</description>

      <title>Simple Models of Randomization and Preservation Theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main purpose of this paper is to present new and more uniform model-theoretic/combinatorial proofs of the theorems (in [5] and [4]): The randomization $T^{R}$ of a complete first-order theory $T$ with $NIP$/stability is a (complete) first-order continuous theory with $NIP$/stability. The proof method for both theorems is based on the significant use of a particular type of models of $T^{R}$, namely simple models, and certain indiscernible arrays. Using simple models of $T^R$ gives the advantage of re-proving these theorems in a simpler and quantitative manner. We finally turn our attention to $NSOP$ in randomization. We show that based on the definition of $NSOP$ given [11], $T^R$ is stable if and only if it is $NIP$ and $NSOP$.</description>

      <title>The equational theory of the Weihrauch lattice with (iterated) composition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the equational theory of the Weihrauch lattice with composition and iterations, meaning the collection of equations between terms built from variables, the lattice operations $\sqcup$, $\sqcap$, the composition operator $\star$ and its iteration $(-)^\diamond$ , which are true however we substitute (slightly extended) Weihrauch degrees for the variables. We characterize them using B\"uchi games on finite graphs and give a complete axiomatization that derives them. The term signature and the axiomatization are reminiscent of Kleene algebras, except that we additionally have meets and the lattice operations do not fully distributes over composition. The game characterization also implies that it is decidable whether an equation is universally valid. We give some complexity bounds; in particular, the problem is Pspace-hard in general and we conjecture that it is solvable in Pspace.</description>

      <title>Glivenko-Cantelli classes and NIP formulas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2103.10788v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give several new equivalences of $NIP$ for formulas and new proofs of known results using [T87] and [HOR91]. We emphasize that Keisler measures are more complicated than types (even in $NIP$ context), in an analytic sense. Among other things, we show that, for a first order theory $T$ and formula $\phi(x,y)$, the following are equivalent:
  (i) $\phi$ has $NIP$ (for theory $T$).
  (ii) For any global $\phi$-type $p(x)$ and any model $M$, if $p$ is finitely satisfiable in $M$, then $p$ is generalized $DBSC$ definable over $M$. In particular, if $M$ is countable, $p$ is $DBSC$ definable over $M$. (Cf. Definition 3.3, Fact 3.4.)
  (iii) For any global Keisler $\phi$-measure $\mu(x)$ and any model $M$, if $\mu$ is finitely satisfiable in $M$, then $\mu$ is generalized Baire-1/2 definable over $M$. In particular, if $M$ is countable, $p$ is Baire-1/2 definable over $M$. (Cf. Definition 3.5.)
  (iv) For any model $M$ and any Keisler $\phi$-measure $\mu(x)$ over $M$, \begin{align*} \sup_{b\in M}|\frac{1}{k}\sum_1^k\phi(p_i,b)-\mu(\phi(x,b))|\to 0 \end{align*} for almost every $(p_i)\in S_{\phi}(M)^{\Bbb N}$ with the product measure $\mu^{\Bbb N}$. (Cf. Theorem 4.3.)
  (v) Suppose moreover that $T$ is countable, then for any countable model $M$, the space of global $M$-finitely satisfied types/measures is a Rosenthal compactum. (Cf. Theorem A.1.)</description>

      <title>Axiomatization and Forcing in Set Theory with Urelements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.13627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.13627v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the first part of this paper, we consider several natural axioms in urelement set theory, including the Collection Principle, the Reflection Principle, the Dependent Choice scheme and its generalizations, as well as other axioms specifically concerning urelements. We prove that these axioms form a hierarchy over $\ZFCUR$ (ZFC with urelements formulated with Replacement) in terms of direct implication. The second part of the paper studies forcing over countable transitive models of $\ZFUR$. We propose a new definition of $\P$-names to address an issue with the existing approach. We then prove the fundamental theorem of forcing with urelements regarding axiom preservation. Moreover, we show that forcing can destroy and recover certain axioms within the previously established hierarchy. Finally, we demonstrate how ground model definability may fail when the ground model contains a proper class of urelements.</description>

Abstract: For all $d \geq 3$ we show that the cardinality of $ \mathbb{R} $ is at most $\aleph_n $ if and only if $ \mathbb{R}^d $ can be covered with $ ( n + 1 ) ( d - 1 ) + 1 $ sprays whose centers are in general position in a hyperplane. This extends previous results by Schmerl when $ d = 2 $.</description>

      <title>On topological groupoids that represent theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.16331v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Grothendieck toposes, and by extension, logical theories, can be represented by topological structures. Butz and Moerdijk showed that every topos with enough points can be represented as the topos of sheaves on an open topological groupoid. This paper tackles a follow-up question: we characterise, in model-theoretic terms, which open topological groupoids can represent the classifying topos of a theory. Intuitively, this characterises which groupoids of models contain enough information to reconstruct the theory. Our treatment subsumes many of the previous approaches found in the literature, such as that of Awodey, Forssell, Butz and Moerdijk.</description>

      <title>Uniform Borel amenability is equivalent to randomized hyperfiniteness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12565v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Whether Borel amenability implies hyperfiniteness is a main open question in the theory of Borel equivalence relations. Under a mild extra uniformity condition, we prove that Borel amenability of bounded degree Borel graphs is equivalent to a randomized version of hyperfiniteness. Our new approach yields simple proofs and generalizations for the Ornstein-Weiss theorem, the Quasi-Tiling theorem and the Connes-Feldman-Weiss theorem. One result is that the main conjecture holds up to a compressible set (that is, a set that admits no invariant probability measure).</description>
