      <title>Solar Cruiser Disturbance Torque Estimation and Predictive Momentum Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel disturbance-torque-estimation-augmented model predictive control (MPC) framework to perform momentum management on NASA's Solar Cruiser solar sail mission. Solar Cruiser represents a critical step in the advancement of large-scale solar sail technology and includes the innovative use of an active mass translator (AMT) and reflectivity control devices (RCDs) as momentum management actuators. The coupled nature of these actuators has proven challenging in the development of a robust momentum management controller. Recent literature has explored the use of MPC for solar sail momentum management with promising results, although exact knowledge of the disturbance torques acting on the solar sail was required. This paper amends this issue through the use of a Kalman filter to provide real-time estimation of unmodeled disturbance torques. Furthermore, the dynamic model used in this paper incorporates key fidelity enhancements compared to prior work, including the Solar Cruiser's four-reaction-wheel assembly and the offset between its center of mass and center of pressure. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed policy successfully manages angular momentum growth under slew maneuvers that exceed the operational envelope of the current state-of-the-art method. The inclusion of the disturbance torque estimate is shown to greatly improve the reliability and performance of the proposed MPC approach. This work establishes a new benchmark for Solar Cruiser's momentum management capabilities and paves the way for MPC-based momentum management of other solar sails making use of an AMT and/or RCDs.</description>

      <title>Light-tight skipper-CCDs for X-ray detection in space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Skipper Charge-Coupled Devices (skipper-CCDs) are pixelated silicon detectors with deep sub-electron resolution. Their radiation hardness and capability to reconstruct energy deposits with unprecedented precision make them a promising technology for space-based X-ray astronomy. In this scenario, optical and near-infrared photons may saturate the sensor, distorting the reconstructed signal. We present a light-tight shield for skipper-CCDs to suppress optical backgrounds while preserving X-ray detection efficiency. We deposited thin aluminum layers on the CCD surface using an e-beam evaporator and evaluated their blinding performance across wavelengths from 650 to 1000 nm using a monochromator, as well as the X-ray transmission using an $^{55}$Fe source. We find that 50 and 100\,nm layers provide &gt;99.6\% light suppression, with no efficiency loss for 5.9 and 6.4\,keV X-rays. In addition, we used Geant4 simulations to extend these results to a broader energy range and quantify the efficiency loss for different aluminum thicknesses. Results show that thin aluminum coatings are an effective, low-cost solution for optical suppression in skipper-CCDs intended for X-ray detection and space instrumentation.</description>

      <title>Betelgeuse: Detection of the Expanding Wake of the Companion Star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent analyses conclude that Betelgeuse, a red supergiant star (HD 39801), likely has a companion object with a period of about 2000 days orbiting at only 2.3 stellar radii, deep in the chromosphere of the supergiant. A probable detection of such a companion, named Siwarha, has just occurred from speckle imaging. This study finds that Betelgeuse spectra in the optical region and ultraviolet exhibit signatures of variable circumstellar absorption and chromospheric outflows. These variations are consistent with the ~ 2000-day period of the companion object. Circumstellar absorption evident in optical Mn I lines, and mass outflow marked by ultraviolet Fe II, Si I, and Mg I lines increase after the transit of the companion across the disk of Betelgeuse. Following the eclipse of the companion, the absorption and outflow slowly decrease in advance of the next transit. The occurrence and variation of this plasma appear consistent with the presence of a trailing and expanding wake caused by a companion star orbiting within the atmosphere of Betelgeuse.</description>

      <title>Spectral performance of single-channel plastic and GAGG scintillator bars of the CUbesat Solar Polarimeter (CUSP)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00485</link>

Abstract: Our Sun is the closest X-ray astrophysical source to Earth. As such, it makes a formidable case study to better understand astrophysical processes. Solar flares are in particular very interesting as they are linked to coronal mass ejections as well as magnetic field reconnection sites in the solar atmosphere. Flares can therefore provide insightful information on the physical processes at play on their production sites, but also on the emission and acceleration of energetic charged particles towards our planet, making it a formidable forecasting tool for space weather. While solar flares are critical to understanding magnetic reconnection and particle acceleration, their hard X-ray polarization -- key to distinguishing between competing theoretical models -- remains poorly constrained by existing observations. To address this, we present the CUbesat Solar Polarimeter (CUSP), a mission under development to perform solar flare polarimetry in the 25-100 keV energy range. CUSP consists of a 6U-XL platform hosting a dual-phase Compton polarimeter. The polarimeter is made of a central assembly of four 4x4 arrays of plastic scintillators, each coupled to multi-anode photomultiplier tubes, surrounded by four strips of eight elongated GAGG scintillator bars coupled to avalanche photodiodes. Both types of sensors from Hamamatsu are respectively read out by the MAROC-3A and SKIROC-2A ASICs from Weeroc. In this manuscript, we present the preliminary spectral performances of single plastic and GAGG channels measured in the laboratory using development boards of the ASICs foreseen for the flight model.</description>

      <title>Factors Controlling the Statistics of Magnetic Reconnection in MHD Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07502v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the statistics of dynamical quantities associated with magnetic reconnection events embedded in a sea of strong background magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence using direct numerical simulations. We focus on the relationship of the reconnection properties to the statistics of global turbulent fields. For the first time, we show that the distribution in turbulence of reconnection rates (determined by upstream fields) is strongly correlated with the magnitude of the global turbulent magnetic field at the correlation scale. The average reconnection rates, and associated dissipation rates, during turbulence are thus much larger than predicted by using turbulent magnetic field fluctuation amplitudes at the dissipation or kinetic scales. Magnetic reconnection may therefore be playing a major role in energy dissipation in astrophysical and heliospheric turbulence.</description>

      <title>Properties of current sheets in two-dimensional tearing-mediated magnetohydrodynamic turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16707v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is well known that the nonlinear evolution of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence generates intermittent current sheets. In the solar wind turbulence, current sheets are frequently observed and they are believed to be an important pathway for the turbulence energy to dissipate and heat the plasma. In this study, we perform a comprehensive analysis of current sheets in a high-resolution two-dimensional simulation of balanced, incompressible MHD turbulence. The simulation parameters are selected such that tearing mode instability is triggered and plasmoids are generated throughout the simulation domain. We develop an automated method to identify current sheets and accurately quantify their key parameters including thickness ($a$), length ($L$), and Lundquist number ($S$). Before the triggering of tearing instability, the current sheet lengths are mostly comparable to the energy injection scale. After the tearing mode onsets, smaller current sheets with lower Lundquist numbers are generated. We find that the aspect ratio ($a/L$) of the current sheets scales approximately as $S^{-1/2}$, i.e. the Sweet-Parker scaling. While a power-law scaling between $L$ and $a$ is observed, no clear correlation is found between the upstream magnetic field strength and thickness $a$. Finally, although the turbulence energy shows anisotropy between the directions parallel and perpendicular to the local magnetic field increment, we do not observe a direct correspondence between the shape of the current sheets and that of the turbulence "eddies." These results suggest that one needs to be cautious when applying the scale-dependent dynamic alignment model to the analysis of current sheets in MHD turbulence.</description>
