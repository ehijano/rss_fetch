      <title>The failure of square at all uncountable cardinals is weaker than a Woodin limit of Woodin cardinals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We force the Axiom of Choice over the least initial segment of a Nairian model satisfying ZF. In the forcing extension, square_kappa fails at all uncountable cardinals kappa, and every regular cardinal is omega-strongly measurable in HOD, as witnessed by the omega-club filter. Thus the failure of square everywhere is within the current reach of inner model theory, and the HOD Hypothesis is not provable in ZFC.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of finite Quasi-Probability and Probability from Principles: The Role of Syntactic Locality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasi-probabilities appear across diverse areas of physics, but their conceptual foundations remain unclear: they are often treated merely as computational tools, and operations like conditioning and Bayes' theorem become ambiguous. We address both issues by developing a principled framework that derives quasi-probabilities and their conditional calculus from structural consistency requirements on how statements are valued across different universes of discourse, understood as finite Boolean algebras of statements.We begin with a universal valuation that assigns definite (possibly complex) values to all statements. The central concept is Syntactic Locality: every universe can be embedded within a larger ambient one, and the universal valuation must behave coherently under such embeddings and restrictions. From a set of structural principles, we prove a representation theorem showing that every admissible valuation can be re-expressed as a finitely additive measure on mutually exclusive statements, mirroring the usual probability sum rule. We call such additive representatives pre-probabilities. This representation is unique up to an additive regraduation freedom. When this freedom can be fixed canonically, pre-probabilities reduce to finite quasi-probabilities, thereby elevating quasi-probability theory from a computational device to a uniquely determined additive representation of universal valuations. Classical finite probabilities arise as the subclass of quasi-probabilities stable under relativisation, i.e., closed under restriction to sub-universes. Finally, the same framework enables us to define a coherent theory of conditionals, yielding a well-defined generalized Bayes' theorem applicable to both pre-probabilities and quasi-probabilities. We conclude by discussing additional regularity conditions, including the role of rational versus irrational probabilities in this setting.</description>

      <title>Strongly increasing sequences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06758v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using a variation of Woodin's $\mathbb{P}_{\mathrm{max}}$ forcing, we force over a model of the Axiom of Determinacy to produce a model of ZFC containing a very strongly increasing sequence of length $\omega_{2}$ consisting of functions from $\omega$ to $\omega$. We also show that there can be no such sequence of length $\omega_{4}$.</description>

      <title>Parametrized complexity of relations between multidimensional subshifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24343v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the parametrized complexity of fundamental relations between multidimensional subshifts, such as equality, conjugacy, inclusion, and embedding, for subshifts of finite type (SFTs) and effective subshifts. We build on previous work of E. Jeandel and P. Vanier on the complexity of these relations as two-input problems, by fixing one subshift as parameter and taking the other subshift as input. We study the impact of various dynamical properties related to periodicity, minimality, finite type, etc. on the computational properties of the parameter subshift, which reveals interesting differences and asymmetries.
  Among other notable results, we find choices of parameter that reach the maximum difficulty for each problem; we find nontrivial decidable problems for multidimensional SFT, where most properties are undecidable; and we find connections with recent work relating having computable language and being minimal for some property, showing in particular that this property may not always be chosen conjugacy-invariant.</description>

      <title>A Note on Pseudofinite W*-Probability Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06455v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce pseudofinite W*-probability spaces. These are W*-probability spaces that are elementarily equivalent to Ocneanu ultraproducts of finite-dimensional von Neumann algebras equipped with arbitrary faithful normal states. We are particularly interested in the case where these finite-dimensional von Neumann algebras are full matrix algebras: the pseudofinite factors. We show that these are indeed factors. We see as a consequence that pseudofinite factors are never of type $\mathrm{III}_0$. Mimicking the construction of the Powers factors, we give explicit families of examples of matrix algebra ultraproducts that are $\mathrm{III}_\lambda$ factors for $\lambda \in (0,1]$. We show that these examples share their universal theories with the corresponding Powers factor and thus have uncomputable universal theories. Finally, we show that pseudofinite factors are full. This generalizes a theorem of Farah-Hart-Sherman which shows that pseudofinite tracial factors do not have property $\Gamma$. It has the consequence that hyperfinite factors of type $\mathrm{III}$ (the Powers factors) are never pseudofinite. Our proofs combine operator algebraic insights with routine continuous logic syntactic arguments: using \L os' theorem to prove that certain sentences which are true for all matrix algebras are inherited by their ultraproducts.</description>

      <title>There is no Definable Grauert Direct Image Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18711v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the claim in the title by showing that a definable Grauert Direct Image
  Theorem in o-minimal geometry would imply a weak
  representability-like property of the definable Picard functor. However, this weak representability cannot hold because of the Definable Chow Theorem of Peterzil and Starchenko.
