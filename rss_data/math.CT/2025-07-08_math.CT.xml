      <title>Prenormal categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce the notion of (pointed) prenormal category, modelled after regular categories, but with the key notions of coequaliser and kernel pair replaced by those of cokernel and kernel. This framework provides a natural setting for extending certain classical results in algebra. We study the fundamental properties of prenormal categories, including a characterisation in terms of a factorisation system involving normal epimorphisms, and a categorical version of Noether's so-called `third isomorphism theorem'. We also present a range of examples, with the category of commutative monoids constituting a central one. In the second part of the paper we extend prenormality and its related properties to the non-pointed context, using kernels and cokernels defined relative to a distinguished class of trivial objects.</description>

      <title>The Flat Cover Conjecture for Monoid Acts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the Flat Cover Conjecture holds for the category of (right) acts over any right-reversible monoid $S$, provided that the flat $S$-acts are closed under stable Rees extensions. The argument shows that the class $\mathcal{F}$-Mono ($S$-act monomorphisms with flat Rees quotient) is cofibrantly generated in such categories, answering a question of Bailey and Renshaw. But cofibrant generation of $\mathcal{SF}$-Mono ($S$-act monomorphisms with \emph{strongly} flat Rees quotient) appears much stronger, since we show it implies that there is a bound on the size of the indecomposable strongly flat acts. Similarly, cofibrant generation of $\mathcal{U}_{\mathcal{F}}$ (unitary monomorphisms with flat complement) implies a bound on the size of indecomposable flat acts. The key tool is a new characterization of cofibrant generation of a class $\mathcal{M}$ of monomorphisms, in terms of ``almost everywhere" effectiveness of $\mathcal{M}$.</description>

We also consider the gluing of $s$-torsion pairs and extriangulated factorization systems under recollements of extriangulated categories.</description>

      <title>An Alternative Model for Coherent Sheaves over Noetherian Schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The category of coherent sheaves over a noetherian scheme is very important for studying the properties of a given scheme. For noetherian schemes it is a well-known fact that the topology can be fully recovered from the corresponding partially ordered set of its points together with the specializaion partial order. Here we show that the same thing holds for the category of coherent sheaves over a noetherian scheme, i.e. there exists an equivalent description of this category in the "language" of this poset. First we build the equivalent notion of the structure sheaf, then we introduce the desired functor from the category of coherent sheaves to a certain category of presheaves over it, show this functor is fully faithful, describe its essential image and hence find an equivalent category for the category of coherent sheaves over a noetherian scheme. This paper is based on the author's master's thesis.</description>

      <title>The Joys of Categorical Conformal Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conformal prediction (CP) is an Uncertainty Representation technique that delivers finite-sample calibrated prediction regions for any underlying Machine Learning model, yet its status as an Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) tool has remained conceptually opaque. We adopt a category-theoretic approach to CP -- framing it as a morphism, embedded in a commuting diagram, of two newly-defined categories -- that brings us three joys. First, we show that -- under minimal assumptions -- CP is intrinsically a UQ mechanism, that is, its UQ capabilities are a structural feature of the method. Second, we demonstrate that CP bridges (and perhaps subsumes) the Bayesian, frequentist, and imprecise probabilistic approaches to predictive statistical reasoning. Finally, we show that a conformal prediction region (CPR) is the image of a covariant functor. This observation is relevant to AI privacy: It implies that privacy noise added locally does not break coverage.</description>

      <title>Differentiable structures on a union of two open sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a recent paper the authors classified differentiable structures on the non-Hausdorff one-dimensional manifold $\mathbb{L}$ called the line with two origins which is obtained by gluing two copies of the real line $\mathbb{R}$ via the identity homeomorphism of $\mathbb{R}\setminus 0$.
  Here we give a classification of differentiable structures on another non-Hausdorff one-dimensional manifold $\mathbb{Y}$ (called letter "$Y$") obtained by gluing two copies of $\mathbb{R}$ via the identity map of positive reals. It turns out that, in contrast to the real line, for every $r=1,\ldots,\infty$, both manifolds $\mathbb{L}$ and $\mathbb{Y}$ admit uncountably many pair-wise non-diffeomorphic $\mathcal{C}^{k}$-structures.
  We also observe that the proofs of these classifications are very similar. This allows to formalize the arguments and extend them to a certain general statement about arrows in arbitrary categories.</description>

      <title>Higher-dimensional generalization of abelian categories via DG-categories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06955v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce abelian $n$-truncated DG-categories as an $n$-dimensional analogue of abelian categories in the setting of DG-categories. When $n=1$, this recovers ordinary abelian categories, and when $n=\infty$, it corresponds to stable DG-categories. This notion serves as a DG-categorical analogue of abelian $(n,1)$-categories in the context of $(n,1)$-categories. We show that the homotopy categories of abelian $n$-truncated DG-categories acquire the structure of extriangulated and pretriangulated categories. Furthermore, we develop a general theory of abelian $n$-truncated DG-categories, including the analogues of the existence epi-mono factorizations of morphisms, as in classical abelian categories.</description>

      <title>Projective crossed modules in semi-abelian categories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19165v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We characterize projective objects in the category of internal crossed modules within any semi-abelian category. When this category forms a variety of algebras, the internal crossed modules again constitute a semi-abelian variety, ensuring the existence of free objects, and thus of enough projectives. We show that such a variety is not necessarily Schreier, but satisfies the so-called Condition (P) -- meaning the class of projectives is closed under protosplit subobjects -- if and only if the base variety satisfies this condition. As a consequence, the non-additive left chain-derived functors of the connected components functor are well defined in this context.</description>

      <title>The concept of nullity in general spaces and contexts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00212v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The notion of nullity is present in all discourses of mathematics. The two most familiar notions of nullity are "almost-every" and "almost none". A notion of nullity corresponds to a choice of subsets that one interprets as null or non-empty. The rationale behind this choice depends on the context, such as Topology or Measure theory. One also expects that the morphisms or transformations within the contexts preserve the nullity structures. Extending this idea, a generalized notion of nullity is presented as a functor between categories. A constructive procedure is presented for extending the notion of nullity to categories with richer structure. Thus nullity in a category, such as that of general vector spaces, can be provided a recursive definition. Thus nullity is an arbitrary construct, which can be extended to broader contexts using well defined rules. These rules are succinctly expressed by right and left Kan extensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03717v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formulate a definition of the existence property that works with "structural" set theories, in the mode of ETCS (the elementary theory of the category of sets). We show that a range of structural set theories, when formulated using constructive logic, satisfy the disjunction, numerical existence, and existence properties; in particular, intuitionist ETCS, formulated with separation and Shulman's replacement of contexts axiom, satisfies these properties. As a consequence of this, we show that, working constructively, replacement of contexts is strictly weaker than collection.</description>

      <title>The DeMorganization of a locale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12486v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 2009, Caramello proved that each topos has a largest dense subtopos whose internal logic satisfies De Morgan law (also known as the law of the weak excluded middle). This finding implies that every locale has a largest dense extremally disconnected sublocale, referred to as its DeMorganization. In this paper, we take the first steps in exploring the DeMorganization in the localic context, shedding light on its geometric nature by showing that it is always a fitted sublocale and by providing a concrete description. Explicit examples of DeMorganizations for toposes that do not satisfy De Morgan law are rather difficult to find. We present a contribution in that direction, with the main result of the paper showing that for any metrizable locale (without isolated points), its DeMorganization coincides with its Booleanization. This, in particular, implies that any extremally disconnected metric locale (without isolated points) must be Boolean, generalizing a well-known result for topological spaces to the localic setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10928v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper builds on top of arXiv:2306.02734. We consider a complete, separated topological ring $\mathfrak R$ with a countable base of neighborhoods of zero consisting of open two-sided ideals. The main result is that the homotopy category of projective left $\mathfrak R$-contramodules is equivalent to the derived category of the exact category of flat left $\mathfrak R$-contramodules, and also to the homotopy category of flat cotorsion left $\mathfrak R$-contramodules. In other words, a complex of flat $\mathfrak R$-contramodules is contraacyclic (in the sense of Becker) if and only if it is an acyclic complex with flat $\mathfrak R$-contramodules of cocycles, and if and only if it is coacyclic as a complex in the exact category of flat $\mathfrak R$-contramodules. These are contramodule generalizations of theorems of Neeman and of Bazzoni, Cortes-Izurdiaga, and Estrada.</description>

      <title>Polarizations on a triangulated category</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15621v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a recent collaboration, Hiroki Matsui and the author introduced a new proof of the reconstruction theorem of Bondal-Orlov and Ballard, using Matsui's construction of a ringed space associated to a triangulated category. This paper first shows that these ideas can be applied to reconstructions of more general varieties from their perfect derived categories. For further applications of these ideas, we introduce the framework of a polarized triangulated category, a pair $(\mathcal T,\tau)$ consisting of a triangulated category $\mathcal T$ and an autoequivalence $\tau$ (called a polarization), to which we can associate a ringed space called the pt-spectrum. As concrete applications, we observe that several reconstruction results of Favero naturally fit within this framework, leading to both generalizations and new proofs of these results. Furthermore, we explore broader implications of polarizations and pt-spectra in tensor triangular geometry, noncommutative projective geometry, birational geometry and homological mirror symmetry.</description>

      <title>Unstable $1$-semiadditivity as classifying Goodwillie towers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11245v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A stable $\infty$-category is $1$-semiadditive if all norms for finite group actions are equivalences. In the presence of $1$-semiadditivity, Goodwillie calculus simplifies drastically. We introduce two unstable analogs of $1$-semiadditivity for an $\infty$-category $C$ and study their relation to the Goodwillie calculus of functors $C \rightarrow \s(C)$. We demonstrate these qualities are complete obstructions to the problem of endowing $\partial_\ast F$ with either a right module or a divided power right module structure which completely classifies the Goodwillie tower of $F$. We find applications to algebraic localizations of spaces, the Morita theory of operads, and bar-cobar duality of algebras. Along the way, we address several milestones in these areas including: Lie structures in the Goodwillie calculus of spaces, spectral Lie algebra models of $v_h$-periodic homotopy theory, and the Poincar\'e/Koszul duality of $E_d$-algebras.</description>
