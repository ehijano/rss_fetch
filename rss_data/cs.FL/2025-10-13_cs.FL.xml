      <title>Psi-Turing Machines: Bounded Introspection for Complexity Barriers and Oracle Separations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Psi-Turing Machines (Psi-TM): classical Turing machines equipped with a constant-depth introspection interface $ \iota $ and an explicit per-step information budget $ B(d,n)=c\,d\log_2 n $. With the interface frozen, we develop an information-theoretic lower-bound toolkit: Budget counting, $ \Psi $-Fooling, and $ \Psi $-Fano, with worked examples $ L_k $ and $ L_k^{\mathrm{phase}} $. We prove an oracle-relative separation $ P^{\Psi} \neq NP^{\Psi} $ and a strict depth hierarchy, reinforced by an Anti-Simulation Hook that rules out polynomial emulation of $ \iota_k $ using many calls to $ \iota_{k-1} $ under the budget regime. We also present two independent platforms (Psi-decision trees and interface-constrained circuits IC-AC$^{0}$/IC-NC$^{1}$) and bridges that transfer bounds among machine, tree, and circuit with explicit poly/log losses. The model preserves classical computational power outside $ \iota $ yet enables precise oracle-aware statements about barriers (relativization; partial/conditional progress on natural proofs and proof complexity). The aim is a standardized minimal introspection interface with clearly accounted information budgets.</description>

      <title>MASA: LLM-Driven Multi-Agent Systems for Autoformalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autoformalization serves a crucial role in connecting natural language and formal reasoning. This paper presents MASA, a novel framework for building multi-agent systems for autoformalization driven by Large Language Models (LLMs). MASA leverages collaborative agents to convert natural language statements into their formal representations. The architecture of MASA is designed with a strong emphasis on modularity, flexibility, and extensibility, allowing seamless integration of new agents and tools to adapt to a fast-evolving field. We showcase the effectiveness of MASA through use cases on real-world mathematical definitions and experiments on formal mathematics datasets. This work highlights the potential of multi-agent systems powered by the interaction of LLMs and theorem provers in enhancing the efficiency and reliability of autoformalization, providing valuable insights and support for researchers and practitioners in the field.</description>

      <title>RegexPSPACE: A Benchmark for Evaluating LLM Reasoning on PSPACE-complete Regex Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show strong performance across natural language processing (NLP), mathematical reasoning, and programming, and recent large reasoning models (LRMs) further emphasize explicit reasoning. Yet their computational limits, particularly spatial complexity constrained by finite context windows, remain poorly understood. While recent works often focus on problems within the NP complexity class, we push the boundary by introducing a novel benchmark grounded in two PSPACE-complete regular expression (regex) problems: equivalence decision (RegexEQ) and minimization (RegexMin). PSPACE-complete problems serve as a more rigorous standard for assessing computational capacity, as their solutions require massive search space exploration. We perform a double-exponential space exploration to construct a labeled dataset of over a million regex instances with a sound filtering process to build the benchmark. We conduct extensive evaluations on 6 LLMs and 5 LRMs of varying scales, revealing common failure patterns such as verbosity and repetition. With its well-defined structure and quantitative evaluation metrics, this work presents the first empirical investigation into the spatial computational limitations of LLMs and LRMs, offering a new framework for evaluating their advanced reasoning capabilities.

      <title>Parameterized Verification of Timed Networks with Clock Invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05190v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider parameterized verification problems for networks of timed automata (TAs) based on different communication primitives. To this end, we first consider disjunctive timed networks (DTNs), i.e., networks of TAs that communicate via location guards that enable a transition only if there is another process in a certain location. We solve for the first time the case with unrestricted clock invariants, and establish that the parameterized model checking problem (PMCP) over finite local traces can be reduced to the corresponding model checking problem on a single TA. Moreover, we prove that the PMCP for networks that communicate via lossy broadcast can be reduced to the PMCP for DTNs. Finally, we show that for networks with k-wise synchronization, and therefore also for timed Petri nets, location reachability can be reduced to location reachability in DTNs. As a consequence we can answer positively the open problem from Abdulla et al.(2018) whether the universal safety problem for timed Petri nets with multiple clocks is decidable.</description>

      <title>Iterating Non-Aggregative Structure Compositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06019v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An aggregative composition is a binary operation obeying the
  principle that the whole is determined by the sum of its parts. The
  development of graph algebras, on which the theory of formal graph
  languages is built, relies on aggregative compositions that behave
  like disjoint union, except for a set of well-marked interface
  vertices from both sides, that are joined. The same style of
  composition has been considered in the context of relational
  structures, that generalize graphs and use constant symbols to label
  the interface.
  In this paper, we study a non-aggregative composition operation,
  called \emph{fusion}, that joins non-deterministically chosen
  elements from disjoint structures. The sets of structures obtained
  by iteratively applying fusion do not always have bounded
  tree-width, even when starting from a tree-width bounded set.
  First, we prove that the problem of the existence of a bound on the
  tree-width of the closure of a given set under fusion is decidable,
  when the input set is described inductively by a finite
  \emph{hyperedge-replacement} (HR) grammar, written using the
  operations of aggregative composition, forgetting and renaming of
  constants. Such sets are usually called \emph{context-free}.
  Second, assuming that the closure under fusion of a context-free set
  has bounded tree-width, we show that it is the language of an
  effectively constructible HR grammar. A possible application of the
  latter result is the possiblity of checking whether all structures
  from a non-aggregatively closed set having bounded tree-width
  satisfy a given monadic second order logic formula.</description>

      <title>A Constructive Framework for Nondeterministic Automata via Time-Shared, Depth-Unrolled Feedforward Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24110v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a formal and constructive simulation framework for nondeterministic finite automata (NFAs) using time-shared, depth-unrolled feedforward networks (TS-FFNs), i.e., acyclic unrolled computations with shared parameters that are functionally equivalent to unrolled recurrent or state-space models. Unlike prior approaches that rely on explicit recurrent architectures or post hoc extraction methods, our formulation symbolically encodes automaton states as binary vectors, transitions as sparse matrix transformations, and nondeterministic branching-including $\varepsilon$-closures-as compositions of shared thresholded updates. We prove that every regular language can be recognized exactly by such a shared-parameter unrolled feedforward network, with parameter count independent of input length. Our construction yields a constructive equivalence between NFAs and neural networks and demonstrates \emph{empirical learnability}: these networks can be trained via gradient descent on supervised acceptance data to recover the target automaton behavior. This learnability, formalized in Proposition 5.1, is the crux of this work. Extensive experiments validate the theoretical results, achieving perfect or near-perfect agreement on acceptance, state propagation, and closure dynamics. This work clarifies the correspondence between automata theory and modern neural architectures, showing that unrolled feedforward networks can perform precise, interpretable, and trainable symbolic computation.</description>

      <title>Low complexity binary words avoiding $(5/2)^+$-powers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19050v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rote words are infinite words that contain $2n$ factors of length $n$ for every $n \geq 1$. Shallit and Shur, as well as Ollinger and Shallit, showed that there are Rote words that avoid $(5/2)^+$-powers and that this is best possible. In this note we give a structure theorem for the Rote words that avoid $(5/2)^+$-powers, confirming a conjecture of Ollinger and Shallit.</description>
