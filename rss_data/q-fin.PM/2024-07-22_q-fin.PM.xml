      <title>Construction and Hedging of Equity Index Options Portfolios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research presents a comprehensive evaluation of systematic index option-writing strategies, focusing on S&amp;P500 index options. We compare the performance of hedging strategies using the Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) model and the Variance-Gamma (VG) model, emphasizing varying moneyness levels and different sizing methods based on delta and the VIX Index. The study employs 1-minute data of S&amp;P500 index options and index quotes spanning from 2018 to 2023. The analysis benchmarks hedged strategies against buy-and-hold and naked option-writing strategies, with a focus on risk-adjusted performance metrics including transaction costs. Portfolio delta approximations are derived using implied volatility for the BSM model and market-calibrated parameters for the VG model. Key findings reveal that systematic option-writing strategies can potentially yield superior returns compared to buy-and-hold benchmarks. The BSM model generally provided better hedging outcomes than the VG model, although the VG model showed profitability in certain naked strategies as a tool for position sizing. In terms of rehedging frequency, we found that intraday hedging in 130-minute intervals provided both reliable protection against adverse market movements and a satisfactory returns profile.</description>

      <title>Explainable Post hoc Portfolio Management Financial Policy of a Deep Reinforcement Learning agent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Financial portfolio management investment policies computed quantitatively by modern portfolio theory techniques like the Markowitz model rely on a set on assumptions that are not supported by data in high volatility markets. Hence, quantitative researchers are looking for alternative models to tackle this problem. Concretely, portfolio management is a problem that has been successfully addressed recently by Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) approaches. In particular, DRL algorithms train an agent by estimating the distribution of the expected reward of every action performed by an agent given any financial state in a simulator. However, these methods rely on Deep Neural Networks model to represent such a distribution, that although they are universal approximator models, they cannot explain its behaviour, given by a set of parameters that are not interpretable. Critically, financial investors policies require predictions to be interpretable, so DRL agents are not suited to follow a particular policy or explain their actions. In this work, we developed a novel Explainable Deep Reinforcement Learning (XDRL) approach for portfolio management, integrating the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with the model agnostic explainable techniques of feature importance, SHAP and LIME to enhance transparency in prediction time. By executing our methodology, we can interpret in prediction time the actions of the agent to assess whether they follow the requisites of an investment policy or to assess the risk of following the agent suggestions. To the best of our knowledge, our proposed approach is the first explainable post hoc portfolio management financial policy of a DRL agent. We empirically illustrate our methodology by successfully identifying key features influencing investment decisions, which demonstrate the ability to explain the agent actions in prediction time.</description>
