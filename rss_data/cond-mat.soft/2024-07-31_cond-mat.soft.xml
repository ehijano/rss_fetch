      <title>Fragmentation and aggregation of cyanobacterial colonies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluid flow has a major effect on the aggregation and fragmentation of bacterial colonies. Yet, a generic framework to understand and predict how hydrodynamics affects colony size remains elusive. This study investigates how fluid flow affects the formation and maintenance of large colonial structures in cyanobacteria. We performed experiments on laboratory cultures and lake samples of the cyanobacterium Microcystis, while their colony size distribution was measured simultaneously by direct microscopic imaging. We demonstrate that EPS-embedded cells formed by cell division exhibit significant mechanical resistance to shear forces. However, at elevated hydrodynamic stress levels (exceeding those typically generated by surface wind mixing) these colonies experience fragmentation through an erosion process. We also show that single cells can aggregate into small colonies due to fluid flow. However, the structural integrity of these flow-induced colonies is weaker than that of colonies formed by cell division. We provide a mathematical analysis to support the experiments and demonstrate that a population model with two categories of colonies describes the measured size distributions. Our results shed light on the specific conditions wherein flow-induced fragmentation and aggregation of cyanobacteria are decisive and indicate that colony formation under natural conditions is mainly driven by cell division, although flow-induced aggregation could play a role in dense bloom events. These findings can be used to improve prediction models and mitigation strategies for toxic cyanobacterial blooms and also offer potential applications in other areas such as algal biotechnology or medical settings where the dynamics of biological aggregates play a significant role.</description>

      <title>Emergent phases in bent-core patchy colloids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the two-dimensional behavior of colloidal patchy ellipsoids specifically designed to follow a two-step assembly process from the monomer state to mesoscopic liquid-crystal phases, via the formation of so-called bent-core units at the intermediate stage. Our model comprises a binary mixture of ellipses interacting via the Gay-Berne potential and decorated by surface patches, with the binary components being mirror-image variants of each other - referred to as left-handed and right-handed ellipses according to the position of their patches. The surface patches are designed so as in the first stage of the assembly the monomers form bent-cores units, i.e. V-shaped dimers with a specific bent angle. The Gay-Berne interactions, which act between the ellipses, drive the dimers to subsequently form the characteristic phase observed in bent-core liquid crystals. We numerically investigate -- by means of both Molecular Dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations -- the described two-step process: we first optimize a target bent-core unit and we then fully characterize its state diagram in temperature and density, defining the regions where the different liquid crystalline phases dominate.</description>

      <title>Critical surface adsorption of confined binary liquids with locally conserved mass and composition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Close to a solid surface, the properties of a fluid deviate significantly from their bulk values. In this context, we study the surface adsorption profiles of a symmetric binary liquid confined to a slit pore by means of molecular dynamics simulations; the latter naturally entails that mass and concentration are locally conserved. Near a bulk consolute point, where the liquid exhibits a demixing transition with the local concentration as the order parameter, we determine the order parameter profiles and characterise the relevant critical scaling behaviour, in the regime of strong surface attraction, for a range of pore widths and temperatures. The obtained order parameter profiles decay monotonically near the surfaces, also in the presence of a pronounced layering in the number density. Overall, our results agree qualitatively with recent theoretical predictions from a mesoscopic field-theoretical approach for the canonical ensemble.</description>

      <title>Flow regimes and repose angle in a rotating drum filled with highly concave particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a series of experiments investigating the flow regimes and repose angles of highly concave particle packings in a rotating drum. By varying grain geometry from spherical to highly non-convex shapes, adjusting frictional properties and the particle number of branches, we examine how these parameters and the drum speed influence the flow behavior. Our study identifies two distinct flow regimes: the rolling regime, where granular matter exhibits solid-like behavior near the walls and flows like a liquid near the free surface, and the slumping regime, characterized by cyclic avalanches and solid body rotations. Using quantitative criteria such as the repose angle difference and the area ratio of particle packings, we construct phase diagrams delineating the cross-over between these regimes. Our findings highlight the significant effects of particle concavity, friction, and rotation speed on the flow dynamics of granular materials, providing new insights into the mechanical behaviors of \emph{meta-granular matter}.</description>

      <title>Effect of particle shape on the flow of an hourglass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The flow rate of a granulate out of a cylindrical container is studied as a function of particle shape for flat and elongated ellipsoids experimentally and numerically. We find a nonmonotonic dependence of the flow rate on the grain aspect ratio a/b. Starting from spheres the flow rate grows and has two maxima around the aspect ratios of a/b = 0.6 (lentil-like ellipsoids) and a/b = 1.5 (rice-like ellipsoids) reaching a flow rate increase of about 15% for lentils compared to spheres. For even more anisometric shapes (a/b = 0.25 and a/b = 4) the flow rate drops. Our results reveal two contributing factors to the nonmonotonic nature of the flow rate: both the packing fraction and the particle velocity through the orifice are nonmonotonic functions of the grain shape. Thus, particles with slightly non-spherical shapes not only form a better packing in the silo but also move faster through the orifice than spheres. We also show that the resistance of the granulate against shearing increases with aspect ratio for both elongated and flat particles, thus change in the effective friction of the granulate due to changing particle shape does not coincide with the trend in the flow rate.</description>

      <title>Microscopic model for aging of biocondensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biomolecular condensates are membraneless compartments in the cell that are involved in a wide diversity of biological processes. These phase-separated droplets usually exhibit a viscoelastic mechanical response. A behavior rationalized by modeling the complex molecules that make up a condensate as stickers and spacers, which assemble into a network-like structure. The proper functioning of biocondensates requires precise control over their composition, size, and mechanical response. For example, several neurodegenerative diseases are associated with dysfunctional condensates that solidify over a long period of time (days) until they become solid. A phenomenon usually described as aging. The emergence of such a long timescale of evolution from microscopic events, as well as the associated microscopic reorganization leading to aging, remains mostly an open question. In this article, we explore the connection between the mechanical properties of the condensates and their microscopic structure. We propose a minimal model for the dynamic of stickers and spacers, and show that entropy minimization of spacers leads to an attractive force between stickers. Our system displays a surprisingly slow relaxation toward equilibrium, reminiscent of glassy systems and consistent with the liquid-to-solid transition observed. To explain this behavior, we study the clustering dynamic of stickers and successfully explain the origin of glassy relaxation.</description>

      <title>Molecular Simulations of Quantized Lamellar Thickening in Polyethylenes with Regularly Spaced Brominated Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polyethylene (PE) chains, with CH2 groups replaced by CBr2 at regular intervals ("precision PE"), have been observed to exhibit competing polymorphs driven by a preference for quantized fold lengths by Tasaki et al. Motivated by this recent discovery, the crystallisation behaviour of such precision PE chains, 400 carbons long with CBr2 groups placed regularly at every 21st carbon, is investigated using molecular dynamics simulations. The united-monomer model of PE is extended to include dibromo groups, with steric clashes at the bromines reflected in a triple-well bending potential, demonstrating its function as a preferred fold site. Different crystallisation protocols, continuous-cooling and self-seeding, reveal remarkably different crystals. Using self-seeding, the crystalline lamellar thickness increases monotonically with temperature, in quantized multiples of the distance between dibromo units. Polymer chains are observed to fold preferentially at the dibromo groups and such groups appear to be tolerated within the crystal lamellae. On quenching the bromos assemble to form registered layers, not unlike Smectic phases observed in liquid crystals, which confirms the experimental observation of competing Form I and Form I' polymorphs.</description>

      <title>In-plane dielectric constant and conductivity of confined water</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Water is essential for almost every aspect of life on our planet and, unsurprisingly, its properties have been studied in great detail. However, disproportionately little remains known about the electrical properties of interfacial and strongly confined water where its structure deviates from that of bulk water, becoming distinctly layered. The structural change is expected to affect water's conductivity and particularly its polarizability, which in turn modifies intermolecular forces that play a crucial role in many physical and chemical processes. Here we use scanning dielectric microscopy to probe the in-plane electrical properties of water confined between atomically flat surfaces separated by distances down to 1 nm. For confinement exceeding a few nm, water exhibits an in-plane dielectric constant close to that of bulk water and its proton conductivity is notably enhanced, gradually increasing with decreasing water thickness. This trend abruptly changes when the confined water becomes only a few molecules thick. Its in-plane dielectric constant reaches giant, ferroelectric-like values of about 1,000 whereas the conductivity peaks at a few S/m, close to values characteristic of superionic liquids. We attribute the enhancement to strongly disordered hydrogen bonding induced by the few-layer confinement, which facilitates both easier in-plane polarization of molecular dipoles and faster proton exchange. This insight into the electrical properties of nanoconfined water is important for understanding many phenomena that occur at aqueous interfaces and in nanoscale pores.</description>

      <title>Unsteady slip pulses under spatially-varying prestres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It was recently established that self-healing slip pulses under uniform prestress $\tau_b$ are unstable frictional rupture modes, i.e., they either slowly expand/decay with time t. Furthermore, their dynamics were shown to follow a reduced-dimensionality description corresponding to a special $L(c)$ line in a plane defined by the pulse propagation velocity $c(t)$ and size $L(t)$. Yet, uniform prestress is rather the exception than the rule in natural faults. We study the effects of a spatially-varying prestress $\tau_b(x)$ on 2D slip pulses, initially generated under a uniform $\tau_b$ along a rate-and-state friction fault. We consider periodic and constant-gradient prestress $\tau_b(x)$ around the reference uniform $\tau_b$. For a periodic $\tau_b(x)$, pulses either sustain and form quasi-limit cycles in the $L-c$ plane or decay predominantly monotonically along the $L(c)$ line, depending on the instability index of the initial pulse and the properties of the periodic $\tau_b(x)$. For a constant-gradient $\tau_b(x)$, expanding/decaying pulses closely follow the $L(c)$ line, with systematic shifts determined by the sign and magnitude of the gradient. We also find that a spatially-varying $\tau_b(x)$ can revert the expanding/decaying nature of the initial reference pulse. Finally, we show that a constant-gradient $\tau_b(x)$, of sufficient magnitude and specific sign, can lead to the nucleation of a back-propagating rupture at the healing tail of the initial pulse, generating a bilateral crack-like rupture. This pulse-to-crack transition, along with the above-described effects, demonstrate that rich rupture dynamics merge from a simple, nonuniform prestress. Furthermore, we show that as long as pulses exist, their dynamics are related to the special $L(c)$ line, providing an effective, reduced-dimensionality description of unsteady slip pulses under spatially-varying prestress.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.06915v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A critical end point above which an isotropic phase continuously evolves into a polar (ferroelectric) nematic phase with an increasing electric field is found in a ferroelectric nematic liquid crystalline material. The critical end point is approximately 30 K above the zero-field transition temperature from the isotropic to nematic phase and at an electric field of the order of 10 V/micron. Such systems are interesting from the application point of view because a strong birefringence can be induced in a broad temperature range in an optically isotropic phase.</description>

      <title>Active Sparse Bayesian Committee Machine Potential for Isothermal-Isobaric Molecular Dynamics Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06256v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in machine learning potentials (MLPs) have significantly impacted the fields of chemistry, physics, and biology by enabling large-scale first-principles simulations. Among different machine learning approaches, kernel-based MLPs distinguish themselves through their ability to handle small datasets, quantify uncertainties, and minimize over-fitting. Nevertheless, their extensive computational requirements present considerable challenges. To alleviate these, sparsification methods have been developed, aiming to reduce computational scaling without compromising accuracy. In the context of isothermal and isobaric ML molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, achieving precise pressure estimation is crucial for reproducing reliable system behavior under constant pressure. Despite progress, sparse kernel MLPs struggle with precise pressure prediction. Here, we introduce a virial kernel function that significantly enhances pressure estimation accuracy of MLPs. Additionally, we propose the active sparse Bayesian committee machine (BCM) potential, an on-the-fly MLP architecture that aggregates local sparse Gaussian process regression (SGPR) MLPs. The sparse BCM potential overcomes the steep computational scaling with the kernel size, and a predefined restriction on the size of kernel allows for a fast and efficient on-the-fly training. Our advancements facilitate accurate and computationally efficient machine learning-enhanced MD (MLMD) simulations across diverse systems, including ice-liquid coexisting phases, \ce{Li10Ge(PS6)2} lithium solid electrolyte, and high-pressure liquid boron nitride.</description>

      <title>Non-reciprocal alignment induces asymmetric clustering in active mixtures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19291v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Heterogeneity is ubiquitous in biological and synthetic active matter systems that are inherently out of equilibrium. Typically, such active mixtures involve not only conservative interactions between the constituents, but also non-reciprocal couplings, whose full consequences for the collective behavior still remain elusive. Here, we study a minimal active non-reciprocal mixture with both, symmetric isotropic and non-reciprocal polar interactions. By combining a hydrodynamic theory derived from microscopic equations and particle-based simulations, we provide a scale-bridging view on the rich dynamics that occur even in absence of oscillatory instabilities. We show, in particular, that non-reciprocal alignment alone induces asymmetrical clustering at otherwise fully symmetric parameters. These density inhomogeneities go beyond the typical band formation in Vicsek-like systems. Within the asymmetric clustering state, single-species clusters chase more dilute accumulations of the other species.</description>

      <title>Dynamical structures in phase-separating non-reciprocal polar active mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06305v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-reciprocal systems exhibit diverse dynamical phases whose character depends on the type and degree of non-reciprocity. In this study, we theoretically investigate dynamical structures in a mixture of non-reciprocally aligning polar active particles with repulsion, focusing on the performance on (and connection between) different levels of description. Linear stability analyses of the associated continuum model predict a profound influence of non-reciprocity, leading to phase separation, (anti-)flocking and asymmetric clustering behavior. On the microscopic level, particle simulations confirm the emergence of these dynamical phases and allow for a more in-depth investigation of (microscopic) properties, including orientational correlations and susceptibilities. The drastic impact of orientational couplings alone on the density dynamics is demonstrated in particle simulations without repulsion, where non-reciprocal alignment leads to the asymmetric formation of single-species polarized clumps. Overall, our findings demonstrate that certain dynamical properties, like a chase-and-run behavior in the asymmetrical clustering phase, are overlooked in mean-field continuum theory, making microscopic simulations an indispensable tool for studying the effects of non-reciprocal alignment couplings.</description>
