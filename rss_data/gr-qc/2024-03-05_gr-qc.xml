      <title>Generalized Ghost Dark Energy in f(Q) Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we use the correspondence principle to construct the generalized ghost dark energy $f(Q)$ model, where $Q$ is the non-metricity. For this purpose, we use the Friedman-Robertson-Walker universe model with power-law scale factor. The energy density in this model linearly depends on the Hubble parameter, with a sub-leading term of $H^{2}$, resulting in an energy density $\rho_D=\xi H+\zeta H^{2}$, where $\xi$ and $\zeta$ are arbitrary constants. We reconstruct interacting fluid scenario of this dark energy with dark matter. The reformulated $f(Q)$ gravity model shows how different epochs of the cosmic history can be reproduced by this modified gravity model. The physical characteristics of the model are discussed through the equation of state parameter with the planes of $\omega_{D}-\omega'_{D}$ and $r-s$. We also explore the stability criteria for the interacting model using the squared speed of sound. The equation of state parameter indicates phantom phase of the universe and the squared speed of sound represents stability of the interacting model. The $(\omega_{D}-\omega^{\prime}_{D})$-plane indicates freezing region, while the $(r-s)$-plane corresponds to the Chaplygin gas. We conclude that our findings coincide with the latest observational data.</description>

      <title>Interacting Field Cosmological Model in Lyra Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper explores a plane symmetric cosmological model within the framework of the Lyra manifold, incorporating interactions among various fields. These fields include a charged perfect fluid, a mass-less scalar field, and an electromagnetic field. The study focuses on deriving relativistic field equations and exact solutions for this complex system. The relationships between the scalar field (\b{eta}) and the average scale factor (a(t)), as well as between the metric potentials, are assumed to solve the nonlinear field equations. Two specific expansion models are examined: 1) Exponential expansion and 2) Power law expansion. The research delves into the dynamic parameters behavior, observing changes in pressure, density, and cosmological parameters across different models. The findings indicate that while the Universe is expanding, the rate of expansion can vary among the different models. The investigation also involves kinematic parameters, such as jerk and snap parameters derived from the scale factor variation, and compares them to the {\Lambda}CDM model.</description>

      <title>Energy Conditions in f(R, T) Gravity with an Anisotropic Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In our study, we explored the properties of a spatially homogeneous and anisotropic Bianchi type V I0 Universe. Our investigation centered on integrating cosmic domain walls into the f(R, T) theory of gravitation, initially proposed by Harko et al. in 2011. To tackle the field equations, we employed the relationship between the expansion scalar ({\theta}) and the shear scalar ({\sigma}). Our analysis encompassed both the dynamic and cosmological aspects of the Universe. By comparing our findings to the {\Lambda}CDM model, specifically focusing on the evolution of the jerk parameter, we found a striking agreement between the two models. A noteworthy discovery was the verification of accelerated expansion in our described model, consistent with the prevailing observational data. Finally, we examine the energy condition criteria and determine that the violation of the Strong Energy Condition (SEC), while the Null Energy Condition (NEC), Weak Energy Condition (WEC) and Dominant Energy Condition (DEC) continue to meet the requirements for positivity.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Signalling: Connections between Causal Inference and Space-time Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Causality is pivotal to our understanding of the world, presenting itself in different forms: information-theoretic and relativistic, the former linked to the flow of information, the latter to the structure of space-time. Leveraging a framework introduced in PRA, 106, 032204 (2022), which formally connects these two notions in general physical theories, we study their interplay. Here, information-theoretic causality is defined through a causal modelling approach. First, we improve the characterization of information-theoretic signalling as defined through so-called affects relations. Specifically, we provide conditions for identifying redundancies in different parts of such a relation, introducing techniques for causal inference in unfaithful causal models (where the observable data does not "faithfully" reflect the causal dependences). In particular, this demonstrates the possibility of causal inference using the absence of signalling between certain nodes. Second, we define an order-theoretic property called conicality, showing that it is satisfied for light cones in Minkowski space-times with $d&gt;1$ spatial dimensions but violated for $d=1$. Finally, we study the embedding of information-theoretic causal models in space-time without violating relativistic principles such as no superluminal signalling (NSS). In general, we observe that constraints imposed by NSS in a space-time and those imposed by purely information-theoretic causal inference behave differently. We then prove a correspondence between conical space-times and faithful causal models: in both cases, there emerges a parallel between these two types of constraints. This indicates a connection between informational and geometric notions of causality, and offers new insights for studying the relations between the principles of NSS and no causal loops in different space-time geometries and theories of information processing.</description>

      <title>Particle motion around luminous neutron stars: effects of deviation from Schwarzschild spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study trajectories of test particles around a luminous, static, spherically symmetric neutron star, under the combined influence of gravity and radiation. In general relativity, for Schwarzschild spacetime, an equilibrium sphere (the Eddington Capture Sphere) is formed for near-Eddington luminosities. We generalize these results to a broad class of static, spherical spacetimes. We also study the dynamics of particles in a strong radiation field in spherical spacetimes. The results are illustrated for two cases, Reissner-Nordstr\"om spacetime of a charged spherical object in general relativity and Kehagias-Sfetsos spacetime, arising from the Horava-Lifshitz gravity theory. Our findings apply to neutron stars under gravitational field equations different from the vacuum Einstein field equations of general relativity, such as in modified theories of gravity, the only requirement being that test particles follow geodesics in the absence of the radiation field. We show that it is possible, in principle, to test the gravity theory by investigating such test particle equilibria and trajectories with observations of neutron stars' X-ray bursts.</description>

      <title>Motion of Rotating Black Holes in Homogeneous Scalar Fields: A General Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the motion of a rotating black hole through a static, homogeneous, massless scalar field. In the general case, a constant vector of the field gradient can be timelike, spacelike or null. We consider and compare all of these cases. We demonstrate that as a result of the interaction of the black hole with the scalar field, its mass, spin and relative velocity with respect to the field can change. We obtain the equations describing the evolution of these parameters and present solutions of the obtained equations for some simple cases.</description>

      <title>Study of charged gravastar model in $f(\mathcal{Q})$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent days gravastar has been a very lucrative alternative to black holes, as it does not suffer from the singularity problem as well and it is based on sound physical grounds. Modified Symmetric teleparallel equivalent of gravity also has seen quite a few successes in recent years both in cosmology as well as in astrophysical objects like black holes and wormholes. In this paper, we have considered the charged gravastar in $f(\mathcal{Q})$ formulation and have solved it fully analytically and found various physical characteristics like energy density, entropy and EoS for the gravastar. We have used the Israel junction condition to make some phenomenological predictions regarding the potential of the thin shell around the gravastar. We have also studied the deflection of the angle caused by the gravastar. Finally, we conclude by noting how future radio telescopes could detect the gravastar shadow and how can one distinguish it from the black hole event horizon.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this thesis, we scrutinize the literature to trace the evolution of the concepts surrounding the weak cosmic censorship conjecture and the attempts to prove or disprove it. We discuss its development over the years, its conceptual transformations, and the various thought experiments constructed to validate or invalidate the weak cosmic censorship conjecture. We also discuss possible connections with blackhole thermodynamics, and end with an evaluation of the current status about the subject, and finally, speculations about the future.</description>

      <title>Relativistic and nonrelativistic Landau levels for Dirac fermions in the cosmic string spacetime in the context of rainbow gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the relativistic and nonrelativistic Landau levels for Dirac fermions in the cosmic string spacetime in the context of rainbow gravity in $(3+1)$-dimensions, where we work with the curved Dirac equation with minimal coupling in cylindrical coordinates. Using the tetrads formalism of General Relativity, we obtain a second-order differential equation. Solving this differential equation, we obtain a generalized Laguerre equation as well as the relativistic Landau levels for the fermion and antifermion, where such energy levels are quantized in terms of the quantum numbers $n$, $m_j$ and $m_s$, and explicitly depends on the rainbow functions $f(\varepsilon)$ and $g(\varepsilon)$, charge parameter $\sigma$, cyclotron frequency $\omega_c$, curvature parameter $\alpha$, and on the square rest energy $m^2_0$ and square $z$-momentum $k^2_z$, respectively. Posteriorly, we study the nonrelativistic limit of the system, where we obtain the nonrelativistic Landau levels. In both cases (relativistic and nonrelativistic), we graphically analyze the behavior of Landau levels for the three rainbow gravity scenarios as a function of the magnetic field $B$ and of the curvature parameter $\alpha$. In addition, we also compared our problem with other works, where we verified that our results generalize several particular cases in the literature.</description>

      <title>Phase space analysis of sign-shifting interacting dark energy models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theory of non-gravitational interaction between a pressure-less dark matter (DM) and dark energy (DE) is a phenomenologically rich cosmological domain which has received magnificent attention in the community. In the present article we have considered some interacting scenarios with some novel features: the interaction functions do not depend on the external parameters of the universe, rather, they depend on the intrinsic nature of the dark components; the assumption of unidirectional flow of energy between DM and DE has been extended by allowing the possibility of bidirectional energy flow characterized by some sign shifting interaction functions; and the DE equation of state has been considered to be either constant or dynamical in nature. These altogether add new ingredients in this context, and, we performed the phase space analysis of each interacting scenario in order to understand their global behaviour. According to the existing records in the literature, this combined picture has not been reported elsewhere. From the analyses, we observed that the DE equation of state as well as the coupling parameter(s) of the interaction models can significantly affect the nature of the critical points. It has been found that within these proposed sign shifting interacting scenarios, it is possible to obtain stable late time attractors which may act as global attractors corresponding to an accelerating expansion of the universe. The overall outcomes of this study clearly highlight that the sign shifting interaction functions are quite appealing in the context of cosmological dynamics and they deserve further attention.</description>

      <title>Dynamical stability of new wormhole solutions via cold dark matter and solitonic quantum wave halos in $f(\mathcal{R},\mathcal{L}_m)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This current analysis offers novel wormhole solutions in the background of newly developed extended $f(\mathcal{R},\mathcal{L}_m)$ gravity. We use an anisotropic matter source and a particular type of energy density demonstrating cold dark matter halo and quantum wave dark matter halo to calculate two different wormhole solutions. The properties of the exotic matter within the wormhole geometry and the matter contents via energy conditions are studied in detail, both analytically and graphically, by showing valid and invalid regions. The calculated shape functions of wormhole geometry satisfy the required conditions in both cases. Further, we investigate the stability of the shell around wormhole structures by considering black hole solutions in the framework of cold dark matter halo and quantum wave dark matter by assuming matter contents located at the shell follow the phantom-like equations of state. Then, for quintessence and phantom energy type equations of state, the choice of cold dark matter halo has maximum stability at lower equilibrium shell radii and declines as the radius rises. More petite wormhole throats have an unstable configuration for the dark energy matter content, while higher wormhole throat radius has the lowest stability. For the choice of quantum wave dark matter, the shell around the wormhole structure is unstable for both quintessence and phantom energy, while dark energy shows a stable configuration for smaller values of wormhole throat.</description>

      <title>Constraining study of charged gravastars solutions in symmetric teleparallel gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the effect of charge on a special astronomical object known as a gravastar, which is viewed as an alternative to a black hole. Based on the conjecture put out by Mazur and Mottola in general relativity, the study primarily focuses on the consequences of $f(Q)$ gravity. The internal domain, the intermediate shell, and the external domain are the three separate sections that make up a gravastar. Using a particular $f(Q)$ gravity model that includes conformal Killing vectors to analyze these areas, we discover that the inner domain shows a repulsive force on the spherical shell since it is assumed that pressure is equivalent to negative energy density. The intermediate shell is made up of ultrarelativistic plasma and pressure, which is proportional to energy density and balances the repulsive force from the interior domain. For exterior region, we use two appraoches as first we calculate the vacuum exact solution and secondly considered as the Reissner-Nordstr\"om metric. Then, we match these spacetimes through junction condition and explore the stability constraints for both cases. Our results show that charged gravastar solutions with non-singular physical parameters including length, energy, entropy, and equation of state parameter are physically realistic.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, I studied the thermodynamical properties of the Einstein-Maxwell system with a box boundary in 4-dimensions [1](arXiv:2402.16113). In this paper, I investigate those in 3-dimensions. Similar to the 4-dimensional case, the system is thermodynamically well-behaved when $\Lambda&lt;0$ (due to the contribution of the ``bag of gold'' saddles). However, when $\Lambda=0$, a crucial difference to the 4-dimensional case appears, i.e. the 3-dimensional system turns out to be thermodynamically unstable, while the 4-dimensional one is thermodynamically stable.</description>

      <title>Time delay interferometry with minimal null frequencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time delay interferometry (TDI) is a key technique employed in gravitational wave (GW) space missions to mitigate laser frequency noise by combining multiple laser links and establishing an equivalent equal arm interferometry. The null frequencies will be introduced in noise spectra and GW response when the periodical signal/noise is canceled in synthesized laser links. These frequencies are characteristic frequencies (CFs) of a TDI which related to its geometry of combination. In this work, we propose a second-generation TDI configuration referred to as hybrid Relay, whose CFs are only one-quarter that of the fiducial second-generation Michelson observables. We examine the performance of novel TDI configuration in laser noise cancellation and clock noise suppression and justify its essential capabilities. To assess its robustness for signal extraction, we simulate data containing GW signals from massive black hole binaries and perform parameter inferences with comparisons against the fiducial Michelson TDI configuration. The results demonstrate that the newly proposed TDI solution could be more robust than Michelson in fulfilling data analysis.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of the arbitrary dimensional FRW universe: Joule-Thomson expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the thermodynamics especially the Joule-Thomson expansion of the $n$-dimensional FRW (Friedmann-Robertson-Walker) universe with a perfect fluid. We derive the thermodynamic equations of state $P=P(V, T)$ for the $n$-dimensional FRW universe in Einstein gravity and Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity, where the thermodynamic pressure $P$ defined by the work density $W$ of the perfect fluid, $i.e.$ $P\equiv W$. Furthermore, we present the Joule-Thomson expansion as an application of these equations of state to elucidate the cooling-heating properties of the $n$-dimensional FRW universe. We determine the inversion temperature and inversion pressure in the FRW universe with arbitrary dimensions for the first time, and illustrate the characteristics of inversion curves and isenthalpic curves in the $T$-$P$ plane. This study offers insights into deepening our comprehension of cooling and heating regions in the FRW universe, thereby revealing its expansion mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Prediction of the Expansion of the Universe made by Alexander Friedmann and the Effect of Particle Creation in Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This review devoted to the centenary of Alexander Friedmann's prediction of the Universe expansion presents the results obtained by him in 1922 and 1924 and the sketch of their further developments. Special attention is paid to the role of mathematics which enabled Friedmann to perform a radical departure from the conventional practice of considering our Universe as a static system. The effect of particle creation in expanding Universe is discussed concurrently with the earlier investigated phenomenon of pair creation from vacuum by external electric field. The numbers of scalar and spinor particles created at different stages of the Universe evolution are presented, and the possible role of the effect of creation of particles in the formation of relativistic plasma and cold dark matter after the inflationary period is noted. It is stressed that by introducing the concept of expanding Universe Friedmann made a contribution to understanding of the world around us compatible to those made by Ptolemy, Copernicus, and Newton in previous epochs.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of binary black hole harmonics in LIGO using deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational wave signals from coalescing compact binaries in the LIGO and Virgo interferometers are primarily detected by the template based matched filtering method. While this method is optimal for stationary and Gaussian data scenarios, its sensitivity is often affected by non stationary noise transients in the detectors. Moreover, most of the current searches do not account for the effects of precession of black hole spins and higher order waveform harmonics, focusing solely on the leading order quadrupolar modes. This limitation impacts our search for interesting astrophysical sources, such as intermediate mass black hole binaries and hierarchical mergers. Here we show for the first time that deep learning can be used for accurate waveform reconstruction of precessing binary black hole signals with higher order modes. This approach can also be adapted into a rapid trigger generation algorithm to enhance online searches. Our model, tested on simulated injections in real LIGO noise from the third observing run achieved high-degree of overlap with injected signals. This accuracy was consistent across a wide range of black hole masses and spin configurations chosen for this study. When applied to real gravitational wave events, our reconstructions achieved between 0.85 and 0.98 overlaps with those obtained by Coherent WaveBurst (unmodeled) and LALInference (modeled) analyses. These results suggest that deep learning is a potent tool for analyzing signals from a diverse catalog of compact binaries.</description>

      <title>SATDI: Simulation and Analysis for Time-Delay Interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-delay interferometry (TDI) is essential for space-based gravitational wave (GW) missions to effectively suppress laser frequency noise and achieve targeting sensitivity. The principle of the TDI is to synthesize multiple laser link measurements between spacecraft and create virtual equal-arm interferometry. This process blends instrumental noises and tunes the response function to GW, yielding data characterized by TDI combinations. Extracting signals requires modeling GW signals under TDI operations in the frequency domain. In this work, we introduce a versatile framework, SATDI, which integrates simulation and analysis for TDI. The simulation aims to implement TDI to instrumental noises and GW signals, investigate influential factors in noise suppressions, and explore GW characterizations across different TDI configurations. The analysis component focuses on developing robust algorithms for modeling TDI responses to extract GWs and accurately determine source parameters. LISA is selected as the representative space mission to demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. We simulate and analyze data containing GW signals from massive black hole binary coalescence, examining data from both first-generation and second-generation TDI Michelson configurations. The results not only validate the framework but also illustrate the influence of different factors on parameter estimation.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Physical Properties of Traversable Wormholes in the Modified $f(R,T)$ Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the paper, we analyze some physical properties of static traversable WH within the framework of $f(R,T)$ modified gravitational theory. Firstly, we explore the validity of the null, weak, dominant and strong energy conditions for wormhole matter for the considered $f(R,T)=R+\alpha R^2+\lambda T$ model. Research shows that it is possible to obtain traversable WH geometry without bring in exotic matter that violates the null energy condition in the $f(R,T)$ theory. The violation of the dominant energy condition in this model may be related to quantum fluctuations or indicates the existence of special matter that violates this EC within the wormhole. Moreover, it is found that in the $f(R,T)=R+\alpha R^2+\lambda T$ model, relative to the GR, the introduction of the geometric term $\alpha R^2$ has no remarkable impact on the wormhole matter components and their properties, while the appearance of the matter-geometry coupling term $\lambda T$ can resolve the question that WH matter violates the null, weak and strong energy condition in GR. Additionally, we investigate dependency of the valid NEC on model parameters and quantify the matter components within the wormhole using the ``volume integral quantifier". Lastly, based on the modified Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkov equation, we find that the traversable WH in this theory is stable. On the other hand, we use the classical reconstruction technique to derive wormhole solution in $f(R,T)$ theory and discuss the corresponding ECs of matter. It is found that all four ECs (NEC, WEC, SEC and DEC) of matter in the traversable wormholes are valid in this reconstructed $f(R,T)$ model, i.e we provide a wormhole solution without introducing the exotic matter and special matter in $f(R,T)$ theory.</description>

      <title>Improving the detection sensitivity to primordial stochastic gravitational waves with reduced astrophysical foregrounds -- II: subthreshold binary neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic gravitational waves (GWs) consist of a primordial component from early Universe processes and an astrophysical component from compact binary mergers. To detect the primordial stochastic GW background (SGWB), the astrophysical foregrounds must be reduced to high precision, which is achievable for third-generation (3G) ground based GW detectors. Previous studies have shown that the foreground from individually detectable merger events can be reduced with fractional residual energy density below $10^{-3}$, and the residual foreground from subthreshold binary neutron stars (BNSs) will be the bottleneck if not be well cleaned. In this work, we propose that the foreground energy density of subthreshold BNSs $\Omega_{\rm sub}$ can be estimated via a population based approach from the individually detectable BNSs utilizing the isotropic orbital orientations of all BNSs, i.e., uniform distribution in $\cos\iota$, where $\iota$ is the BNS inclination angle with respect to the line of sight. Using this approach, we find $\Omega_{\rm sub}$ can be measured with percent-level uncertainty, assuming $O(10^5)$ individually detected BNSs in our simulations. As a result, the sensitivity to the primordial SGWB will be limited by the detector noise and the total observation time, instead of the astrophysical foregrounds from compact binaries.</description>

Abstract: The positive energy theorem for weighted asymptotically flat spin manifolds was proved by Baldauf and Ozuch \cite{BO}, and for non-spin case by Chu and Zhu \cite{CZh}. In this paper, we generalize the positive energy theorem for 3-dimensional asymptotically anti-de Sitter initial data sets to weighted asymptotically anti-de Sitter initial data sets assuming that the weighted dominant energy condition holds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine perturbations of a massive scalar field around spherically symmetric, brane-localized black holes. Although the ringdown and asymptotic tails of various brane-world black holes have been extensively studied, there has been no analysis of the massive late-time tails for the simplest Schwarzschild-like, brane-localized black hole to date. We demonstrate that after the ringdown phase, two stages of oscillatory tails emerge - intermediate and asymptotic. The asymptotic decay law is distinct from those associated with Schwarzschild or Reissner-Nordstrom solutions.</description>

      <title>Status of Birkhoff's theorem in polymerized semiclassical regime of Loop Quantum Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The collapse of a spherically symmetric ball of dust has been intensively studied in Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG). From a quantum theory, it is possible to recover a semiclassical regime through a polymerization procedure. In this setting, general solutions to the polymerized Einstein field equations (PEFE) will be discussed both for the interior and the exterior of the dust cloud. Exterior solutions are particularly interesting since they may lead to a semiclassical version of the Birkhoff's theorem. It is seen that if time independence of the vacuum is imposed, there exists a unique class of solutions depending on two parameters. Nevertheless, the possibility of more intricate time dependent solutions is not ruled out completely. Ultimately, these results will be compared to a model of spherical collapse obtained independently from the Einstein equations.</description>

      <title>Holographic Einstein Ring of a Charged Rastall AdS Black Hole with Bulk Electromagnetic Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Einstein images of a charged Rastall AdS black hole (BH) within the fabric of AdS/CFT correspondence. Considering the holographic setup, we analyze the amplitude of the total response function for various values of model parameters. With an increase in parameter $\lambda$ and temperature $T$, the amplitude of the response function is decreased, while it is increased with the increase of the electric charge $e$ and chemical potential $\mu$. The influence of frequency $\omega$ also plays an important role in the bulk field, as it is found that the decreasing $\omega$ leads to an increase in the periods of the waves, which means that the amplitude of the response function also depends on the wave source. The relation between $T$ to the inverse of the horizon $r_{h}$ for the parameter $\lambda$ is interpreted under fixed values of other involved parameters. These, in turn, affect the behavior of the response function and the Einstein ring, which may be used to differentiate the present work from previous studies. Via a special optical system, we construct the holographic images of the BH in bulk. The obtained results show that the Einstein ring always appears with concentric stripes at the position of the north pole, and this ring transforms into the luminosity-deformed ring or bright light spot when the distant observer lies away from the north pole. Moreover, from the brightness profiles, it is observed that as $\lambda$ grows, the shadow radius is significantly decreased, while the brightness of the ring is negligibly changed. We further investigate the influence of $T$ and $\mu$ on the ring radius. These results reveal that the increasing values of $T$ lead to an increase in the shadow radius and decrease as the values of $\mu$ grow. Finally, we finish this work with a discussion of the Einstein ring radius obtained by geometric optics, which is consistent with wave optics.</description>

      <title>Significance of Fabry-Perot cavities for space gravitational wave antenna DECIGO</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The future Japanese project for the detection of gravitational waves in space is planned as DECIGO. To achieve various scientific missions, including the verification of cosmic inflation through the detection of primordial gravitational waves as the main objective, DECIGO is designed to have high sensitivity in the frequency band from $0.1$ to $1$ Hz, with arms of length 1000 km. Furthermore, the use of the Fabry-Perot cavity in these arms has been established for the DECIGO project. In this paper, we scrutinize the significance of the Fabry-Perot cavity for promoting this project, with a focus on the possibility of observing gravitational waves from cosmic inflation and binary compact star systems as indicators. The results show that using the Fabry-Perot cavity is extremely beneficial for detecting them, and it is anticipated to enable the opening of a new window in gravitational wave astronomy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (EGB) 4D massive gravity coupled to nonlinear electrodynamics (NED) in an Anti-de-Sitter (AdS) background and find an exact magnetically charged black hole solution. The metric function was analyzed for different values of massive gravity parameters. We verified the first law of black hole thermodynamics and the generalized Smarr formula, treating the cosmological constant as thermodynamic pressure. Vacuum polarization is defined as the conjugate to the NED parameter. To analyze the local stability of the black hole, we compute specific heat. We investigated the Van der Waals-like/reentrant phase transition of the black holes and estimated the critical points. We observed small/large black hole (SBH/LBH) and small/intermediate/large black hole (SBH/IBH/LBH) phase transitions. The Joule-Thomson coefficient, inversion, and isenthalpic curves are discussed. Finally, the minimum inversion temperature and the corresponding event horizon radius are obtained using numerical techniques.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmological particle creation is the phenomenon by which the expansion of spacetime results in the production of particles of a given quantum field in that spacetime. In this paper, we study this phenomenon by considering a multi-level quantum particle detector in de Sitter spacetime coupled to a massless real quantum scalar field. Rather than considering a fixed classical trajectory for the detector, following recent novel approaches we consider a quantum superposition of trajectories, in particular of static trajectories which keep a fixed distance from one another. The main novel result is that, due to the quantum nature of the superposition of trajectories, the state of the detector after interaction with the field is not only a mixture of the thermal states that would be expected from each individual static trajectory but rather exhibits additional coherences due to interferences between the different trajectories. We study these in detail and associate them with the properties of the particle absorbed by the detector from the thermal bath.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, ultracompact objects have been found to be susceptible to a new nonlinear instability, known as the light-ring instability, triggered by stable light rings. This discovery raises concerns about the viability of these objects as alternatives to black holes. In this work, we investigate the presence of the light-ring instability in scalarized Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes, which have been previously shown to admit stable light rings. We employ fully nonlinear numerical evolutions of both scalarized black holes with and without stable light rings, perturbing them initially with spherically symmetric scalar perturbations. Our simulations demonstrate the long-term stability of these scalarized black holes, suggesting that the presence of a stable light ring may not necessarily induce the light-ring instability.</description>

      <title>De Sitter horizon entropy from a simplicial Lorentzian path integral</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dimension of the Hilbert space of a quantum gravitational system can be written formally as a path integral partition function over Lorentzian metrics. We implement this in a 2+1 dimensional simplicial minisuperspace model in which the system is a spatial topological disc, and recover by contour deformation through a Euclidean saddle the entropy of the de Sitter static patch, up to discretization artifacts. The model illustrates the importance of integration over both positive and negative lapse to enforce the gravitational constraints, and of restriction to complex metrics for which the fluctuation integrals would converge. Although a strictly Lorentzian path integral is oscillatory, an exponentially large partition function results from unavoidable imaginary contributions to the action. These arise from analytic continuation of the simplicial (Regge) action for configurations with codimension-2 simplices where the metric fails to be Lorentzian. In particular, the dominant contribution comes from configurations with contractible closed timelike curves that encircle the boundary of the disc, in close correspondence with recent continuum results.</description>

      <title>Projective path to points at infinity in spherically symmetric spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper points out that, in a four-dimensional spacetime manifold, the four coordinates of any point may be viewed as arising from five homogeneous coordinates according to the well-established recipes of projective geometry. Moreover, if the homogeneous coordinates change by a linear transformation, ruled by the coefficients of a matrix of the group GL(5,R), this induces a fractional linear transformation of spherically symmetric spacetime coordinates which can be exploited to bring infinity down to a finite distance. The boundary of spherically symmetric spacetimes here studied is the disjoint union of three points: future timelike infinity, past timelike infinity, spacelike infinity, and the three-dimensional products of half-lines with a 2-sphere. For the single points, the underlying structure is a projective map which destroys the 2-sphere, whereas the two products of a half-line with the 2-sphere arise from a projective map which preserves the 2-sphere. Geodesics are then studied in the projectively transformed (t',r',theta',phi') coordinates for Schwarzschild spacetime, with special interest in their way of approaching our points at infinity. Next, Nariai and de Sitter spacetimes are studied with our projective method. Since the kinds of infinity here defined depend only on the symmetry of interest in a spacetime manifold, they have a broad range of applications, which motivate the innovative analysis of Schwarzschild, Nariai and de Sitter spacetime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of an homogeneous and isotropic universe, we consider the degeneracy condition at background level between two scenarios in which processes out of equilibrium are possible to explore their cosmological implications; this consideration allows us to deviate from the perfect fluid description and in this case bulk viscosity represents a viable candidate to describe entirely such effects. The cosmological model describing an unstable dark matter sector is mapped into a slight modification of the $\Lambda$CDM model characterized by a viscous dark matter sector; under this consideration our description does not depend on a specific formulation of viscous effects and these can be fully reconstructed and characterized by the parameter that determines the decay ratio of dark matter. However, in this new scenario the cosmic expansion is influenced by the viscous pressure and the dark energy sector given by the cosmological constant is translated into a dynamical one. As consequence of our formulation, the test against observations of the model indicates consistency with quintessence dark energy but the crossing of the phantom divide can be accessible.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A special conformal transformation which carries a vacuum gravitational wave into another vacuum one is built by using the M\"obius-redefined time. It can either interchange two different vacuum waves transforming a global one into a sandwich vacuum wave, or transform the gravitational wave into itself. The first type, illustrated by linearly and circularly polarized vacuum plane gravitational waves, interchanges the symmetries and the geodesics. The second type, inspired by molecular physics, is illustrated by an anisotropic generalization of the familiar inverse-square profile with its familiar conformal O(2,1) symmetry. The particle can escape, or perform periodic motion, or fall into the singularity.</description>

Abstract: Advancements in gravitational-wave interferometers, particularly the next generation, are poised to profoundly impact gravitational wave astronomy and multimessenger astrophysics. A hybrid quantum algorithm is proposed to carry out quantum inference of parameters from compact binary coalescences detected in gravitational-wave interferometers. It performs quantum Bayesian Inference with Renormalization and Downsampling (qBIRD). We choose binary black hole (BBH) mergers from LIGO observatories as the first case to test the algorithm, but its application can be extended to more general instances. The quantum algorithm is able to generate corner plots of relevant parameters such as chirp mass, mass ratio, spins, etc. by inference of simulated gravitational waves with known injected parameter values with zero noise, Gaussian noise and real data, thus recovering an accuracy equivalent to that of classical Markov Chain Monte Carlo inferences. The simulations are performed with sets of 2 and 4 parameters. These results enhance the possibilities to extend our capacity to track signals from coalescences over longer durations and at lower frequencies extending the accuracy and promptness of gravitational wave parameter estimation.</description>

      <title>Bulk-local dS$_3$ holography: the Matter with $T\bar T+\Lambda_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an algorithm which builds a concrete dual for large-radius 3d de Sitter with a timelike York boundary for both gravity and bulk effective fields. This generalizes the solvable $T\bar T+\Lambda_2$ deformation, whose finite real spectrum accounts for the refined Gibbons-Hawking entropy as a microstate count while reproducing the radial static patch geometry. The required generalization to produce approximately local boundary conditions for bulk quantum fields requires a scheme for defining double-trace operators dual to deformed boundary conditions to realize the finite timelike boundary, valid at finite N. By starting with a small stint of a pure $T\bar T$ trajectory, the theory becomes finite, enabling well-defined subtractions to define the double-trace deformation so as to match the large-N prescription of Hartman, Kruthoff, Shaghoulian, and Tajdini to good approximation. We incorporate the matter effecting an uplift from negative to positive cosmological constant, and analyze the effect of matter on the energy spectrum of the theory arising from time-dependent bulk excitations. This validates the cosmic horizon $dS_3$ microstate count for large-radius $dS_3$ holography, embedding $T\bar T+\Lambda_2$ concretely into a larger theory consistent with bulk locality for matter fields. We comment briefly on potential upgrades to four dimensions and other future directions.</description>

      <title>An analytical approximation of the evolution of the primordial curvature perturbation in the ultraslow-roll inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmic inflation can enter an ultraslow-roll (USR) stage, if there is a plateau on the inflaton potential. During this stage, the primordial curvature perturbation ${\mathcal R}_k$ and its power spectrum ${\mathcal P}_{\mathcal R}$ can be remarkably enhanced on small scales. In this work, an analytical approximation is provided to systematically study the evolution of ${\mathcal R}_k$ in the USR inflation. We first discuss the asymptotic solutions of the moduli and arguments of ${\mathcal R}_k$ and its time derivative ${\mathcal R}_{k,N}$ on the sub- and super-horizon scales separately and find that all these solutions have simple exponential forms. Then, ${\mathcal R}_k$ on five typical scales are investigated in order. Our analytical approximation predicts that ${\mathcal R}_k$ first revolves around the origin in the complex plane, but if it crosses the horizon around the start of the USR stage, there appears a subsequent linear evolution towards or away from the origin. This behavior naturally explains the shape of ${\mathcal P}_{\mathcal R}$ from the sharp dip to the peak and matches the numerical results perfectly. Moreover, the minimum of ${\mathcal P}_{\mathcal R}$ is exactly proved to be nonvanishing. Our analytical approximation will help the model building in primordial black hole and gravitational wave physics.</description>

      <title>Electroweak Phase Transition in Singlet Extensions of The Standard Model with Dimension-Six Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The significance of the electroweak phase transition is undeniable, and although initially it was believed that it was second-order, it is now believed that it is a first-order transition. However, it is not a strong first-order phase transition in the context of the Standard Model and the remedy to this issue is to use the Higgs portal and directly couple the Higgs to a hidden scalar sector. This can result in a strong electroweak phase transition, while the couplings to a hidden scalar are constrained by several phenomenological constraints, such as the sphaleron rate criterion and the branching ratio of the Higgs to invisible channels. In this work, we consider the standard singlet extensions of the Standard Model, including dimension-six non-renormalizable operators that couple a real singlet scalar field with the Higgs doublet. As a result, we examine the effects of those Higgs-singlet couplings on the electroweak phase transition. The effective theory, where the non-renormalizable couplings originate from, is considered to be active beyond 15$\,$TeV. As we show, the Universe experiences a two-step electroweak phase transition, a primary phase transition in the singlet sector at a high temperature, and then a subsequent first-order phase transition from the singlet vacuum to the electroweak vacuum. The singlet's phase transition can either be second-order or first-order, depending on the singlet mass and its couplings to the Higgs. In particular, we show that the dimension-six operator assists in generating a strong electroweak phase transition in regions of the parameter space that were excluded in the previous singlet extensions of the Standard Model. This is further apparent for low singlet masses \(m_S &lt; m_H/2\) which are rarely taken into account in the literature due to the invisible branching ratio of the Higgs boson.</description>

      <title>Generalized Symmetry in Dynamical Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore generalized symmetry in the context of nonlinear dynamical gravity. Our basic strategy is to transcribe known results from Yang-Mills theory directly to gravity via the tetrad formalism, which recasts general relativity as a gauge theory of the local Lorentz group. By analogy, we deduce that gravity exhibits a one-form symmetry implemented by an operator $U_\alpha$ labeled by a center element $\alpha$ of the Lorentz group and associated with a certain area measured in Planck units. The corresponding charged line operator $W_\rho$ is the holonomy in a spin representation $\rho$, which is the gravitational analog of a Wilson loop. The topological linking of $U_\alpha$ and $W_\rho$ has an elegant physical interpretation from classical gravitation: the former materializes an exotic chiral cosmic string defect whose quantized conical deficit angle is measured by the latter. We verify this claim explicitly in an AdS-Schwarzschild black hole background. Notably, our conclusions imply that the standard model exhibits a new symmetry of nature at scales below the lightest neutrino mass. More generally, the absence of global symmetries in quantum gravity suggests that the gravitational one-form symmetry is either gauged or explicitly broken. The latter mandates the existence of fermions. Finally, we comment on generalizations to magnetic higher-form or higher-group gravitational symmetries.</description>

      <title>Gravitationally Mediated Entanglement with Superpositions of Rotational Energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Experimental proposals for testing quantum gravity-induced entanglement of masses (QGEM) typically involve two interacting masses which are each in a spatial superposition state. Here, we propose a QGEM experiment with two particles which are each in a superposition of rotational states, this amounts to a superposition of mass through mass-energy equivalence. Our proposal relies on the fact that rotational energy gravitates. This approach would test a feature unique to gravity since it amounts to sourcing a spacetime in superposition due to a superposition of 'charge'. We propose and analyse a concrete experimental protocol and discuss challenges.</description>

      <title>Semi-classical saddles of three-dimensional gravity via holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We find out the complex geometries corresponding to the semi-classical saddles of threedimensional quantum gravity by making use of the known results of dual conformal field theory (CFT), which is effectively given by Liouville field theory. We examine both the cases with positive and negative cosmological constants. We determine the set of semi-classical saddles to choose from the homotopy argument in the Chern-Simons formulation combined with CFT results and provide strong supports from the mini-superspace approach to the quantum gravity. For the case of positive cosmological constant, partial results were already obtained in our previous works, and they are consistent with the current ones. For the case of negative cosmological constant, we identify the geometry corresponding a semi-classical saddle with three-dimensional Euclidean anti-de Sitter space dressed with imaginary radius three-dimensional spheres. The geometry is generically unphysical, but we argue that the fact itself does not lead to any problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dilaton and axion are ubiquitous in extended supergravities and closed superstrings. We propose new models of modular inflation in four-dimensional $N=1$ supergravity coupled to the chiral dilaton-axion-goldstino supermultiplet, which fit some necessary conditions of superstring cosmology. The model parameters are tuned to obey precision measurements of the cosmic microwave background radiation. We employ the modular-invariant superpotentials and asymptotically modular-invariant K\"ahler potentials, and achieve axion stabilization with high-scale supersymmetry breaking.</description>

      <title>Classical dynamical $r$-matrices for the Chern-Simons formulation of generalised 3d gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical dynamical $r$-matrices arise naturally in the combinatorial description of the phase space of Chern-Simons theories, either through the inclusion of dynamical sources or through a gauge-fixing procedure involving two punctures. Here we consider classical dynamical $r$-matrices for the family of Lie algebras which arise in the Chern-Simons formulation of 3d gravity, for any value of the cosmological constant. We derive differential equations for classical dynamical $r$-matrices in this case, and show that they can be viewed as generalised complexifications, in a sense which we define, of the equations governing dynamical $r$-matrices for $\mathfrak{su}(2)$ and $\mathfrak{sl}(2,\mathbb{R})$. We obtain explicit families of solutions and relate them, via Weierstrass factorisation, to solutions found by Feher, Gabor, Marshall, Palla and Pusztai in the context of chiral WZWN models.</description>

      <title>Incompatibility of fine-structure constant variations at recombination with local observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Some attempts of easing the critical Hubble tension present in modern cosmology have resorted to using variations of fundamental constants, such as the fine-structure constant, at the time of recombination. In this article we demonstrate that there are critical hurdles to construct such viable models using scalar fields, due to the striking precision of local constraints on the fine-structure constant stability. These hurdles demonstrate that in single-field models one has to extremely fine-tune the shape of the potential and/or the initial conditions. Indeed, for single field models in a potential that is not fine-tuned we can put a generic bound at recombination of $\Delta \alpha/\alpha &lt; 5\cdot 10^{-4}$ (95\% CL).</description>

      <title>Periodic signature change in spacetimes of embedding class one</title>

      <description>arXiv:2204.14222v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The idea of an oscillating Universe has remained a topic of interest even after the discovery of dark energy. This paper confirms this idea by means of another well-established theory in general relativity, the embedding of curved spacetimes in higher-dimensional flat spacetimes: an $n$-dimensional Riemannian space is said to be of embedding class $m$ if $m+n$ is the lowest dimension of the flat space in which the given space can be embedded; here $m=\frac{1}{2}n(n+1)$. So a four-dimensional Riemannian space is of class two and can therefore be embedded in a six-dimensional flat space. A line element of class two can be reduced to a line element of class one by a suitable coordinate transformation. The extra dimension can be either spacelike or timelike, leading to accelerating and decelerating expansions, respectively. Accordingly, it is proposed in this paper that the free parameter occurring in the transformation be a periodic function of time. The result is a mathematical model that can be interpreted as a periodic change in the signature of the embedding space. This signature change may be the best model for an oscillating Universe and complements various models proposed in the literature.</description>

Abstract: The light scalar field with a coupling to standard model particles provide a possible source of the dark matter, long-range Yukawa forces or violation of the weak equivalence principle, which can be potentially explored by precision gravity experiments. We describe the searches for such light scalar fields with the three types of gravity experiments, including the $G$-measurement experiments, Inverse-Square Law (ISL) experiments, and equivalence principle experiments. We investigate the potential influences of the scalar field as a function of its mass, and focus on the experimental constraints from torsion-balance gravity experiments. HUST-18 $G$-measurement torsion-balance experiments place bounds on the photon coupling and electron coupling at up to $\Lambda_{\gamma}=7\times10^{17}$ GeV and $\Lambda_{e}=1\times10^{17}$ GeV in the mass ranges $10^{-9}-10^{-4}$ eV. Results from the ISL experiments by the Universities of Washington, Stanford, IUPUI, HUST, Colorado, Irvine, Yale and others allow us to set limits on the photon coupling and electron coupling at up to $\Lambda_{\gamma}=5\times10^{17}$ GeV and $\Lambda_{e}=3\times10^{16}$ GeV for scalar field mass ranges between $10^{-5}$ and $10^{-1}$ eV. Additionally, we also discuss the limits from equivalence principle experiments, and $MICROSCOPE$ final result updates the constrains on the coupling parameters at up to $\Lambda_{\gamma}=7\times10^{22}$ GeV and $\Lambda_{e}=4\times10^{21}$ GeV for mass ranges $\lesssim 10^{-13}$ eV. These results contribute experimental constraints to relatively unexplored mass regions of {light scalar field} parameter space and improve upon previous limits in some mass ranges. This work paves the way for long-range Yukawa forces mediated by light scalar fields in future high-precision gravity experiments.</description>

      <title>Spectrogram correlated stacking: A novel time-frequency domain analysis of the Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.03090v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The astrophysical stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) originates from numerous faint sub-threshold gravitational wave (GW) signals arising from the coalescing binary compact objects. This background is expected to be discovered from the current (or next-generation) network of GW detectors by cross-correlating the signal between multiple pairs of GW detectors. However, detecting this signal is challenging and the correlation is only detectable at low frequencies due to the arrival time delay between different detectors. In this work, we propose a novel technique, \texttt{Spectrogram Correlated Stacking} (or \texttt{SpeCs}), which goes beyond the usual cross-correlation (and to higher frequencies) by exploiting the higher-order statistics in the time-frequency domain which accounts for the \textit{chirping} nature of the individual events that comprise SGWB. We show that \texttt{SpeCs} improves the signal-to-noise for the detection of SGWB by a factor close to $8$, compared to standard optimal cross-correlation methods which are tuned to measure only the power spectrum of the SGWB signal.\texttt{SpeCs} can probe beyond the power spectrum and its application to the GW data available from the current and next-generation GW detectors would speed up the SGWB discovery.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.08654v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we elaborate and extend our proposal arXiv:2307.16098 of the cosmological bouncing model in which a chiral condensate violates the null energy condition and induces a bounce. The condensate formation is caused by the gravitational effects that arise in the effective action when the curvature of space-time is non-zero. As the chiral condensation is a vacuum effect, the symmetries of the FRW space-time are not violated. We explicitly calculate the spinor effective action in the presence of a background gravitational field up to second order in curvature and with derivative corrections and also derive the initial conditions of the condensate. In addition, a new interaction term between the condensate and the scalar field is introduced that might be relevant for producing the adiabatic perturbations during the contraction phase. The curvature/energy density stays far from Planckian values throughout this evolution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.00857v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider scalar field perturbations in the background of black holes immersed in perfect fluid dark matter (PFDM). We find, by using the sixth order Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) approximation, that the longest-lived modes are the ones with higher angular number, for a scalar field mass smaller than a critical value, known as anomalous decay rate of the quasinormal modes, while that beyond this critical value the behaviour is inverted. Moreover, we show that it is possible to recover the real part of the quasinormal frequencies (QNFs), the imaginary part of the QNFs, and the critical scalar field mass, of the Schwarzschild background for different values of the PFDM intensity parameter $k$, respectively. For values of $k$ smaller than these values, the mentioned quantities are greater than the Schwarzschild background. However, beyond of these values of $k$, these quantities are smaller than the Schwarzschild background.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.14195v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the near future, space-borne gravitational wave (GW) detector LISA can open the window of low-frequency band of GW and provide new tools to test gravity theories. In this work, we consider multi-parameter tests of GW generation and propagation where the deformation coefficients are varied simultaneously in parameter estimation and the principal component analysis (PCA) method are used to transform posterior samples into new bases for extracting the most informative components. The dominant components can be more sensitive to potential departures from general relativity (GR). We extend previous works by employing Bayesian parameter estimation and performing both tests with injections of GR and injections of subtle GR-violated signals. We also apply multi-parameter tests with PCA in the phenomenological test of GW propagation. This work complements previous works and further demonstrates the enhancement provided by the PCA method. Considering a supermassive black hole binary system as the GW source, we show that subtle departures will be more obvious in posteriors of PCA parameters. The departures less than $1\sigma$ in original parameters can yield significant departures in first 5 dominant PCA parameters.</description>

      <title>Spectral method for metric perturbations of black holes: Kerr background case in general relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08435v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel approach, $\textit{Metric pErTuRbations wIth speCtral methodS}$ (METRICS), to calculate the gravitational metric perturbations and the quasinormal-mode frequencies of rotating black holes of any spin without decoupling the linearized field equations. We demonstrate the method by applying it to perturbations of Kerr black holes of any spin, simultaneously solving all ten linearized Einstein equations in the Regge-Wheeler gauge through purely algebraic methods and computing the fundamental (co-rotating) quadrupole mode frequency at various spins. We moreover show that the METRICS approach is accurate and precise, yielding (i) quasinormal mode frequencies that agree with Leaver's, continuous-fraction solution with a relative fractional error smaller than $10^{-5}$ for all dimensionless spins below up to 0.95, and (ii) metric perturbations that lead to Teukolsky functions that also agree with Leaver's solution with mismatches below $1\%$ for all spins below 0.9. By not requiring the decoupling or the angular separation of the linearized field equations, the METRICS approach has the potential to be straightforwardly adapted for the computation of the quasinormal-mode frequencies of rotating black holes of any spin beyond general relativity or in the presence of matter.</description>

      <title>Bayesian power spectral estimation of gravitational wave detector noise revisited</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11808v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The analysis of gravitational wave interferometer data requires estimates for the noise covariance matrix. For stationary noise, this amounts to estimating the power spectrum. Classical methods such as Welch averaging are used in many analyses, but this method require large stretches of ``off-source'' data, where the assumption of stationarity may break down. For this reason, Bayesian spectral estimates using only ``on-source'' data are becoming more widely used, but the Bayesian approach tends to be slower, and more computationally expensive than classical methods. Here we introduce numerous improvements in speed and performance for the BayesWave trans-dimensional Bayesian spectral estimation algorithm, and introduce a new, low-latency fixed dimension Bayesian spectral estimation algorithm, FastSpec, which serves as both a starting point for the BayesWave analysis, and as a stand-alone fast spectral estimation tool. The performance of the Welch, BayesWave and FastSpec algorithms are compared by applying statistical tests for normality to the whitened frequency domain data. Bayesian spectral estimation methods are shown to significantly outperform the classical approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16479v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate quasinormal modes of scalar and electromagnetic fields in the background of Einstein--scalar--Gauss--Bonnet (EsGB) black holes. Using the scalar and electromagnetic field equations in the vicinity of the EsGB black hole, we study nature of the effective potentials. The dependence of real and imaginary parts of the fundamental quasinormal modes on parameter $p$ (which is related to the Gauss--Bonnet coupling parameter $\alpha$) for different values of multipole numbers $l$ are studied. We analyzed the effects of massive scalar fields on the EsGB black hole, which tells us the existence of quasi--resonances. In the eikonal regime, we find the analytical expression for the quasinormal frequency and show that the correspondence between the eikonal quasinormal modes and null geodesics is valid in the EsGB theory for the test fields. Finally, we study grey-body factors of the electromagnetic fields for different multipole numbers $l$, which deviates from Schwarzschild's black hole.</description>

      <title>Lyapunov Exponents and Phase Structure of Lifshitz and Hyperscaling Violating Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05181v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the phase structure of hyperscaling violating black holes using Lyapunov exponents. For describing hyperscaling violating system, we chose a particular gravity model constructed from generalized Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton action which includes the Lifshitz cases in appropriate limit. We study the relationship between Lyapunov exponents and black hole phase transitions considering both the timelike and null geodesics. We observe that, the black hole phase transiton properties are reflected in Lyapunov exponent where its multiple branches correspond to the distinct phases of the black hole. The discontinuos change of the Lyapunov exponent during the phase transition serve as an order parameter with critical exponent $1/2$ near the critical point. Our numerical study reveals that the correlation between the Lyapunov exponent and black hole thermodynamic properties can be generalised beyond the AdS spacetime. We find that it is independent of the hyperscaling violation parameter as well as the Lifshitz exponent.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15408v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the optical appearance of Schwarzschild-de Sitter and Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m-de Sitter black holes viewed by distant observers inside cosmological horizons. Unlike their asymptotically flat counterparts, due to the positive cosmological constant, there are outermost stable circular orbits in the spacetimes, resulting in significant outer edges in the images. Besides, when the Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m-de Sitter black hole has a stable Cauchy horizon, the photons from the preceding companion universe can be received by the observer in our universe. These rays create a multi-ring structure in the image. Since the stable Cauchy horizon violates the strong cosmic censorship conjecture, this novel image shed some light on the test of the conjecture by astronomical observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01634v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tidal disruption events occur when astrophysical objects are destroyed by black holes due to strong tidal force effects. Tidal forces have been studied in a variety of black hole spacetimes, including Reissner-Nordstr\"om and Kerr spacetimes. Despite the vast literature on the subject, tidal forces around black holes in static equilibrium have never been investigated before. The aim of this work is to fill in this gap and explore tidal forces in the Majumdar-Papapetrou spacetime describing two extremely charged binary black holes in equilibrium. We focus on tidal forces associated with radial and circular geodesics of massive neutral particles moving on the plane equidistant to the black holes. In particular, we study the behavior of the tidal forces as a function of the distance from the black holes and as a function of the energy of the geodesics. We also investigate the numerical solutions of the geodesic deviation equation for different initial conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17026v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interesting phenomena and problems arising from the coupling of large-scale electromagnetic fields and spacetime curvature, are introduced and studied within this thesis. From electromagnetic wave propagation in curved spacetime to envisaging a gravito-electromagnetic equivalence on large scales; from magnetic fields' cosmic evolution, and magnetised gravitational collapse in astrophysical environments, to the interaction between electromagnetic and gravitational radiation; the present research work explores some unique characteristics and properties of the gravito-electromagnetic coexistence. Its theoretical framework is generally provided by classical (Maxwellian) electrodynamics in the (4-dimensional) Riemannian spacetime of General Relativity. Chapter 1, dealing with the perspective of a gravito-electromagnetic equivalence in a metric affine geometry (involving torsion and non-metricity), forms an exception to the aforementioned general framework. Regarding its structure, the manuscript consists of four chapters divided in two parts. The first two chapters (forming Part I) are concerned with the Maxwell field in curved, Riemannian (Chapter 2) and (generalised) metric affine (Chapter 2), spacetime framework. Aspects of the Weyl-Maxwell coupling (where the Weyl field refers to long-range curvature) are also included in Chapter 2. The last two chapters (forming Part II) treat magnetohydrodynamics in the general relativistic framework.</description>

Abstract: Advances in scattering amplitudes have exposed previously-hidden color-kinematics and double-copy structures in theories ranging from gauge and gravity theories to effective field theories such as chiral perturbation theory and the Born-Infeld model. These novel structures both simplify higher-order calculations and pose tantalizing questions related to a unified framework underlying relativistic quantum theories. This introductory mini-review article invites further exploration of these topics. After a brief introduction to color-kinematics duality and the double copy as they emerges at tree and loop-level in gauge and gravity theories, we present two distinct examples: 1) an introduction to the web of double-copy-constructible theories, and 2) a discussion on the application of the double copy to calculation relevant to gravitational-wave physics.</description>

      <title>Cosmological forecasts for future galaxy surveys with the linear point standard ruler: Toward consistent BAO analyses far from a fiducial cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.09098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.09098v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The linear point (LP) standard ruler was identified as the basis of a purely geometric method for exploiting the Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO). The LP exploits the BAO feature imprinted in the galaxy two-point correlation function to measure cosmological distances independent of any specific cosmological model. We forecast the expected precision of future and ongoing spectroscopic galaxy surveys to measure distances leveraging the linear point. We investigate the cosmological implications of our forecasted results. We focus in particular on a relevant working example: the detection of the late-time cosmic acceleration independent of other cosmological probes. Our findings show that, even within the LCDM standard cosmological paradigm, estimated distances need to be reliable over a very wide parameter range in order to realize their maximum utility. This is particularly relevant if we aim to properly characterize cosmological tensions. The LP is a promising candidate approach to achieve this reliability. In contrast, widely employed procedures in BAO analysis estimate distances keeping fixed cosmological parameters to fiducial values close to cosmic-microwave-background constraints in flat-LCDM. It is unclear whether they are purely geometric methods. Moreover, they rely on untested extrapolations to explore the parameter space away from those fiducial flat-LCDM values. We recommend that all BAO methodologies be validated across the full range of models and parameters over which their results are quoted, first by means of linear predictions and then N-body simulations.</description>

      <title>On thermal fluctuations and quantum regularities of $\mathcal{F}(R,\mathcal{G})$ gravity black holes with constant topological Euler density in nonlinear electrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.14294v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the corrected thermodynamics and naked singularity structure of the topological static spherically symmetric solution in $\mathcal{F}(R,\mathcal{G})$ - gravity coupled with Born-Infeld - like nonlinear electrodynamics. Solutions admitting black holes with constant topological Euler density is analyzed in view of various thermodynamical variables. The inclusion of logarithmic correction to the entropy is extended to the other thermodynamical variables and the contribution of corrected variables are displayed on various plots. The stability of black hole under the effect of thermal variables is also studied. As a second scope of this study, solutions admitting timelike naked singularity are probed with bosonic and fermionic quantum wave packets to see if the singularity is quantum mechanically regular or not. In this context, the evolution of these probes remains well-defined if the corresponding spatial Hamiltonian operator is essentially self-adjoint. Our calculations reveal that when the singularity is probed with specific wave modes involving spin - $0$ and spin - $1/2$ quantum wave packets, the corresponding wave operators turn out to be essentially self-adjoint, which in turn implies unique well-defined time evolution.</description>

      <title>Primordial magnetic field as a common solution of nanohertz gravitational waves and the Hubble tension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.17124v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The origin of interstellar and intergalactic magnetic fields remains largely unknown. One possibility is that they are related to the primordial magnetic fields (PMFs) produced by, for instance, the phase transitions of the early Universe. In this paper, we show that the PMF-induced turbulence generated at around the QCD phase transition epoch--the characteristic magnetic field strength $B_{\rm ch}^* \sim \mathcal{O}(1)~\rm{\mu G}$ and coherent length scale $\ell_{\rm ch}^* \sim \mathcal{O}(1)~\rm{pc}$--can naturally accommodate nanohertz gravitational waves reported by pulsar timing array (PTA) collaborations. Moreover, the evolution of the PMFs to the recombination era with the form of $B_{\rm ch}\sim \ell_{\rm ch}^{-\alpha}$ can induce baryon density inhomogeneities, alter the recombination history, and alleviate the tension of the Hubble parameter $H_0$ and the matter clumpiness parameter $S_8$ between early- and late-time measurements for $0.88\leq \alpha \leq 1.17$ (approximate 95\% credible region based on three PTA likelihoods). The further evolved PMFs may account for the $\sim {\cal O}(10^{-16})$ Gauss extragalactic magnetic field inferred with GRB 221009A.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.00741v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultralight bosons near rotating black holes can grow significantly via superradiant energy extraction, potentially reaching field values close to the Planck scale, thereby turning black holes into effective transducers for these fields. The interaction between a boson field and fermions can initiate a parametric production of fermions, potentially halting the exponential growth and leading to a saturated state of the boson cloud. This dynamic offers a framework for establishing limits on boson-neutrino interactions, which have traditionally been restricted by neutrino self-interaction considerations. At the saturation phase, boson clouds have the capacity to propel neutrinos to TeV-scale energies, generating fluxes that surpass atmospheric neutrino fluxes from nearby black holes. This mechanism extends to dark sector fermions, leading to the generation of boosted dark matter. These fluxes open novel avenues for observation through high-energy neutrino detectors like IceCube, as well as through dark matter direct detection, by directing observational efforts towards targeted black holes.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we present the calculation of the three-point function in momentum space of currents for a $SO(3)$ global symmetry, in a three-dimensional toy model within phenomenological holographic cosmology. Since the two-point function gives, via electric-magnetic duality, the resolution of the cosmological monopole problem, the three-point function is related to the monopole non-Gaussianities. We check that the final result is UV and IR finite and satisfies the transverse Ward identities and consider the $k_1\ll k_2,k_3$ case, relevant for cosmology. We also show that the two-loop result for the 3-point function is completely independent of the explicit form of the potential, meaning that, like the solution to the monopole problem, also the non-Gaussianities are universal within the phenomenological holographic cosmology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.14176v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A previous paper~\cite{Bern:2022kto} identified a puzzle stemming from the amplitudes-based approach to spinning bodies in general relativity: additional Wilson coefficients appear compared to current worldline approaches to conservative dynamics of generic astrophysical objects, including neutron stars. In this paper we clarify the nature of analogous Wilson coefficients in the simpler theory of electrodynamics. We analyze the original field-theory construction, identifying definite-spin states some of which have negative norms, and relating the additional Wilson coefficients in the classical theory to transitions between different quantum spin states. We produce a new version of the theory which also has additional Wilson coefficients, but no negative-norm states. We match, through $\mathcal O(\alpha^2)$ and $\mathcal O(S^2)$, the Compton amplitudes of these field theories with those of a modified worldline theory with extra degrees of freedom introduced by releasing the spin supplementary condition. We build an effective two-body Hamiltonian that matches the impulse and spin kick of the modified field theory and of the worldline theory, displaying additional Wilson coefficients compared to standard worldline approaches. The results are then compactly expressed in terms of an eikonal formula. Our key conclusion is that, contrary to standard approaches, while the magnitude of the spin tensor is still conserved, the magnitude of the spin vector can change under conserved Hamiltonian dynamics and this change is governed by the additional Wilson coefficients. For specific values of Wilson coefficients the results are equivalent to those from a definite spin obeying the spin supplementary condition, but for generic values they are physically inequivalent. These results warrant detailed studies of the corresponding issues in general relativity.</description>

      <title>Primordial black holes in non-canonical scalar field inflation driven by quartic potential in the presence of bump</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.01239v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Here, generation of Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) from quartic potential in the presence of a tiny bump in non-canonical inflationary model has been inquired. It is demonstrated that, a viable inflationary era can be driven through the quartic potential in non-canonical framework with a power-law Lagrangian density. Furthermore, setting a suitable function of inflaton field as a correction term (like a bump) to the quartic potential, causes the inflaton to slow down for a while. In such a short time span, the amplitude of the scalar perturbations power spectrum on small scales grows up sufficiently versus CMB scales. In addition to the bump feature, the enhancing effect of the $\alpha$ parameter of the Lagrangian on the amplitude of the scalar power spectrum has been shown. Fine tuning of three parameter Cases of the model results in generating of three Cases of PBHs. In addition, we investigate the secondary Gravitational Waves (GWs) produced during generation of PBHs and show that their contemporary density parameter spectra $(\Omega_{\rm GW_0})$ can be tracked down by GWs detectors.</description>

      <title>Viscous torque in turbulent magnetized AGN accretion disks and its effects on EMRI's gravitational waves</title>

Abstract: The merger of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) produces mHz gravitational waves (GW), which are potentially detectable by future Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). Such binary systems are usually embedded in an accretion disk environment at the centre of the active galactic nucleus (AGN). Recent studies suggest the plasma environment imposes measurable imprints on the GW signal if the mass ratio of the binary is around q $ \sim10^{-4}-10^{-3}$. The effect of the gaseous environment on the GW signal is strongly dependent on the disk's parameters, therefore it is believed that future low-frequency GW detections will provide us with precious information about the physics of AGN accretion disks. We investigate this effect by measuring the viscous torque via modelling the evolution of magnetized tori around the primary massive black hole. Using GRMHD HARM-COOL code, we perform 2D and 3D simulations of weakly-magnetized thin accretion disks, with a possible truncation and transition to advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF). We study the angular momentum transport and turbulence generated by magnetorotational instability (MRI). We quantify the disk's effective alpha viscosity and its evolution over time. We apply our numerical results to quantify the relativistic viscous torque on a hypothetical low-mass secondary black hole via a 1D analytical approach, and we estimate the GW phase shift due to the gas environment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.00069v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe an approach to incorporating the physical effects of the absorption of energy by the event horizon of black holes in the scattering amplitudes based post-Minkowskian, point-particle effective description. Absorptive dynamics are incorporated in a model-independent way by coupling the usual point-particle description to an invisible sector of gapless internal degrees-of-freedom. The leading order dynamics of this sector are encoded in the low-energy expansion of a spectral density function obtained by matching an absorption cross section in the ultraviolet description. This information is then recycled using the scattering amplitudes based Kosower-Maybee-O'Connell in-in formalism to calculate the leading absorptive contribution to the impulse and change in rest mass of a Schwarzschild black hole scattering with a second compact body sourcing a massless scalar, electromagnetic or gravitational field. The results obtained are in complete agreement with previous worldline Schwinger-Keldysh calculations and provide an alternative on-shell scattering amplitudes approach to incorporating horizon absorption effects in the gravitational two-body problem.</description>

Abstract: Black hole complementarity plays a pivotal role in resolving the information loss paradox by treating Hawking radiation as carriers of information, apart from the complicated mechanisms involved in decoding information from this radiation. The thought experiment proposed by Susskind and Thorlacius, as well as the criteria set forth by Hayden and Preskill, provide deep insights into the intricate relationship of black hole complementarity between fiducial and infalling observers. We execute the Alice-Bob thought experiment in the context of two-dimensional anti-de Sitter black holes. It turns out that information cloning can be avoided in the case of a large black hole. According to the Hayden-Preskill criteria, the scale parameter associated with the explicit breaking of the one-dimensional group of reparametrizations must significantly exceed the squared mass of the black hole to effectively prevent information cloning.</description>

      <title>Scrutinizing coupled vector dark energy in light of data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.13877v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since current challenges faced by $\Lambda$CDM might be hinting at new unravelled physics, here we investigate a plausible cosmological model where a vector field acts as source of dark energy. In particular, we examine whether an energy-momentum exchange between dark energy and dark matter could provide an explanation for current discrepancies in cosmological parameters. We carefully work out equations governing background and linear order perturbations and implement them in a Boltzmann code. We found that a negative coupling makes the dark energy equation of state less negative and closer to a cosmological constant during the matter dominated epoch than an uncoupled vector dark energy model. While the effect of the coupling is hardly noticeable through its effect on matter density perturbations, matter velocity perturbations and gravitational potentials are enhanced at late-times when dark energy dominates. Therefore, data of redshift space distortions help to narrow down these kinds of couplings in the dark sector. We computed cosmological constraints and found common parameters also present in $\Lambda$CDM are in good agreement with the Planck Collaboration baseline result. Our best fit for a negatively coupled vector field predicts a higher growth rate of matter perturbations at low redshift, thus exacerbating the disagreement with redshift space distortions data. While a positively coupled vector field can lead to power suppression of $P_{\rm{m}}(k,z=0)$ on small scales as well as a lower growth rate of matter perturbations than the standard model, it might compromise the goodness of fit to the CMB angular power spectrum on small scales. We conclude that our negatively coupled vector dark energy model does not solve current tensions (i.e., $H_0$ and $\sigma_8$). (abridged)</description>

      <title>Particle detector models from path integrals of localized quantum fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16083v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the Schwinger-Keldysh path integral, we draw a connection between localized quantum field theories and more commonly used models of local probes in Relativistic Quantum Information (RQI). By integrating over and then tracing out the inaccessible modes of the localized field being used as a probe, we show that, at leading order in perturbation theory, the dynamics of any finite number of modes of the probe field is exactly that of a finite number of harmonic-oscillator Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) detectors. The equivalence is valid for a rather general class of input states of the probe-target field system, as well as for any arbitrary number of modes included as detectors. The path integral also provides a closed-form expression which gives us a systematic way of obtaining the corrections to the UDW model at higher orders in perturbation theory due to the existence of the additional modes that have been traced out. This approach vindicates and extends a recently proposed bridge between detector-based and field-theory-based measurement frameworks for quantum field theory [Phys. Rev. D 109, 045013 (2024)], and also points to potential connections between particle detector models in RQI and other areas of physics where path integral methods are more commonplace -- in particular, the Wilsonian approach to the renormalization group and effective field theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07224v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The emergence of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in the early universe remains a topic of profound interest and debate. In this paper, we investigate the formation and growth of the first SMBHs within the framework of Modified Gravity (MOG), where gravity exhibits increased strength. We explore how MOG, as an alternative to the standard model, may offer novel insights into the emergence of SMBHs and potentially reconcile the discrepancies observed in the accretion and growth processes. We examine the dynamics of gas and matter in this modified gravitational framework, shedding light on the unique interplay between gravity and the formation of SMBHs.</description>

      <title>A model-independent tripartite test of cosmic distance relations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17176v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmological distances are fundamental observables in cosmology. The luminosity ($D_L$), angular diameter ($D_A$) and gravitational wave ($D_{\rm GW}$) distances are all trivially related in General Relativity assuming no significant absorption of photons in the extragalactic medium, also known as cosmic opacity. Supernovae have long been the main cosmological standard candle, but bright standard sirens are now a proven alternative, with the advantage of not requiring calibration with other astrophysical sources. Moreover, they can also measure deviations from modified gravity through discrepancies between $D_L$ and $D_{\rm GW}$. However, both gravitational and cosmological parameters are degenerate in the Hubble diagram, making it hard to properly detect beyond standard model physics. Finally, recently a model-independent method named FreePower was proposed to infer angular diameter distances from large-scale structure which is independent of both early universe and dark energy physics. In this paper we propose a tripartite test of the ratios of these three distances with minimal amount of assumptions regarding cosmology, the early universe, cosmic opacity and modified gravity. We proceed to forecast this test with a combination of LSST and Roman supernovae, Einstein Telescope bright sirens and a joint DESI-like + Euclid-like galaxy survey. We find that even in this very model-independent approach we will be able to detect, in each of many redshift bins, percent-level deviations in these ratios of distances, allowing for very precise consistency checks of $\Lambda$CDM and standard physics. It can also result in sub-percent measurements of $H_0$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08353v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We devise new boundary conditions for the near-horizon geometries of extremal BTZ and Kerr black holes, as well as for the ultra-cold limit of the Kerr-de Sitter black hole. These boundary conditions are obtained as the higher-dimensional uplift of recently proposed boundary conditions in two-dimensional gravity. Their asymptotic symmetries consist in the semi-direct product of a Virasoro and a current algebra, of which we determine the central extensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08555v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Several distinct concepts of temperature appear in the holographic description of de Sitter space. Conflating these has led to confusion and inconsistent claims. The double-scaled limit of SYK is a concrete model in which we can examine and explain these different concepts of temperature. This note began as an addendum to our paper ``Comments on a Paper by Narovlansky and Verlinde" but in the process of writing it we learned new things -- interesting in their own right -- that we wish to report here.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative Wavefunction of the Universe in Inflation with (Resonant) Features</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10212v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the statistics of scalar perturbations in models of inflation with small and rapid oscillations in the inflaton potential (resonant non-Gaussianity). We do so by deriving the wavefunction $\Psi[\zeta(\boldsymbol{x})]$ non-perturbatively in $\zeta$, but at first order in the amplitude of the oscillations. The expression of the wavefunction of the universe (WFU) is explicit and does not require solving partial differential equations. One finds qualitative deviations from perturbation theory for $ |\zeta| \gtrsim \alpha^{-2}$, where $\alpha \gg 1$ is the number of oscillations per Hubble time. Notably, the WFU exhibits distinct behaviours for negative and positive values of $\zeta$ (troughs and peaks respectively). While corrections for $\zeta &lt;0$ remain relatively small, of the order of the oscillation amplitude, positive $\zeta$ yields substantial effects, growing exponentially as $e^{\pi\alpha/2}$ in the limit of large $\zeta$. This indicates that even minute oscillations give large effects on the tail of the distribution.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Penrose process in the magnetized Kerr spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13347v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetic Penrose process (MPP) could be highly efficient (efficiency can even exceed $100\%$) for extracting the energy from a Kerr black hole, if it is immersed in a mG order magnetic field. Considering the exact solution of the magnetized Kerr spacetime, here we derive the exact expression of efficiency ($\eta_{\rm MPP}$) for MPP, which is valid for both the Kerr black hole (BH) as well as Kerr superspinar (SS), and also from the weak magnetic field to an ultra-strong magnetic field $(B)$ which can even distort the original Kerr geometry. We show that although the value of $\eta_{\rm MPP}$ increases upto a certain value of ultra-strong magnetic field ($B_p$), it decreases to zero for $B &gt; B_p$, in case of the Kerr BHs. On the other hand, $\eta_{\rm MPP}$ shows the opposite behavior in case of the Kerr SSs. One intriguing feature that emerges is, $\eta_{\rm MPP}$ acquires the maximum value for the Kerr parameter $a_* \approx 0.786$ (unlike $a_*=1$ for the ordinary PP), decreases for $0.786 &lt; a_* \leq 1$. This indicates that the BH starts to expel the effect of magnetic field for $a_* &gt; 0.786$, and is fully expelled from the extremal Kerr BH due to the gravitational Meissner effect. As a special case of MPP, we also study the ordinary Penrose process (PP) for magnetized Kerr spacetime. We show that MPP for Kerr BHs, Kerr SSs and ordinary PP for Kerr SSs can be superefficient for the astrophysical applications to powering engines in the high-energy sources like active galactic nuclei and quasars, in the weak magnetic fields. Our strong magnetic field result of MPP could be important to the primordial BHs in the early Universe immersed in the primordial magnetic fields, and to the transmuted BHs which are formed by collapsing and/or by merging of the magnetized progenitors. It is almost impossible to extract the energy from a BH (SS) through MPP (PP) in the ultra-strong magnetic fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05623v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmelkology is the study of Elko in cosmology. Elko is a massive spin-half field of mass dimension one. Elko differs from the Dirac and Majorana fermions because it furnishes the irreducible representation of the extended Poincare group with a two-fold Wigner degeneracy where the particle and anti-particle states both have four degrees of freedom. Elko has a renormalizable quartic self interaction which makes it a candidate for self-interacting dark matter. We study Elko in the spatially flat FLRW space-time and find exact solutions in the de Sitter space. By choosing the appropriate solutions and phases, the fields satisfy the canonical anti-commutation relations and have the correct time evolutions in the flat space limit.</description>

      <title>Holographic Inflation, Primordial Black Holes and Early Structure Formation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11527v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Evidence has accumulated that there are supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in the centers of most galaxies, and that these were formed in the very early universe by some as yet unknown process. In particular, there is evidence [15] that at least some galaxies formed as early as $10^8$ to $10^9$ years after the Big Bang host SMBHs. We suggest that the holographic model of inflation, whose dark matter candidates are primordial black holes carrying a discrete gauge charge, which originated as a small subset of the inflationary horizon volumes in the very early universe, can provide the seeds for this early structure formation. Aspects of the model pointed out long ago suggested an early era of structure formation, with structures dominated by dark matter. The additional assumption that the dark matter consists of discretely charged black holes implies black hole dominance of early structures, which seems to be implied by JWST data.</description>

      <title>The universal thermodynamic properties of Extremely Compact Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13166v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An extremely compact object (ECO) is defined as a quantum object without horizon, whose radius is just a small distance $s$ outside its Schwarzschild radius. We show that any ECO of mass $M$ in $d+1$ dimensions with $s\ll (M/m_p)^{2/(d-2)(d+1)}l_p$ must have (at leading order) the same thermodynamic properties -- temperature, entropy and radiation rates -- as the corresponding semiclassical black hole of mass $M$. An essential aspect of the argument involves showing that the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation has no consistent solution in the region just outside the ECO surface, unless this region is filled with radiation at the (appropriately blueshifted) Hawking temperature. In string theory it has been found that black hole microstates are fuzzballs -- objects with no horizon -- which are expected to have a radius that is only a little larger than the horizon radius. Thus the arguments of this paper provide a nice closure to the fuzzball paradigm: the absence of a horizon removes the information paradox, and the thermodynamic properties of the semiclassical hole are nonetheless recovered to an excellent approximation.</description>
