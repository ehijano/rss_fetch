      <title>Successive-Cancellation Flip Decoding of Polar Codes Under Fixed Channel-Production Rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polar codes are a class of error-correcting codes that provably achieve the capacity of practical channels under the low-complexity successive-cancellation flip (SCF) decoding algorithm. However, the SCF decoding algorithm has a variable execution time with a high (worst-case) decoding latency. This characteristic poses a challenge to the design of receivers that have to operate at fixed data rates. In this work, we propose a multi-threshold mechanism that restrains the delay of a SCF decoder depending on the state of the buffer to avoid overflow. We show that the proposed mechanism provides better error-correction performance compared to a straightforward codeword-dropping mechanism at the cost of a small increase in complexity. In the region of interest for wireless communications, the proposed mechanism can prevent buffer overflow while operating with a fixed channel-production rate that is 1.125 times lower than the rate associated to a single decoding trial.</description>

      <title>Robust End-to-End Image Transmission with Residual Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, deep learning (DL) based image transmission at the physical layer (PL) has become a rising trend due to its ability to significantly outperform conventional separation-based digital transmissions. However, implementing solutions at the PL requires a major shift in established standards, such as those in cellular communications. Application layer (AL) solutions present a more feasible and standards-compliant alternative. In this work, we propose a layered image transmission scheme at the AL that is robust to end-to-end (E2E) channel errors. The base layer transmits a coarse image, while the enhancement layer transmits the residual between the original and coarse images. By mapping the residual image into a latent representation that aligns with the structure of the E2E channel, our proposed solution demonstrates high robustness to E2E channel errors.</description>

      <title>Identification of non-causal systems with arbitrary switching modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the identification of non-causal systems with arbitrary switching modes (NCS-ASM), a class of models essential for describing typical power load management and department store inventory dynamics. The simultaneous identification of causal-and-anticausal subsystems, along with the presence of possibly random switching sequences, however, make the overall identification problem particularly challenging. To this end, we develop an expectation-maximization (EM) based system identification technique, where the E-step proposes a modified Kalman filter (KF) to estimate the states and switching sequences of causal-and-anticausal subsystems, while the M-step consists in a switching least-squares algorithm to estimate the parameters of individual subsystems. We establish the main convergence features of the proposed identification procedure, also providing bounds on the parameter estimation errors under mild conditions. Finally, the effectiveness of our identification method is validated through two numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Movable Antennas: Channel Measurement, Modeling, and Performance Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since decades ago, multi-antenna has become a key enabling technology in the evolution of wireless communication systems. In contrast to conventional multi-antenna systems that contain antennas at fixed positions, position-flexible antenna systems have been proposed to fully utilize the spatial variation of wireless channels. In this paper, movable antenna (MA) systems are analyzed from channel measurement, modeling, position optimization to performance evaluation. First, a broadband channel measurement system with physical MAs is developed, for which the extremely high movable resolution reaches 0.02 mm. A practical two-ray model is constructed based on the channel measurement for a two-dimensional movable antenna system across 32$\times$32 planar port positions at 300 GHz. In light of the measurement results, spatial-correlated channel models for the two-dimensional MA system are proposed, which are statistically parameterized by the covariance matrix of measured channels. Finally, the signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR)-maximized position selection algorithm is proposed, which achieves 99% of the optimal performance. The performance of different MA systems in terms of spectral efficiency are evaluated and compared for both planar and linear MA systems. Extensive results demonstrate the advantage of MAs over fixed-position antennas in coping with the multi-path fading and improving the spectral efficiency by 10% in a 300 GHz measured channel.</description>

      <title>Fundamentals of Energy-Efficient Wireless Links: Optimal Ratios and Scaling Behaviors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine the energy efficiency (EE) of a base station (BS) with multiple antennas. We use a state-of-the-art power consumption model, taking into account the passive and active parts of the transceiver circuitry, including the effects of radiated power, signal processing, and passive consumption. The paper treats the transmit power, bandwidth, and number of antennas as the optimization variables. We provide novel closed-form solutions for the optimal ratios of power per unit bandwidth and power per transmit antenna. We present a novel algorithm that jointly optimizes these variables to achieve maximum EE, while fulfilling constraints on the variable ranges. We also discover a new relationship between the radiated power and the passive transceiver power consumption. We provide analytical insight into whether using maximum power or bandwidth is optimal and how many antennas a BS should utilize.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the second-order differential uniformity of vectorial Boolean functions, a relevant cryptographic property due to indication of resistance to the boomerang attack. First, we discuss connections with the second-order zero differential uniformity and its recent literature. We then prove the optimality of monomial functions with univariate form $x^d$ where $d=2^{2k}+2^k+1$ and $\gcd(k,n)=1$, and begin work towards generalising such conditions to all monomial functions of algebraic degree 3. Finally, we discuss further questions arising from computational results.</description>

      <title>Hemispherical Antenna Array Architecture for High-Altitude Platform Stations (HAPS) for Uniform Capacity Provision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel hemispherical antenna array (HAA) designed for high-altitude platform stations (HAPS). A significant limitation of traditional rectangular antenna arrays for HAPS is that their antenna elements are oriented downward, resulting in low gains for distant users. Cylindrical antenna arrays were introduced to mitigate this drawback; however, their antenna elements face the horizon leading to suboptimal gains for users located beneath the HAPS. To address these challenges, in this study, we introduce our HAA. An HAA's antenna elements are strategically distributed across the surface of a hemisphere to ensure that each user is directly aligned with specific antenna elements. To maximize users minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), we formulate an optimization problem. After performing analog beamforming, we introduce an antenna selection algorithm and show that this method achieves optimality when a substantial number of antenna elements are selected for each user. Additionally, we employ the bisection method to determine the optimal power allocation for each user. Our simulation results convincingly demonstrate that the proposed HAA outperforms the conventional arrays, and provides uniform rates across the entire coverage area. With a $20~\mathrm{MHz}$ communication bandwidth, and a $50~\mathrm{dBm}$ total power, the proposed approach reaches sum rates of $14~\mathrm{Gbps}$.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Algorithm for Group Testing with Runlength Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide an efficient algorithm to construct almost optimal $(k,n,d)$-superimposed codes with runlength constraints. A $(k,n,d)$-superimposed code of length $t$ is a $t \times n$ binary matrix such that any two 1's in each column are separated by a run of at least $d$ 0's, and such that for any column $\mathbf{c}$ and any other $k-1$ columns, there exists a row where $\mathbf{c}$ has $1$ and all the remaining $k-1$ columns have $0$. These combinatorial structures were introduced by Agarwal et al. [1], in the context of Non-Adaptive Group Testing algorithms with runlength constraints.
  By using Moser and Tardos' constructive version of the Lov\'asz Local Lemma, we provide an efficient randomized Las Vegas algorithm of complexity $\Theta(t n^2)$ for the construction of $(k,n,d)$-superimposed codes of length $t=O(dk\log n +k^2\log n)$. We also show that the length of our codes is shorter, for $n$ sufficiently large, than that of the codes whose existence was proved in [1].</description>

      <title>Submodularity of Mutual Information for Multivariate Gaussian Sources with Additive Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sensor placement approaches in networks often involve using information-theoretic measures such as entropy and mutual information. We prove that mutual information abides by submodularity and is non-decreasing when considering the mutual information between the states of the network and a subset of $k$ nodes subjected to additive white Gaussian noise. We prove this under the assumption that the states follow a non-degenerate multivariate Gaussian distribution.</description>

      <title>On the Optimal Performance of Distributed Cell-Free Massive MIMO with LoS Propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we revisit the performance analysis of distributed beamforming architectures in dense user-centric cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) systems in line-of-sight (LoS) scenarios. By incorporating a recently developed optimal distributed beamforming technique, called the team minimum mean square error (TMMSE) technique, we depart from previous studies that rely on suboptimal distributed beamforming approaches for LoS scenarios. Supported by extensive numerical simulations that follow 3GPP guidelines, we show that such suboptimal approaches may often lead to significant underestimation of the capabilities of distributed architectures, particularly in the presence of strong LoS paths. Considering the anticipated ultra-dense nature of cell-free mMIMO networks and the consequential high likelihood of strong LoS paths, our findings reveal that the team MMSE technique may significantly contribute in narrowing the performance gap between centralized and distributed architectures.</description>

      <title>Communication-Assisted Sensing Systems: Fundamental Limits and ISAC Waveform Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The communication-assisted sensing (CAS) systems are expected to endow the users with beyond-line-of-sight sensing capabilities without the aid of additional sensors. In this paper, we study the dual-functional signaling strategy, focusing on three primary aspects, namely, the information-theoretic framework, the optimal distribution of channel input, and the optimal waveform design for Gaussian signals. First, we establish the information-theoretic framework and develop a modified source-channel separation theorem (MSST) tailored for CAS systems. The proposed MSST elucidates the relationship between achievable distortion, coding rate, and communication channel capacity in cases where the distortion metric is separable for sensing and communication (S\&amp;C) processes. Second, we present an optimal channel input design for dual-functional signaling, which aims to minimize total distortion under the constraints of the MSST and resource budget. We then conceive a two-step Blahut-Arimoto (BA)-based optimal search algorithm to numerically solve the functional optimization problem. Third, in light of the current signaling strategy, we further propose an optimal waveform design for Gaussian signaling in multi-input multi-output (MIMO) CAS systems. The associated covariance matrix optimization problem is addressed using a successive convex approximation (SCA)-based waveform design algorithm. Finally, we provide numerical simulation results to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms and to show the unique performance tradeoff between S\&amp;C processes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use algebraic invariant theory to study three weight enumerators of self-dual quantum codes over finite fields. We show that the weight enumerators of self-dual quantum codes can be expressed algebraically by two polynomials and the double weight enumerators of self-dual quantum codes can be expressed algebraically by five polynomials. We also explicitly compute the complete weight enumerators of some special self-dual quantum codes. Our approach avoids applying the well-known Molien's formula and demonstrates the potential of employing invariant theory to compute weight enumerators of quantum codes.</description>

      <title>A Logarithmic Decomposition and a Signed Measure Space for Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Shannon entropy of a random variable X has much behaviour analogous to a signed measure. Previous work has explored this connection by defining a signed measure on abstract sets, which are taken to represent the information that different random variables contain. This construction is sufficient to derive many measure-theoretical counterparts to information quantities such as the mutual information $I(X; Y) = \mu(\tilde{X} \cap \tilde{Y})$, the joint entropy $H(X,Y) = \mu(\tilde{X} \cup \tilde{Y})$, and the conditional entropy $H(X|Y) = \mu(\tilde{X} \setminus \tilde{Y})$. Here we provide concrete characterisations of these abstract sets and a corresponding signed measure, and in doing so we demonstrate that there exists a much finer decomposition with intuitive properties which we call the logarithmic decomposition (LD). We show that this signed measure space has the useful property that its logarithmic atoms are easily characterised with negative or positive entropy, while also being consistent with Yeung's I-measure. We present the usability of our approach by re-examining the G\'acs-K\"orner common information and the Wyner common information from this new geometric perspective and characterising it in terms of our logarithmic atoms - a property we call logarithmic decomposability. We present possible extensions of this construction to continuous probability distributions before discussing implications for quality-led information theory. Lastly, we apply our new decomposition to examine the Dyadic and Triadic systems of James and Crutchfield and show that, in contrast to the I-measure alone, our decomposition is able to qualitatively distinguish between them.</description>

      <title>A note on the differential spectrum of the Ness-Helleseth function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $n\geqslant3$ be an odd integer and $u$ an element in the finite field $\gf_{3^n}$. The Ness-Helleseth function is the binomial $f_u(x)=ux^{d_1}+x^{d_2}$ over $\gf_{3^n}$, where $d_1=\frac{3^n-1}{2}-1$ and $d_2=3^n-2$. In 2007, Ness and Helleseth showed that $f_u$ is an APN function when $\chi(u+1)=\chi(u-1)=\chi(u)$, is differentially $3$-uniform when $\chi(u+1)=\chi(u-1)\neq\chi(u)$, and has differential uniformity at most 4 if $ \chi(u+1)\neq\chi(u-1)$ and $u\notin\gf_3$. Here $\chi(\cdot)$ denotes the quadratic character on $\gf_{3^n}$. Recently, Xia et al. determined the differential uniformity of $f_u$ for all $u$ and computed the differential spectrum of $f_u$ for $u$ satisfying $\chi(u+1)=\chi(u-1)$ or $u\in\gf_3$. The remaining problem is the differential spectrum of $f_u$ with $\chi(u+1)\neq\chi(u-1)$ and $u\notin\gf_3$. In this paper, we fill in the gap. By studying differential equations arising from the Ness-Helleseth function $f_u$ more carefully, we express the differential spectrum of $f_u$ for such $u$ in terms of two quadratic character sums. This complements the previous work of Xia et al.</description>

      <title>The Kneser--Poulsen phenomena for entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Kneser--Poulsen conjecture asserts that the volume of a union of balls in Euclidean space cannot be increased by bringing their centres pairwise closer. We prove that its natural information-theoretic counterpart is true. This follows from a complete answer to a question asked in arXiv:2210.12842 about Gaussian convolutions, namely that the R\'enyi entropy comparisons between a probability measure and its contractive image are preserved when both undergo simultaneous heat flow.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Uplink Data Detection for Massive MIMO with 1-Bit ADCs: Analysis and Joint Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04183v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new analytical framework on the uplink data detection for massive multiple-input multiple-output systems with 1-bit analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). We first characterize the expected values of the soft-estimated symbols (after the linear receiver and prior to the data detection), which are affected by the 1-bit quantization during both the channel estimation and the uplink data transmission. In our analysis, we consider conventional receivers such as maximum ratio combining (MRC), zero forcing, and minimum mean squared error (MMSE), with multiple user equipments (UEs) and correlated Rayleigh fading. Additionally, we design a linear minimum mean dispersion (LMMD) receiver tailored for the data detection with 1-bit ADCs, which exploits the expected values of the soft-estimated symbols previously derived. Then, we propose a joint data detection (JD) strategy that exploits the interdependence among the soft-estimated symbols of the interfering UEs, along with its low-complexity variant. These strategies are compared with the robust maximum likelihood data detection with 1-bit ADCs. Numerical results examining the symbol error rate show that MMSE exhibits a considerable performance gain over MRC, whereas the proposed LMMD receiver significantly outperforms all the conventional receivers. Lastly, the proposed JD and its low-complexity variant provide a significant boost in comparison with the single-UE data detection.</description>

      <title>Sensing-Enhanced Channel Estimation for Near-Field XL-MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11809v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Future sixth-generation (6G) systems are expected to leverage extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) technology, which significantly expands the range of the near-field region. The spherical wavefront characteristics in the near field introduce additional degrees of freedom (DoFs), namely distance and angle, into the channel model, which leads to unique challenges in channel estimation (CE). In this paper, we propose a new sensing-enhanced uplink CE scheme for near-field XL-MIMO, which notably reduces the required quantity of baseband samples and the dictionary size. In particular, we first propose a sensing method that can be accomplished in a single time slot. It employs power sensors embedded within the antenna elements to measure the received power pattern rather than baseband samples. A time inversion algorithm is then proposed to precisely estimate the locations of users and scatterers, which offers a substantially lower computational complexity. Based on the estimated locations from sensing, a novel dictionary is then proposed by considering the eigen-problem based on the near-field transmission model, which facilitates efficient near-field CE with less baseband sampling and a more lightweight dictionary. Moreover, we derive the general form of the eigenvectors associated with the near-field channel matrix, revealing their noteworthy connection to the discrete prolate spheroidal sequence (DPSS). Simulation results unveil that the proposed time inversion algorithm achieves accurate localization with power measurements only, and remarkably outperforms various widely-adopted algorithms in terms of computational complexity. Furthermore, the proposed eigen-dictionary considerably improves the accuracy in CE with a compact dictionary size and a drastic reduction in baseband samples by up to 66%.</description>

      <title>Homotopy Theoretic and Categorical Models of Neural Information Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2006.15136v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we develop a novel mathematical formalism for the modeling of neural information networks endowed with additional structure in the form of assignments of resources, either computational or metabolic or informational. The starting point for this construction is the notion of summing functors and of Segal's Gamma-spaces in homotopy theory. The main results in this paper include functorial assignments of concurrent/distributed computing architectures and associated binary codes to networks and their subsystems, a categorical form of the Hopfield network dynamics, which recovers the usual Hopfield equations when applied to a suitable category of weighted codes, a functorial assignment to networks of corresponding information structures and information cohomology, and a cohomological version of integrated information.</description>

      <title>Ising Machines' Dynamics and Regularization for Near-Optimal Large and Massive MIMO Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.10535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.10535v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optimal MIMO detection has been one of the most challenging and computationally inefficient tasks in wireless systems. We show that the new analog computing techniques like Coherent Ising Machines (CIM) are promising candidates for performing near-optimal MIMO detection. We propose a novel regularized Ising formulation for MIMO detection that mitigates a common error floor problem and further evolves it into an algorithm that achieves near-optimal MIMO detection. Massive MIMO systems, that have a large number of antennas at the Access point (AP), allow linear detectors to be near-optimal. However, the simplified detection in these systems comes at the cost of overall throughput, which could be improved by supporting more users. By means of numerical simulations, we show that in principle a MIMO detector based on a hybrid use of a CIM would allow us to add more transmitter antennas/users and increase the overall throughput of the cell by a significant factor. This would open up the opportunity to operate using more aggressive modulation and coding schemes and hence achieve high throughput: for a $16\times16$ large MIMO system, we estimate around 2.5$\times$ more throughput in mid-SNR regime ($\approx 12 dB$) and 2$\times$ more throughput in high-SNR regime( $&gt;$ 20dB) than the industry standard, Minimum-Mean Square Error decoding (MMSE).</description>

      <title>Inevitability of knowing less than nothing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.14424v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A colloquial interpretation of entropy is that it is the knowledge gained upon learning the outcome of a random experiment. Conditional entropy is then interpreted as the knowledge gained upon learning the outcome of one random experiment after learning the outcome of another, possibly statistically dependent, random experiment. In the classical world, entropy and conditional entropy take only non-negative values, consistent with the intuition that one has regarding the aforementioned interpretations. However, for certain entangled states, one obtains negative values when evaluating commonly accepted and information-theoretically justified formulas for the quantum conditional entropy, leading to the confounding conclusion that one can know less than nothing in the quantum world. Here, we introduce a physically motivated framework for defining quantum conditional entropy, based on two simple postulates inspired by the second law of thermodynamics (non-decrease of entropy) and extensivity of entropy, and we argue that all plausible definitions of quantum conditional entropy should respect these two postulates. We then prove that all plausible quantum conditional entropies take on negative values for certain entangled states, so that it is inevitable that one can know less than nothing in the quantum world. All of our arguments are based on constructions of physical processes that respect the first postulate, the one inspired by the second law of thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Uplink MIMO Detection using Ising Machines: A Multi-Stage Ising Approach</title>

Abstract: Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output~(MIMO) signal detection is central to every state-of-the-art communication system, and enhancements in error performance and computation complexity of MIMO detection would significantly enhance data rate and latency experienced by the users. Theoretically, the optimal MIMO detector is the maximum-likelihood (ML) MIMO detector; however, due to its extremely high complexity, it is not feasible for large real-world communication systems. Over the past few years, algorithms based on physics-inspired Ising solvers, like Coherent Ising machines and Quantum Annealers, have shown significant performance improvements for the MIMO detection problem. However, the current state-of-the-art is limited to low-order modulations or systems with few users. In this paper, we propose an adaptive multi-stage Ising machine-based MIMO detector that extends the performance gains of physics-inspired computation to Large and Massive MIMO systems with a large number of users and very high modulation schemes~(up to 256-QAM). We enhance our previously proposed delta Ising formulation and develop a heuristic that adaptively optimizes the performance and complexity of our proposed method. We perform extensive micro-benchmarking to optimize several free parameters of the system and evaluate our methods' BER and spectral efficiency for Large and Massive MIMO systems (up to 32 users and 256 QAM modulation).</description>

      <title>Effective Distance of Higher Dimensional HGPs and Weight-Reduced Quantum LDPC Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02193v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum error correction plays a prominent role in the realization of quantum computation, and quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes are believed to be practically useful stabilizer codes. While qLDPC codes are defined to have constant weight parity-checks, the weight of these parity checks could be large constants that make implementing these codes challenging. Large constants can also result in long syndrome extraction times and bad error propagation that can impact error correction performance. Hastings recently introduced weight reduction techniques for qLDPC codes that reduce the weight of the parity checks as well as the maximum number of checks that acts on any data qubit. However, the fault tolerance of these techniques remains an open question. In this paper, we analyze the effective distance of the weight-reduced code when single-ancilla syndrome extraction circuits are considered for error correction. We prove that there exists single-ancilla syndrome extraction circuits that largely preserve the effective distance of the weight-reduced qLDPC codes. In addition, we also show that the distance balancing technique introduced by Evra et al. preserves effective distance. As a corollary, our result shows that higher-dimensional hypergraph product (HGP) codes, also known as homological product codes corresponding to the product of 1-complexes, have no troublesome hook errors when using any single-ancilla syndrome extraction circuit.</description>
