      <title>Phase diagram of Rydberg atoms in a two-leg rectangular ladder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the density matrix renormalization group algorithm, we map the ground-state phase diagram of a two-leg Rydberg ladder array with lattice spacings $a_x=2a_y$. We identify various density wave phases that spontaneously break the translational symmetry or the top-bottom reflection symmetry within the ladder. By increasing the laser detuning from zero, where the system is in a disordered phase that preserves all symmetries, we observe density wave orders with spontaneous breaking of the translational $\mathbb{Z}_p$ symmetries at intermediate detuning values, while the reflection symmetry is preserved. These orders exhibit nonzero bond orders with positive expectation values on every $p$th rung, thus labeled as $\mathbb{Z}_p^+$ phases. At larger detuning values, another spontaneous breaking of the reflection symmetry, which disrupted the bond orders on the rungs, occurs via an Ising phase transition. In these phases, either the top or the bottom site is occupied in a staggered way on every $p$th rung, breaking the translational $\mathbb{Z}_{2p}$ symmetry, thus labeled by $\mathbb{Z}_{2p}$ phases. We locate and characterize the 3-state Potts point and Ashkin-Teller point along the commensurate lines, as well as the direct chiral phase transitions between the disordered phase and the $\mathbb{Z}_p^+$ ($p = 3, 4$) phases. Critical exponents $\nu$ and $z$ are calculated for both conformal and chiral phase transition points. We finally identify two types of floating phases in the phase diagram: one characterized by a quasi-long-range incommensurate bond-order wave, and the other by a quasi-long-range incommensurate wave of density differences in the rungs. Our work motivates further applications of Rydberg atom arrays in quantum simulation.</description>

      <title>Synchronization in rotating supersolids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synchronization is ubiquitous in nature at various scales and fields. This phenomenon not only offers a window into the intrinsic harmony of complex systems, but also serves as a robust probe for many-body quantum systems. One such system is a supersolid: an exotic state that is simultaneously superfluid and solid. Here, we show that putting a supersolid under rotation leads to a synchronization of the crystal's motion to an external driving frequency triggered by quantum vortex nucleation, revealing the system's dual solid-superfluid response. Benchmarking the theoretical framework against experimental observations, we exploit this model as a novel method to investigate the critical frequency required for vortex nucleation. Our results underscore the utility of synchronization as a powerful probe for quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Localized fermions on the triangular lattice with Ising-like interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The model of localized fermions on the triangular lattice is analyzed in means of the Monte Carlo simulations in the grand canonical ensemble. The Hamiltonian of the system has a form of the extended Hubbard model (at the atomic limit) with nearest-neighbor Ising-like magnetic $J$ interactions and onsite Coulomb $U$ interactions. The model is investigated for both signs of $J$, arbitrary $U$ interaction and arbitrary chemical potential $\mu$ (or, equivalently, arbitrary particle concentration $n$). Based on the specific heat capacity and sublattice magnetization analyses, the phase diagrams of the model are determined. For ferromagnetic case ($J&lt;0$), the transition from the ordered phase (which is a standard ferromagnet and can be stable up to $k_{B}T/|J| \approx 0.61$) is found to be second-order (for sufficiently large temperatures $k_{B}T/|J| \gtrsim 0.2$) or first-order (for $-1&lt;U/|J|&lt;-0.65$ at the half-filling, i.e., $n=1$). In the case of $J&gt;0$, the ordered phase occurs in a range of $-1/2&lt;U/|J|&lt;0$ (for $n=1$), while for larger $U$ the state with short-range order is also found (also for $n \neq 1$). The ordered phase is characterized by an antiferromagnetic arrangement of magnetic moments in two sublattices forming the hexagonal lattice. The transition from this ordered phase, which is found also for $\mu \neq 0$ ($n \neq 1$) and $U/|J|&gt;-1/2$ is always second-order for any model parameters. The ordered phase for $J&gt;0$ can be stable up to $k_{B}T/|J| \approx 0.06$.</description>

      <title>Room temperature exciton-polariton neural network with perovskite crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Limitations of electronics have stimulated the search for novel unconventional computing platforms that enable energy-efficient and ultra-fast information processing. Among various systems, exciton-polaritons stand out as promising candidates for the realization of optical neuromorphic devices. This is due to their unique hybrid light-matter properties, resulting in strong optical nonlinearity and excellent transport capabilities. However, previous implementations of polariton neural networks have been restricted to cryogenic temperatures, limiting their practical applications. In this work, using non-equillibrium Bose-Einstein condensation in a monocrystalline perovskite waveguide, we demonstrate the first room-temperature exciton-polariton neural network. Its performance is verified in various machine learning tasks, including binary classification, and object detection. Our result is a crucial milestone in the development of practical applications of polariton neural networks and provides new perspectives for optical computing accelerators based on perovskites.</description>

      <title>Interaction-induced phase transitions and critical phases in nonreciprocal non-Hermitian quasicrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian phenomena, such as exceptional points, non-Hermitian skin effects, and topologically nontrivial phases, have attracted continued attention. In this work, we reveal how interactions and nonreciprocal hopping could collectively influence the behavior of two interacting bosons on quasiperiodic lattices. Focusing on the Bose-Hubbard model with Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper quasiperiodic modulations and hopping asymmetry, we discover that the interaction could enlarge the localization transition point of the noninteracting system into a critical phase, in which localized doublons formed by bosonic pairs can coexist with delocalized states. Under the open boundary condition, the bosonic doublons could further show non-Hermitian skin effects, realizing doublon condensation at the edges, and their direction of skin-localization can be flexibly tuned by the hopping parameters. A framework is developed to characterize the spectral, localization, and topological transitions accompanying these phenomena. Our work advances the understanding of localization and topological phases in non-Hermitian systems, particularly in relation to multiparticle interactions.</description>

      <title>Many-body dynamics with explicitly time-dependent neural quantum states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulating the dynamics of many-body quantum systems is a significant challenge, especially in higher dimensions where entanglement grows rapidly. Neural quantum states (NQS) offer a promising tool for representing quantum wavefunctions, but their application to time evolution faces scaling challenges. We introduce the time-dependent neural quantum state (t-NQS), a novel approach incorporating explicit time dependence into the neural network ansatz. This framework optimizes a single, time-independent set of parameters to solve the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation across an entire time interval. We detail an autoregressive, attention-based transformer architecture and techniques for extending the model's applicability. To benchmark and demonstrate our method, we simulate quench dynamics in the 2D transverse field Ising model and the time-dependent preparation of the 2D antiferromagnetic state in a Heisenberg model, demonstrating state of the art performance, scalability, and extrapolation to unseen intervals. These results establish t-NQS as a powerful framework for exploring quantum dynamics in strongly correlated systems.</description>

      <title>Discrete-phase-space method for driven-dissipative dynamics of strongly interacting bosons in optical lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.16170v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a discrete truncated Wigner method to analyze the real-time evolution of dissipative SU(${\cal N}$) spin systems coupled with a Markovian environment. This semiclassical approach is not only numerically efficient but also particularly capable of accurately capturing local loss processes due to its local linearity in the dynamical equations. We apply the method to a state-of-the-art experiment involving an analog quantum simulator of a three-dimensional dissipative Bose-Hubbard model in a strongly interacting regime. Our numerical results show good agreement with experimental data, specifically capturing the continuous quantum Zeno effect in the dynamics subjected to a gradual change of the ratio between the hopping amplitude and the onsite interaction across the superfluid-Mott insulator crossover. Furthermore, we present comparative analyses with the continuous truncated Wigner method, derived as an effective Fokker-Planck equation for SU(${\cal N}$) classical spin variables, showing that the discrete method outperforms the continuous one in simulating the long-time dynamics of SU(2) and SU(3) spin models. The discrete phase space framework offers a versatile and powerful tool for exploring a wide range of open quantum many-body systems in dimensions higher than one dimension, where numerically exact methods are impractical due to the exponential growth of the Hilbert space dimension.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions from Heating to non-heating in SU(1, 1) quantum dynamics: applications to Bose-Einstein condensates and periodically driven coupled oscillators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12558v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the entanglement properties in non-equilibrium quantum systems with the SU(1, 1) structure. Through M\"obius transformation, we map the dynamics of these systems following a sudden quench or a periodic drive onto three distinct trajectories on the Poincar\'e disc, corresponding the heating, non-heating, and a phase boundary describing these non-equilibrium quantum states. We consider two experimentally feasible systems where their quantum dynamics exhibit the SU(1, 1) structure: the quench dynamics of the Bose-Einstein condensates and the periodically driven coupled oscillators. In both cases, the heating, non-heating phases, and their boundary manifest through distinct signatures in the phonon population where exponential, oscillatory, and linear growths classify these phases. Similarly, the entanglement entropy and negativity also exhibit distinct behaviors (linearly, oscillatory, and logarithmic growths) characterizing these phases, respectively. Notibly, for the periodically driven coupled oscillators, the non-equilibrium properties are characterized by two sets of SU(1, 1) generators. The corresponding two sets of the trajectories on two Poincar\'e discs lead to a more complex phase diagram. We identify two distinct phases within the heating region discernible solely by the growth rate of the entanglement entropy, where a discontinuity is observed when varying the parameters across the phase boundary within in heating region. This discontinuity is not observed in the phonon population.</description>

      <title>Impact of quantum noise on phase transitions in an atom-cavity system with limit cycles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21390v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum fluctuations are inherent in open quantum systems and they affect not only the statistical properties of the initial state but also the time evolution of the system. Using a generic minimal model, we show that quantum noise smoothens the transition between a stationary and a dynamical phase corresponding to a limit cycle (LC) in the semiclassical mean-field approximation of a generic open quantum system. Employing truncated Wigner approximation, we show that the inherent quantum noise pushes the system to exhibit signatures of LCs for interaction strengths lower than the critical value predicted by the standard mean-field theory, suggesting a noise-induced emergence of temporal ordering. Our work demonstrates that the apparent crossover-like behavior between stationary phases brought by finite-size effects from quantum fluctuations also apply to transitions involving dynamical phases. To demonstrate this on a specific physical system, we consider a transversely pumped atom-cavity setup, wherein LCs have been observed and identified as continuous time crystals. We compare the oscillation frequencies of the LCs in the one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional regimes, and find that the frequencies have larger shot-to-shot fluctuations in 1D. This has an important consequence in the effectiveness of entrainment of LCs for a periodically driven pump intensity or light-matter coupling strength.</description>

      <title>Effective approaches to the dynamical properties of two distinguishable Bose polarons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15093v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore effective approaches for describing the dynamics of induced interactions amongst two non-interacting distinguishable impurities - Bose polarons - when their couplings to the host species are switched on. First, we evaluate the time-dependent characteristics of each polaron through reduced single-particle models. Their validity is ultimately judged by comparing to observables obtained within a many-body variational approach. We argue that utilizing a time-dependent optimization process with the effective mass and frequency being fitting parameters leads to an accurate matching on the level of one-body observables with the prediction of the many-body method. Next, we construct two-body effective models, which besides the effective parameters of the single polaron, include a contact interaction potential modelling the induced interactions. It is shown that the instantaneous coupling strength obtained with a time-dependent optimization process allows for an accurate description of the impurities two-body correlation dynamics when compared to the many-body calculations. In this sense, it is possible to describe the dynamical crossover from correlated to anti-correlated impurity patterns related to the transition from attractive to repulsive induced interactions. Our results should facilitate the description of strongly particle-imbalanced mixtures via reduced models and hence their experimental understanding.</description>

      <title>Stationary acoustic black hole solutions in Bose-Einstein condensates and their Borel analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06678v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we study the dynamics of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) with the idea of finding solutions that could possibly correspond to a so-called acoustic (or Unruh) black/white holes. Those are flows with horizons where the speed of the flow goes from sub-sonic to super-sonic. This is because sound cannot go back from the supersonic to the subsonic region. The speed of sound plays the role of the speed of light in a gravitational black hole, an important difference being that there are excitations that can go faster than the speed of sound and therefore can escape the sonic black hole. Here, the motion of the BEC is described by the Gross-Pitaevskii Equation (GPE). More concretely, we discuss singular Stationary solutions of Gross-Pitaevskii equation in 2D (with Circular symmetry) and 3D (with Spherical symmetry). We use these solutions to study the local speed of sound and magnitude of flow velocity of the condensate to see whether they cross, indicating the potential existence of a sonic analog of a black/white hole. We discuss numerical techniques used and also study the semi-analytical Laplace-Borel resummation of asymptotic series solutions to see how well they agree with numerical solutions. We also study how the resurgent transseries plays a role in these solutions.</description>

Abstract: Chiral symmetry is broken by typical interactions in lattice models, but the statistical interactions embodied in the anyon-Hubbard model are an exception. It is an example of a correlated hopping model in which chiral symmetry protects a degenerate zero-energy subspace. Complementary to the traditional approach of anyon braiding in real space, we adiabatically evolve the statistical parameter in the anyon-Hubbard model and we find non-trivial Berry phases and holonomies in this chiral subspace. The corresponding states possess stationary checkerboard pattern in their $N$-particle densities which are preserved under adiabatic manipulation. We give an explicit protocol for how these chirally-protected zero energy states can be prepared, observed, validated, and controlled.</description>

Abstract: In a previous article, we studied stationary solutions to the dynamics of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) corresponding to acoustic (or Unruh) black/white holes, namely configurations where the flow becomes supersonic creating a horizon for phonons. In this paper, we consider again the Gross-Pitaevskii Equation (GPE) but looking for stationary numerical solutions in the case where the couplings are position dependent in a prescribed manner. Initially we consider a 2D quantum gas in a funnel-like spatial metric. We then reinterpret this solution as a solution in a flat metric but with spatially dependent coupling and external potential. In these solutions the local speed of sound and magnitude of flow velocity cross, indicating the existence of a supersonic region and therefore of sonic analogues of black/white holes and wormholes. We discuss the numerical techniques used. We also study phase (and density) fluctuations in these solutions and derive approximate acoustic metric tensors. For certain external potentials, we find uniform density acoustic black hole configurations and obtain their Hawking temperature.</description>

      <title>Self-Similar acoustic white hole solutions in Bose-Einstein condensates and their Borel analysis</title>

Abstract: In this article, we study Self-Similar configurations of non-relativistic Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) described by the Gross-Pitaevskii Equation (GPE). To be precise, we discuss singular Self-similar solutions of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation in 2D (with circular symmetry) and 3D (with spherical symmetry). We use these solutions to check for the crossover between the local speed of sound in the condensate and the magnitude of the flow velocity of the condensate, indicating the existence of a supersonic region and thus a sonic analog of a black/white hole. This is because phonons cannot go against the condensate flow from the supersonic to the subsonic region in such a system. We also discuss numerical techniques used and study the semi-analytical Laplace-Borel resummation of asymptotic series solutions while making use of the asymptotic transseries to justify the choice of numerical and semi-analytical approaches taken.</description>

      <title>Investigating finite-size effects in random matrices by counting resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10271v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Resonance counting is an intuitive and widely used tool in Random Matrix Theory and Anderson Localization. Its undoubted advantage is its simplicity: in principle, it is easily applicable to any random matrix ensemble. On the downside, the notion of resonance is ill-defined, and the `number of resonances' does not have a direct mapping to any commonly used physical observable like the participation entropy, the fractal dimensions, or the gap ratios (r-parameter), restricting the method's predictive power to the thermodynamic limit only where it can be used for locating the Anderson localization transition. In this work, we reevaluate the notion of resonances and relate it to measurable quantities, building a foundation for the future application of the method to finite-size systems.

      <title>Gauge fields induced by curved spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03647v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I found an extended duality (triality) between Dirac fermions in periodic spacetime metrics, nonrelativistic fermions in gauge fields (e.g., Harper-Hofstadter model), and in periodic scalar fields on a lattice (e.g., Aubry-Andr\'e model). This indicates an unexpected equivalence between spacetime metrics, gauge fields, and scalar fields on the lattice, which is understood as different physical representations of the same mathematical object, the quantum group $\mathcal{U}_q(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$. This quantum group is generated by the exponentiation of two canonical conjugate operators, namely a linear combination of position and momentum (periodic spacetime metrics), the two components of the gauge invariant momentum (gauge fields), position and momentum (periodic scalar fields). Hence, on a lattice, Dirac fermions in a periodic spacetime metric are equivalent to nonrelativistic fermions in a periodic scalar field after a proper canonical transformation. The three lattice Hamiltonians (periodic spacetime metric, Harper-Hofstadter, and Aubry-Andr\'e) share the same properties, namely fractal phase diagrams, self-similarity, topological invariants, flat bands, and topological quantized current in the incommensurate regimes.</description>
