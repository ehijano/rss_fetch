      <title>Variability in energetic particle observations at strong interplanetary shocks: Multi-spacecraft observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Interplanetary (IP) shock waves offer an unparalleled opportunity to directly study the elusive mechanisms of particle acceleration that are pervasive in our Universe. Novel spacecraft missions, orbiting poorly-explored regions of the heliosphere, opened a new observational window on particle acceleration at IP shocks that is relevant to space and astrophysical plasmas. Aims. We address shock variability and its effects on the production of accelerated particles at different energies. We leveraged three different missions that directly observed a strong IP shock in a range of separations that cannot be achieved with a single mission. We linked spatial shock irregularities and evolutionary effects to the observed energetic particle responses in the shock passage at the three different heliospheric vantage points. Methods. We exploited direct observations of magnetic field, plasma, and energetic particle fluxes from the Wind and ACE missions at 1 AU and from the Solar Orbiter spacecraft. They are well-aligned radially at 0.8 AU. We devised a new technique based on the cross-correlation of energetic particle profiles to quantitatively address the variability in the characteristics of energetic particles at different points in space and time. Results. We show that ions with different energies respond differently to the shock passage in the range of observer separations 0.02 - 0.2 AU we explored. The shape and behavior of high-energy (&gt; 0.5 MeV) particle profiles vary between the 0.8 and 1 AU observations, and we suggest that this is caused by shock-evolution, in which high-energy particles are produced less efficiently at 1 AU than at 0.8. Finally, we show that shock and ambient spatial irregularities that are observed throughout the event modulate the energetic particle responses at different energies.</description>
