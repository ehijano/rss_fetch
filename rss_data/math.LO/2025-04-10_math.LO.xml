      <title>Recasting Arrow's Impossibility Theorem as G\"odelian Incomputability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Incomputability results in formal logic and the Theory of Computation (i.e., incompleteness and undecidability) have deep implications for the foundations of mathematics and computer science. Likewise, Social Choice Theory, a branch of Welfare Economics, contains several impossibility results that place limits on the potential fairness, rationality and consistency of social decision-making processes. A formal relationship between G\"odel's Incompleteness Theorems in formal logic, and Arrow's Impossibility Theorem in Social Choice Theory has long been conjectured. In this paper, we address this gap by bringing these two theories closer by introducing a general mathematical object called a Self-Reference System. Impossibility in Social Choice Theory is demonstrated to correspond to the impossibility of a Self-Reference System to interpret its own internal consistency. We also provide a proof of G\"odel's First Incompleteness Theorem in the same terms. Together, this recasts Arrow's Impossibility Theorem as incomputability in the G\"odelian sense. The incomputability results in both fields are shown to arise out of self-referential paradoxes. This is exemplified by a new proof of Arrow's Impossibility Theorem centred around Condorcet Paradoxes.</description>

      <title>A new model for all $C$-sequences are trivial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a model in which all $C$-sequences are trivial, yet there exists a $\kappa$-Souslin tree with full vanishing levels. This answers a question of Lambie-Hanson and Rinot, and provides an optimal combination of compactness and incompactness. It is obtained by incorporating a so-called mutually exclusive ascent path to Kunen's original forcing construction.</description>

      <title>Computably discrete represented spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In computable topology, a represented space is called computably discrete if its equality predicate is semidecidable. While any such space is classically isomorphic to an initial segment of the natural numbers, the computable-isomorphism types of computably discrete represented spaces exhibit a rich structure. We show that the widely studied class of computably enumerable equivalence relations (ceers) corresponds precisely to the computably Quasi-Polish computably discrete spaces. We employ computably discrete spaces to exhibit several separating examples in computable topology. We construct a computably discrete computably Quasi-Polish space admitting no decidable properties, a computably discrete and computably Hausdorff precomputably Quasi-Polish space admitting no computable injection into the natural numbers, a two-point space which is computably Hausdorff but not computably discrete, and a two-point space which is computably discrete but not computably Hausdorff. We further expand an example due to Weihrauch that separates computably regular spaces from computably normal spaces.</description>

      <title>Dp-finite and Noetherian NIP integral domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.03315v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove some results on NIP integral domains, especially those that are Noetherian or have finite dp-rank. If $R$ is an NIP Noetherian domain that is not a field, then $R$ is a semilocal ring of Krull dimension 1, and the fraction field of $R$ has characteristic 0. Assuming the henselianity conjecture (on NIP valued fields), $R$ is a henselian local ring. Additionally, we show that integral domains of finite dp-rank are henselian local rings. Finally, we lay some groundwork for the study of Noetherian domains of finite dp-rank, and we classify dp-minimal Noetherian domains.</description>

      <title>Stationarity and elimination of imaginaries in stable and simple theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16586v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that types over real algebraically closed sets are stationary, both for the theory of separably closed fields of infinite degree of imperfection and for the theory of beautiful pairs of algebraically closed field. The proof is given in a general setup without using specific features of theories of fields.
  Moreover, we generalize results of Delon as well as of Messmer and Wood that separably closed fields of infinite degree of imperfection and differentially closed fields of positive characteristic do not have elimination of imaginaries. Using work of Wagner on subgroups of stable groups, we obtain a general criterion yielding the failure of geometric elimination of imaginaries. This criterion applies in particular to beautiful pairs of algebraically closed fields, giving an alternative proof of the corresponding result of Pillay and Vassiliev.</description>

      <title>On the Nature of Fractal Numbers and the Classical Continuum Hypothesis (CH)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04637v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a reinterpretation of the continuum grounded in the stratified structure of definability rather than classical cardinality. In this framework, a real number is not an abstract point on the number line, but an object expressible at some level Fn of a formal hierarchy. We introduce the notion of "fractal numbers" -- entities defined not within a fixed set-theoretic universe, but through layered expressibility across constructive systems. This reconceptualizes irrationality as a relative property, depending on definability depth, and replaces the binary dichotomy between countable and uncountable sets with a gradated spectrum of definability classes. We show that the classical Continuum Hypothesis loses its force in this context: between aleph_0 and c lies not a single cardinal jump, but a stratified sequence of definitional stages, each forming a countable yet irreducible approximation to the continuum. We argue that the real line should not be seen as a completed totality but as an evolving architecture of formal expressibility. We conclude with a discussion of rational invariants, the relativity of irrationality, and the emergence of a fractal metric for definitional density.</description>

      <title>On the Hausdorff dimension of maximal chains and antichains of Turing and Hyperarithmetic degrees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04957v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the Hausdorff dimension properties of chains and antichains in Turing degrees and hyperarithmetic degrees. Our main contributions are threefold: First, for antichains in hyperarithmetic degrees, we prove that every maximal antichain necessarily attains Hausdorff dimension 1. Second, regarding chains in Turing degrees, we establish the existence of a maximal chain with Hausdorff dimension 0. Furthermore, under the assumption that $\omega_1=(\omega_1)^L$, we demonstrate the existence of such maximal chains with $\Pi^1_1$ complexity. Third, we extend our investigation to maximal antichains of Turing degrees by analyzing both the packing dimension and effective Hausdorff dimension.</description>
