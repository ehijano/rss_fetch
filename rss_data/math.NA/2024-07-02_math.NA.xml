      <title>Deep Neural Networks with Symplectic Preservation Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a deep neural network architecture designed such that its output forms an invertible symplectomorphism of the input. This design draws an analogy to the real-valued non-volume-preserving (real NVP) method used in normalizing flow techniques. Utilizing this neural network type allows for learning tasks on unknown Hamiltonian systems without breaking the inherent symplectic structure of the phase space.</description>

      <title>UM2N: Towards Universal Mesh Movement Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving complex Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) accurately and efficiently is an essential and challenging problem in all scientific and engineering disciplines. Mesh movement methods provide the capability to improve the accuracy of the numerical solution without increasing the overall mesh degree of freedom count. Conventional sophisticated mesh movement methods are extremely expensive and struggle to handle scenarios with complex boundary geometries. However, existing learning-based methods require re-training from scratch given a different PDE type or boundary geometry, which limits their applicability, and also often suffer from robustness issues in the form of inverted elements. In this paper, we introduce the Universal Mesh Movement Network (UM2N), which -- once trained -- can be applied in a non-intrusive, zero-shot manner to move meshes with different size distributions and structures, for solvers applicable to different PDE types and boundary geometries. UM2N consists of a Graph Transformer (GT) encoder for extracting features and a Graph Attention Network (GAT) based decoder for moving the mesh. We evaluate our method on advection and Navier-Stokes based examples, as well as a real-world tsunami simulation case. Our method outperforms existing learning-based mesh movement methods in terms of the benchmarks described above. In comparison to the conventional sophisticated Monge-Amp\`ere PDE-solver based method, our approach not only significantly accelerates mesh movement, but also proves effective in scenarios where the conventional method fails.

      <title>Stability and Convergence Analysis of an Exact Finite Difference Scheme for Fredholm Integro-Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This report addresses the boundary value problem for a second-order linear singularly perturbed FIDE. Traditional methods for solving these equations often face stability issues when dealing with small perturbation parameters. We propose an exact finite difference method to solve these equations and provide a detailed stability and $\varepsilon$-uniform convergence analysis. Our approach is validated with an example, demonstrating its uniform convergence and applicability, with a convergence order of 1. The results illustrate the method's robustness in handling perturbation effects efficiently.</description>

      <title>A time-adaptive algorithm for pressure dominated flows: a heuristic estimator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work aims to introduce a heuristic timestep-adaptive algorithm for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI) problems where the flow is dominated by the pressure. In such scenarios, many time-adaptive algorithms based on the interplay of implicit and explicit time schemes fail to capture the fast transient dynamics of pressure fields. We present an algorithm that relies on a temporal error estimator using Backward Differentiation Formulae (BDF$k$) of order $k=2,3$. Specifically, we demonstrate that the implicit BDF$3$ solution can be well approximated by applying a single Newton-type nonlinear solver correction to the implicit BDF$2$ solution. The difference between these solutions determines our adaptive temporal error estimator. The effectiveness of our approach is confirmed by numerical experiments conducted on a backward-facing step flow CFD test case with Reynolds number $300$ and on a two-dimensional haemodynamics FSI benchmark.</description>

      <title>The weak form of the SDOF and MDOF equation of motion, part I: Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The weak form of the SDOF and MDOF equations of motion are obtained. The original initial conditions problem is transformed into a boundary value problem. The boundary value problem is then solved and transformed back to the initial conditions one. Subsequently, a general method for obtaining numerical methods using an arbitrary number of linearly independent approximating functions is outlined.
  This is part one of a series of three papers, in the second of which a numerical method is obtained, using Bernstein polynomials of arbitrarily high order. The numerical evidence for the convergence of the method will be presented in the third part paper.</description>

      <title>A Review of Neural Network Solvers for Second-order Boundary Value Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning-based partial differential equation(PDE) solvers have received much attention in the past few years. Methods of this category can solve a wide range of PDEs with high accuracy, typically by transforming the problems into highly nonlinear optimization problems of neural network parameters. This work reviews several deep learning solvers proposed a few years ago, including PINN, WAN, DRM, and VPINN. Numerical results are provided to make comparisons amongst them and address the importance of loss formulation and the optimization method. A rigorous error analysis for PINN is also presented. Finally, we discuss the current limitations and bottlenecks of these methods.</description>

      <title>ParaPIF: A Parareal Approach for Parallel-in-Time Integration of Particle-in-Fourier schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose ParaPIF, a parareal based time parallelization scheme for the particle-in-Fourier (PIF) discretization of the Vlasov-Poisson system used in kinetic plasma simulations. Our coarse propagators are based on the coarsening of the numerical discretization scheme combined with, if possible, temporal coarsening rather than coarsening of particles and/or Fourier modes, which are not possible or effective for PIF schemes. Specifically, we use PIF with a coarse tolerance for nonuniform FFTs or even the standard particle-in-cell schemes as coarse propagators for the ParaPIF algorithm. We state and prove the convergence of the algorithm and verify the results numerically with Landau damping, two-stream instability, and Penning trap test cases in 3D-3V. We also implement the space-time parallelization of the PIF schemes in the open-source, performance-portable library IPPL and conduct scaling studies up to 1536 A100 GPUs on the JUWELS booster supercomputer. The space-time parallelization utilizing the ParaPIF algorithm for the time parallelization provides up to $4-6$ times speedup compared to spatial parallelization alone and achieves a push rate of around 1 billion particles per second for the benchmark plasma mini-apps considered.</description>

      <title>Fully discrete energy-dissipative and conservative discrete gradient particle methods for a class of continuity equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structure-preserving particle methods have recently been proposed for a class of nonlinear continuity equations, including aggregation-diffusion equation in [J. Carrillo, K. Craig, F. Patacchini, Calc. Var., 58 (2019), pp. 53] and the Landau equation in [J. Carrillo, J. Hu., L. Wang, J. Wu, J. Comput. Phys. X, 7 (2020), pp. 100066]. One common feature to these equations is that they both admit some variational formulation, which upon proper regularization, leads to particle approximations dissipating the energy and conserving some quantities simultaneously at the semi-discrete level. In this paper, we formulate continuity equations with a density dependent bilinear form associated with the variational derivative of the energy functional and prove that appropriate particle methods satisfy a compatibility condition with its regularized energy. This enables us to utilize discrete gradient time integrators and show that the energy can be dissipated and the mass conserved simultaneously at the fully discrete level. In the case of the Landau equation, we prove that our approach also conserves the momentum and kinetic energy at the fully discrete level. Several numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the dissipative and conservative properties of our proposed method.</description>

      <title>Convergence analysis of exponential time differencing scheme for the nonlocal Cahn-Hilliard equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a rigorous proof of the convergence of first order and second order exponential time differencing (ETD) schemes for solving the nonlocal Cahn-Hilliard (NCH) equation. The spatial discretization employs the Fourier spectral collocation method, while the time discretization is implemented using ETD-based multistep schemes. The absence of a higher-order diffusion term in the NCH equation poses a significant challenge to its convergence analysis. To tackle this, we introduce new error decomposition formulas and employ the higher-order consistency analysis. These techniques enable us to establish the $\ell^\infty$ bound of numerical solutions under some natural constraints. By treating the numerical solution as a perturbation of the exact solution, we derive optimal convergence rates in $\ell^\infty(0,T;H_h^{-1})\cap \ell^2(0,T; \ell^2)$. We conduct several numerical experiments to validate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed schemes, including convergence tests and the observation of long-term coarsening dynamics.</description>

      <title>A Nonconforming Virtual Element Method for Advection-Diffusion-Reaction Problems with CIP Stabilization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a nonconforming virtual element method (VEM) for advection-diffusion-reaction problems with continuous interior penalty (CIP) stabilization. The design of the method is based on a standard variational formulation of the problem (no skew-symmetrization), and boundary conditions are imposed with a Nitsche technique. We use the enhanced version of VEM, with a ``DoFi-DoFi'' stabilization in the diffusion and reaction terms. We prove stability of the proposed method and derive $h$-version error estimates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An unexpected failure of a concrete gravity dam may cause unimaginable human suffering and massive economic losses. An earthquake is the main factor contributing to the concrete gravity dam's failure. In recent years, there has been a rise in efforts globally to make dams safe under dynamic loading. Numerical modeling of dams under earthquake loading yields substantial insights into dams' fracture and damage progression. In the present work, a particle-based computational framework is developed to investigate the failure of the Koyna dam, a concrete gravity dam in India exposed to dynamic loading. The dam-foundation system is considered here. The numerically obtained crack results in the concrete dam are compared with the available experimental results. The findings are consistent with one another.</description>

      <title>Multiple-GPU accelerated high-order gas-kinetic scheme on three-dimensional unstructured meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, successes have been achieved for the high-order gas-kinetic schemes (HGKS) on unstructured meshes for compressible flows. In this paper, to accelerate the computation, HGKS is implemented with the graphical processing unit (GPU) using the compute unified device architecture (CUDA). HGKS on unstructured meshes is a fully explicit scheme, and the acceleration framework can be developed based on the cell-level parallelism. For single-GPU computation, the connectivity of geometric information is generated for the requirement of data localization and independence. Based on such data structure, the kernels and corresponding girds of CUDA are set. With the one-to-one mapping between the indices of cells and CUDA threads, the single-GPU computation using CUDA can be implemented for HGKS. For multiple-GPU computation, the domain decomposition and data exchange need to be taken into account. The domain is decomposed into subdomains by METIS, and the MPI processes are created for the control of each process and communication among GPUs. With reconstruction of connectivity and adding ghost cells, the main configuration of CUDA for single-GPU can be inherited by each GPU. The benchmark cases for compressible flows, including accuracy test and flow passing through a sphere, are presented to assess the numerical performance of HGKS with Nvidia RTX A5000 and Tesla V100 GPUs. For single-GPU computation, compared with the parallel central processing unit (CPU) code running on the Intel Xeon Gold 5120 CPU with open multi-processing (OpenMP) directives, 5x speedup is achieved by RTX A5000 and 9x speedup is achieved by Tesla V100. For multiple-GPU computation, HGKS code scales properly with the increasing number of GPU. Numerical results confirm the excellent performance of multiple-GPU accelerated HGKS on unstructured meshes.</description>

      <title>On the Continuity of Schur-Horn Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Schur-Horn theorem is a well-known result that characterizes the relationship between the diagonal elements and eigenvalues of a symmetric (Hermitian) matrix. In this paper, we extend this theorem by exploring the eigenvalue perturbation of a symmetric (Hermitian) matrix with fixed diagonals, which is referred to as the continuity of the Schur-Horn mapping. We introduce a concept called strong Schur-Horn continuity, characterized by minimal constraints on the perturbation. We demonstrate that several categories of matrices exhibit strong Schur-Horn continuity. Leveraging this notion, along with a majorization constraint on the perturbation, we prove the Schur-Horn continuity for general symmetric (Hermitian) matrices. The Schur-Horn continuity finds applications in oblique manifold optimization related to quantum computing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For linear systems $Ax=b$ we develop iterative algorithms based on a sketch-and-project approach. By using judicious choices for the sketch, such as the history of residuals, we develop weighting strategies that enable short recursive formulas. The proposed algorithms have a low memory footprint and iteration complexity compared to regular sketch-and-project methods. In a set of numerical experiments the new methods compare well to GMRES, SYMMLQ and state-of-the-art randomized solvers.</description>

      <title>A posteriori error estimator for elliptic interface problems in the fictitious formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A posteriori error estimator is derived for an elliptic interface problem in the fictitious domain formulation with distributed Lagrange multiplier considering a discontinuous Lagrange multiplier finite element space. A posteriori error estimation plays a pivotal role in assessing the accuracy and reliability of computational solutions across various domains of science and engineering. This study delves into the theoretical underpinnings and computational considerations of a residual-based estimator.
  Theoretically, the estimator is studied for cases with constant coefficients which jump across an interface as well as generalized scenarios with smooth coefficients that jump across an interface. Theoretical findings demonstrate the reliability and efficiency of the proposed estimators under all considered cases.
  Numerical experiments are conducted to validate the theoretical results, incorporating various immersed geometries and instances of high coefficients jumps at the interface. Leveraging an adaptive algorithm, the estimator identifies regions with singularities and applies refinement accordingly. Results substantiate the theoretical findings, highlighting the reliability and efficiency of the estimators. Furthermore, numerical solutions exhibit optimal convergence properties, demonstrating resilience against geometric singularities or coefficients jumps.</description>

Abstract: The use of variable grid BDF methods for parabolic equations leads to structures that are called variable (coefficient) Toeplitz. Here, we consider a more general class of matrix-sequences and we prove that they belong to the maximal $*$-algebra of generalized locally Toeplitz (GLT) matrix-sequences. Then, we identify the associated GLT symbols in the general setting and in the specific case, by providing in both cases a spectral and singular value analysis. More specifically, we use the GLT tools in order to study the asymptotic behaviour of the eigenvalues and singular values of the considered BDF matrix-sequences, in connection with the given non-uniform grids. Numerical examples, visualizations, and open problems end the present work.</description>

      <title>ROM inversion of monostatic data lifted to full MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Lippmann--Schwinger--Lanczos (LSL) algorithm has recently been shown to provide an efficient tool for imaging and direct inversion of synthetic aperture radar data in multi-scattering environments \cite{DrMoZa3}, where the data set is limited to the monostatic, a.k.a. single input/single output (SISO) measurements. The approach is based on constructing data-driven estimates of internal fields via a reduced-order model (ROM) framework and then plugging them into the Lippmann-Schwinger integral equation. However, the approximations of the internal solutions may have more error due to missing the off diagonal elements of the multiple input/multiple output (MIMO) matrix valued transfer function. This, in turn, may result in multiple echoes in the image. Here we present a ROM-based data completion algorithm to mitigate this problem. First, we apply the LSL algorithm to the SISO data as in \cite{DrMoZa3} to obtain approximate reconstructions as well as the estimate of internal field. Next, we use these estimates to calculate a forward Lippmann-Schwinger integral to populate the missing off-diagonal data (the lifting step). Finally, to update the reconstructions, we solve the Lippmann-Schwinger equation using the original SISO data, where the internal fields are constructed from the lifted MIMO data. The steps of obtaining the approximate reconstructions and internal fields and populating the missing MIMO data entries can be repeated for complex models to improve the images even further. Efficiency of the proposed approach is demonstrated on 2D and 2.5D numerical examples, where we see reconstructions are improved substantially.</description>

      <title>Semi-implicit hybrid finite volume/finite element method for the GPR model of continuum mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new hybrid semi-implicit finite volume / finite element numerical scheme for the solution of incompressible and weakly compressible media. From the continuum mechanics model proposed by Godunov, Peshkov and Romenski (GPR), we derive the incompressible GPR formulation as well as a weakly compressible GPR system. As for the original GPR model, the new formulations are able to describe different media, from elastoplastic solids to viscous fluids, depending on the values set for the model's relaxation parameters. Then, we propose a new numerical method for the solution of both models based on the splitting of the original systems into three subsystems: one containing the convective part and non-conservative products, a second subsystem for the source terms of the distortion tensor and heat flux equations and, finally, a pressure subsystem. In the first stage of the algorithm, the transport subsystem is solved by employing an explicit finite volume method, while the source terms are solved implicitly. Next, the pressure subsystem is implicitly discretised using finite elements. Within this methodology, unstructured grids are employed, with the pressure defined in the primal grid and the rest of the variables computed in the dual grid. To evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme, a numerical convergence analysis is carried out, which confirms the second order of accuracy in space. A wide range of benchmarks is reproduced for the incompressible and weakly compressible cases, considering both solid and fluid media. These results demonstrate the good behaviour and robustness of the proposed scheme in a variety of scenarios and conditions.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We make the interprecision transfers explicit in an algorithmic description of iterative refinement and obtain new insights into the algorithm. One example is the classic variant of iterative refinement where the matrix and the factorization are stored in a working precision and the residual is evaluated in a higher precision. In that case we make the observation that this algorithm will solve a promoted form of the original problem and thereby characterize the limiting behavior in a novel way and obtain a different version of the classic convergence analysis. We also discuss two approaches for interprecision transfer in the triangular solves.</description>

      <title>PhoTOS: Topology Optimization of Photonic Components using a Shape Library</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topology Optimization (TO) holds the promise of designing next-generation compact and efficient photonic components. However, ensuring the optimized designs comply with fabrication constraints imposed by semiconductor foundries remains a challenge. This work presents a TO framework that guarantees designs satisfy fabrication criteria, particularly minimum feature size and separation. Leveraging recent advancements in machine learning and feature mapping methods, our approach constructs components by transforming shapes from a predefined library, simplifying constraint enforcement. Specifically, we introduce a Convo-implicit Variational Autoencoder to encode the discrete shape library into a differentiable space, enabling gradient-based optimization. The efficacy of our framework is demonstrated through the design of several common photonic components.</description>

      <title>Mittag-Leffler stability of complete monotonicity-preserving schemes for time-dependent coefficients sub-diffusion equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key characteristic of the anomalous sub-solution equation is that the solution exhibits algebraic decay rate over long time intervals, which is often refered to the Mittag-Leffler type stability. For a class of power nonlinear sub-diffusion models with variable coefficients, we prove that their solutions have Mittag-Leffler stability when the source functions satisfy natural decay assumptions. That is the solutions have the decay rate $\|u(t)\|_{L^{s}(\Omega)}=O\left( t^{-(\alpha+\beta)/\gamma} \right)$ as $t\rightarrow\infty$, where $\alpha$, $\gamma$ are positive constants, $\beta\in(-\alpha,\infty)$ and $s\in (1,\infty)$. Then we develop the structure preserving algorithm for this type of model. For the complete monotonicity-preserving ($\mathcal{CM}$-preserving) schemes developed by Li and Wang (Commun. Math. Sci., 19(5):1301-1336, 2021), we prove that they satisfy the discrete comparison principle for time fractional differential equations with variable coefficients. Then, by carefully constructing the fine the discrete supsolution and subsolution, we obtain the long time optimal decay rate of the numerical solution $\|u_{n}\|_{L^{s}(\Omega)}=O\left( t_n^{-(\alpha+\beta)/\gamma} \right)$ as $t_{n}\rightarrow\infty$, which is fully agree with the theoretical solution. Finally, we validated the analysis results through numerical experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents and analyzes a parallelizable iterative procedure based on domain decomposition for primal-dual weak Galerkin (PDWG) finite element methods applied to the Poisson equation. The existence and uniqueness of the PDWG solution are established. Optimal order of error estimates are derived in both a discrete norm and the $L^2$ norm. The convergence analysis is conducted for domain decompositions into individual elements associated with the PDWG methods, which can be extended to larger subdomains without any difficulty.</description>

      <title>An Abstract Lyapunov Control Optimizer: Local Stabilization and Global Convergence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, many machine learning optimizers have been analysed considering them as the asymptotic limit of some differential equations when the step size goes to zero. In other words, the optimizers can be seen as a finite difference scheme applied to a continuous dynamical system. But the major part of the results in the literature concerns constant step size algorithms. The main aim of this paper is to investigate the guarantees of the adaptive step size counterpart. In fact, this dynamical point of view can be used to design step size update rules, by choosing a discretization of the continuous equation that preserves its most relevant features. In this work, we analyse this kind of adaptive optimizers and prove their Lyapunov stability and convergence properties for any choice of hyperparameters. At the best of our knowledge, this paper introduces for the first time the use of continuous selection theory from general topology to overcome some of the intrinsic difficulties due to the non constant and non regular step size policies. The general framework developed gives many new results on adaptive and constant step size Momentum/Heavy-Ball and p-GD algorithms.</description>

      <title>Randomized linear solvers for computational architectures with straggling workers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the iterative solution of sparse systems of linear algebraic equations under the condition that sparse matrix-vector products with the coefficient matrix are computed only partially. At the same time, non-computed entries are set to zeros. We assume that both the number of computed entries and their associated row index set are random variables, with the row index set sampled uniformly given the number of computed entries. This model of computations is prevalent to that realized in hybrid cloud computing architectures following the controller-worker distributed model under the influence of straggling workers. We propose a randomized Richardson iterative scheme and a randomized Chebyshev semi-iterative method within this model and prove the sufficient conditions for their convergence in expectation. Numerical experiments verify the presented theoretical results as well as the effectiveness of the proposed schemes on a few sparse matrix problems.</description>

      <title>Mixed finite element methods for the Landau--Lifshitz--Baryakhtar and the regularised Landau--Lifshitz--Bloch equations in micromagnetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Landau--Lifshitz--Baryakhtar (LLBar) and the Landau--Lifshitz--Bloch (LLBloch) equations are nonlinear vector-valued PDEs which arise in the theory of micromagnetics to describe the dynamics of magnetic spin field in a ferromagnet at elevated temperatures. We consider the LLBar and the regularised LLBloch equations in a unified manner, thus allowing us to treat the numerical approximations for both problems at once. In this paper, we propose a semi-discrete mixed finite element scheme and two fully discrete mixed finite element schemes based on a semi-implicit Euler method and a semi-implicit Crank--Nicolson method to solve the problems. These numerical schemes provide accurate approximations to both the magnetisation vector and the effective magnetic field. Moreover, they are proven to be unconditionally energy-stable and preserve energy dissipativity of the system at the discrete level. Error analysis is performed which shows optimal rates of convergence in $\mathbb{L}^2$, $\mathbb{L}^\infty$, and $\mathbb{H}^1$ norms. These theoretical results are further corroborated by several numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>A Line Search Algorithm for Multiphysics Problems with Fracture Deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Models for multiphysics problems often contain strong nonlinearities. Including fracture contact mechanics introduces discontinuities at the transition between open and closed or sliding and sticking fractures. The resulting system of equations is highly challenging to solve. The na\"ive choice of Newton's method frequently fails to converge, calling for more refined solution techniques such as line search methods. When dealing with strong nonlinearities and discontinuities, a global line search based on the magnitude of the residual of all equations is at best costly to evaluate and at worst fails to converge. We therefore suggest a cheap and reliable approach tailored to the discontinuities. Utilising adaptive variable scaling, the algorithm uses a line search to identify the transition between contact states. Then, a solution update weight is chosen to ensure that no fracture cells move too far beyond the transition. We demonstrate the algorithm on a series of test cases for poromechanics and thermoporomechanics in fractured porous media. We consider both single- and multifracture cases and study the importance of proper scaling of variables and equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel framework of generalised Petrov-Galerkin Dynamical Low Rank Approximations (DLR) in the context of random PDEs. It builds on the standard Dynamical Low Rank Approximations in their Dynamically Orthogonal formulation. It allows to seamlessly build-in many standard and well-studied stabilisation techniques that can be framed as either generalised Galerkin methods, or Petrov-Galerkin methods. The framework is subsequently applied to the case of Streamine Upwind/Petrov Galerkin (SUPG) stabilisation of advection-dominated problems with small stochastic perturbations of the transport field. The norm-stability properties of two time discretisations are analysed. Numerical experiments confirm that the stabilising properties of the SUPG method naturally carry over to the DLR framework.</description>

      <title>Fast Iterative Solver For Neural Network Method: II. 1D Diffusion-Reaction Problems And Data Fitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper expands the damped block Newton (dBN) method introduced recently in [4] for 1D diffusion-reaction equations and least-squares data fitting problems. To determine the linear parameters (the weights and bias of the output layer) of the neural network (NN), the dBN method requires solving systems of linear equations involving the mass matrix. While the mass matrix for local hat basis functions is tri-diagonal and well-conditioned, the mass matrix for NNs is dense and ill-conditioned. For example, the condition number of the NN mass matrix for quasi-uniform meshes is at least ${\cal O}(n^4)$. We present a factorization of the mass matrix that enables solving the systems of linear equations in ${\cal O}(n)$ operations. To determine the non-linear parameters (the weights and bias of the hidden layer), one step of a damped Newton method is employed at each iteration. A Gauss-Newton method is used in place of Newton for the instances in which the Hessian matrices are singular. This modified dBN is referred to as dBGN. For both methods, the computational cost per iteration is ${\cal O}(n)$. Numerical results demonstrate the ability dBN and dBGN to efficiently achieve accurate results and outperform BFGS for select examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The high computational demands of multiscale modeling necessitate advanced parallel and adaptive strategies. To address this challenge, we introduce an adaptive method that utilizes two microscale models based on an offline database for multiscale modeling of curved interfaces (e.g., adhesive layers). This database employs nonlinear classifiers, developed using Support Vector Machines from microscale sampling data, as a preprocessing step for multiscale simulations. Next, we develop a new parallel network library that enables seamless model selection with customized communication layers, ensuring scalability in parallel computing environments. The correctness and effectiveness of the hierarchically parallel solver are verified on a crack propagation problem within the curved adhesive layer. Finally, we predict the ultimate bending moment and adhesive layer failure of a wind turbine blade and validate the solver on a difficult large-scale engineering problem.</description>

Abstract: Influence propagation in social networks is a central problem in modern social network analysis, with important societal applications in politics and advertising. A large body of work has focused on cascading models, viral marketing, and finite-horizon diffusion. There is, however, a need for more developed, mathematically principled \emph{adversarial models}, in which multiple, opposed actors strategically select nodes whose influence will maximally sway the crowd to their point of view.
  In the present work, we develop and analyze such a model based on harmonic functions and linear diffusion. We prove that our general problem is NP-hard and that the objective function is monotone and submodular; consequently, we can greedily approximate the solution within a constant factor. Introducing and analyzing a convex relaxation, we show that the problem can be approximately solved using smooth optimization methods. We illustrate the effectiveness of our approach on a variety of example networks.</description>

      <title>Bridging Large Eddy Simulation and Reduced Order Modeling of Convection-Dominated Flows through Spatial Filtering: Review and Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reduced order models (ROMs) have achieved a lot of success in reducing the computational cost of traditional numerical methods across many disciplines. For convection-dominated (e.g., turbulent) flows, however, standard ROMs generally yield inaccurate results, usually affected by spurious oscillations. Thus, ROMs are usually equipped with numerical stabilization or closure models to account for the effect of the discarded modes. The literature on ROM closures and stabilizations is large and growing fast. In this paper, we focus on one particular type of ROM closures and stabilizations that are inspired by Large Eddy Simulation (LES). These ROMs, which we call LES-ROMs, are extremely easy to implement, very efficient, and accurate. Carefully tuned LES-ROMs can accurately capture the average physical quantities of interest in challenging convection-dominated flows in many applications. LES-ROM are constructed by leveraging spatial filtering, i.e., the same principle used to build classical LES models. This ensures a modeling consistency between LES-ROMs and the approaches that generated the data used to train them. It also ``bridges'' two distinct research fields (LES and ROMs), disconnected until now. This paper is a review of LES-ROMs. It starts with a description of a versatile LES strategy called evolve-filter-relax (EFR) that has been successfully used as a full order method. We then show how the EFR strategy, and spatial filtering in general, can be leveraged to construct LES-ROMs. Several applications of LES-ROMs are presented. Finally, we draw conclusions and outline several research directions and open questions in the LES-ROM development. While we do not claim this review to be comprehensive, we certainly hope it serves as a brief and friendly introduction to this exciting research area, which has a lot of potential in practical numerical simulation of convection-dominated flows.</description>

      <title>WgLaSDI: Weak-Form Greedy Latent Space Dynamics Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The parametric greedy latent space dynamics identification (gLaSDI) framework has demonstrated promising potential for accurate and efficient modeling of high-dimensional nonlinear physical systems. However, it remains challenging to handle noisy data. To enhance robustness against noise, we incorporate the weak-form estimation of nonlinear dynamics (WENDy) into gLaSDI. In the proposed weak-form gLaSDI (WgLaSDI) framework, an autoencoder and WENDy are trained simultaneously to discover intrinsic nonlinear latent-space dynamics of high-dimensional data. Compared to the standard sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) employed in gLaSDI, WENDy enables variance reduction and robust latent space discovery, therefore leading to more accurate and efficient reduced-order modeling. Furthermore, the greedy physics-informed active learning in WgLaSDI enables adaptive sampling of optimal training data on the fly for enhanced modeling accuracy. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated by modeling various nonlinear dynamical problems, including viscous and inviscid Burgers' equations, time-dependent radial advection, and the Vlasov equation for plasma physics. With data that contains 5-10% Gaussian white noise, WgLaSDI outperforms gLaSDI by orders of magnitude, achieving 1-7% relative errors. Compared with the high-fidelity models, WgLaSDI achieves 121 to 1,779x speed-up.</description>

      <title>Multicriteria Optimization and Decision Making: Principles, Algorithms and Case Studies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-world decision and optimization problems, often involve constraints and conflicting criteria. For example, choosing a travel method must balance speed, cost, environmental footprint, and convenience. Similarly, designing an industrial process must consider safety, environmental impact, and cost efficiency. Ideal solutions where all objectives are optimally met are rare; instead, we seek good compromises and aim to avoid lose-lose scenarios. Multicriteria optimization offers computational techniques to compute Pareto optimal solutions, aiding decision analysis and decision making. This reader offers an introduction to this topic and has been developed on the basis of the revised edition of the reader for the MSc computer science course "Multicriteria Optimization and Decision Analysis" at the Leiden Institute of Advanced Computer Science, Leiden University, The Netherlands. This course was taught annually by the first author from 2007 to 2023 as a single semester course with lectures and practicals. The introduction is organized in a unique didactic manner developed by the authors, starting from more simple concepts such as linear programming and single-point methods, and advancing from these to more difficult concepts such as optimality conditions for nonlinear optimization and set-oriented solution algorithms. Besides, we focus on the mathematical modeling and foundations rather than on specific algorithms, though not excluding the discussion of some representative examples of solution algorithms. Our aim was to make the material accessible to MSc students who do not study mathematics as their core discipline by introducing basic numerical analysis concepts when necessary and providing numerical examples for interesting cases.</description>

      <title>Forward and backward problems for coupled subdiffusion systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate both forward and backward problems for coupled systems of time-fractional diffusion equations, encompassing scenarios of strong coupling. For the forward problem, we establish the well-posedness of the system, leveraging the eigensystem of the corresponding elliptic system as the foundation. When considering the backward problem, specifically the determination of initial values through final time observations, we demonstrate a Lipschitz stability estimate, which is consist with the stability observed in the case of a single equation. To numerically address this backward problem, we refer to the explicit formulation of Tikhonov regularization to devise a multi-channel neural network architecture. This innovative architecture offers a versatile approach, exhibiting its efficacy in multidimensional settings through numerical examples and its robustness in handling initial values that have not been trained.</description>

      <title>NourishNet: Proactive Severity State Forecasting of Food Commodity Prices for Global Warning Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Price volatility in global food commodities is a critical signal indicating potential disruptions in the food market. Understanding forthcoming changes in these prices is essential for bolstering food security, particularly for nations at risk. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) previously developed sophisticated statistical frameworks for the proactive prediction of food commodity prices, aiding in the creation of global early warning systems. These frameworks utilize food security indicators to produce accurate forecasts, thereby facilitating preparations against potential food shortages. Our research builds on these foundations by integrating robust price security indicators with cutting-edge deep learning (DL) methodologies to reveal complex interdependencies. DL techniques examine intricate dynamics among diverse factors affecting food prices. Through sophisticated time-series forecasting models coupled with a classification model, our approach enhances existing models to better support communities worldwide in advancing their food security initiatives.</description>

      <title>Structured and Balanced Multi-component and Multi-layer Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a balanced multi-component and multi-layer neural network (MMNN) structure to approximate functions with complex features with both accuracy and efficiency in terms of degrees of freedom and computation cost. The main idea is motivated by a multi-component, each of which can be approximated effectively by a single-layer network, and multi-layer decomposition in a "divide-and-conquer" type of strategy to deal with a complex function. While an easy modification to fully connected neural networks (FCNNs) or multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) through the introduction of balanced multi-component structures in the network, MMNNs achieve a significant reduction of training parameters, a much more efficient training process, and a much improved accuracy compared to FCNNs or MLPs. Extensive numerical experiments are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of MMNNs in approximating high oscillatory functions and its automatic adaptivity in capturing localized features.</description>

      <title>Towards Faster Matrix Diagonalization with Graph Isomorphism Networks and the AlphaZero Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce innovative approaches for accelerating the Jacobi method for matrix diagonalization, specifically through the formulation of large matrix diagonalization as a Semi-Markov Decision Process and small matrix diagonalization as a Markov Decision Process. Furthermore, we examine the potential of utilizing scalable architecture between different-sized matrices. During a short training period, our method discovered a significant reduction in the number of steps required for diagonalization and exhibited efficient inference capabilities. Importantly, this approach demonstrated possible scalability to large-sized matrices, indicating its potential for wide-ranging applicability. Upon training completion, we obtain action-state probabilities and transition graphs, which depict transitions between different states. These outputs not only provide insights into the diagonalization process but also pave the way for cost savings pertinent to large-scale matrices. The advancements made in this research enhance the efficacy and scalability of matrix diagonalization, pushing for new possibilities for deployment in practical applications in scientific and engineering domains.</description>

      <title>Neurodevelopmental disorders modeling using isogeometric analysis, dynamic domain expansion and local refinement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) have arisen as one of the most prevailing chronic diseases within the US. Often associated with severe adverse impacts on the formation of vital central and peripheral nervous systems during the neurodevelopmental process, NDDs are comprised of a broad spectrum of disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and epilepsy, characterized by progressive and pervasive detriments to cognitive, speech, memory, motor, and other neurological functions in patients. However, the heterogeneous nature of NDDs poses a significant roadblock to identifying the exact pathogenesis, impeding accurate diagnosis and the development of targeted treatment planning. A computational NDDs model holds immense potential in enhancing our understanding of the multifaceted factors involved and could assist in identifying the root causes to expedite treatment development. To tackle this challenge, we introduce optimal neurotrophin concentration to the driving force and degradation of neurotrophin to the synaptogenesis process of a 2D phase field neuron growth model using isogeometric analysis to simulate neurite retraction and atrophy. The optimal neurotrophin concentration effectively captures the inverse relationship between neurotrophin levels and neurite survival, while its degradation regulates concentration levels. Leveraging dynamic domain expansion, the model efficiently expands the domain based on outgrowth patterns to minimize degrees of freedom. Based on truncated T-splines, our model simulates the evolving process of complex neurite structures by applying local refinement adaptively to the cell/neurite boundary. Furthermore, a thorough parameter investigation is conducted with detailed comparisons against neuron cell cultures in experiments, enhancing our fundamental understanding of the mechanisms underlying NDDs.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a reexamination of the research paper titled "Communication-Avoiding Parallel Algorithms for \proc{TRSM}" by Wicky et al. We focus on the communication bandwidth cost analysis presented in the original work and identify potential issues that require clarification or revision. The problem at hand is the need to address inconsistencies and miscalculations found in the analysis, particularly in the categorization of costs into three scenarios based on the relationship between matrix dimensions and processor count. Our findings contribute to the ongoing discourse in the field and pave the way for further improvements in this area of research.</description>

      <title>Relevance of the Basset history term for Lagrangian particle dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The movement of small but finite spherical particles in a fluid can be described by the Maxey-Riley equation (MRE) if they are too large to be considered passive tracers. The MRE contains an integral "history term" modeling wake effects, which causes the force acting on a particle at some given time to depend on its full past trajectory. The history term causes complications in the numerical solution of the MRE and is therefore often neglected, despite both numerical and experimental evidence that its effects are generally not negligible. By numerically computing trajectories with and without the history term of a large number of particles in different flow fields, we investigate its impact on the large-scale Lagrangian dynamics of simulated particles. We show that for moderate to large Stokes numbers, ignoring the history term leads to significant differences in clustering patterns. Furthermore, we compute finite-time Lyapunov exponents and show that, even for small particles, the differences in the resulting scalar field from ignoring the BHT can be significant, in particular if the underlying flow is turbulent.</description>

      <title>RIS: Regularized Imaging Spectroscopy for STIX on-board Solar Orbiter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Imaging spectroscopy, i.e., the generation of spatially resolved count spectra and of cubes of count maps at different energies, is one of the main goals of solar hard X-ray missions based on Fourier imaging. For these telescopes, so far imaging spectroscopy has been realized via the generation of either count maps independently reconstructed at the different energy channels, or electron flux maps reconstructed via deconvolution of the bremsstrahlung cross-section. Our aim is to introduce the Regularized Imaging Spectroscopy method (RIS), in which regularization implemented in the count space imposes a smoothing constraint across contiguous energy channels, without the need to deconvolve the bremsstrahlung effect. STIX records imaging data computing visibilities in the spatial frequency domain. Our RIS is a sequential scheme in which part of the information coded in the image reconstructed at a specific energy channel is transferred to the reconstruction process at a contiguous channel via visibility interpolation based on Variably Scaled Kernels. In the case of STIX visibilities recorded during the November 11, 2022 flaring event, we show that RIS is able to generate hard X-ray maps whose morphology smoothly evolves from one energy channel to the contiguous one, and that from these maps it is possible to infer spatially-resolved count spectra characterized by notable numerical stability. We also show that the performances of this approach are robust with respect to both the image reconstruction method and the count energy channel utilized to trigger the sequential process. RIS is appropriate to construct image cubes from STIX visibilities that are characterized by a smooth behavior across count energies, thus allowing the generation of numerically stable (and, thus, physically reliable) local count spectra.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the construction and usage of mimetic operators in curvilinear staggered grids. Specifically, we extend the Corbino-Castillo operators so they can be utilized to solve problems in non-trivial geometries. We prove that the resulting curvilinear operators satisfy the discrete analog of the extended Gauss-Divergence theorem. In addition, we demonstrate energy and mass conservation in curvilinear coordinates for the acoustic wave equation. These findings are illustrated in two-dimensional and three-dimensional elliptic/hyperbolic equations and can be extended to other partial differential equations as well.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Network as Computationally Efficient Emulator of Ice-sheet and Sea-level System Model (ISSM)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Ice-sheet and Sea-level System Model (ISSM) provides solutions for Stokes equations relevant to ice sheet dynamics by employing finite element and fine mesh adaption. However, since its finite element method is compatible only with Central Processing Units (CPU), the ISSM has limits on further economizing computational time. Thus, by taking advantage of Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), we design a graph convolutional network (GCN) as a fast emulator for ISSM. The GCN is trained and tested using the 20-year transient ISSM simulations in the Pine Island Glacier (PIG). The GCN reproduces ice thickness and velocity with a correlation coefficient greater than 0.998, outperforming the traditional convolutional neural network (CNN). Additionally, GCN shows 34 times faster computational speed than the CPU-based ISSM modeling. The GPU-based GCN emulator allows us to predict how the PIG will change in the future under different melting rate scenarios with high fidelity and much faster computational time.</description>

Abstract: In this contribution we study the formal ability of a multi-resolution-times lattice Boltzmann scheme to approximate isothermal and thermal compressible Navier Stokes equations with a single particle distribution. More precisely, we consider a total of 12 classical square lattice Boltzmann schemes with prescribed sets of conserved and nonconserved moments. The question is to determine the algebraic expressions of the equilibrium functions for the nonconserved moments and the relaxation parameters associated to each scheme. We compare the fluid equations and the result of the Taylor expansion method at second order accuracy for bidimensional examples with a maximum of 17 velocities and three-dimensional schemes with at most 33 velocities. In some cases, it is not possible to fit exactly the physical model. For several examples, we adjust the Navier Stokes equations and propose nontrivial expressions for the equilibria.</description>

Abstract: This article introduces continuous $H^2$-nonconforming finite elements in two and three space dimensions which satisfy a strong discrete Miranda--Talenti inequality in the sense that the global $L^2$ norm of the piecewise Hessian is bounded by the $L^2$ norm of the piecewise Laplacian. The construction is based on globally continuous finite element functions with $C^1$ continuity on the vertices (2D) or edges (3D). As an application, these finite elements are used to approximate uniformly elliptic equations in non-divergence form under the Cordes condition without additional stabilization terms. For the biharmonic equation in three dimensions, the proposed methods has less degrees of freedom than existing nonconforming schemes of the same order. Numerical results in two and three dimensions confirm the practical feasibility of the proposed schemes.</description>

      <title>Positivity-preserving and entropy-bounded discontinuous Galerkin method for the chemically reacting, compressible Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17637v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article concerns the development of a fully conservative, positivity-preserving, and entropy-bounded discontinuous Galerkin scheme for the multicomponent, chemically reacting, compressible Navier-Stokes equations with complex thermodynamics. In particular, we extend to viscous flows the fully conservative, positivity-preserving, and entropy-bounded discontinuous Galerkin method for the chemically reacting Euler equations that we previously introduced. An important component of the formulation is the positivity-preserving Lax-Friedrichs-type viscous flux function devised by Zhang [J. Comput. Phys., 328 (2017), pp. 301-343], which was adapted to multicomponent flows by Du and Yang [J. Comput. Phys., 469 (2022), pp. 111548] in a manner that treats the inviscid and viscous fluxes as a single flux. Here, we similarly extend the aforementioned flux function to multicomponent flows but separate the inviscid and viscous fluxes, resulting in a different dissipation coefficient. This separation of the fluxes allows for use of other inviscid flux functions, as well as enforcement of entropy boundedness on only the convective contribution to the evolved state, as motivated by physical and mathematical principles. We also detail how to account for boundary conditions and incorporate previously developed techniques to reduce spurious pressure oscillations into the positivity-preserving framework. Furthermore, potential issues associated with the Lax-Friedrichs-type viscous flux function in the case of zero species concentrations are discussed and addressed. The resulting formulation is compatible with curved, multidimensional elements and general quadrature rules with positive weights. A variety of multicomponent, viscous flows is computed, ranging from a one-dimensional shock tube problem to multidimensional detonation waves and shock/mixing-layer interaction.</description>

      <title>Structure-Preserving Discretization and Model Order Reduction of Boundary-Controlled 1D Port-Hamiltonian Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06425v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a systematic methodology for the discretization and reduction of a class of one-dimensional Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) with inputs and outputs collocated at the spatial boundaries. The class of system that we consider is known as Boundary-Controlled Port-Hamiltonian Systems (BC-PHSs) and covers a wide class of Hyperbolic PDEs with a large type of boundary inputs and outputs. This is, for instance, the case of waves and beams with Neumann, Dirichlet, or mixed boundary conditions. Based on a Partitioned Finite Element Method (PFEM), we develop a numerical scheme for the structure-preserving spatial discretization for the class of one-dimensional BC-PHSs. We show that if the initial PDE is passive (or impedance energy preserving), the discretized model also is. In addition and since the discretized model or Full Order Model (FOM) can be of large dimension, we recall the standard Loewner framework for the Model Order Reduction (MOR) using frequency domain interpolation. We recall the main steps to produce a Reduced Order Model (ROM) that approaches the FOM in a given range of frequencies. We summarize the steps to follow in order to obtain a ROM that preserves the passive structure as well. Finally, we provide a constructive way to build a projector that allows to recover the physical meaning of the state variables from the ROM to the FOM. We use the one-dimensional wave equation and the Timoshenko beam as examples to show the versatility of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Algorithms of constrained uniform approximation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16330v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the problem of the best uniform approximation of a continuous function on a convex domain. The approximation is by linear combinations of a finite system of functions (not necessarily Chebyshev) under arbitrary linear constraints. By modifying the concept of alternance and of the Remez iterative procedure we present a method, which demonstrates its efficiency in numerical problems. The linear rate of convergence is proved under some favourable assumptions. A special attention is paid to systems of complex exponents, Gaussian functions, lacunar algebraic and trigonometric polynomials. Applications to signal processing, linear ODE, switching dynamical systems, and to Markov-Bernstein type inequalities are considered.</description>

      <title>Irrational-window-filter projection method and application to quasiperiodic Schr\"odinger eigenproblems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04507v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new algorithm, the irrational-window-filter projection method (IWFPM), for solving arbitrary dimensional global quasiperiodic systems. Based on the projection method (PM), IWFPM further utilizes the concentrated distribution of Fourier coefficients to filter out relevant spectral points using an irrational window. Moreover, a corresponding index-shift transform is designed to make the Fast Fourier Transform available. The corresponding error analysis on the function approximation level is also given. We apply IWFPM to 1D, 2D, and 3D quasiperiodic Schr\"odinger eigenproblems to demonstrate its accuracy and efficiency. IWFPM exhibits a significant computational advantage over PM for both extended and localized quantum states. Furthermore, the widespread existence of such spectral point distribution feature can endow IWFPM with significant potential for broader applications in quasiperiodic systems.</description>

      <title>An adaptive Euler-Maruyama scheme for SDDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10244v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes an adaptive numerical method for stochastic delay differential equations (SDDEs) with a non-global Lipschitz drift term and a non-constant delay, building upon the work of Wei Fang and others. The method adapts the step size based on the growth of the drift term. Differing slightly from the conventional Euler-Maruyama format, this paper addresses the estimation of the delay term by substituting it with the numerically obtained solution closest to the left endpoint.This approach overcomes the challenge of numerical nodes not falling within the nodes after subtracting the delay. The paper proves the convergence of the numerical method for a class of non-global Lipschitz continuous SDDEs under the assumption that the step size function satisfies certain conditions.</description>

      <title>An extension of the low-rank Lyapunov ADI to non-zero initial values and its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13477v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive the Alternating-Direction Implicit (ADI) method based on a commuting operator split and apply the results to the continuous time algebraic Lyapunov equation with low-rank constant term and approximate solution. Previously, it has been mandatory to start the low-rank ADI (LR-ADI) with an all-zero initial value. Our approach retains the known efficient iteration schemes of low-rank increments and residual to arbitrary low-rank initial values for the LR-ADI method. We further generalize some of the known properties of the LR-ADI for Lyapunov equations to larger classes of algorithms or problems.
  We investigate the performance of arbitrary initial values using two outer iterations in which LR-ADI is typically called. First, we solve an algebraic Riccati equation with the Newton method. Second, we solve a differential Riccati equation with a first-order Rosenbrock method. Numerical experiments confirm that the proposed new initial value of the alternating-directions implicit (ADI) can lead to a significant reduction in the total number of ADI steps, while also showing a 17% and 8x speed-up over the zero initial value for the two equation types, respectively.</description>

Abstract: We present a simple formula to update the pseudoinverse of a full-rank rectangular matrix that undergoes a low-rank modification, and demonstrate its utility for solving least squares problems. The resulting algorithm can be dramatically faster than solving the modified least squares problem from scratch, just like the speedup enabled by Sherman--Morrison--Woodbury for solving linear systems with low-rank modifications.</description>

      <title>Complexity-optimal and parameter-free first-order methods for finding stationary points of composite optimization problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.13055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.13055v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper develops and analyzes an accelerated proximal descent method for finding stationary points of nonconvex composite optimization problems. The objective function is of the form $f+h$ where $h$ is a proper closed convex function, $f$ is a differentiable function on the domain of $h$, and $\nabla f$ is Lipschitz continuous on the domain of $h$. The main advantage of this method is that it is "parameter-free" in the sense that it does not require knowledge of the Lipschitz constant of $\nabla f$ or of any global topological properties of $f$. It is shown that the proposed method can obtain an $\varepsilon$-approximate stationary point with iteration complexity bounds that are optimal, up to logarithmic terms over $\varepsilon$, in both the convex and nonconvex settings. Some discussion is also given about how the proposed method can be leveraged in other existing optimization frameworks, such as min-max smoothing and penalty frameworks for constrained programming, to create more specialized parameter-free methods. Finally, numerical experiments are presented to support the practical viability of the method.</description>

      <title>Langevin dynamics based algorithm e-TH$\varepsilon$O POULA for stochastic optimization problems with discontinuous stochastic gradient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.13193v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new Langevin dynamics based algorithm, called e-TH$\varepsilon$O POULA, to solve optimization problems with discontinuous stochastic gradients which naturally appear in real-world applications such as quantile estimation, vector quantization, CVaR minimization, and regularized optimization problems involving ReLU neural networks. We demonstrate both theoretically and numerically the applicability of the e-TH$\varepsilon$O POULA algorithm. More precisely, under the conditions that the stochastic gradient is locally Lipschitz in average and satisfies a certain convexity at infinity condition, we establish non-asymptotic error bounds for e-TH$\varepsilon$O POULA in Wasserstein distances and provide a non-asymptotic estimate for the expected excess risk, which can be controlled to be arbitrarily small. Three key applications in finance and insurance are provided, namely, multi-period portfolio optimization, transfer learning in multi-period portfolio optimization, and insurance claim prediction, which involve neural networks with (Leaky)-ReLU activation functions. Numerical experiments conducted using real-world datasets illustrate the superior empirical performance of e-TH$\varepsilon$O POULA compared to SGLD, TUSLA, ADAM, and AMSGrad in terms of model accuracy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.13781v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work is concerned with fractional Gaussian fields, i.e. Gaussian fields whose covariance operator is given by the inverse fractional Laplacian $(-\Delta)^{-s}$ (where, in particular, we include the case $s &gt;1$). We define a lattice discretization of these fields and show that their scaling limits -- with respect to the optimal Besov space topology (up to an endpoint case) -- are the original continuous fields. As a byproduct, in dimension $d&lt;2s$, we prove the convergence in distribution of the maximum of the fields. A key tool in the proof is a sharp error estimate for the natural finite difference scheme for $(-\Delta)^s$ under minimal regularity assumptions, which is also of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Inverse Evolution Layers: Physics-informed Regularizers for Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.07344v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditional image processing methods employing partial differential equations (PDEs) offer a multitude of meaningful regularizers, along with valuable theoretical foundations for a wide range of image-related tasks. This makes their integration into neural networks a promising avenue. In this paper, we introduce a novel regularization approach inspired by the reverse process of PDE-based evolution models. Specifically, we propose inverse evolution layers (IELs), which serve as bad property amplifiers to penalize neural networks of which outputs have undesired characteristics. Using IELs, one can achieve specific regularization objectives and endow neural networks' outputs with corresponding properties of the PDE models. Our experiments, focusing on semantic segmentation tasks using heat-diffusion IELs, demonstrate their effectiveness in mitigating noisy label effects. Additionally, we develop curve-motion IELs to enforce convex shape regularization in neural network-based segmentation models for preventing the generation of concave outputs. Theoretical analysis confirms the efficacy of IELs as an effective regularization mechanism, particularly in handling training with label issues.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Boundary Integral Networks (PIBI-Nets): A Data-Driven Approach for Solving Partial Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.09571v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) are widely used to describe relevant phenomena in dynamical systems. In real-world applications, we commonly need to combine formal PDE models with (potentially noisy) observations. This is especially relevant in settings where we lack information about boundary or initial conditions, or where we need to identify unknown model parameters. In recent years, Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have become a popular tool for this kind of problems. In high-dimensional settings, however, PINNs often suffer from computational problems because they usually require dense collocation points over the entire computational domain. To address this problem, we present Physics-Informed Boundary Integral Networks (PIBI-Nets) as a data-driven approach for solving PDEs in one dimension less than the original problem space. PIBI-Nets only require points at the computational domain boundary, while still achieving highly accurate results. Moreover, PIBI-Nets clearly outperform PINNs in several practical settings. Exploiting elementary properties of fundamental solutions of linear differential operators, we present a principled and simple way to handle point sources in inverse problems. We demonstrate the excellent performance of PIBI- Nets for the Laplace and Poisson equations, both on artificial datasets and within a real-world application concerning the reconstruction of groundwater flows.</description>

Abstract: We consider the problem of performing Bayesian inference for logistic regression using appropriate extensions of the ensemble Kalman filter. Two interacting particle systems are proposed that sample from an approximate posterior and prove quantitative convergence rates of these interacting particle systems to their mean-field limit as the number of particles tends to infinity. Furthermore, we apply these techniques and examine their effectiveness as methods of Bayesian approximation for quantifying predictive uncertainty in neural networks.</description>

      <title>Improved Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) formulation with multiple root nodes for discrete sizing optimization of truss structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.06045v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a new method for discrete optimum design of truss structures utilizing Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) with update process, the best reward, accelerating technique, and terminal condition. An improved MCTS formulation with multiple root nodes is developed in this study. Update process means that once a final solution is found, it is used as the initial solution for next search tree. The best reward is used in the backpropagation step. Accelerating technique is introduced by decreasing the width of search tree and reducing maximum number of iterations. The agent is trained to minimize the total structural weight under various constraints until the terminal condition is satisfied. Then, optimal solution is the minimum value of all solutions found by search trees. These numerical examples show that the agent can find optimal solution with low computational cost, stably produces an optimal design, and is suitable for practical engineering problems.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Optimal Control Matching</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02027v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stochastic optimal control, which has the goal of driving the behavior of noisy systems, is broadly applicable in science, engineering and artificial intelligence. Our work introduces Stochastic Optimal Control Matching (SOCM), a novel Iterative Diffusion Optimization (IDO) technique for stochastic optimal control that stems from the same philosophy as the conditional score matching loss for diffusion models. That is, the control is learned via a least squares problem by trying to fit a matching vector field. The training loss, which is closely connected to the cross-entropy loss, is optimized with respect to both the control function and a family of reparameterization matrices which appear in the matching vector field. The optimization with respect to the reparameterization matrices aims at minimizing the variance of the matching vector field. Experimentally, our algorithm achieves lower error than all the existing IDO techniques for stochastic optimal control for three out of four control problems, in some cases by an order of magnitude. The key idea underlying SOCM is the path-wise reparameterization trick, a novel technique that may be of independent interest. Code at https://github.com/facebookresearch/SOC-matching</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03180v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, the concept of Braced Fourier Continuation and Regression (BFCR) is introduced. BFCR is a novel and computationally efficient means of finding nonlinear regressions or trend lines in arbitrary one-dimensional data sets. The Braced Fourier Continuation (BFC) and BFCR algorithms are first outlined, followed by a discussion of the properties of BFCR as well as demonstrations of how BFCR trend lines may be used effectively for anomaly detection both within and at the edges of arbitrary one-dimensional data sets. Finally, potential issues which may arise while using BFCR for anomaly detection as well as possible mitigation techniques are outlined and discussed. All source code and example data sets are either referenced or available via GitHub, and all associated code is written entirely in Python.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13390v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kernel learning forward backward SDE filter is an iterative and adaptive meshfree approach to solve the nonlinear filtering problem. It builds from forward backward SDE for Fokker-Planker equation, which defines evolving density for the state variable, and employs KDE to approximate density. This algorithm has shown more superior performance than mainstream particle filter method, in both convergence speed and efficiency of solving high dimension problems.
  However, this method has only been shown to converge empirically. In this paper, we present a rigorous analysis to demonstrate its local and global convergence, and provide theoretical support for its empirical results.</description>

      <title>Learning the boundary-to-domain mapping using Lifting Product Fourier Neural Operators for partial differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16740v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural operators such as the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) have been shown to provide resolution-independent deep learning models that can learn mappings between function spaces. For example, an initial condition can be mapped to the solution of a partial differential equation (PDE) at a future time-step using a neural operator. Despite the popularity of neural operators, their use to predict solution functions over a domain given only data over the boundary (such as a spatially varying Dirichlet boundary condition) remains unexplored. In this paper, we refer to such problems as boundary-to-domain problems; they have a wide range of applications in areas such as fluid mechanics, solid mechanics, heat transfer etc. We present a novel FNO-based architecture, named Lifting Product FNO (or LP-FNO) which can map arbitrary boundary functions defined on the lower-dimensional boundary to a solution in the entire domain. Specifically, two FNOs defined on the lower-dimensional boundary are lifted into the higher dimensional domain using our proposed lifting product layer. We demonstrate the efficacy and resolution independence of the proposed LP-FNO for the 2D Poisson equation.</description>
