      <title>Gate tunable Dirac mass and Berry phase in Trilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In-situ control over band mass inversion is crucial for developing materials with topologically protected edge modes. In this Letter, we report the direct observation of displacement field $D$ control of band mass and Berry phase in Bernal stacked trilayer graphene (TLG) in the region where trigonal warping distorts the quadratic band into off-center Dirac points, referred to as `Dirac Gullies.' Using Shubnikov-de-Haas (SdH) oscillations, we map the Fermi surface contours of the Dirac gullies and the $D$-dependent band structure. With increasing $D$-field, the Berry phase undergoes multiple transitions from $\Phi_B=2\pi$ $\rightarrow$ $\pi$ $\rightarrow$ $2\pi$ as $D$ is varied. Concurrently, measurement of the effective mass reveals a series of transitions between massless and massive bands, signaling the closure and reopening (accompanied by a possible band inversion) of the band gap at a critical value of $D$. Interestingly, the expected Dirac-like behavior of the Dirac gullies ($\Phi_B=\pi$) persists only over a narrow range of $D$. Our study directly confirms recent predictions of $ D$-field-induced band inversion in the low-energy regions of TLG. It is a significant step towards achieving control over pure valley transport in multilayer graphene.</description>

      <title>RFSoC-based radio-frequency reflectometry in gate-defined bilayer graphene quantum devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computers require both scalability and high performance for practical applications. While semiconductor quantum dots are promising candidates for quantum bits, the complexity of measurement setups poses an important challenge for scaling up these devices. Here, radio-frequency system-on-chip (RFSoC) technology is exepcted for a promising approach that combines scalability with flexibility. In this paper, we demonstrate RF reflectometry in gate-defined bilayer graphene quantum devices using RFSoC-based measurement architecture. By controlling the confinement strength through gate voltages, we achieve both Fabry-P\'erot interferometer and quantum dot operations in a single device. Although impedance matching conditions currently limit the measurement sensitivity, we identify pathways for optimization through tunnel barrier engineering and resonator design. These results represent a step toward integrating high-bandwidth measurements with scalable quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Sign Changes in Heat, Spin, and Orbital Magnon Transport Coefficients in Kitaev Ferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Both Kitaev and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions (DMI) are known to promote intrinsic contributions to the magnon Hall effects such as the thermal Hall and the spin Nernst effects in collinear magnets. Previously, it was reported that a sign change in those transversal transport coefficients only appears in the presence of Kitaev interaction, but not for DMI, which qualitatively distinguishes both kinds of spin-anisotropic interactions in ferromagnets. Herein, we systematically study how the magnon-mediated heat, spin, and orbital transport in longitudinal and transverse geometries evolves with a continuously varying Kitaev-to-DMI ratio, but a fixed magnon band structure. We show that several transport coefficients feature temperature-driven sign changes in the presence of Kitaev interaction, which are absent for DMI. In particular, we find a sign change in longitudinal orbital transport, the magnon orbital Seebeck effect, which is absent in the transverse geometry, the magnon orbital Nernst effect. This sets the orbital transport apart from the heat and spin transport, where we only find sign changes promoted by the Kitaev interaction in transverse, but not in the longitudinal geometry.</description>

      <title>Cavity QED Control of Quantum Hall Stripes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling quantum phases of materials with vacuum field fluctuations in engineered cavities is a novel route towards the optical control of emergent phenomena. We demonstrate, using magnetotransport measurements of a high-mobility two-dimensional electron gas, striking cavity-induced anisotropies in the electronic transport, including the suppression of the longitudinal resistance well below the resistivity at zero magnetic field. Our cavity-induced effects occur at ultra-low temperatures (&lt; 200 mK) when the magnetic field lies between quantized Hall plateaus. We interpret our results as arising from the stabilization of thermally-disordered quantum Hall stripes. Our work presents a clear demonstration of the cavity QED control of a correlated electronic phase.</description>

      <title>Quantifying hydrogen bonding using electrically tunable nanoconfined water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrogen bonding plays a crucial role in biology and technology, yet it remains poorly understood and quantified despite its fundamental importance. Traditional models, which describe hydrogen bonds as electrostatic interactions between electropositive hydrogen and electronegative acceptors, fail to quantitatively capture bond strength, directionality, or cooperativity, and cannot predict the properties of complex hydrogen-bonded materials. Here, we introduce a novel approach that conceptualizes the effect of hydrogen bonds as elastic dipoles in an electric field, which captures a wide range of hydrogen bonding phenomena in various water systems. Using gypsum, a hydrogen bond heterostructure with two-dimensional structural crystalline water, we calibrate the hydrogen bond strength through an externally applied electric field. We show that our approach quantifies the strength of hydrogen bonds directly from spectroscopic measurements and reproduces a wide range of key properties of confined water reported in the literature. Using only the stretching vibration frequency of confined water, we can predict hydrogen bond strength, local electric field, O-H bond length, and dipole moment. Our work also introduces hydrogen bond heterostructures - a new class of electrically and chemically tunable materials that offer stronger, more directional bonding compared to van der Waals heterostructures, with potential applications in areas such as catalysis, separation, and energy storage.</description>

      <title>Analytical solution for the relaxed atomic configuration of twisted bilayer graphene including heterostrain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continuum atomic relaxation models for twisted bilayer graphene involve minimization of the sum of intralayer elastic energy and interlayer adhesion energy. The elastic energy favors a rigid twist i.e. no distortion in the twisted honeycomb lattices, while the adhesion energy favors Bernal stacking and breaking the relaxation into triangular AB and BA stacked domains. We compare the results of two relaxation models with the published Bragg interferometry data, finding good agreement with one of the models. We then provide a method for finding a highly accurate approximation to the solution of this model which holds above the twist angle of $\approx0.7^\circ$ and thus covers the first magic angle. We find closed form expressions in the absence, as well as in the presence, of external heterostrain. These expressions are not written as a Taylor series in the ratio of adhesion and elastic energy, because, as we show, the radius of convergence of such a series is too small to access the first magic angle.</description>

      <title>Single monolayer ferromagnetic perovskite SrRuO3 with high conductivity and strong ferromagnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Achieving robust ferromagnetism and high conductivity in atomically thin oxide materials is critical for advancing spintronic technologies. Here, we report the growth of a highly conductive and ferromagnetic single monolayer SrRuO3 having a high Curie temperature of 154 K on DyScO3 110 substrates. The SrTiO3 capping layer effectively suppresses surface reactions, which typically hinder ferromagnetism in atomically thin films. X ray absorption spectroscopy and X ray magnetic circular dichroism measurements revealed strong orbital hybridization between Ru 4d and O 2p orbitals in the SRO monolayer, which contributes to enhancement of the conductivity and ferromagnetic ordering of both the Ru 4d and O 2p orbitals. The resistivity of the single monolayer SrRuO3 on the better lattice matched DyScO3 substrate is approximately one-third of that of previously reported single monolayer SrRuO3 grown on an SrTiO3 substrate. This study highlights the potential of monolayer SrRuO3 as a platform for two dimensional magnetic oxide systems, offering new opportunities for the eploration of spintronic devices and quantum transport phenomena.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Exchange Spin Model to Investigate the Curie Temperature Dispersion of Finite-Size L10-FePt Magnetic Nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We developed an anisotropic spin model that accounts for magnetic anisotropy and evaluated the Curie temperature (Tc) dispersion due to finite size effects in L10-FePt nanoparticles. In heat-assisted magnetic recording (HAMR) media, a next-generation magnetic recording technology, high-density recording is achieved by locally heating L10-FePt nanoparticles near their Tc and rapidly cooling them. However, variations in Tc caused by differences in particle size and shape can compromise recording stability and areal density capacity, making the control of Tc dispersion critical. In this study, we constructed atomistic LLG models to explicitly incorporate the spin exchange anisotropy of L10-FePt, based on parameters determined by first-principles calculations. Using this model, we evaluated the impact of particle size on Tc dispersion. As a result, (1) the Tc dispersion critical to the performance of HAMR can be reproduced, whereas it was previously underestimated by isotropic models and (2) approximately 70% of the experimentally observed Tc dispersion can be attributed to particle size effects. This research highlights the role of exchange anisotropy in amplifying finite-size effects and underscores the importance of size control in HAMR media.</description>

      <title>Ultra-Stable Ferrimagnetic Second-Order Topological Insulator in 2D Metal-Organic Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) magnetic second-order topological insulators (SOTIs) exhibit distinct topological phases characterized by spin-polarized zero-dimensional (0D) corner states, which have garnered significant interest. However, 2D ferrimagnetic (FiM) SOTIs, particularly those that simultaneously exhibit ultra-stable corner states, are still lacking. Here, based on first-principles calculations and theoretical analysis, we reveal such SOTI state in a 2D metal-organic framework (MOF) material, Cr(pyz)2 (pyz = pyrazine). This material exhibits FiM ground state with an easy axis aligned along [001] direction. It hosts a nontrivial real Chern number in the spin-up channel, enabled by PT symmetry, with 0D corner states observable in disk. In contrast, the spin-down channel exhibits a trivial gapped bulk state. Notably, the topological corner states in monolayer Cr(pyz)2 show high robustness, even if the symmetries are broken by introducing defects, the corner states persist. We also considered other external perturbations, including uniaxial/biaxial strain, ligand rotation, and electric fields, the corner states still remain stable. Even more, the energy positions of the corner states are also nearly unchanged. This work is the first to identify ultra-stable FiM SOTI state in the MOF system, and provide an ideal platform for future experimental investigations and applications in spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional fully-compensated Ferrimagnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Antiferromagnetic spintronics has long been a subject of intense research interest, and the recent introduction of altermagnetism has further ignited enthusiasm in the field. However, fully-compensated ferrimagnetism, which exhibits band spin splitting but zero net magnetization, has yet to receive enough attention. Since the experimental preparation of two-dimensional (2D) magnetic van der Waals (vdW) materials in 2017, 2D magnetic materials, thanks to their super tunability, have quickly become an important playground for spintronics. Here, we extend the concept of fully-compensated ferrimagnetism (fFIM) to two dimensions and propose 2D \textit{filling-enforced} fFIM, demonstrate its stability and ease of manipulation, and present three feasible realization schemes with respective exemplary candidate materials. A simple model for 2D fully-compensated ferrimagnets (fFIMs) is developed. Further investigation of 2D fFIMs' physical properties reveals that they not only exhibit significant magneto-optical response but also show fully spin-polarized currents and the anomalous Hall effect in the half-metallic states, displaying characteristics previously almost exclusive to ferromagnetic materials, greatly broadening the research and application prospects of spintronic materials.</description>

      <title>Learning Chern Numbers of Topological Insulators with Gauge Equivariant Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Equivariant network architectures are a well-established tool for predicting invariant or equivariant quantities. However, almost all learning problems considered in this context feature a global symmetry, i.e. each point of the underlying space is transformed with the same group element, as opposed to a local ``gauge'' symmetry, where each point is transformed with a different group element, exponentially enlarging the size of the symmetry group. Gauge equivariant networks have so far mainly been applied to problems in quantum chromodynamics. Here, we introduce a novel application domain for gauge-equivariant networks in the theory of topological condensed matter physics. We use gauge equivariant networks to predict topological invariants (Chern numbers) of multiband topological insulators. The gauge symmetry of the network guarantees that the predicted quantity is a topological invariant. We introduce a novel gauge equivariant normalization layer to stabilize the training and prove a universal approximation theorem for our setup. We train on samples with trivial Chern number only but show that our models generalize to samples with non-trivial Chern number. We provide various ablations of our setup. Our code is available at https://github.com/sitronsea/GENet/tree/main.</description>

      <title>Superconducting phenomena in systems with unconventional magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we review the recent advances on superconducting phenomena in junctions formed by superconductors and unconventional magnets. Conventional magnets, such as ferromagnets and antiferromagnets, are characterized by broken time-reversal symmetry but only ferromagnets produce a finite net magnetization due to parallel spin alignment and spin-split bands in momentum. Very recently, a new type of magnets have been reported and here we refer to them as \emph{unconventional magnets} because they exhibit special properties of both ferromagnets and antiferromagnets: they exhibit zero net magnetization (like antiferromagnets) and a nonrelativistic spin splitting of energy bands (like ferromagnets), both leading to anisotropic spin-polarized Fermi surfaces. An interesting property of unconventional magnets is that their magnetic order can be even or odd with respect to momentum, where \emph{$d$-wave altermagnets} and \emph{$p$-wave magnets} are the most representative examples. In this regard, $d$-wave altermagnetism and $p$-wave magnets are seen as counterparts in magnetism of the unconventional $d$-wave and $p$-wave superconducting states, respectively. While the impact of conventional magnetism on superconductivity has been largely studied, the combination of unconventional magnets and superconductivity has only lately attracted considerably attention. This work provides a comprehensive review of the recent progress on the interplay between superconductivity and unconventional magnets. In particular, we focus on the fundamental emerging superconducting phenomena and also discuss the potential implications towards quantum applications.</description>

      <title>Interaction of dopants with the I$_3$-type basal stacking fault in hexagonal-diamond Si</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently synthesized hexagonal-diamond silicon, germanium, and silicon-germanium nanowires exhibit remarkable optical and electronic properties when compared to cubic-diamond polytypes. Because of the metastability of the hexagonal-diamond phase, I$_3$-type basal stacking faults are frequently observed in these materials. In the present study, we employ density functional theory calculations to investigate the interaction of extrinsic dopants (group III, IV, and V elements) with the I$_3$-type basal stacking fault in hexagonal-diamond silicon. Contrary to the behavior observed in cubic-diamond silicon with intrinsic stacking faults, we demonstrate that neutral and negatively charged $p$-type impurities exhibit a marked tendency to occupy lattice sites far from the I$_3$-type basal stacking fault. The interaction of acceptors with the planar defect reduces their energetic stability. However, this effect is much less pronounced for neutral or positively charged $n$-type dopants and isovalent impurities. The thermodynamic energy barrier to segregation for these dopants is small and may even become negative, indicating a tendency to segregate into the fault. Through a detailed analysis of structural modifications, ionization effects, and impurity-level charge density distribution, we show that the origin of this behavior can be attributed to variations in the impurity's steric effects and its wave function character. Finally, all these results are validated by considering the extreme case of an abrupt hexagonal/cubic silicon interface, where acceptor segregation from the cubic to the hexagonal region is demonstrated, confirming the behavior observed for $p$-type dopants near to the I$_3$-type defect.</description>

      <title>Dual topological insulator with mirror symmetry protected helical edge states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15869v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dual topological insulators (DTIs) are simultaneously protected by time-reversal and crystal symmetries, representing advantageous alternatives to conventional topological insulators. By combining ab initio calculations and the $\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{p}$ approach, here, we investigate the electronic band structure of a Na$_2$CdSn triatomic layer and derive a low-energy $4\times 4$ effective model consistent with all the symmetries of this material class. We obtain the effective Hamiltonian using the L\"owdin perturbation theory, the folding-down technique, and the theory of invariants and determine its parameters by fitting our analytical dispersion relations to those of ab initio calculations. We then calculate the bulk topological invariants of the system and show that the Na$_2$CdSn triatomic layer is a giant-gap (hundreds of millielectronvolts) quasi-two-dimensional DTI characterized by both spin and mirror Chern numbers $-2$. In agreement with the bulk-boundary correspondence theorem, we find that a finite-width strip of Na$_2$CdSn possesses two pairs of counterpropagating helical edge states per interface. We obtain analytical expressions for the edge state energy dispersions and wave functions, which are shown to agree with our numerical calculations. Our work opens an avenue for further studies of Na$_2$CdSn as a potential DTI candidate with room-temperature applications in areas of technological interest, such as nanoelectronics and spintronics.</description>

      <title>Majorana-metal transition in a disordered superconductor: percolation in a landscape of topological domain walls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17076v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most superconductors are thermal insulators. A disordered chiral $\textit{p}$-wave superconductor, however, can make a transition to a thermal metal phase. Because heat is then transported by Majorana fermions, this phase is referred to as a Majorana metal. Here we present numerical evidence that the mechanism for the phase transition with increasing electrostatic disorder is the percolation of boundaries separating domains of different Chern number. We construct the network of domain walls using the spectral localizer as a ``topological landscape function'', and obtain the thermal metal--insulator phase diagram from the percolation transition.</description>

      <title>Magnetic response of topological insulator layer with metamaterial substrate induced by an electric point source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09103v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological insulators (TIs) are materials with unique surface conductive properties that distinguish them from normal insulators and have attracted significant interest due to their potential applications in electronics and spintronics. However, their weak magnetic field response in traditional setups has limited their practical applications. Here, we show that integrating TIs with active metamaterial substrates can significantly enhance the induced magnetic field by more than $10^4$ times. Our results demonstrate that selecting specific permittivity and permeability values for the active metamaterial substrate optimizes the magnetic field at the interface between the TI layer and the metamaterial, extending it into free space. This represents a substantial improvement over previous methods, where the magnetic field decayed rapidly. The findings reveal that the TI-metamaterial approach enhances the magnetic field response, unveiling new aspects of TI electromagnetic behavior and suggesting novel pathways for developing materials with tailored electromagnetic properties. The integration of metamaterials with TIs offers promising opportunities for advancements in materials science and various technological applications. Overall, our study provides a practical and effective approach to exploring the unique magnetic field responses of TIs, potentially benefiting other complex material systems.</description>

      <title>Fundamentals and applications of Van der Waals magnets in magnon spintronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14979v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spintronics is concerned with replacing charge current with current of spin, the electron's intrinsic angular momentum. In magnetic insulators, spin currents are carried by magnons, the quanta of spin-wave excitations on top of the magnetically ordered state. Magnon spin currents are especially promising for information technology due to their low intrinsic damping, non-reciprocal transport, micrometer wavelengths at microwave frequencies, and strong interactions that enable signal transduction. In this perspective, we give our view on the progress and challenges towards realizing magnon spintronics based on atomically thin Van der Waals magnets, a recently discovered class of magnetic materials of which the tunability and versatility has attracted a great deal of ongoing research.</description>

      <title>Parafermions in Moir\'e Minibands</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08546v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Moir\'e materials provide a remarkably tunable platform for topological and strongly correlated quantum phases of matter. Very recently, the first zero field Abelian fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) have been experimentally demonstrated and it has been theoretically predicted that non-Abelian states with Majorana fermion excitations may be realized in the nearly dispersionless minibands of these systems. Here we provide telltale evidence in terms of low-energy quantum numbers, spectral flow and entanglement spectra for the even more exotic possibility of moir\'e-based non-Abelian FCIs exhibiting Fibonacci parafermion excitations.</description>

      <title>Anomalous shot noise in a bad metal beta-tantalum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18349v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the electronic shot noise produced by nanowires of $\beta$-Ta, an archetypal ``bad" metal with resistivity near the Ioffe-Regel localization limit. The Fano factor characterizing the shot noise exhibits a strong dependence on temperature and is suppressed compared to the expectations for quasiparticle diffusion, but hopping transport is ruled out by the analysis of scaling with the nanowire length. These anomalous behaviors closely resemble those of strange metal nanowires, suggesting that $\beta$-Ta may host a correlated electron liquid. This material provides an accessible platform for exploring exotic electronic states of matter.</description>

      <title>Magneto-optical evidence of tilting effect in coupled Weyl bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17081v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Theories have revealed the universality of the band tilting effect in topological Weyl semimetals (WSMs) and its implications for the material's physical properties. However, the experimental identification of tilted Weyl bands remains much less explored. Here, by combining magneto-infrared optical studies with a four-band coupled Weyl point model, we report spectroscopic evidence of the tilting effect in the well-established WSM niobium phosphide. Specifically, we observe Landau level transitions with rich features that are well reproduced within a model of coupled tilted Weyl points. Our analysis indicates that the tilting effect relaxes the selection rules and gives rise to transitions that would otherwise be forbidden in the non-tilt case. Additionally, we observe unconventional interband transitions with flat and negative magnetic field dispersions, highlighting the importance of coupling between Weyl points. Our results not only emphasize the significance of the tilting effect in the optical responses of WSMs but also demonstrate magneto-optics as an effective tool for probing the tilting effect in electronic band structures.</description>

      <title>Non-Abelian interlayer coherent fractional quantum Hall states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06041v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study non-Abelian fractional quantum Hall state in double layer systems at total filling factor $1/2$. Recent progresses in two-dimensional van der Waals materials made it possible to explore the regime with very small interlayer distance. Numerical calculations suggests interlayer phase coherence can develop between the layers such that the electrons may redistribute between them without changing the Hall response. It corresponds to spontaneous breaking of the U(1) symmetry associated with the particle number difference in the layers. This state manifests itself as superfluid in counterflow measurement and has characteristic Hall response when current is passed through one layer and voltages in both layers are measured. As the interlayer distance increases, a phase transition to the Halperin 331 state occurs. We also discuss similar physics for bosonic systems with specially designed interactions.</description>
