      <title>Large Empirical Case Study: Go-Explore adapted for AI Red Team Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Production LLM agents with tool-using capabilities require security testing despite their safety training. We adapt Go-Explore to evaluate GPT-4o-mini across 28 experimental runs spanning six research questions. We find that random-seed variance dominates algorithmic parameters, yielding an 8x spread in outcomes; single-seed comparisons are unreliable, while multi-seed averaging materially reduces variance in our setup. Reward shaping consistently harms performance, causing exploration collapse in 94% of runs or producing 18 false positives with zero verified attacks. In our environment, simple state signatures outperform complex ones. For comprehensive security testing, ensembles provide attack-type diversity, whereas single agents optimize coverage within a given attack type. Overall, these results suggest that seed variance and targeted domain knowledge can outweigh algorithmic sophistication when testing safety-trained models.</description>

      <title>Overlooked Safety Vulnerability in LLMs: Malicious Intelligent Optimization Algorithm Request and its Jailbreak</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The widespread deployment of large language models (LLMs) has raised growing concerns about their misuse risks and associated safety issues. While prior studies have examined the safety of LLMs in general usage, code generation, and agent-based applications, their vulnerabilities in automated algorithm design remain underexplored. To fill this gap, this study investigates this overlooked safety vulnerability, with a particular focus on intelligent optimization algorithm design, given its prevalent use in complex decision-making scenarios. We introduce MalOptBench, a benchmark consisting of 60 malicious optimization algorithm requests, and propose MOBjailbreak, a jailbreak method tailored for this scenario. Through extensive evaluation of 13 mainstream LLMs including the latest GPT-5 and DeepSeek-V3.1, we reveal that most models remain highly susceptible to such attacks, with an average attack success rate of 83.59% and an average harmfulness score of 4.28 out of 5 on original harmful prompts, and near-complete failure under MOBjailbreak. Furthermore, we assess state-of-the-art plug-and-play defenses that can be applied to closed-source models, and find that they are only marginally effective against MOBjailbreak and prone to exaggerated safety behaviors. These findings highlight the urgent need for stronger alignment techniques to safeguard LLMs against misuse in algorithm design.</description>

      <title>Evolution of Android's Permission-based Security Model and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Android Permission Model and Application (app) analysis has consistently remained the focus of the investigation of research groups and stakeholders of the Android ecosystem since it was launched in 2008. Even though the Android smartphone operating system (OS) permission model has evolved significantly from `all-or-none access' to `user-chosen dangerous resource access', specific challenges and issues remain unresolved even after 15 years after the smartphone OS launch. This study addresses the issues and documents the research work in this arena through a comprehensive literature survey and comparative analysis.
  The survey's focal point is the Android permission model and relevant research between 2010-2022. We systematize the knowledge on (i) Android API Calls to permissions mapping, (ii) Android Permissions evolution, and (iii) how permissions are checked. Furthermore, the survey identifies the permission-related issues and relevant research addressed during the last decade. We reference seminal work in these areas. We summarize the identified research gaps and present future directions for early and experienced researchers.</description>

      <title>Rectifying Adversarial Examples Using Their Vulnerabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep neural network-based classifiers are prone to errors when processing adversarial examples (AEs). AEs are minimally perturbed input data undetectable to humans posing significant risks to security-dependent applications. Hence, extensive research has been undertaken to develop defense mechanisms that mitigate their threats. Most existing methods primarily focus on discriminating AEs based on the input sample features, emphasizing AE detection without addressing the correct sample categorization before an attack. While some tasks may only require mere rejection on detected AEs, others necessitate identifying the correct original input category such as traffic sign recognition in autonomous driving. The objective of this study is to propose a method for rectifying AEs to estimate the correct labels of their original inputs. Our method is based on re-attacking AEs to move them beyond the decision boundary for accurate label prediction, effectively addressing the issue of rectifying minimally perceptible AEs created using white-box attack methods. However, challenge remains with respect to effectively rectifying AEs produced by black-box attacks at a distance from the boundary, or those misclassified into low-confidence categories by targeted attacks. By adopting a straightforward approach of only considering AEs as inputs, the proposed method can address diverse attacks while avoiding the requirement of parameter adjustments or preliminary training. Results demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits consistent performance in rectifying AEs generated via various attack methods, including targeted and black-box attacks. Moreover, it outperforms conventional rectification and input transformation methods in terms of stability against various attacks.</description>

      <title>From Consensus to Chaos: A Vulnerability Assessment of the RAFT Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent decades, the RAFT distributed consensus algorithm has become a main pillar of the distributed systems ecosystem, ensuring data consistency and fault tolerance across multiple nodes. Although the fact that RAFT is well known for its simplicity, reliability, and efficiency, its security properties are not fully recognized, leaving implementations vulnerable to different kinds of attacks and threats, which can transform the RAFT harmony of consensus into a chaos of data inconsistency. This paper presents a systematic security analysis of the RAFT protocol, with a specific focus on its susceptibility to security threats such as message replay attacks and message forgery attacks. Examined how a malicious actor can exploit the protocol's message-passing mechanism to reintroduce old messages, disrupting the consensus process and leading to data inconsistency. The practical feasibility of these attacks is examined through simulated scenarios, and the key weaknesses in RAFT's design that enable them are identified. To address these vulnerabilities, a novel approach based on cryptography, authenticated message verification, and freshness check is proposed. This proposed solution provides a framework for enhancing the security of the RAFT implementations and guiding the development of more resilient distributed systems.</description>

      <title>Making Theft Useless: Adulteration-Based Protection of Proprietary Knowledge Graphs in GraphRAG Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) has emerged as a key technique for enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) with proprietary Knowledge Graphs (KGs) in knowledge-intensive applications. As these KGs often represent an organization's highly valuable intellectual property (IP), they face a significant risk of theft for private use. In this scenario, attackers operate in isolated environments. This private-use threat renders passive defenses like watermarking ineffective, as they require output access for detection. Simultaneously, the low-latency demands of GraphRAG make strong encryption which incurs prohibitive overhead impractical. To address these challenges, we propose AURA, a novel framework based on Data Adulteration designed to make any stolen KG unusable to an adversary. Our framework pre-emptively injects plausible but false adulterants into the KG. For an attacker, these adulterants deteriorate the retrieved context and lead to factually incorrect responses. Conversely, for authorized users, a secret key enables the efficient filtering of all adulterants via encrypted metadata tags before they are passed to the LLM, ensuring query results remain completely accurate. Our evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach: AURA degrades the performance of unauthorized systems to an accuracy of just 5.3%, while maintaining 100% fidelity for authorized users with negligible overhead. Furthermore, AURA proves robust against various sanitization attempts, retaining 80.2% of its adulterants.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC) is a cryptographic service that allows generating analysis of sensitive data related to finance under the collaboration of all stakeholders without violating the privacy of the research participants. This article shows the increasing significance of privacy protection in the contemporary financial services, where various stakeholders should comply with stringent security and regulatory standards. It discusses the main issues of scalability, computational efficiency, and working with very large datasets, and it identifies the directions of future research to make SMPC protocols more practical and efficient. The results highlight the possibility of SMPC to facilitate safe, transparent, and trustful financial transactions in an ecosystem that is becoming more digital.</description>

      <title>Diamond: Design and Implementation of Breach-Resilient Authenticated Encryption Framework For Internet of Things</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resource-constrained Internet of Things (IoT) devices, from medical implants to small drones, must transmit sensitive telemetry under adversarial wireless channels while operating under stringent computing and energy budgets. Authenticated Encryption (AE) is essential for ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity. However, existing lightweight AE standards lack forward-security guarantees, compact tag aggregation, and offline-online (OO) optimizations required for modern high-throughput IoT pipelines.
  We introduce Diamond, the first provable secure Forward-secure and Aggregate Authenticated Encryption (FAAE) framework that extends and generalizes prior FAAE constructions through a lightweight key evolution mechanism, an OO-optimized computation pipeline, and a set of performance-tiered instantiations tailored to heterogeneous IoT platforms. Diamond substantially reduces amortized offline preprocessing (up to 47%) and achieves up to an order-ofmagnitude reduction in end-to-end latency for large telemetry batches. Our comprehensive evaluation across 64-bit ARM Cortex-A72, 32-bit ARM Cortex-M4, and 8-bit AVR architectures confirms that Diamond consistently outperforms baseline FAAE variants and NIST lightweight AE candidates across authenticated encryption throughput and end-to-end verification latency while maintaining compact tag aggregation and strong breach resilience. We formally prove the security of Diamond and provide two concrete instantiations optimized for compliance and high efficiency. Our open-source release enables reproducibility and seamless integration into IoT platforms.</description>

      <title>Traffic-MoE: A Sparse Foundation Model for Network Traffic Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While pre-trained large models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in network traffic analysis, their prohibitive computational costs hinder deployment in real-time, throughput-sensitive network defense environments. This work bridges the gap between advanced representation learning and practical network protection by introducing Traffic-MoE, a sparse foundation model optimized for high-efficiency real-time inference. By dynamically routing traffic tokens to a small subset of specialized experts, Traffic-MoE effectively decouples model capacity from computational overhead. Extensive evaluations across three security-oriented tasks demonstrate that Traffic-MoE achieves up to a 12.38% improvement in detection performance compared to leading dense competitors. Crucially, it delivers a 91.62% increase in throughput, reduces inference latency by 47.81%, and cuts peak GPU memory consumption by 38.72%. Beyond efficiency, Traffic-MoE exhibits superior robustness against adversarial traffic shaping and maintains high detection efficacy in few-shot scenarios, establishing a new paradigm for scalable and resilient network traffic analysis.</description>

      <title>PatchBlock: A Lightweight Defense Against Adversarial Patches for Embedded EdgeAI Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adversarial attacks pose a significant challenge to the reliable deployment of machine learning models in EdgeAI applications, such as autonomous driving and surveillance, which rely on resource-constrained devices for real-time inference. Among these, patch-based adversarial attacks, where small malicious patches (e.g., stickers) are applied to objects, can deceive neural networks into making incorrect predictions with potentially severe consequences. In this paper, we present PatchBlock, a lightweight framework designed to detect and neutralize adversarial patches in images. Leveraging outlier detection and dimensionality reduction, PatchBlock identifies regions affected by adversarial noise and suppresses their impact. It operates as a pre-processing module at the sensor level, efficiently running on CPUs in parallel with GPU inference, thus preserving system throughput while avoiding additional GPU overhead. The framework follows a three-stage pipeline: splitting the input into chunks (Chunking), detecting anomalous regions via a redesigned isolation forest with targeted cuts for faster convergence (Separating), and applying dimensionality reduction on the identified outliers (Mitigating). PatchBlock is both model- and patch-agnostic, can be retrofitted to existing pipelines, and integrates seamlessly between sensor inputs and downstream models. Evaluations across multiple neural architectures, benchmark datasets, attack types, and diverse edge devices demonstrate that PatchBlock consistently improves robustness, recovering up to 77% of model accuracy under strong patch attacks such as the Google Adversarial Patch, while maintaining high portability and minimal clean accuracy loss. Additionally, PatchBlock outperforms the state-of-the-art defenses in efficiency, in terms of computation time and energy consumption per sample, making it suitable for EdgeAI applications.</description>

      <title>Ouroboros AutoSyn: Time Based Permissionless Synchrony Model for PoS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blockchain as a promising technology is gaining its popularity ever since proof-of-work based Bitcoin came to the world. Nevertheless, Bitcoin achieves consensus at an expensive cost of energy. Proof-of-stake is one of the solutions for such a problem. Participants of PoS protocols achieve dynamic-availability in permissionless settings. Parties can join and leave the protocol at their will without notifying others. However, such protocol relies heavily on a central clock, providing the function of synchrony by collecting the finish status of every honest participant.
  In our protocol, the global function maintains the round information for each participant no longer needed. We analyze and modify the round into real-time based round model. Message delivery delay is also taken into consideration of the round length. However, participant need the connection of a real-world time global clock which is crucial to calculate the current round. And round length also is adjusted due to the changing network situation at the start of every new epoch.</description>

      <title>LLM-Powered Analysis of IoT User Reviews: Tracking and Ranking Security and Privacy Concerns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Being able to understand the security and privacy (S&amp;P) concerns of IoT users brings benefits to both developers and users. To learn about users' views, we examine Amazon IoT reviews - one of the biggest IoT markets. This work presents a state-of-the-art methodology to identify and categorize reviews in which users express S&amp;P concerns. We developed an automated pipeline by fine-tuning GPT-3.5-Turbo to build two models: the Classifier-Rationalizer-Categorizer and the Thematic Mapper. By leveraging dynamic few-shot prompting and the model's large context size, our pipeline achieved over 97% precision and recall, significantly outperforming keyword-based and classical ML methods. We applied our pipeline to 91K Amazon reviews about fitness trackers, smart speakers and cameras, over multiple years. We found that on average 5% contained S&amp;P concerns, while security camera exhibited the highest prevalence at 10%. Our method detected significantly more S&amp;P-relevant reviews than prior works: 15x more for fitness trackers, 29% more for smart speakers, and 70% more for cameras. Our longitudinal analysis reveals that concerns like surveillance and data control have persisted for years, suggesting limited industry progress. We demonstrate that across all device types, users consistently demand more precise control over what data is collected and shared. We uncover challenges in multi-user and multi-device interactions, identifying two previously unreported themes concerning inadequate controls for account separation and data access. These findings, ranging from broad persistent trends to specific instances of customer loss, offer actionable insights for developers to improve user satisfaction and trust.</description>

      <title>Engineering Attack Vectors and Detecting Anomalies in Additive Manufacturing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Additive manufacturing (AM) is rapidly integrating into critical sectors such as aerospace, automotive, and healthcare. However, this cyber-physical convergence introduces new attack surfaces, especially at the interface between computer-aided design (CAD) and machine execution layers. In this work, we investigate targeted cyberattacks on two widely used fused deposition modeling (FDM) systems, Creality's flagship model K1 Max, and Ender 3. Our threat model is a multi-layered Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) intrusion, where the adversary intercepts and manipulates G-code files during upload from the user interface to the printer firmware. The MitM intrusion chain enables several stealthy sabotage scenarios. These attacks remain undetectable by conventional slicer software or runtime interfaces, resulting in structurally defective yet externally plausible printed parts. To counter these stealthy threats, we propose an unsupervised Intrusion Detection System (IDS) that analyzes structured machine logs generated during live printing. Our defense mechanism uses a frozen Transformer-based encoder (a BERT variant) to extract semantic representations of system behavior, followed by a contrastively trained projection head that learns anomaly-sensitive embeddings. Later, a clustering-based approach and a self-attention autoencoder are used for classification.

      <title>Exploring the Integration of Differential Privacy in Cybersecurity Analytics: Balancing Data Utility and Privacy in Threat Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To resolve the acute problem of privacy protection and guarantee that data can be used in the context of threat intelligence, this paper considers the implementation of Differential Privacy (DP) in cybersecurity analytics. DP, which is a sound mathematical framework, ensures privacy by adding a controlled noise to data outputs and thus avoids sensitive information disclosure even with auxiliary datasets. The use of DP in Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems is highlighted, and it can be seen that DP has the capability to protect event log and threat data analysis without interfering with the analytical efficiency. The utility versus privacy trade-offs linked to the maximization of the epsilon parameter, which is one of the critical components of DP mechanisms, is pointed out. The article shows the transformative power of DP in promoting safe sharing of data and joint threat intelligence through real-world systems and case studies. Finally, this paper makes DP one of the key strategies to improve privacy-preserving analytics in the field of cybersecurity.</description>

      <title>NOS-Gate: Queue-Aware Streaming IDS for Consumer Gateways under Timing-Controlled Evasion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Timing and burst patterns can leak through encryption, and an adaptive adversary can exploit them. This undermines metadata-only detection in a stand-alone consumer gateway. Therefore, consumer gateways need streaming intrusion detection on encrypted traffic using metadata only, under tight CPU and latency budgets. We present a streaming IDS for stand-alone gateways that instantiates a lightweight two-state unit derived from Network-Optimised Spiking (NOS) dynamics per flow, named NOS-Gate. NOS-Gate scores fixed-length windows of metadata features and, under a $K$-of-$M$ persistence rule, triggers a reversible mitigation that temporarily reduces the flow's weight under weighted fair queueing (WFQ). We evaluate NOS-Gate under timing-controlled evasion using an executable 'worlds' benchmark that specifies benign device processes, auditable attacker budgets, contention structure, and packet-level WFQ replay to quantify queue impact. All methods are calibrated label-free via burn-in quantile thresholding. Across multiple reproducible worlds and malicious episodes, at an achieved $0.1%$ false-positive operating point, NOS-Gate attains 0.952 incident recall versus 0.857 for the best baseline in these runs. Under gating, it reduces p99.9 queueing delay and p99.9 collateral delay with a mean scoring cost of ~ 2.09 {\mu}s per flow-window on CPU.</description>

      <title>Secure, Verifiable, and Scalable Multi-Client Data Sharing via Consensus-Based Privacy-Preserving Data Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose the Consensus-Based Privacy-Preserving Data Distribution (CPPDD) framework, a lightweight and post-setup autonomous protocol for secure multi-client data aggregation. The framework enforces unanimous-release confidentiality through a dual-layer protection mechanism that combines per-client affine masking with priority-driven sequential consensus locking. Decentralized integrity is verified via step (sigma_S) and data (sigma_D) checksums, facilitating autonomous malicious deviation detection and atomic abort without requiring persistent coordination. The design supports scalar, vector, and matrix payloads with O(N*D) computation and communication complexity, optional edge-server offloading, and resistance to collusion under N-1 corruptions. Formal analysis proves correctness, Consensus-Dependent Integrity and Fairness (CDIF) with overwhelming-probability abort on deviation, and IND-CPA security assuming a pseudorandom function family. Empirical evaluations on MNIST-derived vectors demonstrate linear scalability up to N = 500 with sub-millisecond per-client computation times. The framework achieves 100% malicious deviation detection, exact data recovery, and three-to-four orders of magnitude lower FLOPs compared to MPC and HE baselines. CPPDD enables atomic collaboration in secure voting, consortium federated learning, blockchain escrows, and geo-information capacity building, addressing critical gaps in scalability, trust minimization, and verifiable multi-party computation for regulated and resource-constrained environments.</description>

      <title>Security in the Age of AI Teammates: An Empirical Study of Agentic Pull Requests on GitHub</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous coding agents are increasingly deployed as AI teammates in modern software engineering, independently authoring pull requests (PRs) that modify production code at scale. This study aims to systematically characterize how autonomous coding agents contribute to software security in practice, how these security-related contributions are reviewed and accepted, and which observable signals are associated with PR rejection. We conduct a large-scale empirical analysis of agent-authored PRs using the AIDev dataset, comprising of over 33,000 curated PRs from popular GitHub repositories. Security-relevant PRs are identified using a keyword filtering strategy, followed by manual validation, resulting in 1,293 confirmed security-related agentic-PRs. We then analyze prevalence, acceptance outcomes, and review latency across autonomous agents, programming ecosystems, and types of code changes. Moreover, we apply qualitative open coding to identify recurring security-related actions and underlying intents, and examine review metadata to identify early signals associated with PR rejection. Security-related Agentic-PRs constitute a meaningful share of agent activity (approximately 4\%). Rather than focusing solely on narrow vulnerability fixes, agents most frequently perform supportive security hardening activities, including testing, documentation, configuration, and improved error handling. Compared to non-security PRs, security-related Agentic-PRs exhibit lower merge rates and longer review latency, reflecting heightened human scrutiny, with variation across agents and programming ecosystems. PR rejection is more strongly associated with PR complexity and verbosity than with explicit security topics.</description>

      <title>Improving LLM-Assisted Secure Code Generation through Retrieval-Augmented-Generation and Multi-Tool Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate code but often introduce security vulnerabilities, logical inconsistencies, and compilation errors. Prior work demonstrates that LLMs benefit substantially from structured feedback, static analysis, retrieval augmentation, and execution-based refinement. We propose a retrieval-augmented, multi-tool repair workflow in which a single code-generating LLM iteratively refines its outputs using compiler diagnostics, CodeQL security scanning, and KLEE symbolic execution. A lightweight embedding model is used for semantic retrieval of previously successful repairs, providing security-focused examples that guide generation. Evaluated on a combined dataset of 3,242 programs generated by DeepSeek-Coder-1.3B and CodeLlama-7B, the system demonstrates significant improvements in robustness. For DeepSeek, security vulnerabilities were reduced by 96%. For the larger CodeLlama model, the critical security defect rate was decreased from 58.55% to 22.19%, highlighting the efficacy of tool-assisted self-repair even on "stubborn" models.</description>

      <title>Cyberscurity Threats and Defense Mechanisms in IoT network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, projected to exceed 30 billion interconnected devices by 2030, has significantly escalated the complexity of cybersecurity challenges. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of vulnerabilities, threats, and defense mechanisms, specifically focusing on the integration of network and application layers within real-time monitoring and decision-making systems. Employing an integrative review methodology, 59 scholarly articles published between 2009 and 2024 were selected from databases such as IEEE Xplore, ScienceDirect, and PubMed, utilizing keywords related to IoT vulnerabilities and security attacks. Key findings identify critical threat categories, including sensor vulnerabilities, Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks, and public cloud insecurity. Conversely, the study highlights advanced defense approaches leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI) for anomaly detection, Blockchain for decentralized trust, and Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) for continuous verification. This paper contributes a novel five-layer IoT model and outlines future research directions involving quantum computing and 6G networks to bolster IoT ecosystem resilience.</description>

      <title>Cracking IoT Security: Can LLMs Outsmart Static Analysis Tools?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Smart home IoT platforms such as openHAB rely on Trigger Action Condition (TAC) rules to automate device behavior, but the interplay among these rules can give rise to interaction threats, unintended or unsafe behaviors emerging from implicit dependencies, conflicting triggers, or overlapping conditions. Identifying these threats requires semantic understanding and structural reasoning that traditionally depend on symbolic, constraint-driven static analysis. This work presents the first comprehensive evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) across a multi-category interaction threat taxonomy, assessing their performance on both the original openHAB (oHC/IoTB) dataset and a structurally challenging Mutation dataset designed to test robustness under rule transformations. We benchmark Llama 3.1 8B, Llama 70B, GPT-4o, Gemini-2.5-Pro, and DeepSeek-R1 across zero-, one-, and two-shot settings, comparing their results against oHIT's manually validated ground truth. Our findings show that while LLMs exhibit promising semantic understanding, particularly on action- and condition-related threats, their accuracy degrades significantly for threats requiring cross-rule structural reasoning, especially under mutated rule forms. Model performance varies widely across threat categories and prompt settings, with no model providing consistent reliability. In contrast, the symbolic reasoning baseline maintains stable detection across both datasets, unaffected by rule rewrites or structural perturbations. These results underscore that LLMs alone are not yet dependable for safety critical interaction-threat detection in IoT environments. We discuss the implications for tool design and highlight the potential of hybrid architectures that combine symbolic analysis with LLM-based semantic interpretation to reduce false positives while maintaining structural rigor.</description>

      <title>Low Rank Comes with Low Security: Gradient Assembly Poisoning Attacks against Distributed LoRA-based LLM Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has become a popular solution for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) in federated settings, dramatically reducing update costs by introducing trainable low-rank matrices. However, when integrated with frameworks like FedIT, LoRA introduces a critical vulnerability: clients submit $A$ and $B$ matrices separately, while only their product $AB$ determines the model update, yet this composite is never directly verified. We propose Gradient Assembly Poisoning (GAP), a novel attack that exploits this blind spot by crafting individually benign $A$ and $B$ matrices whose product yields malicious updates. GAP operates without access to training data or inter-client coordination and remains undetected by standard anomaly detectors. We identify four systemic vulnerabilities in LoRA-based federated systems and validate GAP across LLaMA, ChatGLM, and GPT-2. GAP consistently induces degraded or biased outputs while preserving surface fluency, reducing BLEU by up to 14.5\%, increasing factual and grammatical errors by over 800\%, and maintaining 92.6\% long-form response length. These results reveal a new class of stealthy, persistent threats in distributed LoRA fine-tuning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.00571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entrepreneurial small to medium enterprises face significant cybersecurity challenges when developing valuable intellectual property (IP). This paper addresses the critical gap in research on how E-SMEs can protect their IP assets from cybersecurity threats through effective threat intelligence and IP protection activities. Drawing on Dynamic Capabilities and Knowledge-Based View theoretical frameworks, we propose the Threat Intelligence-driven IP Protection (TI-IPP) model. This conceptual model features to modes of operation, closed IP development and open innovation, enabling E-SMEs to adapt their IP protection and knowledge management strategies. The model incorporates four key phases: sensing opportunities and threats, seizing opportunities, knowledge transfer, and organizational transformation. By integrating cybersecurity threat intelligence with IP protection practices, E-SMEs can develop capabilities to safeguard valuable IP while maintaining competitive advantage. This research-in-progress paper outlines a qualitative research methodology using multiple case studies to validate and refine the proposed model for practical application in resource-constrained entrepreneurial environments.</description>

      <title>Toward a Dynamic Intellectual Property Protection Model in High-Growth SMEs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.00572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges faced by High-Growth Small-to-Medium Enterprises (HG-SMEs) in balancing intellectual property (IP) protection with open innovation during periods of rapid growth. Despite developing valuable IP assets that drive success, HG-SMEs often struggle with cybersecurity concerns related to IP theft and data exfiltration amidst resource constraints and the competing demands of expansion. We examine the intersection of cybersecurity, IP protection and rapid scaling - an area currently underexplored in existing literature. Drawing on Dynamic Capabilities (DC), Knowledge-based View (KBV) and open innovation theoretical frameworks, we introduce a conceptual framework to guide HG-SMEs in effectively managing valuable IP assets. This research-in-progress paper outlines a qualitative methodology to validate and refine the model. By addressing the research question of how HG-SMEs manage cybersecurity to protect valuable IP assets, we aim to provide practical guidance for high-growth, technology-driven companies navigating the tension between robust IP protection and collaborative innovation.</description>

      <title>Towards Understanding and Characterizing Vulnerabilities in Intelligent Connected Vehicles through Real-World Exploits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intelligent Connected Vehicles (ICVs) are a core component of modern transportation systems, and their security is crucial as it directly relates to user safety. Despite prior research, most existing studies focus only on specific sub-components of ICVs due to their inherent complexity. As a result, there is a lack of systematic understanding of ICV vulnerabilities. Moreover, much of the current literature relies on human subjective analysis, such as surveys and interviews, which tends to be high-level and unvalidated, leaving a significant gap between theoretical findings and real-world attacks. To address this issue, we conducted the first large-scale empirical study on ICV vulnerabilities. We began by analyzing existing ICV security literature and summarizing the prevailing taxonomies in terms of vulnerability locations and types. To evaluate their real-world relevance, we collected a total of 649 exploitable vulnerabilities, including 592 from eight ICV vulnerability discovery competitions, Anonymous Cup, between January 2023 and April 2024, covering 48 different vehicles. The remaining 57 vulnerabilities were submitted daily by researchers. Based on this dataset, we assessed the coverage of existing taxonomies and identified several gaps, discovering one new vulnerability location and 13 new vulnerability types. We further categorized these vulnerabilities into 6 threat types (e.g., privacy data breach) and 4 risk levels (ranging from low to critical) and analyzed participants' skills and the types of ICVs involved in the competitions. This study provides a comprehensive and data-driven analysis of ICV vulnerabilities, offering actionable insights for researchers, industry practitioners, and policymakers. To support future research, we have made our vulnerability dataset publicly available.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.00783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous work on home router security has shown that using system calls to train a transformer-based language model built on a BERT-style encoder using contrastive learning is effective in detecting several types of malware, but the performance remains limited at low false positive rates. In this work, we demonstrate that using a high-fidelity eBPF-based system call sensor, together with contrastive augmented learning (which introduces controlled mutations of negative samples), improves detection performance at a low false positive rate. In addition, we introduce a network packet abstraction language that enables the creation of a pipeline similar to network packet data, and we show that network behavior provides complementary detection signals-yielding improved performance for network-focused malware at low false positive rates. Lastly, we implement these methods in an online router anomaly detection framework to validate the approach in an Internet of Things (IoT) deployment environment.</description>

      <title>The Trojan in the Vocabulary: Stealthy Sabotage of LLM Composition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The open-weight LLM ecosystem is increasingly defined by model composition techniques (such as weight merging, speculative decoding, and vocabulary expansion) that remix capabilities from diverse sources. A critical prerequisite for applying these methods across different model families is tokenizer transplant, which aligns incompatible vocabularies to a shared embedding space. We demonstrate that this essential interoperability step introduces a supply-chain vulnerability: we engineer a single "breaker token" that is functionally inert in a donor model yet reliably reconstructs into a high-salience malicious feature after transplant into a base model. By exploiting the geometry of coefficient reuse, our attack creates an asymmetric realizability gap that sabotages the base model's generation while leaving the donor's utility statistically indistinguishable from nominal behavior. We formalize this as a dual-objective optimization problem and instantiate the attack using a sparse solver. Empirically, the attack is training-free and achieves spectral mimicry to evade outlier detection, while demonstrating structural persistence against fine-tuning and weight merging, highlighting a hidden risk in the pipeline of modular AI composition.

      <title>Understanding Security Risks of AI Agents' Dependency Updates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Package dependencies are a critical control point in modern software supply chains. Dependency changes can substantially alter a project's security posture. As AI coding agents increasingly modify software via pull requests, it is unclear whether their dependency decisions introduce distinct security risks.
  We study 117,062 dependency changes from agent- and human-authored pull requests across seven ecosystems. Agents select known-vulnerable versions more often than humans (2.46% vs. 1.64%), and their vulnerable selections are more disruptive to remediate, with 36.8% requiring major-version upgrades compared to 12.9% for humans, despite patched alternatives existing in most cases. At the aggregate level, agent-driven dependency work yields a net vulnerability increase of 98, whereas human-authored work yields a net reduction of 1,316. These findings motivate pull-request-time vulnerability screening and registry-aware guardrails to make agent-driven dependency updates safer.</description>

      <title>When Does Quantum Differential Privacy Compose?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Composition is a cornerstone of classical differential privacy, enabling strong end-to-end guarantees for complex algorithms through composition theorems (e.g., basic and advanced). In the quantum setting, however, privacy is defined operationally against arbitrary measurements, and classical composition arguments based on scalar privacy-loss random variables no longer apply. As a result, it has remained unclear when meaningful composition guarantees can be obtained for quantum differential privacy (QDP).
  In this work, we clarify both the limitations and possibilities of composition in the quantum setting. We first show that classical-style composition fails in full generality for POVM-based approximate QDP: even quantum channels that are individually perfectly private can completely lose privacy when combined through correlated joint implementations. We then identify a setting in which clean composition guarantees can be restored. For tensor-product channels acting on product neighboring inputs, we introduce a quantum moments accountant based on an operator-valued notion of privacy loss and a matrix moment-generating function. Although the resulting R\'enyi-type divergence does not satisfy a data-processing inequality, we prove that controlling its moments suffices to bound measured R\'enyi divergence, yielding operational privacy guarantees against arbitrary measurements. This leads to advanced-composition-style bounds with the same leading-order behavior as in the classical theory.
  Our results demonstrate that meaningful composition theorems for quantum differential privacy require carefully articulated structural assumptions on channels, inputs, and adversarial measurements, and provide a principled framework for understanding which classical ideas do and do not extend to the quantum setting.</description>

      <title>The CoinAlg Bind: Profitability-Fairness Tradeoffs in Collective Investment Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collective Investment Algorithms (CoinAlgs) are increasingly popular systems that deploy shared trading strategies for investor communities. Their goal is to democratize sophisticated -- often AI-based -- investing tools. We identify and demonstrate a fundamental profitability-fairness tradeoff in CoinAlgs that we call the CoinAlg Bind: CoinAlgs cannot ensure economic fairness without losing profit to arbitrage. We present a formal model of CoinAlgs, with definitions of privacy (incomplete algorithm disclosure) and economic fairness (value extraction by an adversarial insider). We prove two complementary results that together demonstrate the CoinAlg Bind. First, privacy in a CoinAlg is a precondition for insider attacks on economic fairness. Conversely, in a game-theoretic model, lack of privacy, i.e., transparency, enables arbitrageurs to erode the profitability of a CoinAlg. Using data from Uniswap, a decentralized exchange, we empirically study both sides of the CoinAlg Bind. We quantify the impact of arbitrage against transparent CoinAlgs. We show the risks posed by a private CoinAlg: Even low-bandwidth covert-channel information leakage enables unfair value extraction.</description>

      <title>Three results on twisted $G-$codes and skew twisted $G-$codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we solve an open question formulated in the original paper of twisted skew group codes regarding when a twisted skew group code is checkable. Also, we prove that all ideals of dimension 3 over a twisted group algebra are abelian group codes, generalising another previous result over group algebras. Finally, we prove a bound on the dimension and distance of a twisted group code, as well as when such bound is reached.</description>

      <title>One Trigger Token Is Enough: A Defense Strategy for Balancing Safety and Usability in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07167v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been extensively used across diverse domains, including virtual assistants, automated code generation, and scientific research. However, they remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, which manipulate the models into generating harmful responses despite safety alignment. Recent studies have shown that current safety-aligned LLMs undergo shallow safety alignment. In this work, we conduct an in-depth investigation into the underlying mechanism of this phenomenon and reveal that it manifests through learned ''safety trigger tokens'' that activate the model's safety patterns when paired with the specific input. Through both analysis and empirical verification, we further demonstrate the high similarity of the safety trigger tokens across different harmful inputs. Accordingly, we propose D-STT, a simple yet effective defense algorithm that identifies and explicitly decodes safety trigger tokens of the given safety-aligned LLM to activate the model's learned safety patterns. In this process, the safety trigger is constrained to a single token, which effectively preserves model usability by introducing minimum intervention in the decoding process. Extensive experiments across diverse jailbreak attacks and benign prompts demonstrate that D-STT significantly reduces output harmfulness while preserving model usability and incurring negligible response time overhead, outperforming ten baseline methods.</description>

Abstract: Satellites are the backbone of several mission-critical services that enable our modern society to function, for example, GPS. For years, satellites were assumed to be secure because of their indecipherable architectures and the reliance on security by obscurity. However, technological advancements have made these assumptions obsolete, paving the way for potential attacks, and sparking interest in satellite security. Unfortunately, to this day, there is no efficient way to collect data on adversarial techniques for satellites, hurting the generation of security intelligence that can lead to the development of effective countermeasures. In this paper, we present HoneySat, the first high-interaction satellite honeypot framework, fully capable of convincingly simulating a real-world CubeSat, a type of Small Satellite (SmallSat). To provide evidence of HoneySat's effectiveness, we surveyed experienced SmallSat operators in charge of in-orbit satellites and deployed HoneySat over the Internet to entice adversaries. Our results show that 90% of satellite operators agreed that HoneySat provides a realistic and engaging simulation of a SmallSat mission. Additionally, HoneySat successfully deceived human adversaries in the wild and collected 22 real-world satellite-specific adversarial interactions. Finally, in a major demonstration of HoneySat's robustness, we collaborated with an aerospace company to perform a hardware-in-the-loop operation that resulted in HoneySat successfully communicating with an in-orbit, operational SmallSat mission.</description>

      <title>Ancora: Accurate Intrusion Recovery for Web Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07806v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern web application recovery presents a critical dilemma. Coarse-grained snapshot rollbacks cause unacceptable data loss for legitimate users. Surgically removing an attack's impact is hindered by a fundamental challenge in high-concurrency environments: it is difficult to attribute resulting file and database modifications to a specific attack-related request. We present Ancora, a system for precise intrusion recovery in web applications without invasive instrumentation. Ancora first isolates the full sequence of syscalls triggered by a single malicious request. Based on this sequence, Ancora addresses file and database modifications separately. To trace file changes, it builds a provenance graph that reveals all modifications, including those by exploit-spawned processes. To attribute database operations, a more difficult challenge due to connection pooling, Ancora introduces a novel spatiotemporal anchor. This anchor uses the request's network connection tuple and active time window to pinpoint exact database operations. With all malicious file and database operations precisely identified, Ancora performs a unified rewind and selective replay recovery. It reverts the system to a clean snapshot taken before the attack, then selectively re-applies only legitimate operations to both the file system and database. This completely removes the attack's effects while preserving concurrent legitimate data. We evaluated Ancora on 10 web applications and 20 CVE-based attack scenarios with concurrency up to 150 connections. Experiments demonstrate Ancora achieves 99.9% recovery accuracy with manageable overhead: up to 19.8% response latency increase and 17.8% QPS decrease in worst cases, and recovery throughput of 110.7 database operations per second and 27.2 affected files per second, effectively preserving legitimate data.</description>

      <title>Fusion of Machine Learning and Blockchain-based Privacy-Preserving Approach for Health Care Data in the Internet of Things</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19026v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, the rapid integration of Internet of Things (IoT) devices into the healthcare sector has brought about revolutionary advancements in patient care and data management. While these technological innovations hold immense promise, they concurrently raise critical security concerns, particularly in safeguarding medical data against potential cyber threats. The sensitive nature of health-related information requires robust measures to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of patient data in IoT-enabled medical environments. Addressing the imperative need for enhanced security in IoT-based healthcare systems, we propose a comprehensive method encompassing three distinct phases. In the first phase, we implement Blockchain-Enabled Request and Transaction Encryption to strengthen data transaction security, providing an immutable and transparent framework. In the second phase, we introduce a Request Pattern Recognition Check that leverages diverse data sources to identify and block potential unauthorized access attempts. Finally, the third phase incorporates Feature Selection and a BiLSTM network to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of intrusion detection using advanced machine learning techniques. We compared the simulation results of the proposed method with three recent related methods: AIBPSF-IoMT, OMLIDS-PBIoT, and AIMMFIDS. The evaluation criteria include detection rate, false alarm rate, precision, recall, and accuracy - crucial benchmarks for assessing the overall performance of intrusion detection systems. Our findings show that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches across all evaluated criteria, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving the security of IoT-based healthcare systems.</description>

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have emerged as a powerful advancement in multi-step reasoning tasks, offering enhanced transparency and logical consistency through explicit chains of thought (CoT). However, these models introduce novel safety and reliability risks, such as CoT-hijacking and prompt-induced inefficiencies, which are not fully captured by existing evaluation methods. To address this gap, we propose RT-LRM, a unified benchmark designed to assess the trustworthiness of LRMs. RT-LRM evaluates three core dimensions: truthfulness, safety and efficiency. Beyond metric-based evaluation, we further introduce the training paradigm as a key analytical perspective to investigate the systematic impact of different training strategies on model trustworthiness. We achieve this by designing a curated suite of 30 reasoning tasks from an observational standpoint. We conduct extensive experiments on 26 models and identify several valuable insights into the trustworthiness of LRMs. For example, LRMs generally face trustworthiness challenges and tend to be more fragile than Large Language Models (LLMs) when encountering reasoning-induced risks. These findings uncover previously underexplored vulnerabilities and highlight the need for more targeted evaluations. In addition, we release a scalable toolbox for standardized trustworthiness research to support future advancements in this important field. Our code and datasets will be open-sourced.</description>

      <title>From Description to Score: Can LLMs Quantify Vulnerabilities?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06781v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Manual vulnerability scoring, such as assigning Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) scores, is a resource-intensive process that is often influenced by subjective interpretation. This study investigates the potential of general-purpose large language models (LLMs), namely ChatGPT, Llama, Grok, DeepSeek, and Gemini, to automate this process by analyzing over 31{,}000 recent Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) entries. The results show that LLMs substantially outperform the baseline on certain metrics (e.g., \textit{Availability Impact}), while offering more modest gains on others (e.g., \textit{Attack Complexity}). Moreover, model performance varies across both LLM families and individual CVSS metrics, with ChatGPT-5 attaining the highest precision. Our analysis reveals that LLMs tend to misclassify many of the same CVEs, and ensemble-based meta-classifiers only marginally improve performance. Further examination shows that CVE descriptions often lack critical context or contain ambiguous phrasing, which contributes to systematic misclassifications. These findings underscore the importance of enhancing vulnerability descriptions and incorporating richer contextual details to support more reliable automated reasoning and alleviate the growing backlog of CVEs awaiting triage.</description>

      <title>PrivTune: Efficient and Privacy-Preserving Fine-Tuning of Large Language Models via Device-Cloud Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08809v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the rise of large language models, service providers offer language models as a service, enabling users to fine-tune customized models via uploaded private datasets. However, this raises concerns about sensitive data leakage. Prior methods, relying on differential privacy within device-cloud collaboration frameworks, struggle to balance privacy and utility, exposing users to inference attacks or degrading fine-tuning performance. To address this, we propose PrivTune, an efficient and privacy-preserving fine-tuning framework via Split Learning (SL). The key idea of PrivTune is to inject crafted noise into token representations from the SL bottom model, making each token resemble the $n$-hop indirect neighbors. PrivTune formulates this as an optimization problem to compute the optimal noise vector, aligning with defense-utility goals. On this basis, it then adjusts the parameters (i.e., mean) of the $d_\chi$-Privacy noise distribution to align with the optimization direction and scales the noise according to token importance to minimize distortion. Experiments on five datasets (covering both classification and generation tasks) against three embedding inversion and three attribute inference attacks show that, using RoBERTa on the Stanford Sentiment Treebank dataset, PrivTune reduces the attack success rate to 10% with only a 3.33% drop in utility performance, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <title>Mage: Cracking Elliptic Curve Cryptography with Cross-Axis Transformers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12483v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the advent of machine learning and quantum computing, the 21st century has gone from a place of relative algorithmic security, to one of speculative unease and possibly, cyber catastrophe.
  Modern algorithms like Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) are the bastion of current cryptographic security protocols that form the backbone of consumer protection ranging from Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) in the modern internet browser, to cryptographic financial instruments like Bitcoin.
  And there's been very little work put into testing the strength of these ciphers. Practically the only study that I could find was on side-channel recognition, a joint paper from the University of Milan, Italy and King's College, London\cite{battistello2025ecc}.
  These algorithms are already considered bulletproof by many consumers, but exploits already exist for them, and with computing power and distributed, federated compute on the rise, it's only a matter of time before these current bastions fade away into obscurity, and it's on all of us to stand up when we notice something is amiss, lest we see such passages claim victims in that process.
  In this paper, we seek to explore the use of modern language model architecture in cracking the association between a known public key, and its associated private key, by intuitively learning to reverse engineer the public keypair generation process, effectively solving the curve.
  Additonally, we attempt to ascertain modern machine learning's ability to memorize public-private secp256r1 keypairs, and to then test their ability to reverse engineer the public keypair generation process.
  It is my belief that proof-for would be equally valuable as proof-against in either of these categories.
  Finally, we'll conclude with some number crunching on where we see this particular field heading in the future.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21251v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: My main worry, and the core of my research, is that our cybersecurity ecosystem is slowly but surely aging and getting old and that aging is becoming an operational risk. This is happening not only because of growing complexity, but more importantly because of accumulation of controls and measures whose effectiveness are uncertain. I introduce a new term for this aging phenomenon: cyber senescence. I will begin my lecture with a short historical overview in which I sketch a development over time that led to this worry for the future of cybersecurity. It is this worry that determined my research agenda and its central theme of the role of uncertainty in cybersecurity. My worry is that waste is accumulating in cyberspace. This waste consists of a multitude of overlapping controls whose risk reductions are uncertain. Unless we start pruning these control frameworks, this waste accumulation causes aging of cyberspace and could ultimately lead to a system collapse.</description>

      <title>NOWA: Null-space Optical Watermark for Invisible Capture Fingerprinting and Tamper Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22501v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ensuring the authenticity and ownership of digital images is increasingly challenging as modern editing tools enable highly realistic forgeries. Existing image protection systems mainly rely on digital watermarking, which is susceptible to sophisticated digital attacks. To address this limitation, we propose a hybrid optical-digital framework that incorporates physical authentication cues during image formation and preserves them through a learned reconstruction process. At the optical level, a phase mask in the camera aperture produces a Null-space Optical Watermark (NOWA) that lies in the Null Space of the imaging operator and therefore remains invisible in the captured image. Then, a Null-Space Network (NSN) performs measurement-consistent reconstruction that delivers high-quality protected images while preserving the NOWA signature. The proposed design enables tamper localization by projecting the image onto the camera's null space and detecting pixel-level inconsistencies. Our design preserves perceptual quality, resists common degradations such as compression, and establishes a structural security asymmetry: without access to the optical or NSN parameters, adversaries cannot forge the NOWA signature. Experiments with simulations and a prototype camera demonstrate competitive performance in terms of image quality preservation, and tamper localization accuracy compared to state-of-the-art digital watermarking and learning-based authentication methods.</description>

      <title>Pod: An Optimal-Latency, Censorship-Free, and Accountable Generalized Consensus Layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14931v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work addresses the inherent issues of high latency in blockchains and low scalability in traditional consensus protocols. We present pod, a novel notion of consensus whose first priority is to achieve the physically-optimal latency of $2\delta$, or one round-trip, i.e., requiring only one network trip (duration $\delta$) for writing a transaction and one for reading it.
  To accomplish this, we first eliminate inter-replica communication. Instead, clients send transactions directly to all replicas, which independently process transactions and append them to local logs. Replicas assigns a timestamp and a sequence number to each transaction in their logs, allowing clients to extract valuable metadata about the transactions and the system state. Later on, clients retrieve these logs and extract transactions (and associated metadata) from them.
  Necessarily, this construction achieves weaker properties than a total-order broadcast protocol, due to existing lower bounds. Our work models the primitive of pod and defines its security properties. We then show pod-core, a protocol that satisfies properties such as transaction confirmation within $2\delta$, censorship resistance against Byzantine replicas, and accountability for safety violations. We show that single-shot auctions can be realized using the pod notion and observe that it is also sufficient for other popular applications.</description>

      <title>Scaling Patterns in Adversarial Alignment: Evidence from Multi-LLM Jailbreak Experiments</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly operate in multi-agent and safety-critical settings, raising open questions about how their vulnerabilities scale when models interact adversarially. This study examines whether larger models can systematically jailbreak smaller ones - eliciting harmful or restricted behavior despite alignment safeguards. Using standardized adversarial tasks from JailbreakBench, we simulate over 6,000 multi-turn attacker-target exchanges across major LLM families and scales (0.6B-120B parameters), measuring both harm score and refusal behavior as indicators of adversarial potency and alignment integrity. Each interaction is evaluated through aggregated harm and refusal scores assigned by three independent LLM judges, providing a consistent, model-based measure of adversarial outcomes. Aggregating results across prompts, we find a strong and statistically significant correlation between mean harm and the logarithm of the attacker-to-target size ratio (Pearson r = 0.51, p &lt; 0.001; Spearman rho = 0.52, p &lt; 0.001), indicating that relative model size correlates with the likelihood and severity of harmful completions. Mean harm score variance is higher across attackers (0.18) than across targets (0.10), suggesting that attacker-side behavioral diversity contributes more to adversarial outcomes than target susceptibility. Attacker refusal frequency is strongly and negatively correlated with harm (rho = -0.93, p &lt; 0.001), showing that attacker-side alignment mitigates harmful responses. These findings reveal that size asymmetry influences robustness and provide exploratory evidence for adversarial scaling patterns, motivating more controlled investigations into inter-model alignment and safety.</description>

      <title>Device Independent Quantum Secret Sharing Using Multiparty Pseudo-telepathy Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09699v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Device-independent quantum secret sharing (DI-QSS) provides security against untrusted quantum devices. While device-independent quantum key distribution (DI-QKD) using Mermin-Peres magic square game [Zhen et al., Phys. Rev. Lett, 2023] has been proposed, we present the first DI-QSS protocol based on a pseudo-telepathy parity game without requiring dedicated rounds and specific basis configuration, unlike CHSH-based DI-QSS schemes [Zhang et al., Phys. Rev. A, 2024]. Our scheme simultaneously certifies device-independence and key generation using a single test, achieving optimal performance for a seven-qubit GHZ state configuration. Security against collective attacks is analyzed, and a positive key rate is obtained under white noise and photon loss. Moreover, we show a bitwise advantage over the previous protocol for producing the same raw key length.</description>
