      <title>Cavity-mediated multispin interactions and phase transitions in ultracold Fermi gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The many-body physics of higher-spin systems is expected to host qualitatively new matter phases, but realizing them requires the controllable multispin interactions that can be tuned independently for each spin component. Here we propose a scheme that meets this demand in ultracold Fermi gases. By engineering the atom-cavity coupling, we generate cavity-mediated effective interactions between arbitrary pseudo-spin states. Focusing on the simplest three-spin case, we obtain two independent scattering channels whose strengths and signs can be adjusted separately. The resulting Hamiltonian combines the on-site attraction with the off-site repulsion, and drives a continuous transition from the superfluid to the spin-density-wave phase. The coexistence region is reminiscent of a supersolid, yet the self-organized modulation appears in the spin space of a higher-spin representation, rather than in the density profile. The proposal is reliable to be implemented using the existing techniques of ultracold atoms. Therefore it offers a versatile platform for quantum simulation of higher-spin many-body physics.</description>

      <title>Nonperturbative quantum field theory for pseudo-Goldstone modes, slow-Goldstone modes, and their quantum chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a novel form of non-perturbative theory to identify a light pseudo-Goldstone mode with a small mass, as well as a new type of Goldstone mode with a tiny slope (termed the slow-Goldstone mode), which may not be obtained via traditional perturbative methods. We demonstrate our formalism in the context of superfluids formed by Rashba spin-orbit coupled spinor bosons in a square lattice weakly interacting with a spin-anisotropic interaction. The experimental detections of these two modes, especially their roles leading to the quantum information scramblings at a finite temperature are discussed. The slow-Goldstone mode is compared with the slow light and the soft mode in the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev models. This non-perturbative formalism can be widely applied to study other emergent particles in various quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Importance of Correlations for Neural Quantum States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural quantum states (NQS) have emerged as a powerful variational ansatz for representing quantum many-body wave functions. Their internal mechanisms, however, remain poorly understood. We investigate the role of correlations for NQS-like quantum state representation by employing a correlation-based interpretable neural network architecture and thereafter proving our observations based on Boolean function theory. The correlator neural network demonstrates that, even for simple product states, up to all system-size correlation orders in the chosen computational basis are required to represent a quantum state faithfully. We explain these observations using the Fourier expansion, which reveals the correlator basis as the effective basis of the internal NQS structure, the resulting necessity for high-order correlations, potential linear dependencies in constrained Hilbert spaces, and connections between spin basis-rotations and the correlator basis. Furthermore, we analyze how activation functions, network architectures, and choice of reference basis influence correlation requirements. Our results provide new insights and a better understanding of the internal structure and requirements of NQS, enabling a more systematic use of NQS in future research.</description>

      <title>Production of ultracold asymmetric tops from Sr atoms and SrOH molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the comprehensive theoretical investigation of the Sr-SrOH system identifying it as a promising route to production of ultracold asymmetric top molecules. Combining high-level ab initio electronic structure calculations with rigorous quantum scattering simulations, we determine strongly anisotropic, non-reactive interaction potential and an exceptionally dense spectrum of near-threshold resonances. Presented excited states, transition dipole moments, and results of the one-dimensional STIRAP model suggest the possibility of coherently transferring weakly bound complexes to the rovibrational ground state.</description>

      <title>Soliton resuscitations: asymmetric revivals of the breathing mode of an atomic bright soliton in a harmonic trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09016v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An atomic bright soliton realised in a quasi-one-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensate can be considered as an open quantum system. The soliton's breathing mode, for example, is damped by emission of atoms from the soliton to spatial infinity, which thus acts as a Markovian environment for the soliton. If the soliton is held in a shallow harmonic trap, however, the environment becomes non-Markovian: emitted atoms oscillate in the trap and eventually return to the soliton, interfering with it, producing periodic revivals of the breathing mode (``resuscitations''). The amplitude envelopes of these breathing revivals shows a curious asymmetry, with a gradual increase in breathing amplitude followed by sudden drop in amplitude that becomes more and more pronounced in later revivals. We explain this asymmetrical revival pattern in the non-Markovian revivals by deriving a close analytical approximation to the Bogoliubov-de Gennes frequency spectrum for the weakly trapped soliton.</description>

      <title>Non-Equilibrium Probing of Topological Supersolids in Spin-Orbit-Coupled Dipolar Condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14578v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A chiral supersolid is a quantum phase that simultaneously exhibits crystalline order, superfluidity, and topological spin texture, with spontaneously broken translational, U(1) gauge, and chiral symmetries. Here, we demonstrate a chiral supersolid with tunable non-equilibrium dynamics in a spin-orbit coupled dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate. By adjusting dipolar interaction and spin-orbit coupling, we uncover two distinct quantum phase transitions: (i) a first-order transition from a single skyrmion superfluid to a triangular meron supersolid, and (ii) a second-order transition from this superfluid to a square skyrmion supersolid. These phases are characterized by their lattice symmetries, nonclassical rotational inertia, and spin textures. Under parity-time symmetric dissipation, we predict phase-dependent damping of the current oscillations, directly linked to the superfluid fraction. The predicted chiral supersolid phase can be experimentally observed in ultracold magnetic atoms with spin-orbit coupling. Our results establish dipolar quantum gases as a platform for designing topological matter with spintronic functionality.</description>

      <title>Hierarchy of pairing in imbalanced three-component one-dimensional Fermi gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21546v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a one-dimensional, three-component Fermi gas with population imbalance using the Bogoliubov-de Gennes mean-field approach. We specifically consider pairing in two channels while deliberately excluding the third by setting its interaction strength to zero. By systematically varying the interaction strength and population imbalance, we identify a rich set of spatially modulated superfluid states, including structures akin to the Larkin-Ovchinnikov phase and phase-separated domains. A clear hierarchy emerges in the pairing behavior, shaped by the competition between the local density of states and the Fermi momentum mismatch. A fidelity-based analysis of the density further distinguishes smooth crossovers from sharp spatial reorganizations. Our results shed light on how pairing symmetry and population imbalance determine the structure of spatially inhomogeneous superfluid phases in multicomponent systems with reduced dimensionality.</description>

      <title>Universal Thermodynamics of Dunkl-Deformed Bose Gases: From Power-Law Traps to Physical Bounds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12124v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study an ideal Bose gas confined by a $D$-dimensional power-law potential within the framework of the Dunkl formalism. By analyzing the combined effects of spatial dimensionality and trap geometry, we derive universal expressions for the thermodynamic quantities, which depend solely on a single parameter. This reduction reveals the existence of universality classes that apply to any power-law potential, regardless of its specific form.</description>

      <title>Generalised BBGKY hierarchy for near-integrable dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00593v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider quantum and classical many-body Hamiltonian systems that combine integrable contact interactions with generic two-body long-range potentials. We show that the time evolution of local observables can be formulated as a generalized Bogoliubov-Born-Green-Kirkwood-Yvon (gBBGKY) hierarchy, built on the quasiparticle densities of the underlying integrable model and their correlations. Starting from an ansatz for the state at time t, which we denote the correlated fluid cell ensemble, we derive this hierarchy and demonstrate that it exactly reproduces the dynamics of one- and multi-point correlation functions in perturbed integrable models at all times. These predictions are validated against microscopic molecular-dynamics simulations with perfect agreement. In the late-time regime, approach to the Gibbs ensemble is mediated by a Boltzmann-style scattering integral featuring a complex interplay of contact integrable and long-range collision processes. In the specific case of dipolar gases-where the relevant matrix elements are known-we verify that our collision integral exactly recovers the Fermi's golden rule result and provide a full theoretical characterization of the experimental observations of [Tang et al. Phys. Rev. X 8, 021030 2018]. Our framework thus demonstrates how the BBGKY approach can be systematically extended to include strong local interactions, making it applicable to a broad class of experimentally relevant systems, from one-dimensional dipolar cold-atom gases to Lennard -Jones interacting molecules.</description>

      <title>Geometric Floquet theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07029v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive Floquet theory from quantum geometry. We identify quasienergy folding as a consequence of a broken gauge group of the adiabatic gauge potential $U(1){\mapsto}\mathbb{Z}$. Fixing instead the gauge freedom using the parallel-transport gauge uniquely decomposes Floquet dynamics into a purely geometric and a purely dynamical evolution. The dynamical average-energy operator provides an unambiguous sorting of the quasienergy spectrum, identifying a Floquet ground state and suggesting a way to define the filling of Floquet-Bloch bands. We exemplify the features of geometric Floquet theory using an exactly solvable XY model and a non-integrable kicked Ising chain. We elucidate the geometric origin of inherently nonequilibrium effects, like the $\pi$-quasienergy splitting in discrete time crystals or $\pi$-edge modes in anomalous Floquet topological insulators. The spectrum of the average-energy operator is a susceptible indicator for both heating and spatiotemporal symmetry-breaking transitions. Last, we demonstrate that the periodic lab frame Hamiltonian generates transitionless counterdiabatic driving for Floquet eigenstates. This work directly bridges seemingly unrelated areas of nonequilibrium physics.</description>
