      <title>Clarification and Coinduction of Tambara Functors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tambara functors are equivariant analogues of rings arising in representation theory and equivariant homotopy theory. We introduce the notion of a clarified Tambara functor and show that under mild conditions every Tambara functor admits a decomposition as a product of coinductions of clarified Tambara functors; projection onto the non-coinduced part defines a reflective localization we call clarification. Through this perspective we study Nakaoka spectra, Morita invariance and $K$-theory of Tambara functors, field-like and domain-like Tambara functors, $G$-$\mathbb{E}_\infty$-rings, Nullstellensatzian clarified Tambara functors, and transversal Tambara functors.</description>

      <title>Homotopical Dold-Kan Correspondences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work originates from chapters V and VII of Grothendieck's manuscript Pursuing Stacks, which contains a series of questions, as well as a previously unexplored formalism, concerning the interactions between the notion of test categories and homology. The main objective of this thesis is to exhibit homotopical Dold-Kan correspondences in the context of test categories. More precisely, we introduce, following Grothendieck, a functor generalizing simplicial homology, from the category of abelian presheaves over any small category to the derived category of abelian groups in non-negative homological degree. We then look for conditions ensuring that this functor induces an equivalence of categories, after localization by the class of morphisms whose image in the derived category is an isomorphism. Generally, there exists a second class of weak equivalences, arising from the theory of test categories, on the category of abelian presheaves, and we call Whitehead Categories those small categories for which these two classes coincide, generalizing the case of $\Delta$. We show that important examples of test categories are Whitehead categories, notably Joyal's category $\Theta$. We construct, for any Whitehead local test category, a model category structure on its category of abelian presheaves with the weak equivalences mentioned above. We then prove that for any Whitehead test category, the homology functor does induce an equivalence between the localized categories. We obtain this way many examples of homotopical Dold-Kan correspondences, including, among others, the category $\Theta$.</description>

      <title>Persistence Minimal Free Lie Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The minimal Quillen model is a free Lie model for rational spaces proposed by Quillen. Meanwhile, persistence modules are theoretical abstractions of persistent homology. In this paper, we integrate the ideas of rational homotopy theory and persistence modules to construct the persistence minimal Quillen model and discuss its stability. Our results provide a new algebraic framework for topological data analysis, which is more refined compared to directly computing the homology groups of the filtration of simplicial complexes. Furthermore, the stability results for persistence minimal Lie models ensure that our model is well-founded.</description>

      <title>Block-Decomposition for 3-Parameter Persistence Modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2020, Cochoy and Oudot got the necessary and sufficient condition of the block-decomposition of 2-parameter persistence modules $\mathbb{R}^2 \to \textbf{Vec}_{\Bbbk}$. And in 2024, Lebovici, Lerch and Oudot resolve the problem of block-decomposability for multi-parameter persistence modules. Following the approach of Cochoy and Oudot's proof of block-decomposability for 2-parameter persistence modules, we rediscuss the necessary and sufficient conditions for the block decomposition of the 3-parameter persistence modules $\mathbb{R}^3 \to \textbf{Vec}_{\Bbbk}$. Our most important contribution is to generalize the strong exactness of 2-parameter persistence modules to the case of 3-parameter persistence modules. What's more, the generalized method allows us to understand why there is no block decomposition in general persistence modules to some extent.</description>

      <title>Computing Projective Implicit Representations from Poset Towers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A family of simplicial complexes, connected with simplicial maps and indexed by a poset $P$, is called a poset tower. The concept of poset towers subsumes classical objects of study in the persistence literature, as, for example, one-critical multi-filtrations and zigzag filtrations, but also allows multi-critical simplices and arbitrary simplicial maps. The homology of a poset tower gives rise to a $P$-persistence module. To compute this homology globally over $P$, in the spirit of the persistence algorithm, we consider the homology of a chain complex of $P$-persistence modules, $C_{\ell-1}\xleftarrow{}C_\ell\xleftarrow{}C_{\ell+1}$, induced by the simplices of the poset tower. Contrary to the case of one-critical filtrations, the chain-modules $C_\ell$ of a poset tower can have a complicated structure. In this work, we tackle the problem of computing a representation of such a chain complex segment by projective modules and $P$-graded matrices, which we call a projective implicit representation (PiRep). We give efficient algorithms to compute asymptotically minimal projective resolutions (up to the second term) of the chain modules and the boundary maps and compute a PiRep from these resolutions. Our algorithms are tailored to the chain complexes and resolutions coming from poset towers and take advantage of their special structure. In the context of poset towers, they are fully general and could potentially serve as a foundation for developing more efficient algorithms on specific posets.</description>

      <title>Hypergraph Neural Sheaf Diffusion: A Symmetric Simplicial Set Framework for Higher-Order Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The absence of intrinsic adjacency relations and orientation systems in hypergraphs creates fundamental challenges for constructing sheaf Laplacians of arbitrary degrees. We resolve these limitations through symmetric simplicial sets derived directly from hypergraphs, which encode all possible oriented subrelations within each hyperedge as ordered tuples. This construction canonically defines adjacency via facet maps while inherently preserving hyperedge provenance. We establish that the normalized degree zero sheaf Laplacian on our induced symmetric simplicial set reduces exactly to the traditional graph normalized sheaf Laplacian when restricted to graphs, validating its mathematical consistency with prior graph-based sheaf theory. Furthermore, the induced structure preserves all structural information from the original hypergraph, ensuring that every multi-way relational detail is faithfully retained. Leveraging this framework, we introduce Hypergraph Neural Sheaf Diffusion (HNSD), the first principled extension of Neural Sheaf Diffusion (NSD) to hypergraphs. HNSD operates via normalized degree zero sheaf Laplacians over symmetric simplicial sets, resolving orientation ambiguity and adjacency sparsity inherent to hypergraph learning. Experimental evaluations demonstrate HNSD's competitive performance across established benchmarks.</description>

Abstract: Let $V$ be a finite set. Let $\mathcal{K}$ be a simplicial complex with its vertices in $V$. In this paper, we discuss some differential calculus on $V$. We construct some constrained homology groups of $\mathcal{K}$ by using the differential calculus on $V$. Moreover, we define an independent hypergraph to be the complement of a simplicial complex in the complete hypergraph on $V$. Let $\mathcal{L}$ be an independent hypergraph with its vertices in $V$. We construct some constrained cohomology groups of $\mathcal{L}$ by using the differential calculus on $V$.</description>

      <title>Sectional category with respect to group actions and sequential topological complexity of fibre bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00139v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a $G$-space. In this paper, we introduce the notion of sectional category with respect to $G$. As a result, we obtain $G$-homotopy invariants: the LS category with respect to $G$, the sequential topological complexity with respect to $G$ (which is same as the weak sequential equivariant topological complexity $\mathrm{TC}_{k,G}^w(X)$ in the sense of Farber and Oprea), and the strong sequential topological complexity with respect to $G$, denoted by $\mathrm{cat}_G^{\#}(X)$, $\mathrm{TC}_{k,G}^{\#}(X)$, and $\mathrm{TC}_{k,G}^{\#,*}(X)$, respectively. We explore several relationships among these invariants and well-known ones, such as the LS category, the sequential (equivariant) topological complexity, and the sequential strong equivariant topological complexity. In one of our main results, we give an additive upper bound for $\mathrm{TC}_k(E)$ for a fibre bundle $F \hookrightarrow E \to B$ with structure group $G$ in terms of certain motion planning covers of the base $B$ and the invariant $\mathrm{TC}_{k,G}^{\#,*}(F)$ or $\mathrm{cat}_{G^k}^{\#}(F^k)$, where the fibre $F$ is viewed as a $G$-space. As applications of these results, we give bounds on the sequential topological complexity of generalized projective product spaces and mapping tori.</description>

      <title>Double complexes for configuration spaces and hypergraphs on manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16545v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider hypergraphs whose vertices are distinct points moving smoothly on a Riemannian manifold M. We take these hypergraphs as graded submanifolds of configuration spaces. We construct double complexes of differential forms on configuration spaces. Then we construct double complexes of differential forms on hypergraphs which are sub-double complexes of the double complex for the ambient configuration space. Among these double complexes for hypergraphs, the infimum double complex and the supremum double complex are quasi-isomorphic concerning the boundary maps induced from vertex deletion of the hyperedges. In particular, all the double complexes are identical if the hypergraph is a $\Delta$-submanifold of the ambient configuration space.</description>

Abstract: We discuss the role of higher Segal spaces at the interface of cyclic polytopes, orientals, and higher correspondences. Along the way we review examples from algebraic K-theory, show how cyclic polytopes provide a geometric model for the definition of orientals, and establish a characterization of higher Segal spaces as lax monadic structures in higher correspondence categories.</description>

      <title>Geometric universal Jones invariant from configurations on ovals in the disc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17245v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct geometrically a universal Jones invariant as a limit of invariants given by graded intersections in configuration spaces. For any fixed level $\mathcal N$, we construct a new knot invariant, called "$\mathcal N^{th}$ Unified Jones invariant" globalising topologically all coloured Jones polynomials at levels less than $\mathcal N$. It is defined via the set of intersection points between Lagrangian submanifolds supported on arcs and ovals in the disc.
  Habiro's famous invariant for knots is a universal invariant recovering each coloured Jones polynomial. Willetts modified Habiro's ring and defined a universal invariant recovering coloured Jones polynomials and the ADO invariant divided by the Alexander polynomials. The universal Jones invariant that we construct belongs to a different ring that comes with a map to Habiro-Willetts's ring. We prove that our invariant recovers Habiro-Willetts's invariant. The difference is that our invariant is constructed as a limit of new knot invariants, the $\mathcal N^{th}$ unified Jones invariants. These invariants in turn provide a geometrical understanding of sets of all coloured Jones polynomials of bounded colour, collecting more information as we increase the colour.
  This article provides part of the set-up for a sequel, where we construct geometrically two universal link invariants. These invariants, universal Jones link invariant and universal ADO link invariant, globalise all coloured Jones polynomials and all ADO link invariants respectively. They are constructed as limits of link invariants that see all coloured Jones link invariants and coloured Alexander link invariants with bounded (multi) colours respectively. This answers the open problem of defining universal non-semisimple link invariants.</description>

      <title>The commutator subalgebra of the Lie algebra associated with a right-angled Coxeter group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10305v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the graded Lie algebra $L(RC_K)$ associated with the lower central series of a right-angled Coxeter group $RC_K$. We prove that its commutator subalgebra is a quotient of the polynomial ring over an auxiliary Lie subalgebra $N_K$ of the graph Lie algebra $L_K$, and conjecture that the quotient map is an isomorphism. The epimorphism is defined in terms of a new operation in the associated Lie algebra, which corresponds to the squaring and has an analogue in homotopy theory. We show that the universal enveloping algebra $U(N_K)$ is the mod 2 loop homology algebra of the corresponding moment-angle complex $Z_K$. This allows us to give a presentation of the Lie algebra $N_K$ by generators and relations.</description>
