      <title>Numerical Analysis of Locally Adaptive Penalty Methods For The Navier-Stokes Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Penalty methods relax the incompressibility condition and uncouple velocity and pressure. Experience with them indicates that the velocity error is sensitive to the choice of penalty parameter $\epsilon$. So far, there is no effective \'a prior formula for $\epsilon$. Recently, Xie developed an adaptive penalty scheme for the Stokes problem that picks the penalty parameter $\epsilon$ self-adaptively element by element small where $\nabla \cdot u^h$ is large. Her numerical tests gave accurate fluid predictions. The next natural step, developed here, is to extend the algorithm with supporting analysis to the non-linear, time-dependent incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. In this report, we prove its unconditional stability, control of $\|\nabla \cdot u^h\|$, and provide error estimates. We confirm the predicted convergence rates with numerical tests.</description>

      <title>Linear and nonlinear filtering for a two-layer quasi-geostrophic ocean model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although the two-layer quasi-geostrophic equations (2QGE) are a simplified model for the dynamics of a stratified, wind-driven ocean, their numerical simulation is still plagued by the need for high resolution to capture the full spectrum of turbulent scales. Since such high resolution would lead to unreasonable computational times, it is typical to resort to coarse low-resolution meshes combined with the so-called eddy viscosity parameterization to account for the diffusion mechanisms that are not captured due to mesh under-resolution. We propose to enable the use of further coarsened meshes by adding a (linear or nonlinear) differential low-pass to the 2QGE, without changing the eddy viscosity coefficient. While the linear filter introduces constant (additional) artificial viscosity everywhere in the domain, the nonlinear filter relies on an indicator function to determine where and how much artificial viscosity is needed. Through several numerical results for a double-gyre wind forcing benchmark, we show that with the nonlinear filter we obtain accurate results with very coarse meshes, thereby drastically reducing the computational time (speed up ranging from 30 to 300).</description>

      <title>The Ramshaw-Mesina Hybrid Algorithm applied to the Navier Stokes Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1991, Ramshaw and Mesina proposed a novel synthesis of penalty methods and artificial compression methods. When the two were balanced they found the combination was 3-4 orders more accurate than either alone. This report begins the study of their interesting method applied to the Navier-Stokes equations. We perform stability analysis, semi-discrete error analysis, and tests of the algorithm. Although most of the results for implicit time discretizations of our numerical tests comply with theirs for explicit time discretizations, the behavior in damping pressure oscillations and violations of incompressibility are different from their findings and our heuristic analysis.</description>

      <title>Aerodynamic Design and Performance Evaluation of Pipe Diffuser for Centrifugal Compressor of Micro Gas Turbine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces a new approach to optimize the geometrical parameters of pipe diffusers in centrifugal compressors for Micro Gas Turbines, tailored for a 100 kW unit. The methodology draws insights from optimized airfoil-type diffusers and addresses the unique topological challenges of pipe diffusers, using diffuser maps to enhance design precision. The effectiveness of this method is validated through 3D-RANS based steady CFD simulations, using the ANSYS CFX solver. Comparative performance assessments at 100 percent rotation speed show that the best-performing pipe diffuser slightly trails its airfoil counterpart in efficiency, achieving 82.2 percent total-to-total isentropic efficiency compared to 84.4 percent. However, it offers a reduced frontal area, enhancing compactness. The analysis also reveals a dualistic impact from the leading-edge geometry of the pipe diffuser, which generates two counter-rotating vortices. These vortices have beneficial effects in pseudo and semi-vaneless spaces while introducing destabilizing factors in channel spaces. This investigation highlights potential trade-offs and outlines conditions under which adverse effects dominate, leading to significant flow separation. These insights pave the way for refining diffuser designs to better balance performance with spatial efficiency, marking a critical step forward in compressor technology of micro gas turbine for decentralized power systems.</description>

      <title>A Distributions-based Approach for Data-Consistent Inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate a novel approach to solve a class of stochastic problems, referred to as data-consistent inverse (DCI) problems, which involve the characterization of a probability measure on the parameters of a computational model whose subsequent push-forward matches an observed probability measure on specified quantities of interest (QoI) typically associated with the outputs from the computational model. Whereas prior DCI solution methodologies focused on either constructing non-parametric estimates of the densities or the probabilities of events associated with the pre-image of the QoI map, we develop and analyze a constrained quadratic optimization approach based on estimating push-forward measures using weighted empirical distribution functions. The method proposed here is more suitable for low-data regimes or high-dimensional problems than the density-based method, as well as for problems where the probability measure does not admit a density. Numerical examples are included to demonstrate the performance of the method and to compare with the density-based approach where applicable.</description>

      <title>FCNCP: A Coupled Nonnegative CANDECOMP/PARAFAC Decomposition Based on Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the field of brain science, data sharing across servers is becoming increasingly challenging due to issues such as industry competition, privacy security, and administrative procedure policies and regulations. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop new methods for data analysis and processing that enable scientific collaboration without data sharing. In view of this, this study proposes to study and develop a series of efficient non-negative coupled tensor decomposition algorithm frameworks based on federated learning called FCNCP for the EEG data arranged on different servers. It combining the good discriminative performance of tensor decomposition in high-dimensional data representation and decomposition, the advantages of coupled tensor decomposition in cross-sample tensor data analysis, and the features of federated learning for joint modelling in distributed servers. The algorithm utilises federation learning to establish coupling constraints for data distributed across different servers. In the experiments, firstly, simulation experiments are carried out using simulated data, and stable and consistent decomposition results are obtained, which verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in this study. Then the FCNCP algorithm was utilised to decompose the fifth-order event-related potential (ERP) tensor data collected by applying proprioceptive stimuli on the left and right hands. It was found that contralateral stimulation induced more symmetrical components in the activation areas of the left and right hemispheres. The conclusions drawn are consistent with the interpretations of related studies in cognitive neuroscience, demonstrating that the method can efficiently process higher-order EEG data and that some key hidden information can be preserved.</description>

      <title>A variational discretization method for mean curvature flows by the Onsager principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mean curvature flow describes the evolution of a surface(a curve) with normal velocity proportional to the local mean curvature. It has many applications in mathematics, science and engineering. In this paper, we develop a numerical method for mean curvature flows by using the Onsager principle as an approximation tool. We first show that the mean curvature flow can be derived naturally from the Onsager variational principle. Then we consider a piecewisely linear approximation of the curve and derive a discrete geometric flow. The discrete flow is described by a system of ordinary differential equations for the nodes of the discrete curve. We prove that the discrete system preserve the energy dissipation structure in the framework of the Onsager principle and this implies the energy decreasing property. The ODE system can be solved by an improved Euler scheme and this leads to an efficient fully discrete scheme. We first consider the method for a simple mean curvature flow and then extend it to volume preserving mean curvature flow and also a wetting problem on substrates. Numerical examples show that the method has optimal convergence rate and works well for all the three problems.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo method and the random isentropic Euler system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show several results on convergence of the Monte Carlo method applied to consistent approximations of the isentropic Euler system of gas dynamics with uncertain initial data. Our method is based on combination of several new concepts. We work with the dissipative weak solutions that can be seen as a universal closure of consistent approximations. Further, we apply the set-valued version of the Strong law of large numbers for general multivalued mapping with closed range and the Koml\'os theorem on strong converge of empirical averages of integrable functions. Theoretical results are illustrated by a series of numerical simulations obtained by an unconditionally convergent viscosity finite volume method combined with the Monte Carlo method.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to analyzing overlapping Schwarz methods for N\'{e}d\'{e}lec and Raviart--Thomas vector field problems. The theory is based on new regular stable decompositions for vector fields that are robust to the topology of the domain. Enhanced estimates for the condition numbers of the preconditioned linear systems are derived, dependent linearly on the relative overlap between the overlapping subdomains. Furthermore, we present the numerical experiments which support our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Optimizing the diffusion of overdamped Langevin dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is a preleminary work. Overdamped Langevin dynamics are reversible stochastic differential equations which are commonly used to sample probability measures in high dimensional spaces, such as the ones appearing in computational statistical physics and Bayesian inference. By varying the diffusion coefficient, there are in fact infinitely many reversible overdamped Langevin dynamics which preserve the target probability measure at hand. This suggests to optimize the diffusion coefficient in order to increase the convergence rate of the dynamics, as measured by the spectral gap of the generator associated with the stochastic differential equation. We analytically study this problem here, obtaining in particular necessary conditions on the optimal diffusion coefficient. We also derive an explicit expression of the optimal diffusion in some homogenized limit. Numerical results, both relying on discretizations of the spectral gap problem and Monte Carlo simulations of the stochastic dynamics, demonstrate the increased quality of the sampling arising from an appropriate choice of the diffusion coefficient.</description>

      <title>Low-rank alternating direction doubling algorithm for solving large-scale continuous time algebraic Riccati equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes an effective low-rank alternating direction doubling algorithm (R-ADDA) for computing numerical low-rank solutions to large-scale sparse continuous-time algebraic Riccati matrix equations. The method is based on the alternating direction doubling algorithm (ADDA), utilizing the low-rank property of matrices and employing Cholesky factorization for solving. The advantage of the new algorithm lies in computing only the $2^k$-th approximation during the iterative process, instead of every approximation. Its efficient low-rank formula saves storage space and is highly effective from a computational perspective. Finally, the effectiveness of the new algorithm is demonstrated through theoretical analysis and numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>A general alternating direction implicit iteration method for solving complex symmetric linear systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have introduced the generalized alternating direction implicit iteration (GADI) method for solving large sparse complex symmetric linear systems and proved its convergence properties. Additionally, some numerical results have demonstrated the effectiveness of this algorithm. Furthermore, as an application of the GADI method in solving complex symmetric linear systems, we utilized the flattening operator and Kronecker product properties to solve Lyapunov and Riccati equations with complex coefficients using the GADI method. In solving the Riccati equation, we combined inner and outer iterations, first simplifying the Riccati equation into a Lyapunov equation using the Newton method, and then applying the GADI method for solution. Finally, we provided convergence analysis of the method and corresponding numerical results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we provide theoretical estimates for the ranks of the power functions $f(k) = k^{-\alpha}$, $\alpha&gt;1$ in the quantized tensor train (QTT) format for $k = 1, 2, 3, \ldots, 2^{d}$. Such functions and their several generalizations (e.~g. $f(k) = k^{-\alpha} \cdot e^{-\lambda k}, \lambda &gt; 0$) play an important role in studies of the asymptotic solutions of the aggregation-fragmentation kinetic equations. In order to support the constructed theory we verify the values of QTT-ranks of these functions in practice with the use of the TTSVD procedure and show an agreement between the numerical and analytical results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with model order reduction of parametric Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) using tree-based library approximations. Classical approaches are formulated for PDEs on Hilbert spaces and involve one single linear space to approximate the set of PDE solutions. Here, we develop reduced models relying on a collection of linear or nonlinear approximation spaces called a library, and which can also be formulated on general metric spaces. To build the spaces of the library, we rely on greedy algorithms involving different splitting strategies which lead to a hierarchical tree-based representation. We illustrate through numerical examples that the proposed strategies have a much wider range of applicability in terms of the parametric PDEs that can successfully be addressed. While the classical approach is very efficient for elliptic problems with strong coercivity, we show that the tree-based library approaches can deal with diffusion problems with weak coercivity, convection-diffusion problems, and with transport-dominated PDEs posed on general metric spaces such as the $L^2$-Wasserstein space.</description>

      <title>A hybrid boundary integral-PDE approach for the approximation of the demagnetization potential in micromagnetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The demagnetization field in micromagnetism is given as the gradient of a potential which solves a partial differential equation (PDE) posed in R^d. In its most general form, this PDE is supplied with continuity condition on the boundary of the magnetic domain and the equation includes a discontinuity in the gradient of the potential over the boundary. Typical numerical algorithms to solve this problem relies on the representation of the potential via the Green's function, where a volume and a boundary integral terms need to be accurately approximated. From a computational point of view, the volume integral dominates the computational cost and can be difficult to approximate due to the singularities of the Green's function. In this article, we propose a hybrid model, where the overall potential can be approximated by solving two uncoupled PDEs posed in bounded domains, whereby the boundary conditions of one of the PDEs is obtained by a low cost boundary integral. Moreover, we provide a convergence analysis of the method under two separate theoretical settings; periodic magnetisation, and high-frequency magnetisation. Numerical examples are given to verify the convergence rates.</description>

      <title>End-to-End Mesh Optimization of a Hybrid Deep Learning Black-Box PDE Solver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning has been widely applied to solve partial differential equations (PDEs) in computational fluid dynamics. Recent research proposed a PDE correction framework that leverages deep learning to correct the solution obtained by a PDE solver on a coarse mesh. However, end-to-end training of such a PDE correction model over both solver-dependent parameters such as mesh parameters and neural network parameters requires the PDE solver to support automatic differentiation through the iterative numerical process. Such a feature is not readily available in many existing solvers. In this study, we explore the feasibility of end-to-end training of a hybrid model with a black-box PDE solver and a deep learning model for fluid flow prediction. Specifically, we investigate a hybrid model that integrates a black-box PDE solver into a differentiable deep graph neural network. To train this model, we use a zeroth-order gradient estimator to differentiate the PDE solver via forward propagation. Although experiments show that the proposed approach based on zeroth-order gradient estimation underperforms the baseline that computes exact derivatives using automatic differentiation, our proposed method outperforms the baseline trained with a frozen input mesh to the solver. Moreover, with a simple warm-start on the neural network parameters, we show that models trained by these zeroth-order algorithms achieve an accelerated convergence and improved generalization performance.</description>

      <title>FastVPINNs: Tensor-Driven Acceleration of VPINNs for Complex Geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Variational Physics-Informed Neural Networks (VPINNs) utilize a variational loss function to solve partial differential equations, mirroring Finite Element Analysis techniques. Traditional hp-VPINNs, while effective for high-frequency problems, are computationally intensive and scale poorly with increasing element counts, limiting their use in complex geometries. This work introduces FastVPINNs, a tensor-based advancement that significantly reduces computational overhead and improves scalability. Using optimized tensor operations, FastVPINNs achieve a 100-fold reduction in the median training time per epoch compared to traditional hp-VPINNs. With proper choice of hyperparameters, FastVPINNs surpass conventional PINNs in both speed and accuracy, especially in problems with high-frequency solutions. Demonstrated effectiveness in solving inverse problems on complex domains underscores FastVPINNs' potential for widespread application in scientific and engineering challenges, opening new avenues for practical implementations in scientific machine learning.</description>

      <title>Tracing Pareto-optimal points for multi-objective shape optimization applied to electric machines</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the context of the optimization of rotating electric machines, many different objective functions are of interest and considering this during the optimization is of crucial importance. While evolutionary algorithms can provide a Pareto front straightforwardly and are widely used in this context, derivative-based optimization algorithms can be computationally more efficient. In this case, a Pareto front can be obtained by performing several optimization runs with different weights. In this work, we focus on a free-form shape optimization approach allowing for arbitrary motor geometries. In particular, we propose a way to efficiently obtain Pareto-optimal points by moving along to the Pareto front exploiting a homotopy method based on second order shape derivatives.</description>

      <title>A Quadrature Approach for General-Purpose Batch Bayesian Optimization via Probabilistic Lifting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parallelisation in Bayesian optimisation is a common strategy but faces several challenges: the need for flexibility in acquisition functions and kernel choices, flexibility dealing with discrete and continuous variables simultaneously, model misspecification, and lastly fast massive parallelisation. To address these challenges, we introduce a versatile and modular framework for batch Bayesian optimisation via probabilistic lifting with kernel quadrature, called SOBER, which we present as a Python library based on GPyTorch/BoTorch. Our framework offers the following unique benefits: (1) Versatility in downstream tasks under a unified approach. (2) A gradient-free sampler, which does not require the gradient of acquisition functions, offering domain-agnostic sampling (e.g., discrete and mixed variables, non-Euclidean space). (3) Flexibility in domain prior distribution. (4) Adaptive batch size (autonomous determination of the optimal batch size). (5) Robustness against a misspecified reproducing kernel Hilbert space. (6) Natural stopping criterion.</description>

      <title>Towards a Foundation Model for Partial Differential Equation: Multi-Operator Learning and Extrapolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Foundation models, such as large language models, have demonstrated success in addressing various language and image processing tasks. In this work, we introduce a multi-modal foundation model for scientific problems, named PROSE-PDE. Our model, designed for bi-modality to bi-modality learning, is a multi-operator learning approach which can predict future states of spatiotemporal systems while concurrently learning the underlying governing equations of the physical system. Specifically, we focus on multi-operator learning by training distinct one-dimensional time-dependent nonlinear constant coefficient partial differential equations, with potential applications to many physical applications including physics, geology, and biology. More importantly, we provide three extrapolation studies to demonstrate that PROSE-PDE can generalize physical features through the robust training of multiple operators and that the proposed model can extrapolate to predict PDE solutions whose models or data were unseen during the training. Furthermore, we show through systematic numerical experiments that the utilization of the symbolic modality in our model effectively resolves the well-posedness problems with training multiple operators and thus enhances our model's predictive capabilities.</description>

      <title>Towards optimal sensor placement for inverse problems in spaces of measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.01055v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The objective of this work is to quantify the reconstruction error in sparse inverse problems with measures and stochastic noise, motivated by optimal sensor placement. To be useful in this context, the error quantities must be explicit in the sensor configuration and robust with respect to the source, yet relatively easy to compute in practice, compared to a direct evaluation of the error by a large number of samples. In particular, we consider the identification of a measure consisting of an unknown linear combination of point sources from a finite number of measurements contaminated by Gaussian noise. The statistical framework for recovery relies on two main ingredients: first, a convex but non-smooth variational Tikhonov point estimator over the space of Radon measures and, second, a suitable mean-squared error based on its Hellinger-Kantorovich distance to the ground truth. To quantify the error, we employ a non-degenerate source condition as well as careful linearization arguments to derive a computable upper bound. This leads to asymptotically sharp error estimates in expectation that are explicit in the sensor configuration. Thus they can be used to estimate the expected reconstruction error for a given sensor configuration and guide the placement of sensors in sparse inverse problems.</description>

      <title>An efficient saddle search method for ordered phase transitions involving translational invariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.07108v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we propose an efficient nullspace-preserving saddle search (NPSS) method for a class of phase transitions involving translational invariance, where the critical states are often degenerate. The NPSS method includes two stages, escaping from the basin and searching for the index-1 generalized saddle point. The NPSS method climbs upward from the generalized local minimum in segments to overcome the challenges of degeneracy. In each segment, an effective ascent direction is ensured by keeping this direction orthogonal to the nullspace of the initial state in this segment. This method can escape the basin quickly and converge to the transition states. We apply the NPSS method to the phase transitions between crystals, and between crystal and quasicrystal, based on the Landau-Brazovskii and Lifshitz-Petrich free energy functionals. Numerical results show a good performance of the NPSS method.</description>

      <title>Generalized extrapolation methods based on compositions of a basic 2nd-order scheme</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.11581v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose new linear combinations of compositions of a basic second-order scheme with appropriately chosen coefficients to construct higher order numerical integrators for differential equations. They can be considered as a generalization of extrapolation methods and multi-product expansions. A general analysis is provided and new methods up to order 8 are built and tested. The new approach is shown to reduce the latency problem when implemented in a parallel environment and leads to schemes that are significantly more efficient than standard extrapolation when the linear combination is delayed by a number of steps.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12554v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantized tensor trains (QTTs) have recently emerged as a framework for the numerical discretization of continuous functions, with the potential for widespread applications in numerical analysis. However, the theory of QTT approximation is not fully understood. In this work, we advance this theory from the point of view of multiscale polynomial interpolation. This perspective clarifies why QTT ranks decay with increasing depth, quantitatively controls QTT rank in terms of smoothness of the target function, and explains why certain functions with sharp features and poor quantitative smoothness can still be well approximated by QTTs. The perspective also motivates new practical and efficient algorithms for the construction of QTTs from function evaluations on multiresolution grids.</description>

      <title>Generalised Adaptive Cross Approximation for Convolution Quadrature based Boundary Element Formulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11219v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The acoustic wave equation is solved in time domain with a boundary element formulation. The time discretisation is performed with the generalised convolution quadrature method and for the spatial approximation standard lowest order elements are used. Collocation and Galerkin methods are applied. In the interest of increasing the efficiency of the boundary element method, a low-rank approximation such as the adaptive cross approximation (ACA) is carried out. We discuss about a generalisation of the ACA to approximate a three-dimensional array of data, i.e., usual boundary element matrices at several complex frequencies. This method is used within the generalised convolution quadrature (gCQ) method to obtain a real time domain formulation. The behaviour of the proposed method is studied with three examples, a unit cube, a unit cube with a reentrant corner, and a unit ball. The properties of the method are preserved in the data sparse representation and a significant reduction in storage is obtained.</description>

For non-smooth initial values, the regularity of the mild solution is investigated, and an error estimate is derived with the spatial $ L^2 $-norm. For smooth initial values, two error estimates with the general spatial $ L^q $-norms are established.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10756v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A mass-conservative high-order unfitted finite element method for convection-diffusion equations in evolving domains is proposed. The space-time method presented in [P. Hansbo, M. G. Larson, S. Zahedi, Comput. Methods Appl. Mech. Engrg. 307 (2016)] is extended to naturally achieve mass conservation by utilizing Reynold's transport theorem. Furthermore, by partitioning the time-dependent domain into macroelements, a more efficient stabilization procedure for the cut finite element method in time-dependent domains is presented. Numerical experiments illustrate that the method fulfills mass conservation, attains high-order convergence, and the condition number of the resulting system matrix is controlled while sparsity is increased. Problems in bulk domains as well as coupled bulk-surface problems are considered.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10898v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an efficient implementation of the numerical tensor-train (TT) based algorithm solving the multicomponent coagulation equation preserving the nonnegativeness of solution. Unnatural negative elements in the constructed approximation arise due to the errors of the low-rank decomposition and discretization scheme. In this work, we propose to apply the rank-one corrections in the TT-format proportional to the minimal negative element. Such an element can be found via application of the global optimization methods that can be fully implemented within efficient operations in the tensor train format. We incorporate this trick into the time-integration scheme for the multicomponent coagulation equation and also use it for post-processing of the stationary solution for the problem with the source of particles.</description>

Abstract: We present two approaches to constructing isoparametric Virtual Element Methods of arbitrary order for linear elliptic partial differential equations on general two-dimensional domains. The first method approximates the variational problem transformed onto a computational reference domain. The second method computes a virtual domain and uses bespoke polynomial approximation operators to construct a computable method. Both methods are shown to converge optimally, a behaviour confirmed in practice for the solution of problems posed on curved domains.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Optimal Control Matching</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02027v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stochastic optimal control, which has the goal of driving the behavior of noisy systems, is broadly applicable in science, engineering and artificial intelligence. Our work introduces Stochastic Optimal Control Matching (SOCM), a novel Iterative Diffusion Optimization (IDO) technique for stochastic optimal control that stems from the same philosophy as the conditional score matching loss for diffusion models. That is, the control is learned via a least squares problem by trying to fit a matching vector field. The training loss, which is closely connected to the cross-entropy loss, is optimized with respect to both the control function and a family of reparameterization matrices which appear in the matching vector field. The optimization with respect to the reparameterization matrices aims at minimizing the variance of the matching vector field. Experimentally, our algorithm achieves lower error than all the existing IDO techniques for stochastic optimal control for three out of four control problems, in some cases by an order of magnitude. The key idea underlying SOCM is the path-wise reparameterization trick, a novel technique that may be of independent interest. Code at https://github.com/facebookresearch/SOC-matching</description>

      <title>Global Convergence of High-Order Regularization Methods with Sums-of-Squares Taylor Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03035v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-order tensor methods that employ Taylor-based local models (of degree $p\ge 3$) within adaptive regularization frameworks have been recently proposed for both convex and nonconvex optimization problems. They have been shown to have superior, and even optimal, worst-case global convergence rates and local rates compared to Newton's method. Finding rigorous and efficient techniques for minimizing the Taylor polynomial sub-problems remains a challenging aspect for these algorithms. Ahmadi et al. recently introduced a tensor method based on sum-of-squares (SoS) reformulations, so that each Taylor polynomial sub-problem in their approach can be tractably minimized using semidefinite programming (SDP); however, the global convergence and complexity of their method have not been addressed for general nonconvex problems. This paper introduces an algorithmic framework that combines the Sum of Squares (SoS) Taylor model with adaptive regularization techniques for nonconvex smooth optimization problems. Each iteration minimizes an SoS Taylor model, offering a polynomial cost per iteration. For general nonconvex functions, the worst-case evaluation complexity bound is $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$, while for strongly convex functions, an improved evaluation complexity bound of $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-\frac{1}{p}})$ is established. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first global rate analysis for an adaptive regularization algorithm with a tractable high-order sub-problem in nonconvex smooth optimization, opening the way for further improvements.</description>
