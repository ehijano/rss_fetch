      <title>Comment on "Quantum-Mechanical Suppression of Gas Accretion by Primordial Black Holes"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It was recently claimed (arXiv:2409.09081v1 [astro-ph.HE]) that accretion of ordinary matter on black holes of mass $(6\times 10^{14}-4\times10^{19})\,$g would be inhibited by quantum mechanical effects, namely the de Broglie wavelength of the electron being larger than the Schwarzschild radius. However the conclusion is based on considering accretion of a single atom over the age of the Universe. There is no suppression of the accretion rate per atom on such black holes.</description>

      <title>Stars or gas? Constraining the hardening processes of massive black-hole binaries with LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive black-hole binaries will be the loudest sources detectable by LISA. These systems are predicted to form during the hierarchical assembly of cosmic structures and coalesce by interacting with the surrounding environment. The hardening phase of their orbit is driven by either stars or gas and encodes distinctive features into the binary black holes that can potentially be reconstructed with gravitational-wave observations. We present a Bayesian framework to assess the likelihood of massive mergers being hardened by either gaseous or stellar interactions. We use state-of-the-art astrophysical models tracking the cosmological evolution of massive black-hole binaries and construct a large number of simulated catalogs of sources detectable by LISA. From these, we select a representative catalog and run both parameter estimation assuming a realistic LISA response as well model comparison capturing selection effects. Our results suggest that, at least within the context of the adopted models, future LISA observations can confidently constrain whether stars or gas are responsible for the binary hardening. We stress that accurate astrophysical modeling of the black-hole spins and the inclusion of subdominant emission modes in the adopted signal might be crucial to avoid systematic biases.</description>

      <title>The Case for Super-Eddington Accretion: Connecting Weak X-ray and UV Line Emission in JWST Broad-Line AGN During the First Gyr of Cosmic Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A multitude of JWST studies reveal a surprising over-abundance of over-massive accreting super-massive blackholes (SMBHs) -- leading to a deepening tension between theory and observation in the first billion years of cosmic time. Across X-ray to infrared wavelengths, models built off of pre-JWST predictions fail to easily reproduce observed AGN signatures (or lack thereof), driving uncertainty around the true nature of these sources. Using a sample of JWST AGN identified via their broadened Halpha emission and covered by the deepest X-ray surveys, we find neither any measurable X-ray emission nor any detection of high-ionization emission lines frequently associated with accreting SMBHs. We propose that these sources are accreting at or beyond the Eddington limit, which reduces the need for efficient production of heavy SMBH seeds at cosmic dawn. Using a theoretical model of super-Eddington accretion, we can produce the observed relative dearth of both X-ray and ultraviolet emission, as well as the high Balmer decrements, without the need for significant dust attenuation. This work indicates that super-Eddington accretion is easily achieved through-out the early Universe, and further study is required to determine what environments are required to trigger this mode of black hole growth.</description>

      <title>The Variability of Persistent Radio Sources of Fast Radio Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over 700 bright millisecond-duration radio transients, known as Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), have been identified to date. Nevertheless, the origin of FRBs remains unknown. The two repeating FRBs (FRB 20121102A and FRB 20190520B) have been verified to be associated with persistent radio sources (PRSs), making them the best candidates to study the nature of FRBs. Monitoring the variability in PRSs is essential for understanding their physical nature. We conducted 22 observations of the PRSs linked to FRB 20121102A and FRB 20190520B using the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA), to study their variability. We have observed significant flux variability for the PRSs of FRB 20121102A and FRB 20190520B, with a confidence level exceeding 99.99%, based on the observations covering the longest timescale recorded to date. The observed variability of the two PRSs exhibits no significant difference in amplitude across both short and long timescales. We found that the radio-derived star formation rates of the two FRB hosts are significantly higher than those measured by the optical $H_{\alpha}$ emissions, indicating that their host galaxies are highly obscured or most radio emissions are not from star formation processes. The observed timescale of PRS flux evolution constrained the magnetic field of FRB 20121102A with $B_\parallel\gtrsim1~{\rm mG}$ and FRB 20190520B with $B_\parallel\gtrsim0.1~{\rm mG}$.</description>

      <title>Statistical properties and cosmological applications of fast radio bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast radio burst (FRB) is a type of extragalactic radio signal characterized by millisecond duration, extremely high brightness temperature, and large dispersion measure. It remains a mystery in the universe. Advancements in instrumentation have led to the discovery of 816 FRB sources and 7622 bursts from 67 repeating FRBs now. This field is undergoing rapid development, rapidly advancing our understanding of the physics of FRBs as new observational data accumulates. The accumulation of data has also promoted our exploration of our universe. In this review, we summarize the statistical analysis and cosmological applications using large samples of FRBs, including the energy functions, the waiting time distributions of repeating FRBs, the probe of "missing baryons" and circumgalactic medium in the universe, measurements of cosmological parameters, exploration of the epoch of reionization history, and study of the gravitational lensing of FRBs.</description>

      <title>Revealing the state transition of Cen X-3 at high spectral resolution with Chandra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cen X-3 is a compact, high-mass X-ray binary (HMXRB), likely powered by Roche lobe overflow. We present a phase-resolved X-ray spectral and timing analysis of a target of opportunity \textit{Chandra} observation made during a low-flux to high-flux transition. The high-resolution spectra allow us to delve into the events that occurred during this episode. The spectrum is described by a single black body absorbed by a local column density of the order of $10^{23-24}$ cm$^{-2}$, which is one to two orders of magnitude higher than found for previous analyses of data taken at similar orbital phases. Such a large column produces a Compton shoulder in the Fe K$\alpha$ line. The transition appears to be caused by the onset of efficient cooling, which cools the plasma by 10 million degrees in just 10 ks, allowing matter to enter the magnetosphere. This happens after a major disturbance, probably the arrival of a train of wind clumps with individual masses in the range $10^{19-20}$ g. This train moves ballistically in an eccentric orbit around the NS, producing a distinctive Doppler modulation in the \ion{Fe}{xxv} line.</description>

      <title>Prompt and afterglow analysis of the Fermi-LAT detected GRB 230812B</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prompt emission of GRB 230812B stands out as one of the most luminous events observed by both the Fermi-GBM and LAT. Prompt emission spectral analysis (both time-integrated and resolved) of this burst supports an additional thermal component together with a non-thermal, indicating the hybrid jet composition. The spectral parameters alpha, Ep, and kT of the best-fit Band+Blackbody model show a tacking behaviour with the intensity. Further, the low energy afterglow emission is consistent with the synchrotron emission from the external forward shock in the ISM medium. LAT detected very high energy emission (VHE) deviating from the synchrotron mechanism, possibly originating from the Lorentz boosting of prompt emission photons by accelerated electrons in the external shock via Inverse Compton (IC) or Synchrotron Self Compton (SSC) emission mechanisms. The comparison of the prompt and afterglow emission properties of this burst revealed that, unlike the bright prompt emission, the afterglow of GRB 230812B is fainter than the other SN-detected bright bursts (GRB 130427A and GRB 171010A) at a similar redshift.</description>

      <title>Self-Consistent Disk-Reflection Analysis of the Black-Hole Candidate X-ray Binary MAXI J1813-095 with NICER, Swift, Chandra, and NuSTAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present our analysis of MAXI J1813-095 during its hard state ``stalled'' outburst in 2018. This self-consistent analysis has been carried out using \NICER, \Swift, \Chandra, and {\NuSTAR} throughout seven observations of MAXI J1813-095. We find a relativistic iron line at $\sim$6.5 keV from the inner region of the accretion disk. Our results are consistent with a slightly truncated disk or non-truncated disk for an inner radius of $\sim$2$R_\mathrm{g}$ and minimum spin of $&gt;$0.7 with a best value of $\sim0.9$, assuming $R_\mathrm{in}$ reaches the innermost stable circular orbit at $\it{L_\mathrm{x}}$ $\sim$ 1\% $\it{L_\mathrm{Edd}}$. We analyzed MAXI J1813-095 over its outburst employing a spectral model which self-consistently couples the seed disk photons to the Comptonization and reflection components, also inclusive of reflection Comptonization. The unique aspect of this work is a reflection fraction of order unity, which is significantly higher than previous studies of this source, and is a consequence of applying the self-consistent disk-Comptonization-reflection spectral model. Other key parameters such as inclination and inner radius are found to be consistent with other works. works.</description>

      <title>Composition-asymmetric and sheared relativistic magnetic reconnection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relativistic magnetic reconnection studies have focused on symmetric configurations so far, where the upstream plasma has identical properties on each side of the layer. The boundary layer between a relativistic jet and an accretion flow forming around a supermassive black hole may present an asymmetric configuration in terms of plasma composition, bulk velocity, temperature and magnetization. In this work, we aim to conduct the first study of relativistic magnetic reconnection where the upstream plasma is composed of electron-positron pairs on one side, and electrons and ions on the other. We also investigate the role of a relativistic symmetric shear flow applied along the reconnecting field lines. We simulate magnetic reconnection using two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations. The initial setup is adapted from a classic Harris layer without guide field, modified to accommodate plasma-composition and shear asymmetries in the upstream medium. For a composition-asymmetric setup, we find that the reconnection dynamics is driven by the electron-ion side, which is the plasma with the lowest magnetization. The energy partition favors accelerating ions at the expense of electrons even more than in a corresponding symmetric setup. With respect to shear, a super-Alfv\'enic upstream decreases the laboratory-frame reconnection rate, but, unlike in non-relativistic studies, does not shut off reconnection completely. The asymmetries examined in this work diminish the overall efficiency of electron acceleration relative to corresponding symmetric configurations. In the context of a black hole jet-disk boundary, asymmetric reconnection alone is probably not efficient at accelerating electrons to very high energies, but it might facilitate plasma mixing and particle injection for other acceleration channels at the interface.</description>

      <title>Probing the low-velocity regime of non-radiative shocks with neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-radiative shocks accelerate particles and heat astrophysical plasmas. While supernova remnants are the most well-studied example, neutron star (NS) bow shocks are also non-radiative and Balmer-dominated. NS bow shocks are likely ubiquitous in the interstellar medium due to their large speeds imparted at birth, and they are thought to be a discrete source population contributing to the Galactic cosmic ray spectrum. To date, nine NS bow shocks have been directly observed in H$\alpha$ images. Most of these shocks have been characterized using narrowband H$\alpha$ imaging and slit spectroscopy, which do not resolve the multi-component velocity structure of the shocks and their spatial geometry. Here we present integral field spectroscopy of three NS bow shocks: J0742$-$2822, J1741$-$2054, and J2225$+$6535 (the Guitar Nebula). We measure the shock properties simultaneously in four dimensions: the 2D projected shock morphology, the radial velocity structure, and the H$\alpha$ flux. The broad-to-narrow line ratio ($I_{\rm b}/I_{\rm n}$) is inferred from radial velocity profiles, and for J1741$-$2054 the narrow line is detected in multiple regions of the shock. The inferred line ratios and widths suggest that NS bow shocks represent a low shock velocity regime in which electron-ion temperature equilibration is low, contrary to the trend seen in supernova remnants. While the low velocity regime is poorly captured by state-of-the-art simulations, these results may imply electron injection efficiency is lower for bow shocks than their counterparts in supernova remnants.</description>

      <title>Spectropolarimetric modeling of interacting Type II supernovae. Application to early-time observations of SN1998S</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-cadence surveys of the sky are revealing that a large fraction of red-supergiant (RSG) stars, which are progenitors of Type II-Plateau (II-P) supernovae (SNe), explode within circumstellar material (CSM). Such SNe II-P/CSM exhibit considerable diversity, with interaction signatures lasting from hours to days, potentially merging with the Type IIn subclass for which longer-duration interaction typically occurs. To tackle this growing sample of transients and to understand the pre-SN mass loss histories of RSGs, we train on the highest quality, spectropolarimetric observations of a young Type IIn SN taken to date: Those of SN1998S at ~5d after explosion. We design an approach based on a combination of radiation hydrodynamics with HERACLES and polarized radiative transfer with CMFGEN and LONG_POL. The adopted asymmetries are based on a latitudinal, depth- and time-independent, scaling of the density of 1D models of SNe II-P/CSM (e.g., model r1w6b with a `wind' mass-loss rate of 0.01Msun/yr used for SN2023ixf). For a pole-to-equator density ratio of five, we find that the polarization reaches, and then remains for days, at a maximum value of 1.0, 1.4, and 1.8% as the CSM extent is changed from 6, to 8 and 10x10^14cm. The polarization is independent of wavelength away from funnel-shaped depolarizations within emission lines. Our models implicate a significant depolarization at line cores, which we use to constrain the interstellar polarization of SN1998S. Our 2D, prolate ejecta models with moderate asymmetry match well the spectropolarimetric observations of SN1998S at 5d, supporting a polarization level of about ~2%. This study provides a framework for interpreting future spectropolarimetric observations of SNe II-P/CSM and SNe IIn and fostering a better understanding of the origin of their pre-SN mass loss.</description>

      <title>Learning from core-collapse supernova remnants on the explosion mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the recently solidified notion that the jittering jets explosion mechanism (JJEM) is the primary explosion mechanism of core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe), I estimate some typical properties of the jittering jets. From the imprints of jittering jets in the outskirts of some CCSN remnants, I estimate the half-opening angles of jittering jets that shape CCSN remnants to be ~1-10 degrees. I also estimate that intermittent accretion disks around the newly born neutron star (NS) can launch jets after they live for only several times their orbital period around the NS. To operate, the JJEM requires the intermittent accretion disks that launch the jets to amplify the magnetic fields in a dynamo and the magnetic fields to reconnect to release their energy rapidly. I estimate the width of magnetic field reconnection zones to be ~0.005r~0.1km near the surface of the NS. This width requires a numerical resolution several times smaller than the resolution of present CCSN simulations. I argue, therefore, that existing simulations of the CCSN explosion mechanism are still far from correctly simulating CCSN explosions.</description>

      <title>BASS. XLIII: Optical, UV, and X-ray emission properties of unobscured Swift/BAT active galactic nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present one of the largest multiwavelength studies of simultaneous optical-to-X-ray spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of unobscured active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the local Universe. Using a representative sample of hard-X-ray-selected AGN from the 70-month Swift/BAT catalog, with optical/UV photometric data from Swift/UVOT and X-ray spectral data from Swift/XRT, we constructed broadband SEDs of 236 nearby AGN (0.001&lt;z&lt;0.3). We employed GALFIT to estimate host galaxy contamination in the optical/UV and determine the intrinsic AGN fluxes. We used an absorbed power law with a reflection component to model the X-ray spectra and a dust-reddened multi-temperature blackbody to fit the optical/UV SED. We calculated total bolometric luminosities ($L_{bol}$), optical-to-X-ray spectral indices ($\alpha_{ox}$), and multiple bolometric corrections (BCs) in the optical, UV, and X-rays. We used black hole masses obtained by reverberation mapping and the virial method to estimate Eddington ratios ($\lambda_{Edd}$) for all our AGN. We confirm the tight correlation between UV and X-ray luminosity for our sample. We observe a significant decrease in $\alpha_{ox}$ with $L_{bol}$ and $\lambda_{Edd}$, suggesting that brighter sources emit more UV photons per X-rays. We report a second-order regression relation between the 2-10 keV BC and $\alpha_{ox}$, which is useful to compute $L_{bol}$ in the absence of multiband SEDs. We also investigate the dependence of optical/UV BCs on the physical properties of AGN and obtain a significant increase in the UV BCs with $L_{bol}$ and $\lambda_{Edd}$, unlike those in the optical, which are constant across five orders of $L_{bol}$ and $\lambda_{Edd}$. We obtain significant dispersions (~0.1-1 dex) in all BCs, and hence recommend using appropriate relations with observed quantities while including the reported scatter, instead of their median values.</description>

      <title>Radio Emission from Atmosphere-Skimming Cosmic Ray Showers in High-Altitude Balloon-Borne Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atmosphere-skimming air showers are initiated by cosmic rays with incoming directions that allow the cascade to develop entirely within the atmosphere, without reaching the ground. Radio pulses induced by this type of showers have already been observed in balloon-borne experiments such as ANITA, but a detailed characterisation of their properties is lacking. The extreme range of densities in which these cascades can develop gives rise to a wide range of shower profiles, with radio emission characteristics that can differ significantly from those of regular downward-going showers. In this work, we have used the ZHAireS-RASPASS program to characterise the expected radio emission from atmosphere-skimming air showers and its properties. We have studied the interplay between the magnetic field and atmospheric density profile in the expected radio signal, focusing on its detection aboard balloon-borne experiments. The almost horizontal geometry of the events gives rise to a significant \textit{refractive} asymmetry in the spatial distribution of the electric field, due to the propagation of the radio signals across a gradient of index of refraction. In addition, a unique \textit{coherence} asymmetry appears in the intensity of the signals, as a consequence of the cumulative effect of the Earth's magnetic field over the very long distances that these particle cascades traverse. The implications of the peculiar characteristics of the emission are discussed regarding their impact both on the interpretation of collected data and in the exposure of balloon-borne experiments</description>

      <title>First operation of LArTPC in the stratosphere as an engineering GRAMS balloon flight (eGRAMS)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: GRAMS (Gamma-Ray and AntiMatter Survey) is a next-generation balloon/satellite experiment utilizing a LArTPC (Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber), to simultaneously target astrophysical observations of cosmic MeV gamma-rays and conduct an indirect dark matter search using antimatter. While LArTPCs are widely used in particle physics experiments, they have never been operated at balloon altitudes. An engineering balloon flight with a small-scale LArTPC (eGRAMS) was conducted on July 27th, 2023, to establish a system for safely operating a LArTPC at balloon altitudes and to obtain cosmic-ray data from the LArTPC. The flight was launched from the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency's (JAXA) Taiki Aerospace Research Field in Hokkaido, Japan. The total flight duration was 3 hours and 12 minutes, including a level flight of 44 minutes at a maximum altitude of 28.9~km. The flight system was landed on the sea and successfully recovered. The LArTPC was successfully operated throughout the flight, and about 0.5 million events of the cosmic-ray data including muons, protons, and Compton scattering gamma-ray candidates, were collected. This pioneering flight demonstrates the feasibility of operating a LArTPC in high-altitude environments, paving the way for future GRAMS missions and advancing our capabilities in MeV gamma-ray astronomy and dark matter research.</description>

      <title>Variational inference for correlated gravitational wave detector network noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational wave detectors like the Einstein Telescope and LISA generate long multivariate time series, which pose significant challenges in spectral density estimation due to a number of overlapping signals as well as the presence of correlated noise. Addressing both issues is crucial for accurately interpreting the signals detected by these instruments. This paper presents an application of a variational inference spectral density estimation method specifically tailored for dealing with correlated noise in the data. It is flexible in that it does not rely on any specific parametric form for the multivariate spectral density. The method employs a blocked Whittle likelihood approximation for stationary time series and utilizes the Cholesky decomposition of the inverse spectral density matrix to ensure a positive definite estimator. A discounted regularized horseshoe prior is applied to the spline coefficients of each Cholesky factor, and the posterior distribution is computed using a stochastic gradient variational Bayes approach. This method is particularly effective in addressing correlated noise, a significant challenge in the analysis of multivariate data from co-located detectors. The method is demonstrated by analyzing 2000 seconds of simulated Einstein Telescope noise, which shows its ability to produce accurate spectral density estimates and quantify coherence between time series components. This makes it a powerful tool for analyzing correlated noise in gravitational wave data.</description>

Abstract: Optical spectra of the Very Late Thermal Pulse (VLTP) object V4334 Sgr have shown a rapidly changing spectrum resulting from shocks in the outflow, which created a new bipolar nebula inside the old nebula. We see C II and C III emission lines emerging typical of a [WC 11-10]-type star. The strong increase of [O III] and [S III] emission lines indicate the possible onset of photoionisation in the new ejecta.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Next-generation gravitational-wave instruments are expected to constrain the equation of state of dense nuclear matter by observing binaries involving neutron stars. We highlight a problematic systematic error in finite-temperature merger simulations, where shock heating associated with the neutron-star surface gives rise to elevated temperatures. We demonstrate the severe implications of this artificial heating by computing static and dynamical tidal parameters for neutron stars immersed in simulation temperature profiles. The induced systematic errors must be addressed if we want to build robust gravitational-wave signal models for neutron-star, or indeed neutron star-black hole, binaries.</description>

      <title>Memory in the Burst Occurrence of Repeating FRBs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12978v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the nature of repeating fast radio bursts (FRBs) is crucial to probe their underlying physics. In this work, we analyze the waiting time statistics between bursts of three repeating FRBs from four datasets. We find a universally pronounced dependency of the waiting times on the previous time interval (denoted as $\lambda_0$). We observe a temporal clustering where short waiting times tend to be followed by short ones, and long by long comparative to their mean value. This memory dependency is manifested in the conditional mean waiting time as well as in the conditional mean residual time to the next burst, both of which increase in direct proportion to $\lambda_0$. Consequently, the likelihood of experiencing a subsequent FRB burst within a given time window after the preceding burst is generally influenced by the burst history. We reveal that for the first time, these memory effects are present in the scale-invariant preconditioned waiting time distribution. We show that the memory effect provides a unified description of waiting times which may account for both the repeating FRBs and the apparent non-repeating FRBs (i.e. only observed one time). These results shed new light on the mechanism of FRBs.</description>

      <title>Prospects for joint reconstruction of imaging air Cherenkov Telescope array and extensive air shower array</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11286v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we proposed a joint reconstruction of \gray events using both extensive air array (EAS) and Imaging air Cherenkov Telescope array (IACT). We considered eight Cherenkov telescopes to be built on the LHAASO (Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory) site and investigate the improvement in differential sensitivity when combining the information from both IACT and Moun detectors of LHAASO-KM2A. We found that due to the higher cosmic ray background rejection power and higher gamma ray retention ratio provided by muon detectors of LHAASO, such a joint reconstruction can significantly improve the sensitivity of IACTs, especially for extended sources and long exposure time. In this article, we have shown the performance of an eight-telescopes mini array, and our results indicate that above $10~\rm TeV$, the sensitivity can be improved by muon detector from $25\% - 60\%$ in different energy ranges.</description>

      <title>Excess cataloged X-ray and radio sources at galaxy-cluster virial shocks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16946v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We detect a highly significant excess of X-ray (2RXS) and radio (NVSS, GMRT, VLSSr) catalog sources when stacked around MCXC galaxy clusters and groups, narrowly confined within $\lesssim100\mathrm{\,kpc}$ of the $\sim2.4 R_{500}$ virial shock radius (inferred from previous continuum stacking), with similar X-ray ($\sim4\sigma$ for $443$ clusters) and radio ($\sim4\sigma$ for $485$ clusters) characteristics ($&gt;5\sigma$ joint). The excess sources show $10-100$ kpc scales, $L_X(0.1-2.4\mbox{ keV})\simeq10^{42-43}\mathrm{\,erg\,s^{-1}}$ or $\nu L_\nu(\nu=1.4\mbox{ GHz}) \simeq 10^{40-41}\mathrm{\,erg\,s^{-1}}$ luminosities, and a preferentially radial radio-polarization. The narrow localization and properties of the excess identify these sources not as AGN, often invoked speculatively for excess X-ray sources at cluster outskirts, but rather as infalling gaseous clumps interacting with the virial shock, probably galactic halos and possibly outflow remnants. The local excess of such discrete, radio-to-$\gamma$-ray sources around an object can probe its virial shock also at high redshifts and sub-cluster scales.</description>

      <title>SN2023fyq: A Type Ibn Supernova With Long-standing Precursor Activity Due to Binary Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04583v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present photometric and spectroscopic observations of SN 2023fyq, a type Ibn supernova in the nearby galaxy NGC 4388 (D$\simeq$18~Mpc). In addition, we trace long-standing precursor emission at the position of SN 2023fyq using data from DLT40, ATLAS, ZTF, ASAS-SN, Swift, and amateur astronomer Koichi Itagaki. Precursor activity is observed up to nearly three years before the supernova explosion, with a relatively rapid rise in the final 100 days. The double-peaked post-explosion light curve reaches a luminosity of $\sim10^{43}~\rm erg\,s^{-1}$. The strong intermediate-width He lines observed in the nebular spectrum of SN 2023fyq imply the interaction is still active at late phases. We found that the precursor activity in SN 2023fyq is best explained by the mass transfer in a binary system involving a low-mass He star and a compact companion. An equatorial disk is likely formed in this process ($\sim$0.6$\rm M_{\odot}$), and the interaction of SN ejecta with this disk powers the main peak of the supernova. The early SN light curve reveals the presence of dense extended material ($\sim$0.3$\rm M_{\odot}$) at $\sim$3000$\rm R_{\odot}$ ejected weeks before the SN explosion, likely due to final-stage core silicon burning or runaway mass transfer resulting from binary orbital shrinking, leading to rapid rising precursor emission within $\sim$30 days prior to explosion. The final explosion could be triggered either by the core-collapse of the He star or by the merger of the He star with a compact object. SN 2023fyq, along with SN 2018gjx and SN 2015G, forms a unique class of Type Ibn SNe which originate in binary systems and are likely to exhibit detectable long-lasting pre-explosion outbursts with magnitudes ranging from $-$10 to $-$13.</description>

      <title>An Image-Based Search for Pulsar Candidates in the MeerKAT Bulge Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01773v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on the results of an image-based search for pulsar candidates toward the Galactic bulge. We used mosaic images from the MeerKAT radio telescope, that were taken as part of a 173 deg**2 survey of the bulge and Galactic center of our Galaxy at L band (856-1712 MHz) in all four Stokes I, Q, U and V. The image root-mean-square noise levels of 12-17 uJy/ba represent a significant increase in sensitivity over past image-based pulsar searches. Our primary search criterion was circular polarization, but we used other criteria including linear polarization, in-band spectral index, compactness, variability and multi-wavelength counterparts to select pulsar candidates. We first demonstrate the efficacy of this technique by searching for polarized emission from known pulsars, and comparing our results with measurements from the literature. Our search resulted in a sample of 75 polarized pulsar candidates. Bright stars or young stellar objects were associated with 28 of these sources, including a small sample of highly polarized dwarf stars with pulsar-like steep spectra. Comparing the properties of this sample with the known pulsars, we identified 30 compelling candidates for pulsation follow-up, including two sources with both strong circular and linear polarization. The remaining 17 sources are either pulsars or stars, but we cannot rule out an extragalactic origin or image artifacts among the brighter, flat spectrum objects.</description>

      <title>Constraints on fast radio burst emission in the aftermath of gamma-ray bursts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07146v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are highly energetic radio transients with millisecond duration, whose physical origin is still unknown. Many models consider magnetars as possible FRB sources, supported by the observational association of FRBs with the galactic magnetar SGR 1935+2154. Magnetars are also thought to be the source of the power of a fraction of Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs), opening the possibility that the two extreme phenomena have a common progenitor. In this work we put constrains to this hypothesis searching for possible associations between GRBs and FRBs with currently available catalogs, and estimating if the lack of coincident detection can rule out their association. We cross-matched all the Swift GRBs detected so far with all the well-localised FRBs reported in the FRBSTATS catalog, and we looked for FRB-GRB associations considering both spatial and temporal constraints. We also simulated a synthetic population of FRBs associated with Swift GRBs to estimate how likely it is to have a joint detection with current and future radio facilities. We recover two, low significant, possible associations already reported in literature from the catalogs' matches: GRB 110715A/FRB 20171209A and GRB 060502B/FRB 20190309A. However, our study shows that the absence of any unambiguous association so far between Swift GRBs and FRBs cannot exclude that the two populations are connected, given the characteristics of current GRB and FRB detectors. Currently available observational data are not sufficient to clearly exclude/confirm whether GRBs and FRBs are physically associated. In the next decade, with new generations of GRB and FRB detectors there will be a higher probability to detect joint GRB-FRB events, if any: future observations will therefore be key to put more stringent constraints on the hypothesis that FRBs and GRBs have common progenitors.</description>

      <title>Pulsar Population Synthesis with Magnetorotational Evolution: Constraining the Decay of Magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14786v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a population synthesis model for normal radio pulsars in the Galaxy incorporating the latest developments in the field and the magnetorotational evolution processes. Our model considers spin-down with a force-free magnetosphere and the decay of the magnetic field strength and its inclination angle. The simulated pulsar population is fit to a large observation sample that covers the majority of radio surveys using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo technique. We compare the distributions of four major observables: spin period (P), spin down rate($\dot{P}$), dispersion measure, and radio flux density using accurate high-dimensional Kolmogoro-Smirnov statistics. We test two B-field decay scenarios, an exponential model motivated by ohmic dissipation and a power-law model motivated by the Hall effect. The former clearly provides a better fit, and it can successfully reproduce the observed pulsar distributions with a decay timescale of $8.3_{-3.0}^{+3.9}$ Myr. The result suggests that significant B-field decay in aged pulsars and ohmic dissipation could be the dominant process.</description>

      <title>Identifying Light-curve Signals with a Deep Learning Based Object Detection Algorithm. II. A General Light Curve Classification Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08080</link>

Abstract: Vast amounts of astronomical photometric data are generated from various projects, requiring significant effort to identify variable stars and other object classes. In light of this, a general, widely applicable classification framework would simplify the process of designing specific classifiers for various astronomical objects. We present a novel deep learning framework for classifying light curves using a weakly supervised object detection model. Our framework identifies the optimal windows for both light curves and power spectra automatically, and zooms in on their corresponding data. This allows for automatic feature extraction from both time and frequency domains, enabling our model to handle data across different scales and sampling intervals. We train our model on data sets obtained from Kepler, TESS, and Zwicky Transient Facility multiband observations of variable stars and transients. We achieve an accuracy of 87% for combined variables and transient events, which is comparable to the performance of previous feature-based models. Our trained model can be utilized directly for other missions, such as the All-sky Automated Survey for Supernovae, without requiring any retraining or fine-tuning. To address known issues with miscalibrated predictive probabilities, we apply conformal prediction to generate robust predictive sets that guarantee true-label coverage with a given probability. Additionally, we incorporate various anomaly detection algorithms to empower our model with the ability to identify out-of-distribution objects. Our framework is implemented in the Deep-LC toolkit, which is an open-source Python package hosted on Github (https://github.com/ckm3/Deep-LC) and PyPI.</description>

      <title>Extreme mass-ratio inspirals in ultra-light dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06767v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Previous works have argued that future gravitational-wave detectors will be able to probe the properties of astrophysical environments where binary coalesce, including accretion disks, but also dark matter structures. Most analyses have resorted to a Newtonian modelling of the environmental effects, which are not suited to study extreme-mass-ratio inspirals immersed in structures of ultra-light bosons. In this letter, we use relativistic perturbation theory to consistently study these systems in spherical symmetry. We compute the flux of scalar particles and the rate at which orbital energy (and angular momentum) is dissipated via gravitational radiation and depletion of scalars, i.e. dynamical friction. Our results suggest that the Laser Inteferometer Space Antenna will be able to probe ultra-light dark matter structures in the Galaxy by tracking the phase of extreme-mass-ratio inspirals.</description>

      <title>Final state radiation from high and ultrahigh energy neutrino interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07984v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Charged leptons produced by high-energy and ultrahigh-energy neutrinos have a substantial probability of emitting prompt internal bremsstrahlung $\nu_\ell + N \rightarrow \ell + X + \gamma$. This can have important consequences for neutrino detection. We discuss observable consequences at high- and ultrahigh-energy neutrino telescopes and LHC's Forward Physics Facility. Logarithmic enhancements can be substantial (e.g., $\sim 20\%$) when either the charged lepton's energy or the rest of the cascade is measured. We comment on final state radiation's impacts on measuring the inelasticity distribution, $\nu/\bar{\nu}$ flux ratio, throughgoing muons, and double-bang signatures for high-energy neutrino observation. Furthermore, for ultrahigh-energy neutrino observation, we find that final state radiation increases the overall detectable energy by as much as 20\%, affects flavor measurements, and decreases the energy of both Earth-emergent tau leptons and regenerated tau neutrinos. Many of these have significant impacts on measuring neutrino fluxes and spectra. Finally, for LHC's Forward Physics Facility, we find that final state radiation will impact future extractions of strange quark parton distribution functions. Final state radiation should be included in future analyses at neutrino telescopes and the Forward Physics Facility.</description>

      <title>Observational features of reflection asymmetric black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07055v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Kerr spacetime is symmetric with respect to a well-defined equatorial plane. When testing the equatorial reflection symmetry of an isolated black hole, one is at the same time testing the Kerr hypothesis in General Relativity. In this work, we investigate the possible observational features when a Keplerian disk is surrounding a rotating black hole without reflection symmetry. When such symmetry is broken, generically, the photon trajectories around the black hole and the Keplerian orbits on the accretion disk are distorted vertically away from the equatorial plane by an amount that depends on their distance to the black hole. In the reflection asymmetric spacetime we are considering, these two kinds of orbits are distorted in opposite directions. Interestingly, while the size and shape of black hole shadows closely resemble those of Kerr black holes, distinct observational characteristics can emerge in the disk image and emission line profiles. When observing the disk edge-on, a pronounced concave shape may appear along its innermost edge on the incoming side. Furthermore, distinctive horn-like features might be observed on the spectral line profile at the blue-shifted side. These special features can serve as compelling indicators of the reflection asymmetry present in rotating black holes.</description>

      <title>The EUSO-SPB2 Fluorescence Telescope for the Detection of Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13673v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Extreme Universe Space Observatory on a Super Pressure Balloon 2 (EUSO-SPB2) flew on May 13$^{\text{th}}$ and 14$^{\text{th}}$ of 2023. Consisting of two novel optical telescopes, the payload utilized next-generation instrumentation for the observations of extensive air showers from near space. One instrument, the fluorescence telescope (FT) searched for Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECRs) by recording the atmosphere below the balloon in the near-UV with a 1~$\mu$s time resolution using 108 multi-anode photomultiplier tubes with a total of 6,912 channels. Validated by pre-flight measurements during a field campaign, the energy threshold was estimated around 2~EeV with an expected event rate of approximately 1 event per 10 hours of observation. Based on the limited time afloat, the expected number of UHECR observations throughout the flight is between 0 and 2. Consistent with this expectation, no UHECR candidate events have been found. The majority of events appear to be detector artifacts that were not rejected properly due to a shortened commissioning phase. Despite the earlier-than-expected termination of the flight, data were recorded which provide insights into the detectors stability in the near-space environment as well as the diffuse ultraviolet emissivity of the atmosphere, both of which are impactful to future experiments.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Lensing Tomography of Black Hole Ringdown</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10303v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strong gravitational lensing occurs when photons pass through the vicinity of a black hole. We investigate this phenomenon in the context of a gravitational-wave event, specifically when a black hole is settling into its final state. The deflection angle of photons mimics the ringdown pattern of the gravitational wave at intermediate times. At late times it has an inverse cubic dependence on observation time. The deviation angle increases exponentially as photons approach the photon ring orbit, reflecting its unstable nature. Our findings are directly applicable to imaging scenarios involving stars against the background of compact binaries, or circumbinary accretion disks, particularly during the merger of two black holes.</description>
