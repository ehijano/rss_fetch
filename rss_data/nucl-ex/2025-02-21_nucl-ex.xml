      <title>A Comparative Analysis of R-Matrix Fitting: ${}^{12}$C$(p,\gamma)$${}^{13}$N as Test Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In nuclear astrophysics, the accurate determination of nuclear reaction cross sections at astrophysical energies is critical for understanding stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis. This study focuses on the $^{12}$C($p, \gamma$)$^{13}$N reaction, which takes part in the CNO cycle and is significant for determining the $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratio in stellar interiors. Data from various studies, including recent LUNA measurements, reveal high discrepancies in cross section values, underscoring the need for robust fitting approaches. Utilizing the R-matrix theory, we compare different frequentist and Bayesian methodologies for estimating reaction cross sections and their uncertainties. The analysis evaluates the strengths and weaknesses of different statistical techniques, highlighting the importance of systematic uncertainty treatment and the estimate of covariance matrix estimation to enhance the reliability and reproducibility of uncertainty estimates in nuclear astrophysics.</description>

      <title>Independent check of sporadic beta decay anomalies reported earlier by Parkhomov</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A. Parkhomov reported in the past the detection of strong, short, sporadic, nearly everyday decay rate increases in $\beta$-isotopes placed at the focus of a concave mirror directed at a clear sky. He interpreted this effect as neutrino-induced decay. These neutrinos were assumed to be slow and arrive from space in the form of gravitationally collimated beams. We precisely replicated this experiment for the purpose of independent verification. We recorded about 50 days of data employing Geiger-counter-based signal and control detectors, $^{40}$K and $^{90}$Sr/$^{90}$Y isotopes as $\beta$-sources. We did not detect any significant difference between the data from signal and control detectors, both datasets obeyed the standard Poissonian process. Thus, we robustly excluded the hypothesized new effect. We suspect that A. Parkhomov was just misled by a trivial electromagnetic instability of his setup.</description>

      <title>MoNA -- The first 25 years</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Modular Neutron Array (MoNA) collaboration was initiated in 2000 at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL) at Michigan State University (MSU). Since then, the collaboration studied properties of nuclides at and beyond the neutron dripline discovering seven new isotopes between lithium to fluorine. The collaboration included liberal arts colleges, regional comprehensive universities, and major research universities with the focus of giving undergraduate students meaningful research experiences. Over the last 25 years, the combined efforts of hundreds of undergraduates, dozens of graduate students and research associates, and faculty from more than a dozen colleges and universities produced over fifty publications, won awards for research, and combined research and teaching in new and interesting ways.</description>

      <title>Nuclear effects in proton decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Proton decay detection could put in evidence physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM). In this context, multiple projects are searching for such events. We focused our work on two of the expected decay modes, $p \rightarrow \pi^+ + \bar{\nu}$ and $p \rightarrow K^+ + \bar{\nu}$. Neutrinos are particles that interact very weakly with matter, so they are not of interest in our work. The detector materials investigated in this study include liquid argon (LAr), liquid xenon (LXe), and water (H$_2$O). Our analysis focuses on two key effects relevant to this decay process: the Fermi motion of nucleons and final state interactions. In addition to these effects, we have also examined the nuclear interaction of particles with the nuclei of the medium. This paper presents values for nucleon energy distribution, cross sections, mean free paths and interaction probabilities.</description>

      <title>Temperature Dependence of Beam on Plasma Stopping Power in the Resonance Regions of Fusion Reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A recent proposal of accelerator based fusion reactor considers a scheme where an ion beam from the accelerator hits the target plasma on the resonance of the fusion reaction so that the reactivity ($\sigma v$) can be an order of magnitude larger than that of a thermonuclear reactor. One of the important inputs is the stopping power which is needed to assess the energy loss of the beam in the plasma. In this work, we shall use the analytic formulation of Brown, Preston and Singleton~\cite{Brown:2005ji} to calculate the temperature dependence of the stopping power due to the target $t, {}^3H_e$, and ${}^{11}B$ plasmas in the resonance regions of their respective fusion reactions, i.e., $ d + t \rightarrow n + \alpha, d + {}^3H_e \rightarrow p + \alpha$, and $p + {}^{11}B \rightarrow 3 \alpha$. It is found that the calculated stopping power, especially when the quantum corrections are included, does not go down with temperature as fast at $T^{-3/2}$. Instead it decreases slower, more like $T^{-x}$ with $x \le 1$ in the range of T from $\sim$ 5 to 50 keV for $d$ on $t$ and ${}^3H_e$ plasmas around their resonance energies.</description>

      <title>Puzzling $B(E2;0^+\rightarrow 2^+)$ strength in the proton dripline nucleus $^{36}$Ca</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent measurements of the $E2$ transition rate from the ground state to the first 2$^+$ excited state of the proton dripline nucleus $^{36}$Ca show an unusual pattern when compared to its isotopic neighbor $^{38}$Ca: despite having a higher $E_x(2_1^+)$ excitation energy, the $B(E2; 0^+_1\rightarrow 2^+_1)$ rate in $^{36}$Ca is larger. The question that naturally arises is to what extent this observation can be attributed to the unbound character of the $2^+_1$ state. To understand the influence of the continuum space on the low-energy properties of $^{36}$Ca, we carried out Gamow shell model calculations that can account for the continuum coupling effects. We found that in the threshold $2^+$ state, $^{36}$Ca is spatially diffused, which accounts for the abnormal $B(E2)$ trend observed.</description>

      <title>A background for thermal photons in heavy ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15938v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we present the transverse momentum spectra of prompt and decay photons in Au-Au collisions for $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$ 200 GeV, 62.4 GeV, 39 GeV, and 27 GeV. The major sources of the photons in Angantyr include hard processes, Parton showers, and resonance decay. The multiparton interactions and hadronic rescatterings significantly increase the photon yield. The model shows a good match with the available experimental data at high $p_T$. The difference in yield at low $p_T $ suggests that Quark Gluon Plasma of $T_{eff}$ = 0.167 GeV/c in central Au-Au collision at 200 GeV is formed, the new effective temperature is less than the ones extracted without removing background photons. At low $p_T$ the decay photon spectra scales with $(\frac{dN_{ch}}{d\eta})^{1.25}$, the scaling is independent of collision energy and system size. The scaling no longer holds at high $p_T$ and the spectra become beam energy dependent. The scaled $p_T$ spectra of p-p and d-Au collisions show an opposite trend at high $p_T$, their scaled yield is greater than the Au-Au collision at the same energy.</description>

      <title>Thermal production of charm quarks in relativistic heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00425v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the thermal production of charm quarks in the strongly interacting quark-gluon plasma (sQGP) created in heavy-ion collisions at relativistic energies. Our study is based on the off-shell parton-hadron-string dynamics (PHSD) transport approach describing the full time evolution of heavy-ion collisions on a microscopic basis with hadronic and partonic degrees of freedom. The sQGP is realized within the effective dynamical quasi-particle model (DQPM) which is adjusted to reproduce the lattice QCD results for the thermodynamic observables of the sQGP. Relying on the fact that the DQPM successfully describes the spatial diffusion coefficients $D_s$ from the lQCD, which control the interaction of charm quarks with thermal partons (expressed in terms of strongly interacting off-shell quasiparticles), we evaluate the production of charm quark pairs through the rotation of Feynman diagrams such that the incoming charm quark and outgoing light parton in elastic scattering diagrams are exchanged. The charm quark annihilation is realized by detailed balance. We find that the number of produced thermal charm quark pairs strongly depends on the charm quark mass in the QGP. While for the heavy charm quarks of mass $m_c=1.8$ GeV it is subdominant compared to the primary charm production by binary nucleon-nucleon collisions at RHIC and LHC energies, the numbers of primary and thermal charm quarks become comparable for a smaller (bare) $m_c=1.2$ GeV. Compared with the experimental data on the $R_{\rm AA}$ of $D$-mesons in heavy-ion collisions at RHIC and LHC energies, it is more favorable for charm quarks in the QGP to gain additional mass due to thermal effects rather than to have a low bare mass.</description>

      <title>Unique forbidden beta decays at zero momentum transfer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18115v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report an exploratory study of the $\mathcal{O}(\alpha)$ structure-dependent electromagnetic radiative corrections to unique first-forbidden nuclear beta decays. We show that the insertion of angular momentum into the nuclear matrix element by the virtual/real photon exchange opens up the decay at vanishing nuclear recoil momentum which was forbidden at tree level, leading to a dramatic change in the decay spectrum not anticipated in existing studies. We discuss its implications for precision tests on the Standard Model and searches for new physics.</description>

      <title>Fixing effective range parameters in elastic $\alpha$-$^{12}$C scattering: an impact on resonant $2_4^+$ state of $^{16}$O and $S_{E2}$ factor of $^{12}$C($\alpha$,$\gamma$)$^{16}$O</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08190v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Elastic $\alpha$-$^{12}$C scattering for $l=2$ and $E2$ transition of radiative $\alpha$ capture on $^{12}$C, $^{12}$C($\alpha$,$\gamma$)$^{16}$O, are studied in cluster effective field theory. Due to the problem in fixing the asymptotic normalization coefficient (ANC) of the subthreshold $2_1^+$ state of $^{16}$O, equivalently, the effective range parameters of the $2_1^+$ state, from the elastic scattering data, we introduce the conditions that lead to a large value of the ANC. In addition, $d$-wave phase shift data of the elastic scattering up to the $\alpha$ energy, $E_\alpha=10$~MeV, which contain resonant $2_4^+$ state of $^{16}$O, are also introduced in the study. Applying the conditions, the parameters of the $S$ matrix of the elastic scattering for $l=2$ are fitted to the phase shift data, and the fitted parameters are employed in the calculation of astrophysical $S_{E2}$ factor of $^{12}$C($\alpha$,$\gamma$)$^{16}$O; we extrapolate the $S_{E2}$ factor to the Gamow-peak energy, $E_G=0.3$~MeV. We find that the conditions lead to significant effects in the observables of the $2_4^+$ state of $^{16}$O and the estimate of the $S_{E2}$ factor at $E_G$ and confirm that the ANC of the $2_1^+$ of $^{16}$O cannot be determined by the phase shift data for $l=2$.</description>
