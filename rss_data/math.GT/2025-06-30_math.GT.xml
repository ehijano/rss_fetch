      <title>Non-braid positive hyperbolic $L$-space knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An $L$-space knot is a knot that admits a positive Dehn surgery yielding an $L$-space. Many known hyperbolic $L$-space knots are braid positive, meaning they can be represented as the closure of a positive braid. Recently, Baker and Kegel showed that the hyperbolic $L$-space knot $o9\_30634$ from Dunfield's census is not braid positive, and they constructed infinitely many candidates for hyperbolic $L$-space knots that may not be braid positive. However, it remains unproven whether their examples are genuinely non-braid positive. In this paper, we construct infinitely many hyperbolic $L$-space knots that are not braid positive, and our examples are distinct from those considered by Baker and Kegel.</description>

      <title>Representation stability for moduli spaces of admissible covers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a representation stability result for the sequence of spaces $\overline M_{g, n}^A$ of pointed admissible $A$-covers of stable $n$-pointed genus-$g$ curves, for an abelian group $A$. For fixed genus $g$ and homology degree $i$, we give the sequence of rational homology groups $H_i(\overline{M}_{g, n}^A;\mathbb Q)$ the structure of a module over a combinatorial category, a la Sam--Snowden, and prove that this module is generated in degree at most $g + 5 i$. This implies that the generating function for the ranks of the homology groups is rational, with poles in the set $\left\{-1, -\frac{1}{2}, \ldots, -\frac{1}{|A|^2\cdot(g + 5i)}\right\}$. In the case where $A$ is the trivial group, our work significantly improves on previous representation stability results on the Deligne--Mumford compactification $\overline M_{g, n}$.</description>

      <title>Yang-Baxter Equation and Related Algebraic Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the 1990s, Drinfel'd proposed the study of set-theoretical solutions to the quantum Yang-Baxter equation, initiating a line of research that has since garnered substantial attention and led to notable developments in algebra, low-dimensional topology, and related areas. This monograph offers a concise introduction to the algebraic theory of such solutions, focusing on key structures including skew braces, quandles, racks, and Rota-Baxter groups, which have emerged as central objects in this framework. We investigate the algebraic, combinatorial, and homological properties of these structures, with an emphasis on their interrelations and applications to knot theory. The monograph is intended as a reference for researchers interested in the deep interplay between these algebraic structures and the quantum Yang-Baxter equation.</description>

      <title>Computing closed essential surfaces in 3-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.11686</link>
      <description>arXiv:1812.11686v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a practical algorithm to test whether a 3-manifold given by a triangulation or an ideal triangulation contains a closed essential surface. This property has important theoretical and algorithmic consequences. As a testament to its practicality, we run the algorithm over a comprehensive body of closed 3-manifolds and knot exteriors, yielding results that were not previously known.
  The algorithm derives from the original Jaco-Oertel framework, involves both enumeration and optimisation procedures, and combines several techniques from normal surface theory. Our methods are relevant for other difficult computational problems in 3-manifold theory, such as the recognition problem for knots, links and 3-manifolds.</description>

      <title>Dehn filling and the knot group I: Realization Property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.15738v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Each $r$-Dehn filling of the exterior $E(K)$ of a knot $K$ in $S^3$ produces a $3$-manifold $K(r)$, and induces an epimorphism from the knot group $G(K) = \pi_1(E(K))$ to $\pi_1(K(r))$, which trivializes elements in its kernel. To each element $g \in G(K)$, consider all the non-trivial Dehn fillings and assign $\mathcal{S}_K(g) = \{ r \in \mathbb{Q} \mid \textrm{$r$-Dehn filling trivializes}\ g \}$ $\subset \mathbb{Q}$. Which subsets of $\mathbb{Q}$ can occur as $\mathcal{S}_K(g)$? Property P concerns this question and gives a fundamental result which asserts that the emptyset can be realized by $\mathcal{S}_K(\mu)$ for the meridian $\mu$ of $K$. Suppose that $K$ is a hyperbolic knot. Then $\mathcal{S}_K(g)$ is known to be finite for all non-trivial elements $g \in G(K)$. We prove that generically, for instance, if $K$ has no exceptional surgery, then any finite (possibly empty) family of slopes $\mathcal{R} = \{ r_1, . . . , r_n \}$ can be realized by $\mathcal{S}_K(g)$ for some element $g \in G(K)$. Furthermore, there are infinitely many, mutually non-conjugate such elements, each of which is not conjugate to any power of $g$. We also provide an example showing that the above realization property does not hold unconditionally.</description>

      <title>On the degree-two part of the associated graded of the lower central series of the Torelli group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07981v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the associated graded $\bigoplus_{k\geq 1} \Gamma_k \mathcal{I} / \Gamma_{k+1} \mathcal{I} $ of the lower central series $\mathcal{I} = \Gamma_1 \mathcal{I} \supset \Gamma_2 \mathcal{I} \supset \Gamma_3 \mathcal{I} \supset \cdots$ of the Torelli group $\mathcal{I}$ of a compact oriented surface. Its degree-one part is well-understood by D. Johnson's seminal works on the abelianization of the Torelli group. The knowledge of the degree-two part $(\Gamma_2 \mathcal{I} / \Gamma_3 \mathcal{I})\otimes \mathbb{Q}$ with rational coefficients arises from works of S. Morita on the Casson invariant and R. Hain on the Malcev completion of $\mathcal{I}$. Here, we prove that the abelian group $\Gamma_2 \mathcal{I} / \Gamma_3 \mathcal{I}$ is torsion-free, and we describe it as a lattice in a rational vector space. As an application, the group $\mathcal{I}/\Gamma_3 \mathcal{I}$ is computed, and it is shown to embed in the group of homology cylinders modulo the surgery relation of $Y_3$-equivalence.</description>

      <title>On reconstructing Morse-Bott functions with prescribed preimages on $3$-dimensional manifolds and conditions for the reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05992v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present conditions for reconstruction of Morse-Bott functions with prescribed preimages on $3$-dimensional manifolds. The present work strengthens a previous result for the Morse function case by the author and present a related example as another result. This shows a new result on reconstruction of nice smooth functions such that preimages are as prescribed. Such a study has been fundamental, natural, and surprisingly, founded recently, in 2006, by Sharko. Reconstruction of nice smooth functions on closed surfaces has been followed by Masumoto-Saeki, for example, and later, Gelbukh, Marzantowicz, Michalak, and so on, are studying Morse function cases further. The author has started explicit studies for $3$-dimensional cases respecting topologies of preimages of single points and obtained several results. We add another result on this.</description>

      <title>On the spectrum of the number of geodesics and tight geodesics in the curve complex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01801v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $S$ be an oriented surface of type $(g, n)$. We are interested in geodesics in the curve complex $\mathcal C(S)$ of $S$. In general, two $0$-simplexes in $\mathcal C(S)$ have infinitely many geodesics connecting the two simplexes while another geodesics called tight geodesics are always finitely many. On the other hand, we may find two $0$-simplexes in $\mathcal C(S)$ so that they have only finitely many geodesics between them.
  In this paper, we consider the spectrum of the number of geodesics with length $d (\geq 2)$ in $\mathcal C(S)$ and tight geodesics, which is denoted by $\mathfrak{Sp}_d(S)$ and $\mathfrak{Sp}_d^T(S)$, respectively.
  In our main theorem, it is shown that $\mathfrak{Sp}_d(S) \subset \mathfrak{Sp}_d^T(S)$ in general, but $\mathfrak{Sp}_2(S)= \mathfrak{Sp}_2^T(S)$. Moreover, we show that $\mathfrak{Sp}_2(S)$ and $\mathfrak{Sp}_2^T(g, n)$ are completely determined in terms of $(g, n)$.</description>

      <title>The tangle-valued 1-cocycle for knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17738v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper contains the strongest and at the same time most calculable knot invariant ever.
  Let $\Theta$ be the topological moduli space of all ordered oriented tangles in 3-space. We construct a non-trivial combinatorial 1-cocycle $\mathbb{L}$ for $\Theta$ that takes its values in $H_0(\Theta;\mathbb{Z})$. The 1-cocycle $\mathbb{L}$ has a very nice property, called the {\em scan-property}: if we slide a tangle $T$ over or under a given crossing $c$ of a fixed tangle $T'$, then the value of $\mathbb{L}$ on this arc $scan(T)$ in $\Theta$ is already an isotopy invariant of $T$.
  In particular, let $D$ be a framed long knot diagram. We take the product with a fixed long knot diagram $K$ and we consider the 2-cable, with a fixed crossing $c$ in $2K$. $\mathbb{L}(scan(2D))$ gives an element in $H_0(\Theta)$. To this element we associate the {\em set of Alexander vectors}, consisting of the corresponding integer multiples of the one-variable Alexander polynomials of (the standard closures) of all sub-tangles of each of the tangles. We can vary the knots $(K,c)$ and moreover we can iterate our construction by starting now again the $scan$ with the tangles in $\mathbb{L}(scan(2D))$ and so on. The result is the infinite {\em Alexander tree}, which is an isotopy invariant of the knot represented by $D$.
  {\em As an example we show with just one edge of the Alexander tree that the knot $8_{17}$ is not invertible!} This makes the Alexander tree a very promising candidate for a complete and "locally" calculable knot invariant, because the tangles in $\mathbb{L}(scan(2D))$ can be drawn with linear complexity and their Alexander polynomials can be calculated with quartic complexity with respect to the number of crossings of $D$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07748v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Hitchin component of the character variety of representations of a surface group $\pi_1(S)$ into $\mathrm{PSL}_d(\mathbb{R})$ for some $d \geq 3$ can be equipped with a pressure metric whose restriction to the Fuchsian locus equals the Weil--Petersson metric up to a constant factor. We show that if the genus of $S$ is at least $3$, then the Fuchsian locus contains quasi-convex subsets of infinite diameter for the Weil--Petersson metric whose diameter for the path metric of the pressure metric is finite. This is established through showing that biinfinite paths of bending deformations have controlled bounded length.</description>

      <title>Non vanishing of the fourth bounded cohomology of free groups and codimension 2 subspaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22511v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note we prove that the fouth bounded cohomology of non-abelian free
  groups with trivial real coefficients is non-zero. In order to prove this, we
  establish a splitting argument whose simplest form is as follows: Let
  $M$ denote an $n$-manifold of non-zero simplicial volume and
  $S$ a codimension two submanifold of $M$, then one can
  conclude that the $n$-th bounded cohomology of the fundamental group of
  $M \setminus S$ is non-zero.
  While in this note this approach is only used for degree $4$. There is no
  reason to expect that this approach and its generalizations is not suitable
  to prove the non-vanishing of higher degrees or the bounded cohomology of
  different groups as well.</description>
