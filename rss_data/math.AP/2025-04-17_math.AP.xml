      <title>A nonvariational form of the acoustic single layer potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a bounded open subset $\Omega$ of ${\mathbb{R}}^n$ of class $C^{1,\alpha}$ for some $\alpha\in]0,1[$ and the space $V^{-1,\alpha}(\partial\Omega)$ of (distributional) normal derivatives on the boundary of $\alpha$-H\"{o}lder continuous functions in $\Omega$ that have Laplace operator in the Schauder space with negative exponent $C^{-1,\alpha}(\overline{\Omega})$. Then we prove those properties of the acoustic single layer potential that are necessary to analyze the Neumann problem for the Helmholtz equation in $\Omega$ with boundary data in $V^{-1,\alpha}(\partial\Omega)$ and solutions in the space of $\alpha$-H\"{o}lder continuous functions in $\Omega$ that have Laplace operator in $C^{-1,\alpha}(\overline{\Omega})$, \textit{i.e.}, in a space of functions that may have infinite Dirichlet integral. Namely, a Neumann problem that does not belong to the classical variational setting.</description>

      <title>Regularity and explicit $L^\infty$ estimates for a class of nonlinear elliptic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use De Giorgi-Nash-Moser iteration scheme to establish that weak solutions to a coupled system of elliptic equations with critical growth on the boundary are in $L^\infty(\Omega)$. Moreover, we provide an explicit $L^\infty(\Omega)$- estimate of weak solutions with subcritical growth on the boundary, in terms of powers of $H^1(\Omega)$-norms, by combining the elliptic regularity of weak solutions with Gagliardo--Nirenberg interpolation inequality.</description>

      <title>A Deformation Approach to the BFK Formula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how spectral quantities localize on manifolds is a central theme in geometric spectral theory and index theory. Within this framework, the BFK formula, obtained by Burghelea, Friedlander and Kappeler in 1992, describes how the zeta-regularized determinant of an elliptic operator decomposes as the underlying manifold is cut into pieces. In this paper, we present a novel proof of this result. Inspired by work of Br\"uning and Lesch on the eta invariant of Dirac operators, we derive the BFK formula by interpolating continuously between boundary conditions and understanding the variation of the determinant along this deformation.</description>

      <title>On the Grad-Mercier equation and Semilinear Free Boundary Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish regularity and uniqueness results for Grad-Mercier type equations that arise in the context of plasma physics. We show that solutions of this problem naturally develop a dead core, which corresponds to the set where the solutions become identically equal to their maximum. We prove uniqueness, sharp regularity, and non-degeneracy bounds for solutions under suitable assumptions on the reaction term. Of independent interest, our methods allow us to prove that the free boundaries of a broad class of semilinear equations have locally finite $H^{n-1}$ measure.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal diffusion and pulse intervention in a faecal-oral model with moving infected fronts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How individual dispersal patterns and human intervention behaviours affect the spread of infectious diseases constitutes a central problem in epidemiological research. This paper develops an impulsive nonlocal faecal-oral model with free boundaries, where pulses are introduced to capture a periodic spraying of disinfectant, and nonlocal diffusion describes the long-range dispersal of individuals, and free boundaries represent moving infected fronts. We first check that the model has a unique nonnegative global classical solution. Then, the principal eigenvalue, which depends on the infected region, the impulse intensity, and the kernel functions for nonlocal diffusion, is examined by using the theory of resolvent positive operators and their perturbations. Based on this value, this paper obtains that the diseases are either vanishing or spreading, and provides criteria for determining when vanishing and spreading occur. At the end, a numerical example is presented in order to corroborate the theoretical findings and to gain further understanding of the effect of the pulse intervention. This work shows that the pulsed intervention is beneficial in combating the diseases, but the effect of the nonlocal diffusion depends on the choice of the kernel functions.</description>

      <title>Linear damping estimates for periodic roll wave solutions of the inviscid Saint Venant equations and related systems of hyperbolic balance laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Substantially extending previous results of the authors for smooth solutions in the viscous case, we develop linear damping estimates for periodic roll-wave solutions of the inviscid Saint Venant equations and related systems of hyperbolic balance laws. Such damping estimates, consisting of $H^s$ energy estimates yielding exponential slaving of high-derivative to low-derivative norms, have served as crucial ingredients in nonlinear stability analyses of traveling waves in hyperbolic or partially parabolic systems, both in obtaining high-freqency resolvent estimates and in closing a nonlinear iteration for which available linearized stability estimates apparently lose regularity. Here, we establish for systems of size $n\leq 6$ a Lyapunov-type theorem stating that such energy estimates are available whenever strict high-frequency spectral stability holds; for dimensions 7 and higher, there may be in general a gap between high-frequency spectral stability and existence of the type of energy estimate that we develop here. A key ingredient is a dimension-dependent linear algebraic lemma reminiscent of Lyapunov's Lemma for ODE that is to our knowledge new.</description>

      <title>Inverse iteration method for higher eigenvalues of the $p$-Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a characterization of a $p$-Laplace higher eigenvalue based on the inverse iteration method with balancing the Rayleigh quotients of the positive and negative parts of solutions to consecutive $p$-Poisson equations. The approach relies on the second eigenvalue's minimax properties, but the actual limiting eigenvalue depends on the choice of initial function. The well-posedness and convergence of the iterative scheme are proved. Moreover, we provide the corresponding numerical computations. As auxiliary results, which also have an independent interest, we provide several properties of certain $p$-Poisson problems.</description>

      <title>Control of blow-up profiles for the mass-critical focusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation on bounded domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the mass-critical focusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger on bounded two-dimensional domains with Dirichlet boundary conditions. In the absence of control, it is well-known that free solutions starting from initial data sufficiently large can blow-up. More precisely, given a finite number of points, there exists particular profiles blowing up exactly at these points at the blow-up time. For pertubations of these profiles, we show that, with the help of an appropriate nonlinear feedback law located in an open set containing the blow-up points, the blow-up can be prevented from happening. More specifically, we construct a small-time control acting just before the blow-up time. The solution may then be extended globally in time. This is the first result of control for blow-up profiles for nonlinear Schr\"odinger type equations. Assuming further a geometrical control condition on the support of the control, we are able to prove a null-controllability result for such blow-up profiles. Finally, we discuss possible extensions to three-dimensional domains.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we characterize the geometry of solutions to one-phase inhomogeneous fully nonlinear Stefan problem with flat free boundaries under a new nondegeneracy assumption. This continues the study of regularity of flat free boundaries for the linear inhomogeneous Stefan problem started in [9], as well as justifies the definition of flatness assumed in [15].</description>

      <title>Large global solutions to the Oldroyd-B model with dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the first part of this work, we investigate the Cauchy problem for the $d$-dimensional incompressible Oldroyd-B model with dissipation in the stress tensor equation. By developing a weighted Chemin-Lerner framework combined with a refined energy argument, we prove the existence and uniqueness of global solutions for the system under a mild constraint on the initial velocity field, while allowing a broad class of large initial data for the stress tensor. Notably, our analysis accommodates general divergence-free initial stress tensors ( $\mathrm{div}\tau_0=0$) and significantly relaxes the requirements on initial velocities compared to classical fluid models. This stands in sharp contrast to the finite-time singularity formation observed in the incompressible Euler equations, even for small initial data, thereby highlighting the intrinsic stabilizing role of the stress tensor in polymeric fluid dynamics.
  The second part of this paper focuses on the small-data regime. Through a systematic exploitation of the perturbative structure of the system, we establish global well-posedness and quantify the long-time behavior of solutions in Sobolev spaces
  $H^3(\mathbb{T}^d)$. Specifically, we derive exponential decay rates for perturbations, demonstrating how the dissipative mechanisms inherent to the Oldroyd-B model govern the asymptotic stability of the system.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Resolvent and Eigenfunction Stability for the Faber-Krahn Inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a bounded open set $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ with the same volume as the unit ball, the classical Faber-Krahn inequality says that the first Dirichlet eigenvalue $\lambda_1(\Omega)$ of the Laplacian is at least that of the unit ball $B$. We prove that the deficit $\lambda_1(\Omega)- \lambda_1(B)$ in the Faber-Krahn inequality controls the square of the distance between the resolvent operator $(-\Delta_\Omega)^{-1}$ for the Dirichlet Laplacian on $\Omega$ and the resolvent operator on the nearest unit ball $B(x_\Omega)$. The distance is measured by the operator norm from $C^{0,\alpha}$ to $L^2$. As a main application, we show that the Faber-Krahn deficit $\lambda_1(\Omega)- \lambda_1(B)$ controls the squared $L^2$ norm between $k$th eigenfunctions on $\Omega$ and $B(x_\Omega)$ for every $k \in \mathbb{N}.$ In both of these main theorems, the quadratic power is optimal.</description>

Abstract: We discuss the validity of Minkowski integral identities for hypersurfaces inside a cone, intersecting the boundary of the cone orthogonally. In doing so we correct a formula provided in [3]. Then we study rigidity results for constant mean curvature graphs proving the precise statement of a result given in [9] and [10]. Finally we provide an integral estimate for stable constant mean curvature hypersurfaces in cones.</description>

      <title>The coexistence of null and spacelike singularities inside spherically symmetric black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In our previous work [Van de Moortel, The breakdown of weak null singularities, Duke Mathematical Journal 172 (15), 2957-3012, 2023], we showed that dynamical black holes formed in charged spherical collapse generically feature both a null weakly singular Cauchy horizon and a stronger (presumably spacelike) singularity, confirming a longstanding conjecture in the physics literature. However, this previous result, based on a contradiction argument, did not provide quantitative estimates on the stronger singularity.
  In this study, we adopt a new approach by analyzing local initial data inside the black hole that are consistent with a breakdown of the Cauchy horizon. We prove that the remaining portion is spacelike and obtain sharp spacetime estimates near the null-spacelike transition. Notably, we show that the Kasner exponents of the spacelike portion are positive, in contrast to the well-known Oppenheimer-Snyder model of gravitational collapse. Moreover, these exponents degenerate to (1,0,0) towards the null-spacelike transition.
  Our result provides the first quantitative instances of a null-spacelike singularity transition inside a black hole. In our companion paper, we moreover apply our analysis to carry out the construction of a large class of asymptotically flat one or two-ended black holes featuring coexisting null and spacelike singularities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the asymptotic spectral distribution of the twisted Laplacian associated with a real harmonic 1-form on a compact hyperbolic surface. In particular, we establish a sublinear lower bound on the number of eigenvalues in a sufficiently large strip determined by the pressure of the harmonic 1-form. Furthermore, following an observation by Anantharaman \cite{nalinideviation}, we show that quantum unique ergodicity fails to hold for certain twisted Laplacians.</description>

      <title>Relative magnetic helicity under turbulent relaxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic helicity is a quantity that underpins many theories of magnetic relaxation in electrically conducting fluids, both laminar and turbulent. Although much theoretical effort has been expended on magnetic fields that are everywhere tangent to their domain boundaries, many applications, both in astrophysics and laboratories, actually involve magnetic fields that are line-tied to the boundary, i.e. with a non-trivial normal component on the boundary. This modification of the boundary condition requires a modification of magnetic helicity, whose suitable replacement is called relative magnetic helicity. In this work, we investigate rigorously the behaviour of relative magnetic helicity under turbulent relaxation. In particular, we specify the normal component of the magnetic field on the boundary and consider the \emph{ideal limit} of resistivity tending to zero in order to model the turbulent evolution in the sense of Onsager's theory of turbulence. We show that relative magnetic helicity is conserved in this distinguished limit and that, for constant viscosity, the magnetic field can relax asymptotically to a magnetohydrostatic equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Symmetry classification and invariant solutions of the classical geometric mean reversion process</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on the Lie symmetry method, we investigate a Feynman-Kac formula for the classical geometric mean reversion process, which effectively describing the dynamics of short-term interest rates. The Lie algebra of infinitesimal symmetries and the corresponding one-parameter symmetry groups of the equation are obtained. An optimal system of invariant solutions are constructed by a derived optimal system of one-dimensional subalgebras. Because of taking into account a supply response to price rises, this equation provides for a more realistic assumption than the geometric Brownian motion in many investment scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.07502v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a critical problem for an operator of mixed order obtained by the superposition of a Laplacian with a fractional Laplacian. In particular, we investigate the corresponding Sobolev inequality, detecting the optimal constant, which we show that is never achieved. Moreover, we present an existence (and nonexistence) theory for the corresponding subcritical perturbation problem.</description>

      <title>Formation and construction of a shock wave for one dimensional $n\times n$ strictly hyperbolic conservation laws with small smooth initial data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.05460v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Under the genuinely nonlinear assumption for 1-D $n\times n$ strictly hyperbolic conservation laws, we investigate the geometric blowup of smooth solutions and the development of singularities when the small initial data fulfill the generic nondegenerate condition. At first, near the unique blowup point we give a precise description on the space-time blowup rate of the smooth solution and meanwhile derive the cusp singularity structure of characteristic envelope. These results are established through extending the smooth solution of the completely nonlinear blowup system across the blowup time. Subsequently, by utilizing a new form on the resulting 1-D strictly hyperbolic system with $(n-1)$ good components and one bad component, together with the choice of an efficient iterative scheme and some involved analyses, a weak entropy shock wave starting from the blowup point is constructed. As a byproduct, our result can be applied to the shock formation and construction for the 2-D supersonic steady compressible full Euler equations ($4\times 4$ system), 1-D MHD equations ($5\times 5$ system), 1-D elastic wave equations ($6\times 6$ system) and 1-D full ideal compressible MHD equations ($7\times 7$ system).</description>

      <title>On stable self-similar blowup for corotational wave maps and equivariant Yang-Mills connections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14733v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider corotational wave maps from Minkowski spacetime into the sphere and the equivariant Yang-Mills equation for all energy-supercritical dimensions. Both models have explicit self-similar finite time blowup solutions, which continue to exist even past the singularity. We prove the nonlinear asymptotic stability of these solutions in spacetime regions that approach the future light cone of the singularity. For this, we develop a general functional analytic framework in adapted similarity coordinates that allows to evolve the stable wave flow near a self-similar blowup solution in such spacetime regions.</description>

      <title>Mixing, Enhanced Dissipation and Phase Transition in the Kinetic Vicsek Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19859v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the kinetic Vicsek model, which serves as a starting point for describing the polarization phenomena observed in the experiments of fibroblasts moving on liquid crystalline substrates. The long-time behavior of the kinetic equation is analyzed, revealing that, within specific parameter regimes, the mixing and enhanced dissipation phenomena stabilize the dynamics and ensure effective information communication among agents. Consequently, the solution exhibits features similar to those of a spatially-homogeneous system. As a result, we confirm the phase transition observed in the agent-based Vicsek model at the kinetic level.</description>

      <title>Mild ill-posedness in $W^{1,\infty}$ for the incompressible porous media equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23727v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the mild ill-posedness of 2D IPM equation in the critical Sobolev space $W^{1,\infty}$ when the initial data are small perturbations of stable profile $g(x_2).$ Consequently, instability can be inferred. Notably, our results are valid for arbitrary vertically stratified density profiles $g(x_2)$ without imposing any restrictions on the sign of $g'(x_2).$ From a physical perspective, since gravity acts downward, density profiles satisfying $g'(x_2) &lt; 0$ typically correspond to stable configurations, whereas those with $g '(x_2) &gt; 0$ are generally expected to be unstable. Surprisingly, our analysis uncovers an unexpected instability even when $g'(x_2) &lt; 0$ and $g'(x_2)\in W^{2,\infty}(\mathbb{R})$. To the best of our knowledge, this work provides the first rigorous demonstration of IPM instability for vertically nonlinear density profiles, marking a significant departure from conventional physical expectations.</description>

      <title>Supercritical Fokker-Planck equations for consensus dynamics: large-time behaviour and weighted Nash-type inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01359v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the main properties of the solution of a Fokker-Planck equation characterized by a variable diffusion coefficient and a polynomial superlinear drift, modeling the formation of consensus in a large interacting system of individuals. The Fokker-Planck equation is derived from the kinetic description of the dynamics of a quantum particle system, and in presence of a high nonlinearity in the drift operator, mimicking the effects of the mass in the alignment forces, allows for steady states similar to a Bose-Einstein condensate. The main feature of this Fokker-Planck equation is the presence of a variable diffusion coefficient, a nonlinear drift and boundaries, which introduce new challenging mathematical problems in the study of its long-time behavior. In particular, propagation of regularity is shown as a consequence of new weighted Nash and Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequalities.</description>

      <title>Global Well-posedness and Long-time Behavior of the General Ericksen--Leslie System in 2D under a Magnetic Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06748v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the global well-posedness and long-time behavior of the two-dimensional general Ericksen--Leslie system for a nematic liquid crystal in a constant magnetic field. The PDE system consists of Navier--Stokes equations and the harmonic heat flow equation for the orientations of liquid crystal molecules. For incompressible nematic liquid crystal fluids with either isotropic or anisotropic properties in torus $\mathbb{T}^2$, we derive the global well-posedness of strong solutions through higher-order energy estimates combined with compactness methods and acquire the long-time behavior of the solutions by using the \L ojasiewicz--Simon inequality after obtaining the boundedness of the nematic liquid crystal molecules' angle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04161v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study geometrically constrained magnetic walls in a three dimensional geometry where two bulks are connected by a thin neck. Without imposing any symmetry assumption on the domain, we investigate the scaling of the energy as the size of the neck vanishes. We identify five significant scaling regimes, for all of which we characterise the energy scaling and identify the asymptotic behaviour of the domain wall. Finally, we notice the emergence of sub-regimes that are not present in the previous works due to restrictive symmetry assumptions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01504v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Cauchy problem for the two-component Novikov system with initial data $u_0, v_0$ in $H^1(\mathbb{R})$ such that the product $(\partial_x u_0)\partial_x v_0$ belongs to $L^2(\mathbb{R})$. We construct a global semigroup of conservative weak solutions. We also discuss the potential concentration phenomena of $(\partial_x u)^2dx$, $(\partial_x v)^2dx$, and $\left((\partial_x u)^2(\partial_x v)^2\right)dx$, which contribute to wave-breaking and may occur for a set of time with nonzero measure. Finally, we establish the continuity of the data-to-solution map in the uniform norm.</description>

      <title>Sharp Asymptotic Behavior of the Steady Pressure-free Prandtl system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11870v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the asymptotic behavior of solutions to the steady pressure-free Prandtl system. By employing a modified von Mises transformation, we rigorously prove the far-field convergence of Prandtl solutions to Blasius flow. A weighted energy method is employed to establish the optimal convergence rate assuming that the initial data constitutes a perturbation of the Blasius profile. Furthermore, a sharp maximum principle technique is applied to derive the optimal convergence rate for concave initial data. The critical weights and comparison functions depend on the first eigenfunction of the linearized operator associated with the system.</description>

      <title>The geometric Toda equations for noncompact symmetric spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02323v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper has two purposes. The first is to classify all those versions of the Toda equations which govern the existence of $\tau$-primitive harmonic maps from a surface into a homogeneous space $G/T$ for which $G$ is a noncomplex noncompact simple real Lie group, $\tau$ is the Coxeter automorphism which Drinfel'd \&amp; Sokolov assigned to each affine Dynkin diagram, and $T$ is the compact torus fixed pointwise by $\tau$. Here $\tau$ may be either an inner or an outer automorphism. We interpret the Toda equations over a compact Riemann surface $\Sigma$ as equations for a metric on a holomorphic principal $T^\mathbb{C}$-bundle $Q^\mathbb{C}$ over $\Sigma$ whose Chern connection, when combined with holomorphic field $\varphi$, produces a $G$-connection which is flat precisely when the Toda equations hold. The second purpose is to establish when stability criteria for the pair $(Q^\mathbb{C},\varphi)$ can be used to prove the existence of solutions. We classify those real forms of the Toda equations for which this pair is a principal pair and we call these \emph{totally noncompact} Toda pairs: stability theory then gives algebraic conditions for the existence of solutions. Every solution to the geometric Toda equations has a corresponding $G$-Higgs bundle. We explain how to construct this $G$-Higgs bundle directly from the Toda pair and show that Baraglia's cyclic Higgs bundles arise from a very special case of totally noncompact cyclic Toda pairs.</description>

      <title>A note on traces for the Heisenberg calculus</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11982v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In previous work, we gave a local formula for the index of Heisenberg elliptic operators on contact manifolds. We constructed a cocycle in periodic cyclic cohomology which, when paired with the Connes-Chern character of the principal Heisenberg symbol, calculates the index. A crucial ingredient of our index formula was a new trace on the algebra of Heisenberg pseudodifferential operators. The construction of this trace was rather involved. In the present paper, we clarify the nature of this trace.</description>

      <title>Non-uniqueness of Leray-Hopf Solutions to Forced Stochastic Hyperdissipative Navier-Stokes Equations up to Lions Index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18041v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show non-uniqueness of local strong solutions to stochastic fractional Navier-Stokes equations with linear multiplicative noise and some certain deterministic force. Such non-uniqueness holds true even if we perturb such deterministic force in appropriate sense.This is closely related to a critical condition on force under which Leray-Hopf solution to the stochastic equations is locally unique. Meanwhile, by a new idea, we show that for some stochastic force the system admits two different global Leray-Hopf solutions smooth on any compact subset of $(0,\infty) \times \mathbb{R}^d$.</description>
