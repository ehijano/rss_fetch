      <title>Scale This, Not That: Investigating Key Dataset Attributes for Efficient Speech Enhancement Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent speech enhancement models have shown impressive performance gains by scaling up model complexity and training data. However, the impact of dataset variability (e.g. text, language, speaker, and noise) has been underexplored. Analyzing each attribute individually is often challenging, as multiple attributes are usually entangled in commonly used datasets, posing a significant obstacle in understanding the distinct contributions of each attribute to the model's performance. To address this challenge, we propose a generation-training-evaluation framework that leverages zero-shot text-to-speech systems to investigate the impact of controlled attribute variations on speech enhancement performance. It enables us to synthesize training datasets in a scalable manner while carefully altering each attribute. Based on the proposed framework, we analyze the scaling effects of various dataset attributes on the performance of both discriminative and generative SE models. Extensive experiments on multi-domain corpora imply that acoustic attributes (e.g., speaker and noise) are much more important to current speech enhancement models than semantic attributes (e.g., language and text), offering new insights for future research.</description>

      <title>Stable-V2A: Synthesis of Synchronized Sound Effects with Temporal and Semantic Controls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sound designers and Foley artists usually sonorize a scene, such as from a movie or video game, by manually annotating and sonorizing each action of interest in the video. In our case, the intent is to leave full creative control to sound designers with a tool that allows them to bypass the more repetitive parts of their work, thus being able to focus on the creative aspects of sound production. We achieve this presenting Stable-V2A, a two-stage model consisting of: an RMS-Mapper that estimates an envelope representative of the audio characteristics associated with the input video; and Stable-Foley, a diffusion model based on Stable Audio Open that generates audio semantically and temporally aligned with the target video. Temporal alignment is guaranteed by the use of the envelope as a ControlNet input, while semantic alignment is achieved through the use of sound representations chosen by the designer as cross-attention conditioning of the diffusion process. We train and test our model on Greatest Hits, a dataset commonly used to evaluate V2A models. In addition, to test our model on a case study of interest, we introduce Walking The Maps, a dataset of videos extracted from video games depicting animated characters walking in different locations. Samples and code available on our demo page at https://ispamm.github.io/Stable-V2A.</description>

      <title>GIRAFE: Glottal Imaging Dataset for Advanced Segmentation, Analysis, and Facilitative Playbacks Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advances in the development of Facilitative Playbacks extracted from High-Speed videoendoscopic sequences of the vocal folds are hindered by a notable lack of publicly available datasets annotated with the semantic segmentations corresponding to the area of the glottal gap. This fact also limits the reproducibility and further exploration of existing research in this field.
  To address this gap, GIRAFE is a data repository designed to facilitate the development of advanced techniques for the semantic segmentation, analysis, and fast evaluation of High-Speed videoendoscopic sequences of the vocal folds. The repository includes 65 high-speed videoendoscopic recordings from a cohort of 50 patients (30 female, 20 male). The dataset comprises 15 recordings from healthy controls, 26 from patients with diagnosed voice disorders, and 24 with an unknown health condition. All of them were manually annotated by an expert, including the masks corresponding to the semantic segmentation of the glottal gap. The repository is also complemented with the automatic segmentation of the glottal area using different state-of-the-art approaches.
  This data set has already supported several studies, which demonstrates its usefulness for the development of new glottal gap segmentation algorithms from High-Speed-Videoendoscopic sequences to improve or create new Facilitative Playbacks. Despite these advances and others in the field, the broader challenge of performing an accurate and completely automatic semantic segmentation method of the glottal area remains open.</description>

      <title>AV-Link: Temporally-Aligned Diffusion Features for Cross-Modal Audio-Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose AV-Link, a unified framework for Video-to-Audio and Audio-to-Video generation that leverages the activations of frozen video and audio diffusion models for temporally-aligned cross-modal conditioning. The key to our framework is a Fusion Block that enables bidirectional information exchange between our backbone video and audio diffusion models through a temporally-aligned self attention operation. Unlike prior work that uses feature extractors pretrained for other tasks for the conditioning signal, AV-Link can directly leverage features obtained by the complementary modality in a single framework i.e. video features to generate audio, or audio features to generate video. We extensively evaluate our design choices and demonstrate the ability of our method to achieve synchronized and high-quality audiovisual content, showcasing its potential for applications in immersive media generation.

      <title>Deep Learning-based Non-Intrusive Multi-Objective Speech Assessment Model with Cross-Domain Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.02363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.02363v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we propose a cross-domain multi-objective speech assessment model called MOSA-Net, which can estimate multiple speech assessment metrics simultaneously. Experimental results show that MOSA-Net can improve the linear correlation coefficient (LCC) by 0.026 (0.990 vs 0.964 in seen noise environments) and 0.012 (0.969 vs 0.957 in unseen noise environments) in perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ) prediction, compared to Quality-Net, an existing single-task model for PESQ prediction, and improve LCC by 0.021 (0.985 vs 0.964 in seen noise environments) and 0.047 (0.836 vs 0.789 in unseen noise environments) in short-time objective intelligibility (STOI) prediction, compared to STOI-Net (based on CRNN), an existing single-task model for STOI prediction. Moreover, MOSA-Net, originally trained to assess objective scores, can be used as a pre-trained model to be effectively adapted to an assessment model for predicting subjective quality and intelligibility scores with a limited amount of training data. Experimental results show that MOSA-Net can improve LCC by 0.018 (0.805 vs 0.787) in mean opinion score (MOS) prediction, compared to MOS-SSL, a strong single-task model for MOS prediction. In light of the confirmed prediction capability, we further adopt the latent representations of MOSA-Net to guide the speech enhancement (SE) process and derive a quality-intelligibility (QI)-aware SE (QIA-SE) approach accordingly. Experimental results show that QIA-SE provides superior enhancement performance compared with the baseline SE system in terms of objective evaluation metrics and qualitative evaluation test. For example, QIA-SE can improve PESQ by 0.301 (2.953 vs 2.652 in seen noise environments) and 0.18 (2.658 vs 2.478 in unseen noise environments) over a CNN-based baseline SE model.</description>

      <title>Audio-Visual Speaker Tracking: Progress, Challenges, and Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14778v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Audio-visual speaker tracking has drawn increasing attention over the past few years due to its academic values and wide application. Audio and visual modalities can provide complementary information for localization and tracking. With audio and visual information, the Bayesian-based filter can solve the problem of data association, audio-visual fusion and track management. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive overview of audio-visual speaker tracking. To our knowledge, this is the first extensive survey over the past five years. We introduce the family of Bayesian filters and summarize the methods for obtaining audio-visual measurements. In addition, the existing trackers and their performance on AV16.3 dataset are summarized. In the past few years, deep learning techniques have thrived, which also boosts the development of audio visual speaker tracking. The influence of deep learning techniques in terms of measurement extraction and state estimation is also discussed. At last, we discuss the connections between audio-visual speaker tracking and other areas such as speech separation and distributed speaker tracking.</description>

      <title>ICSD: An Open-source Dataset for Infant Cry and Snoring Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10561v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The detection and analysis of infant cry and snoring events are crucial tasks within the field of audio signal processing. While existing datasets for general sound event detection are plentiful, they often fall short in providing sufficient, strongly labeled data specific to infant cries and snoring. To provide a benchmark dataset and thus foster the research of infant cry and snoring detection, this paper introduces the Infant Cry and Snoring Detection (ICSD) dataset, a novel, publicly available dataset specially designed for ICSD tasks. The ICSD comprises three types of subsets: a real strongly labeled subset with event-based labels annotated manually, a weakly labeled subset with only clip-level event annotations, and a synthetic subset generated and labeled with strong annotations. This paper provides a detailed description of the ICSD creation process, including the challenges encountered and the solutions adopted. We offer a comprehensive characterization of the dataset, discussing its limitations and key factors for ICSD usage. Additionally, we conduct extensive experiments on the ICSD dataset to establish baseline systems and offer insights into the main factors when using this dataset for ICSD research. Our goal is to develop a dataset that will be widely adopted by the community as a new open benchmark for future ICSD research.</description>

      <title>Deep CLAS: Deep Contextual Listen, Attend and Spell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17603v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Contextual-LAS (CLAS) has been shown effective in improving Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) of rare words. It relies on phrase-level contextual modeling and attention-based relevance scoring without explicit contextual constraint which lead to insufficient use of contextual information. In this work, we propose deep CLAS to use contextual information better. We introduce bias loss forcing model to focus on contextual information. The query of bias attention is also enriched to improve the accuracy of the bias attention score. To get fine-grained contextual information, we replace phrase-level encoding with character-level encoding and encode contextual information with conformer rather than LSTM. Moreover, we directly use the bias attention score to correct the output probability distribution of the model. Experiments using the public AISHELL-1 and AISHELL-NER. On AISHELL-1, compared to CLAS baselines, deep CLAS obtains a 65.78% relative recall and a 53.49% relative F1-score increase in the named entity recognition scene.</description>

      <title>Audio Captioning RAG via Generative Pair-to-Pair Retrieval with Refined Knowledge Base</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10913v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in audio understanding tasks leverage the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. However, adapting LLMs to learn audio concepts requires massive training data and substantial computational resources. To address these challenges, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) retrieves audio-text pairs from a knowledge base (KB) and augments them with query audio to generate accurate textual responses. In RAG, the relevance of the retrieved information plays a crucial role in effectively processing the input. In this paper, we analyze how different retrieval methods and knowledge bases impact the relevance of audio-text pairs and the performance of audio captioning with RAG. We propose generative pair-to-pair retrieval, which uses the generated caption as a text query to accurately find relevant audio-text pairs to the query audio, thereby improving the relevance and accuracy of retrieved information. Additionally, we refine the large-scale knowledge base to retain only audio-text pairs that align with the contextualized intents. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on benchmarks including AudioCaps, Clotho, and Auto-ACD, with detailed ablation studies validating the effectiveness of our retrieval and KB construction methods.</description>

      <title>ProsodyFM: Unsupervised Phrasing and Intonation Control for Intelligible Speech Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11795v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Prosody contains rich information beyond the literal meaning of words, which is crucial for the intelligibility of speech. Current models still fall short in phrasing and intonation; they not only miss or misplace breaks when synthesizing long sentences with complex structures but also produce unnatural intonation. We propose ProsodyFM, a prosody-aware text-to-speech synthesis (TTS) model with a flow-matching (FM) backbone that aims to enhance the phrasing and intonation aspects of prosody. ProsodyFM introduces two key components: a Phrase Break Encoder to capture initial phrase break locations, followed by a Duration Predictor for the flexible adjustment of break durations; and a Terminal Intonation Encoder which learns a bank of intonation shape tokens combined with a novel Pitch Processor for more robust modeling of human-perceived intonation change. ProsodyFM is trained with no explicit prosodic labels and yet can uncover a broad spectrum of break durations and intonation patterns. Experimental results demonstrate that ProsodyFM can effectively improve the phrasing and intonation aspects of prosody, thereby enhancing the overall intelligibility compared to four state-of-the-art (SOTA) models. Out-of-distribution experiments show that this prosody improvement can further bring ProsodyFM superior generalizability for unseen complex sentences and speakers. Our case study intuitively illustrates the powerful and fine-grained controllability of ProsodyFM over phrasing and intonation.</description>
