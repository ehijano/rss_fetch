      <title>Patient-Specific CT Doses Using DL-based Image Segmentation and GPU-based Monte Carlo Calculations for 10,281 Subjects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11480v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computed tomography (CT) scans are a major source of medical radiation exposure worldwide. In countries like China, the frequency of CT scans has grown rapidly, particularly in routine physical examinations where chest CT scans are increasingly common. Accurate estimation of organ doses is crucial for assessing radiation risk and optimizing imaging protocols. However, traditional methods face challenges due to the labor-intensive process of manual organ segmentation and the computational demands of Monte Carlo (MC) dose calculations. In this study, we present a novel method that combines automatic image segmentation with GPU-accelerated MC simulations to compute patient-specific organ doses for a large cohort of 10,281 individuals undergoing CT examinations for physical examinations at a Chinese hospital. This is the first big-data study of its kind involving such a large population for CT dosimetry. The results show considerable inter-individual variability in CTDIvol-normalized organ doses, even among subjects with similar BMI or WED. Patient-specific organ doses vary widely, ranging from 33% to 164% normalized by the doses from ICRP Adult Reference Phantoms. Statistical analyses indicate that the "Reference Man" based average phantoms can lead to significant dosimetric uncertainties, with relative errors exceeding 50% in some cases. These findings underscore the fact that previous assessments of radiation risk may be inaccurate. It took our computational tool, on average, 135 seconds per subject, using a single NVIDIA RTX 3080 GPU card. The big-data analysis provides interesting data for improving CT dosimetry and risk assessment by avoiding uncertainties that were neglected in the past.</description>

      <title>Ethical Analysis on the Application of Neurotechnology for Human Augmentation in Physicians and Surgeons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.16925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2006.16925v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the shortage of physicians and surgeons and increase in demand worldwide due to situations such as the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a growing interest in finding solutions to help address the problem. A solution to this problem would be to use neurotechnology to provide them augmented cognition, senses and action for optimal diagnosis and treatment. Consequently, doing so can negatively impact them and others. We argue that applying neurotechnology for human enhancement in physicians and surgeons can cause injustices, and harm to them and patients. In this paper, we will first describe the augmentations and neurotechnologies that can be used to achieve the relevant augmentations for physicians and surgeons. We will then review selected ethical concerns discussed within literature, discuss the neuroengineering behind using neurotechnology for augmentation purposes, then conclude with an analysis on outcomes and ethical issues of implementing human augmentation via neurotechnology in medical and surgical practice.</description>

      <title>Analytical solutions to intensity calculation in scintillation detectors and their application to the scintillation flash coordinates reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.07247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.07247v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Detectors with continuous scintillator and matrix of photomultipliers attached are widely used in modern particle physics, and various medical tomographs. There are two common ways to calculate the coordinates of the scintillation flash via photomultipliers energy outcome: Anger method and Monte Carlo simulations. In this article, we derive an analytical solution for the computation of the energy outcome from several photomultipliers built into the bottom face of the scintillation camera with a continuous scintillator shaped as a rectangular parallelepiped. The lateral faces of the scintillation camera are considered specular reflectors with reflective indexes $\sim 1$ or $0$. The analytical solution is used as a reference point for the scintillation flash coordinates reconstruction. The achieved results are similar to those the Monte Carlo simulation provides but require less computational time.</description>

      <title>Prediction of excitable wave dynamics using machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00278v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Excitable systems can exhibit a variety of dynamics with different complexity, ranging from a single, stable spiral to spiral defect chaos (SDC), during which spiral waves are continuously formed and destroyed. The corresponding reaction-diffusion models, including ones for cardiac tissue, can involve a large number of variables and can be time-consuming to simulate. Here we trained a deep-learning (DL) model using snapshots from a single variable, obtained by simulating a single quasi-periodic spiral wave and SDC using a generic cardiac model. Using the trained DL model, we predicted the dynamics in both cases, using timesteps that are much larger than required for the simulations of the underlying equations. We show that the DL model is able to predict the trajectory of a quasi-periodic spiral wave and that the SDC activaton patterns can be predicted for approximately one Lyapunov time. Furthermore, we show that the DL model accurately captures the statistics of termination events in SDC, including the mean termination time. Finally, we show that a DL model trained using a specific domain size is able to replicate termination statistics on larger domains, resulting in significant computational savings.</description>
