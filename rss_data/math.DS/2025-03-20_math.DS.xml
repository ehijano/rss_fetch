      <title>The Onsager-Machlup functional for distribution dependent SDEs driven by fractional Brownian motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we compute the Onsager-Machlup functional for distribution dependent SDEs driven by fractional Brownian motions with Hurst
  parameter $H\in (\frac{1}{4},1)$. In the case $ \frac{1}{4} &lt; H &lt; \frac{1}{2} $, the norm can be either the supremum norm or H\"older norms of order $ \beta $ with $ 0 &lt; \beta &lt; H - \frac{1}{4} $. In the case $\frac{1}{2} &lt; H &lt; 1 $, the norms can be a H\"older norm of order $ \beta$ with $ H - \frac{1}{2} &lt; \beta &lt; H - \frac{1}{4} $. As an example, we compute the Onsager-Machlup functional for the stochastic pendulum equation</description>

      <title>A version of Oseledets for proximal random dynamical System on the circle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study proximal random dynamical systems of homeomorphisms of the circle without a common fixed point. We prove the existence of two random points that govern the behavior of the forward and backward orbits of the system. Assuming the differentiability of the maps, we characterize these random points in terms of the extremal Lyapunov exponents of the random dynamical system. As an application, we prove the exactness of the stationary measure in this setting.</description>

      <title>Quantitative twisted recurrence properties for piecewise expanding maps on $[0,1]^d$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $T:[0,1]^d \rightarrow[0,1]^d$ be a piecewise expanding map with an absolutely continuous (with respect to the $d$-dimensional Lebesgue measure $m_d$) $T$-invariant probability measure $\mu$. Let $\left\{\mathbf{r}_n\right\}$ be a sequence of vectors satisfying the conditons that $\mathbf{r}_n=\left(r_{n, 1}, \ldots, r_{n, d}\right) \in\left(\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}\right)^d$, the sequence $\left\{\frac{\max _{1 \leq i \leq d}\hspace{1ex}r_{n, i}}{\min _{1 \leq i \leq d}\hspace{1ex}r_{n, i}}\right\}$ is bounded and $\lim _{n \rightarrow \infty} \max _{1 \leq i \leq d}r_{n, i}=0$. Let $\left\{\delta_n\right\}$ be a sequence of non-negative real numbers with $\lim _{n \rightarrow \infty} \delta_n=0$. Under the assumptions that $\mu$ is exponentially mixing and its density is sufficiently regular, we prove that the $\mu$-measure of the following sets $$\mathcal{R}^f\left(\left\{\mathbf{r}_n\right\}\right)=\left\{\mathbf{x} \in[0,1]^d: T^n \mathbf{x} \in R\left(f(\mathbf{x}), \mathbf{r}_n\right) \text { for infinitely many } n \in \mathbb{N} \right\} $$ and $$\mathcal{R}^{f \times}\left(\left\{\delta_n\right\}\right)=\left\{\mathbf{x} \in[0,1]^d: T^n \mathbf{x} \in H\left(f(\mathbf{x}), \delta_n\right) \text { for infinitely many } n \in \mathbb{N} \right\}$$ obeys zero-full laws determined by the convergence or divergence of natural volume sums. Here, $R(f(\mathbf{x}), \mathbf{r}_n)$ and $H(f(\mathbf{x}), \delta_n)$ represent targets as, respectively, coordinate-parallel hyperrectangles with bounded aspect ratio, and hyperboloids, both centered at $f(\mathbf{x})$. $f: [0,1]^d \rightarrow [0,1]^d$ is a piecewise Lipschitz vector function. Our results not only unify quantitative recurrence properties and the shrinking target problem for piecewise expanding maps on $[0,1]^d$, but also reveal that the two problems and cross-component recurrence can coexist in distinct directions on $[0,1]^d$.</description>

      <title>Representation of Global Viscosity Solutions for Tonelli Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Lax-Oleinik operator $\mathcal{T}$ associated with the non-stationary Hamilton-Jacobi equation $\partial_tu + H(t,x,\partial_xu) = \alpha_0$ for a Tonelli Hamiltonian $H$ and its \Mane critical value $\alpha_0$. It is known from the work of A. Fathi and J.N. Mather \cite{MR1792479} that the convergence of this semigroup fails in the non-autonomous framework.
  In this context, we study the action of $\mathcal{T}$ on its non-wandering set $\Omega(\mathcal{T})$. First, we show that $\mathcal{T}$ acts as an isometry on this set, and then we characterize $\Omega(\mathcal{T})$ as the set of global viscosity solutions of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation, i.e. solutions that are defined for all real times.
  Next, we introduce a generalized Peierls barrier $\underline{k}$ and a set of generalized static classes $\underline{\mathbb{M}}$ within the Mather set. Using these, we represent elements $u$ of $\Omega(\mathcal{T})$ as
  \begin{equation*}
  u(x) = \inf_{y \in \underline{\mathbb{M}}} \{ u(y) + \underline{k}(y,x) \}
  \end{equation*}
  We apply this representation formula to prove Fathi's convergence theorem for autonomous systems and provide a representation formula for $n$-periodic viscosity solutions. Additionally, we establish that the dynamics of non-wandering viscosity solutions are governed by the Lagrangian flow on the Mather set. Specifically, we show that if the Mather set consists solely of $N$-periodic orbits for some integer $N$, then all non-wandering viscosity solutions are $N$-periodic. Furthermore, we show that if the restriction of the Lagrangian flow to the Mather set is uniformly recurrent for a time sequence $p_n$, then all non-wandering viscosity solutions are uniformly recurrent for the same time sequence $p_n$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a general measurable Liv\v{s}ic regularity theorem for real-valued cocycles over non-invertible dynamical systems using only abstract hypotheses on an associated transfer operator. As illustrative applications we derive measurable Liv\v{s}ic regularity results in the analytic regularity class for cocycles over real-analytic expanding maps, in the bounded-variation regularity class for $\beta$-transformations, and in $C^\alpha$ regularity over the class of virtually expanding maps recently introduced by M. Tsujii.</description>

      <title>Topological Kleene Field Theories: A new model of computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we establish the foundations of a computational field theory, which we term Topological Kleene Field Theory (TKFT), inspired by Stephen Kleene's seminal work on partial recursive functions. Our central result shows that any computable function can be simulated by the flow on a smooth bordism of a vector field with good local properties. More precisely, we prove that reaching functions on clean dynamical bordisms are exactly equivalent to computable functions, setting an alternative model of computation to Turing machines. The use of non-trivial topologies for the bordisms involved is essential for this equivalence, suggesting interesting connections between the topological structure of these flows and the computational complexity inherent in the functions. We emphasize that TKFT has the potential to surpass the computational complexity of both Turing machines and quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Aging and mortality of persons with HIV: a novel Kalman Filtering and DMD framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the widespread availability of effective antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimens, average lifespans of persons with HIV (PWH) in the United States have increased significantly in recent decades. In turn, the demographic profile of PWH has shifted. Older persons comprise an ever-increasing percentage of PWH, with this percentage expected to further increase in the coming years. This has profound implications for HIV treatment and care, as significant resources are required not only to manage HIV itself, but associated age-related comorbidities and health conditions that occur in aging PWH. Effective management of these challenges in the coming years requires accurate modeling of the PWH age structure. In the present work, we introduce several novel mathematical approaches related to this problem. We present a workflow combining a PDE model for the PWH population age structure, into which publicly-available HIV surveillance data is assimilated using the Ensemble Kalman Inversion (EKI) algorithm. This procedure allows us to rigorously reconstruct the age-dependent mortality trends for PWH over the last several decades. To project future trends, we introduce and analyze a novel variant of the Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD), nonnegative DMD. We show that nonnegative DMD provides physically-consistent projections of mortality and HIV diagnosis while remaining purely data-driven, and not requiring additional assumptions. We then combine these elements to provide forecasts for future trends in PWDH mortality and demographic evolution in the coming years.</description>

      <title>Rates of convergence in the multivariate weak invariance principle for nonuniformly hyperbolic maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain rates of convergence in the weak invariance principle (functional central limit theorem) for $\R^d$-valued H\"older observables of nonuniformly hyperbolic maps. In particular, for maps modelled by a Young tower with superpolynomial tails (e.g.\ the Sinai billiard map, and Axiom A diffeomorphisms) we obtain a rate of $O(n^{-\kappa})$ in the Wasserstein $p$-metric for all $\kappa&lt;1/4$ and $p&lt;\infty$. Additionally, this is the first result on rates that covers certain invertible, slowly mixing maps, such as Bunimovich flowers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce CLINE (Computational Learning and Identification of Nullclines), a neural network-based method that uncovers the hidden structure of nullclines from oscillatory time series data. Unlike traditional approaches aiming at direct prediction of system dynamics, CLINE identifies static geometric features of the phase space that encode the (non)linear relationships between state variables. It overcomes challenges such as multiple time scales and strong nonlinearities while producing interpretable results convertible into symbolic differential equations. We validate CLINE on various oscillatory systems, showcasing its effectiveness.</description>

      <title>A Lyapunov exponent attached to modular functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To each weakly holomorphic modular function $f\not \equiv 0$ for $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{Z})$, which is non-negative on the geodesic arc $\{e^{it} : \pi/3\leq t\leq 2\pi/3\}$, we attach a $\mathrm{GL}(2,\mathbb{Z})$-invariant map $\Lambda_f:\mathbb{P}^1(\mathbb{R})\to \mathbb{R}$ that generalizes the Lyapunov exponent function introduced by Spalding and Veselov. We prove that it takes every value between $0$ and $\Lambda_f\left(\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}\right)$ and it gives an increasing convex function on the Markov irrationalities when ordered using their parametrization by Farey fractions in $[0,1/2]$. In the case of quadratic irrationals $w$ with purely periodic continued fraction expansion, the value $\Lambda_f(w)$ equals the real part of the cycle integral of $f$ along the associated geodesic $C_w$ on the modular surface, normalized with the word length of the associated hyperbolic matrix $A_w$ as a word in the generators $T=\left(\begin{smallmatrix}
  1 &amp; 1 \\ 0 &amp; 1 \end{smallmatrix}\right)$ and $V=\left(\begin{smallmatrix}
  1 &amp; 0 \\ 1 &amp; 1 \end{smallmatrix}\right)$. These results are related to conjectures of Kaneko who observed several similar behavior for the cycle integrals of the modular $j$ function when normalized by the hyperbolic length of the geodesic $C_w$.</description>

      <title>A Mixed-FEM approximation with uniform conservation of the exponential stability for a class of anisotropic port-Hamiltonian system and its application to LQ control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we present a mixed finite element discretization for a class of boundary-damped anisotropic port-Hamiltonian systems. Using a multiplier method, we demonstrate that the resulting approximation model uniformly preserves the exponential stability of the uncontrolled system, establishing a lower bound for the exponential decay rate that is independent of the mesh size. This property is illustrated through the spatial discretization of a piezoelectric beam. Furthermore, we show how the uniform preservation of exponential stability by the proposed model aids in the convergence of controllers derived from an infinite-time linear quadratic control design, in comparison to models obtained from the standard finite-element method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02536v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An iterated multistep forecasting scheme based on recurrent neural networks (RNN) is proposed for the time series generated by causal chains with infinite memory. This forecasting strategy contains, as a particular case, the iterative prediction strategies for dynamical systems that are customary in reservoir computing. Explicit error bounds are obtained as a function of the forecasting horizon, functional and dynamical features of the specific RNN used, and the approximation error committed by it. In particular, the growth rate of the error is shown to be exponential and controlled by the top Lyapunov exponent of the proxy system. The framework in the paper circumvents difficult-to-verify embedding hypotheses that appear in previous references in the literature and applies to new situations like the finite-dimensional observations of functional differential equations or the deterministic parts of stochastic processes to which standard embedding techniques do not necessarily apply.</description>

      <title>Solution space characterisation of perturbed linear discrete and continuous stochastic Volterra convolution equations: the $\ell^p$ and $L^p$ cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07767v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we are concerned with characterising when solutions of perturbed linear stochastic Volterra summation equations are $p$-summable along with when their continuous time counterparts, perturbed linear stochastic Volterra integrodifferential equations are $p$-integrable. In the discrete case we find it necessary and sufficient that perturbing functions are $p$-summable in order to ensure paths of the discrete equation are $p$-summable almost surely, while in the continuous case it transpires one can have almost surely $p$-integrable sample paths even with non-integrable perturbation functions. For the continuous equation the main converse is clinched by considering an appropriate discretisation and applying results from the discrete case. We also conduct a thorough study of the asymptotic behaviour of the trajectories of solutions to the continuous equation in the regime of $p$-integrable paths and provide a characterisation of asymptotic convergence to zero in the case of diagonal noise. Additionally we highlight how all proof methods can be applied to obtain even stronger results for stochastic functional differential equations.</description>

Abstract: We provide an alternative construction of the quasi-Fuchsian flows introduced by Ghys in \cite{Ghys-92}. Our approach is based on the coupled vortex equations that allows to see these flows as thermostats on the unit tangent bundle of the Blaschke metric uniquely determined by a conformal class and a holomorphic quadratic differential. We also give formulas for the marked length spectrum of a quasi-Fuchsian flow in the thermostat parametrization.</description>

      <title>A Data-Driven Framework for Koopman Semigroup Estimation in Stochastic Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13301v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present Stochastic Dynamic Mode Decomposition (SDMD), a novel data-driven framework for approximating the Koopman semigroup in stochastic dynamical systems. Unlike existing methods, SDMD explicitly incorporates sampling time into its approximation, ensuring numerical stability and precision. By directly approximating the Koopman semigroup instead of the generator, SDMD avoids computationally expensive matrix exponential computations, which offers a more efficient and practical pathway for analyzing stochastic dynamics. The framework further integrates neural networks to automate basis selection, which reduces the reliance on manual intervention while maintaining computational efficiency. Rigorous theoretical guarantees, including convergence in the large data limit, zero-limit of sampling time, and large dictionary size, establish the method's reliability. Numerical experiments on canonical stochastic systems validate SDMD's effectiveness in approximating eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the stochastic Koopman operator.</description>

Abstract: This study analyses the dynamical consequences of heterogeneous temporal delays within a quorum sensing-inspired (QS-inspired) system, specifically addressing the differential response kinetics of two subpopulations to signalling molecules. A nonlinear delay differential equation (DDE) model, predicated upon an activator-inhibitor framework, is formulated to represent the interspecies interactions. Key analytical techniques, including the derivation of the pseudo-characteristic polynomial and the determination of Hopf bifurcation criteria, are employed to investigate the stability properties of steady-state solutions. The analysis reveals the critical role of multiple, dissimilar delays in modulating system dynamics and inducing bifurcations. Numerical simulations, conducted in conjunction with analytical results, reveal the emergence of periodic self-sustained oscillations and intermittent chaotic behaviour. These observations emphasise the intricate relationship between temporal heterogeneity and the stability landscape of systems exhibiting QS-inspired dynamics. This interplay highlights the capacity for temporal variations to induce complex dynamical transitions within such systems. These findings assist to the comprehension of temporal dynamics within these and related systems, and may contribute to the development of strategies aimed at modulating intercellular communication and engineering synthetic biological systems with temporal control.</description>
