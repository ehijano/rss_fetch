      <title>Study on ploughing phenomena in tool flank face workpiece interface including tool wear effect during ball end milling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ploughing phenomena occurring during precise machining processes affect the formation of surface finish and progress of tool wear. Therefore, this study presents an evaluation of ploughing phenomenon by studying the ploughing forces in tool flank face workpiece interface during precise ball end milling of AISI L6 alloy steel. Developed original model of ploughing forces involved the effect of minimum uncut chip thickness hmin and ploughing volume during ball-end milling. Estimated ploughing forces are sensitive to variations of surface inclinations and progressing tool wear. Moreover, intense growth of ploughing force during milling with worn tool is affected by irregular and non-circular profile of worn cutting edge below the stagnant point, and by the appearance of attrition and micro-grooves on tool flank face.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the earth tides with a diamagnetic-levitated micro-oscillator at room temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The precise measurement of the gravity of the earth plays a pivotal role in various fundamental research and application fields. Although a few gravimeters have been reported to achieve this goal, miniaturization of high-precision gravimetry remains a challenge. In this work, we have proposed and demonstrated a miniaturized gravimetry operating at room temperature based on a diamagnetic levitated micro-oscillator with a proof mass of only 215 mg. Compared with the latest reported miniaturized gravimeters based on Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems, the performance of our gravimetry has substantial improvements in that an acceleration sensitivity of 15 $\mu Gal/\sqrt{Hz}$ and a drift as low as 61 $\mu Gal$ per day have been reached. Based on this diamagnetic levitation gravimetry, we observed the earth tides, and the correlation coefficient between the experimental data and theoretical data reached 0.97. Some moderate foreseeable improvements can develop this diamagnetic levitation gravimetry into chip size device, making it suitable for mobile platforms such as drones. Our advancement in gravimetry is expected to facilitate a multitude of applications, including underground density surveying and the forecasting of natural hazards.</description>

      <title>Spatial Control of Hybridization-Induced Spin-Wave Transmission Stop Band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-wave (SW) propagation close to the hybridization-induced transmission stop band is investigated within a trapezoid-shaped 200\,nm thick yttrium iron garnet (YIG) film using time-resolved magneto-optic Kerr effect (TR-MOKE) microscopy and broadband spin wave spectroscopy, supported by micromagnetic simulations. The gradual reduction of the effective field within the structure leads to local variations of the SW dispersion relation and results in a SW hybridization at a fixed position in the trapezoid where the propagation vanishes since the SW group velocity approaches zero. By tuning external field or frequency, spatial control of the spatial stop band position and spin-wave propagation is demonstrated and utilized to gain transmission control over several microstrip lines.</description>

      <title>Towards optimal spatiotemporal wavefront shaping for the cocktail party problem with inverse design of an acoustic reconfigurable metasurface in disordered media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiple-user multiple-input multiple-output applications have recently gained a lot of attention. Here, we show an efficient optimization formulation for the design of all the temporal and spatial degrees of freedom of an acoustic reconfigurable metasurface for the cocktail party problem. In the frequency domain, the closed-form least square solution matches the optimal time reversal solution for multiple emitter-receiver pairs, optimizing for each frequency independently. This is more efficient than solving in the time domain where the time convolution mixes all the degrees of freedom into a resource-intensive optimization. We illustrate this methodology by optimizing the frequency response of a design for two pairs of emitters-receivers using the Green's functions of disordered media that are measured experimentally. We report strong performance that will be put in perspective in future work, where we will analyze the robustness of the design to noise in the data and design the convolutional filters that match the optimal frequency response for experiment validation of the design.</description>

      <title>Controllable bipolaron formation unveiling structural features of trap states in organic charge transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic resonance methods offer a unique chance for in-depth study of conductive organic material systems, not only accounts for number of charge carriers, but also allows manipulations of spin dynamics of particles. Here we present a study of continuous-wave electrically detected magnetic resonance on a range of organic conjugate polymers under transistor architecture, with tunability in both carrier concentration and drifting electric field. We demonstrate the general existence of bipolaron between mobile and trapped charges at the magnetic resonance condition, then estimates the wavefunction expansion of charge carriers on their hopping sites along conductive pathways. This finding allows direct observation of energetically disordered trap sites under the charge hopping picture, linking-up the microscopic structural properties to the bulk electronic performances.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic-Field-Based Circuit Theory and Charge-Flux-Flow Diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The conventional circuit diagrams and graph-based circuit theory are used for the phase-independent circuits such as resistor-inductor-capacitor (RLC) circuits and semiconductor transistor circuits, rather than the phase-dependent circuits such as Josephson junction circuits and quantum-phase-slip (QPS) junction circuits. in the age of artificial intelligence (AI), we present an electromagnetic-field-based circuit theory to unify the phase-independent and phase-dependent electric circuits. This theory drives two general system models for all electric circuits, and visualizes the dynamics of circuit devices with electric-charge-flow (ECF) diagrams and the magnetic-flux-flow (MFF) diagrams. ECF and MFF diagrams enable electric circuits to be designed and analyzed like the molecules composed of two kinds of atoms; they are promising for the language to train AI-aided electronic-design-automation (EDA) tools.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic auxetic composite laminates: a polar approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of obtaining anisotropic auxetic composite laminates, i.e. having a negative Poisson's ratio for at least some directions, is examined in this paper. In particular, the possibility of obtaining auxeticity stacking uni-directional identical plies is considered. It is shown that if the ply is composed by isotropic matrix and fibers, then it is impossible to obtain totally auxetic orthotropic laminates, i.e. auxeticity for each direction, unless at least one among matrix and fibers is auxetic itself. Moreover, it is shown what are the conditions, in terms of the mechanical properties of the constituents and of the volume fraction of the fibers, to fabricate uni-directional plies with which to realize laminates having a negative Poisson's ratio for some directions. Several existing materials are also examined. All the analysis is done using the polar formalism, very effective for the study of plane anisotropic problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transition-metal-based layered double hydroxides (TM-LDHs) nanosheets are promising electrocatalysts in the renewable electrochemical energy conversion system, which are regarded as alternatives to noble metal-based materials. In this review, recent advances on effective and facile strategies to rationally design TM-LDHs nanosheets as electrocatalysts, such as increasing the number of active sties, improving the utilization of active sites (atomic-scale catalysts), modulating the electron configurations, and controlling the lattice facets, are summarized and compared. Then, the utilization of these fabricated TM-LDHs nanosheets for oxygen evolution reaction, hydrogen evolution reaction, urea oxidation reaction, nitrogen reduction reaction, small molecule oxidations, and biomass derivatives upgrading is articulated through systematically discussing the corresponding fundamental design principles and reaction mechanism. Finally, the existing challenges in increasing the density of catalytically active sites and future prospects of TM-LDHs nanosheets-based electrocatalysts in each application are also commented.</description>

      <title>Green fabrication of nickel-iron layered double hydroxides nanosheets efficient for the enhanced capacitive performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rational synthesis of robust layered double hydroxides (LDHs) nanosheets for high-energy supercapacitors is full of challenges. Herein, we reported an ultrasonication-assisted strategy to eco-friendly fabricate NiFe-LDHs nanosheets for the enhanced capacitive behavior. The experimental results combined with different advanced characterization tools document that the utilization of ultrasonication has a profound effect on the morphology and thickness of the as-obtained NiFe-LDHs, alternatively affecting the capacitive behavior. It shows that NiFe-LDHs nanosheets prepared with 2-h ultrasonic treatments display the exceptional capacitive performance because of the synergetic effect of ultrathin thickness, large specific surface area, and high mesoporous volume. The maximum specific capacitance of Ni3Fe1-LDHs nanosheets with the thickness of 7.39 nm and the specific surface area of 77.16 m2 g-1 reached 1923 F g-1, which is competitive with most previously reported values. In addition, the maximum specific energy of the assembled NiFe-LDHs//AC asymmetric supercapacitor achieved 49.13 Wh kg-1 at 400 W kg-1. This work provides a green technology to fabricate LDHs nanosheets, and offers deep insights for understanding the relationship between the morphology/structure and capacitive behavior of LDHs nanosheets, which is helpful for achieving high-performance LDHs-based electrode materials.</description>

      <title>In situ growth of hydrophilic nickel-cobalt layered double hydroxides nanosheets on biomass waste-derived porous carbon for high-performance hybrid supercapacitors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rational design and cost-effective fabrication of layered double hydroxides (LDHs) nanosheets with extraordinary electrochemical performance is a key challenge for hybrid supercapacitors (HSCs). Herein, we report a facile in situ growth methodology to eco-friendly synthesize hydrophilic NiCo-LDHs nanosheets on biomass waste-derived porous carbon (BC) for robust high-performance HSC cathode. The in situ growth process under ultrasonication realizes the rational arrangement of NiCo-LDHs nanosheets on the surface of BC, which effectively increases the specific surface area, promotes the electronic conductivity and enhances the wettability of NiCo-LDHs nanosheets without affecting their thickness values. With the beneficial effects of ultrathin thickness of LDHs nanosheets (6.20 nm), large specific surface area (2324.1 m2 g-1), low charge transfer resistance (1.65 ohm), and high wettability with electrolyte (34-35 degree), the obtained Ni2Co1-LDHs/BC50 electrode possesses an ultra-high specific capacitance of 2390 F g-1 (956 C g-1) at 1 A g-1, which is superior to most reported values. Furthermore, an assembled Ni2Co1-LDHs/BC50//YP-80F HSC delivers a maximum specific energy of 52.47 Wh kg-1 at 375 W kg-1, and maintains a high capacitance retention of 75.9% even after 4000 cycles. This work provides a facile approach to fabricate LDHs nanosheets based cathode materials for high-performance HSCs.</description>

      <title>Development and Assessment of a Miniaturized Thermocouple for Precise Temperature Measurement in Biological Tissues and Cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a novel thermocouple instrument designed for precise temperature monitoring within biological tissues and cells, addressing a significant gap in biological research. Constructed on a Silicon-On-Insulator (SOI) substrate, the instrument employs doped silicon and chromium/gold junctions, achieving a Seebeck coefficient of up to 447 uV/K, rapid response times, high temperature accuracy, and the necessary durability for tissue measurements. The cleanroom fabrication process yields a device featuring a triangular sensing tip. Using Finite Element Analysis (FEA) with COMSOL Multiphysics, the research delves into the device's thermal time constant within tissue environments. The device's efficacy in biological settings was validated by measuring temperatures inside ex-vivo tissue samples. Our findings, bolstered by FEA COMSOL simulations, confirm the device's robustness and applicability in biological studies. This advancement in thermocouple microneedle technology provides biologists with an instrument for accurately tracking temperature fluctuations in tissues.</description>

      <title>Moir\'e patterns of space-filling curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is shown on the examples of Moore and Gosper curves that two spatially shifted or twisted, pre-asymptotic space-filling curves can produce large-scale superstructures akin to moir\'e patterns. To study physical phenomena emerging from these patterns, a geometrical coupling coefficient based on the Neumann integral is introduced. It is found that moir\'e patterns appear most defined at the peaks of those coefficients. A physical interpretation of these coefficients as a measure for inductive coupling between radiofrequency resonators leads to a design principle for strongly overlapping resonators with vanishing mutual inductance, which might be interesting for applications in MRI. These findings are demonstrated in graphical, numerical, and physical experiments.</description>

      <title>Metasurface-Enabled Multifunctional Single-Frequency Sensors without External Power</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: IoT sensors are crucial for visualizing multidimensional and multimodal information and enabling future IT applications/services such as cyber-physical space, digital twins, autonomous driving, smart cities, and virtual/augmented reality (VR or AR). However, IoT sensors need to be battery-free to realistically manage and maintain the growing number of available sensing devices. Here, we provide a novel sensor design approach that employs metasurfaces to enable multifunctional sensing without requiring an external power source. Importantly, unlike existing metasurface-based sensors, our metasurfaces can sense multiple physical parameters even at a fixed frequency by breaking classic harmonic oscillations in the time domain, making the proposed sensors viable for usage with limited frequency resources. Moreover, we provide a method for predicting physical parameters using the machine learning-based approach of random forest regression. The sensing performance was confirmed by estimating temperature and light intensity, and excellent determination coefficients larger than 0.96 were achieved. Our study affords new opportunities for sensing multiple physical properties without relying on an external power source or needing multiple frequencies, which markedly simplifies and facilitates the design of next-generation wireless communication systems.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal Response of Electrically Biased Graphene-Coated Fiber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here, we theoretically investigate the nonreciprocal response of an electrically biased graphene-coated dielectric fiber. By electrically biasing the graphene coating along the fiber axis, the dynamic conductivity of graphene exhibits a nonsymmetric response with respect to the longitudinal component of guided-mode wave vectors. Consequently, the guided waves propagating in two opposite directions may encounter distinct propagation features. In this work, the electromagnetic properties, such as modal dispersion and some field distributions are presented, and the strength of nonreciprocity is discussed for different parameters of graphene, such as its chemical potential and material loss. Furthermore, the influence of the radius of the fiber on the nonreciprocal response is investigated. We envision that such nonreciprocal optical fibers may find various potential applications in THz, microwave, and optical technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Control over the amplitude, phase, and spatial distribution of visible-spectrum light underlies many technologies, but commercial solutions remain bulky and require high control power. Recent materials and fabrication advances have spurred interest in visible-light integrated photonics. In this review, we discuss three application spaces which rely on control of visible light - quantum control and measurement of neutral atom and trapped-ion atomic systems, augmented-reality displays, and measurement and control of biological systems. We then review the commercial dynamic surfaces and bulk systems which currently provide visible-light modulation before discussing the current state-of-the-art integrated solutions. Throughout the review we focus on speed, control power, size, optical bandwidth, and technological maturity when comparing technologies.</description>

      <title>Extending the spectral operation of silicon power splitters through subwavelength nanotechnology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Power splitters play a crucial role in virtually all photonic circuits, enabling precise control of on-chip signal distribution. However, state-of-the-art solutions typically present trade-offs in terms of loss, bandwidth, and fabrication robustness, especially when targeting multimode operation. Here, we present a novel multimode 3-dB power splitter based on a symmetric Y-junction assisted by subwavelength grating metamaterials. The inclusion of the metamaterial structure circumvents the practical limitations of conventional Y-junction tips and realizes smooth modal transitions. Simulations for a standard 220-nm-thick silicon-on-insulator platform predict minimal excess loss (&lt; 0.2 dB) for the fundamental and the first-order transverse-electric modes over an ultra-broad 700 nm bandwidth (1300-2000 nm). For the fundamental transverse-magnetic mode, losses are less than 0.3 dB in the 1300-1800 nm range. Experimental measurements validate these predictions in the 1430-1630 nm wavelength range, demonstrating losses &lt; 0.4 dB for all three modes, even in the presence of fabrication deviations of up to \pm 10 nm. We believe that this device is suitable for the implementation of advanced photonic systems requiring high-performance distribution of optical signals.</description>

      <title>Tutorial: AI-assisted exploration and active design of polymers with high intrinsic thermal conductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing polymers with high intrinsic thermal conductivity (TC) is critically important for the thermal management of organic electronics and photonics. However, this is a challenging task owing to the diversity of the chemical space and the barriers to advanced synthetic experiments/characterization techniques for polymers. In this Tutorial, the fundamentals and implementation of combining classical molecular dynamics simulation and machine learning (ML) for the development of polymers with high TC are comprehensively introduced. We begin by describing the core components of a universal ML framework, involving polymer datasets, property calculators, feature engineering and informatics algorithms. Then, the process of constructing interpretable regression algorithms for TC prediction is introduced, aiming to extract the underlying relationships between microstructures and TCs for polymers. We also explore the design of sequence-ordered polymers with high TC using lightweight and mainstream active learning algorithms. Lastly, we conclude by addressing the current limitations and suggesting potential avenues for future research on this topic.</description>

      <title>Holography inspired self-controlled reconfigurable intelligent surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Among various promising candidate technologies for the sixth-generation (6G) wireless communications, recent advances in microwave metasurfaces have sparked a new research area of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs). By controllably reprogramming the wireless propagation channel, RISs are envisioned to achieve low-cost wireless capacity boosting, coverage extension, and enhanced energy efficiency. To reprogram the channel, each meta-atom on RIS needs an external control signal, which is usually generated by base station (BS). However, BS-controlled RISs require complicated control cables, which hamper their massive deployments. Here, we eliminate the need for BS control by proposing a self-controlled RIS (SC-RIS), which is inspired by the optical holography principle. Different from the existing BS-controlled RISs, each meta-atom of SC-RIS is integrated with an additional power detector for holographic recording. By applying the classical Fourier-transform processing to the measured hologram, SC-RIS is capable of retrieving the user's channel state information required for beamforming, thus enabling autonomous RIS beamforming without control cables. Owing to this WiFi-like plug-and-play capability without the BS control, SC-RISs are expected to enable easy and massive deployments in the future 6G systems.</description>

      <title>Quantitative study of the pinning effect of the edge dislocation on domain wall motion in Barium Titanate thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dislocation is a very important one-dimensional defect in ferroelectrics. This work introduces an easy and flexible model of implementing the edge dislocation by introducing eigenstrain at the interface, and it could be easily extended to incorporate the surface stress to refine the analysis of ferroelectric thin films. The influence of dislocations on the ferroelectric domain wall motion and hysteresis loop including the remanent polarization and coercive field using phase-field simulations is analyzed. The pinning effect of the dislocation on the domain wall motion is discussed and whether the domain wall is pined is the competition between the external loading and the magnitude of the burgers vector of the dislocation. This work could contribute to the understanding of the pining effect of the dislocation and provide guidance for the fabrication of ferroelectric thin films.</description>

      <title>Broadband and fabrication-tolerant 3-dB couplers with topological valley edge modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 3-dB couplers, which are commonly used in photonic integrated circuits for on-chip information processing, precision measurement, and quantum computing, face challenges in achieving robust performance due to their limited 3-dB bandwidths and sensitivity to fabrication errors. To address this, we introduce topological physics to nanophotonics, developing a framework for topological 3-dB couplers. These couplers exhibit broad working wavelength range and robustness against fabrication dimensional errors. By leveraging valley-Hall topology and mirror symmetry, the photonic-crystal-slab couplers achieve ideal 3-dB splitting characterized by a wavelength-insensitive scattering matrix. Tolerance analysis confirms the superiority on broad bandwidth of 48 nm and robust splitting against dimensional errors of 20 nm. We further propose a topological interferometer for on-chip distance measurement, which also exhibits robustness against dimensional errors. This extension of topological principles to the fields of interferometers, may open up new possibilities for constructing robust wavelength division multiplexing, temperature-drift-insensitive sensing, and optical coherence tomography applications.</description>

      <title>Electrically tunable, rapid spin-orbit torque induced modulation of colossal magnetoresistance in Mn$_3$Si$_2$Te$_6$ nanoflakes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As a quasi-layered ferrimagnetic material, Mn$_3$Si$_2$Te$_6$ nanoflakes exhibit magnetoresistance behaviour that is fundamentally different from their bulk crystal counterparts. They offer three key properties crucial for spintronics. Firstly, at least 10^6 times faster response comparing to that exhibited by bulk crystals has been observed in current-controlled resistance and magnetoresistance. Secondly, ultra-low current density is required for resistance modulation (~ 5 A/cm$^2$). Thirdly, electrically gate-tunable magnetoresistance has been realized. Theoretical calculations reveal that the unique magnetoresistance behaviour in the Mn$_3$Si$_2$Te$_6$ nanoflakes arises from a magnetic field induced band gap shift across the Fermi level. The rapid current induced resistance variation is attributed to spin-orbit torque, an intrinsically ultra-fast process (~nanoseconds). This study suggests promising avenues for spintronic applications. In addition, it highlights Mn$_3$Si$_2$Te$_6$ nanoflakes as a suitable platform for investigating the intriguing physics underlying chiral orbital moments, magnetic field induced band variation and spin torque.</description>

      <title>Selective laser etching of displays: Closing the gap between optical simulations and fabrication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulations and measurements on selective laser etching of display glasses are reported. By means of a holographic 3D beam splitter, ultrashort laser pulses are focused inside the volume of a glass sample creating type III modifications along a specific trajectory like pearls on a string. Superimposed by a feed of the glass sample a full 3D area of modifications is achieved building the cornerstone for subsequent etch processes. Based on KOH the modifications are selectively etched at a much higher rate compared to unmodified regions resulting in a separation of the glass along the trajectory of modifications. For gaining further insight into the etch process, we perform simulations on this wet chemical process and compare it to our experimental results.</description>

      <title>Role of Fragility of the Glass Formers in the Yielding Transition under Oscillatory Shear</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the effect of the fragility of glass formers on the yielding transition under oscillatory shear via extensive computer simulations. Employing sphere assemblies interacting with a harmonic potential as our model glass former, we tune fragility by changing the system's density - higher density corresponds to large fragility. Our study reveals significant differences in the yielding transition between strong and fragile glass formers. While both glass formers exhibit similar behaviour under poorly annealed initial conditions, the yielding transition shifts to larger values with increased annealing for fragile glasses while remaining relatively constant for strong glasses. We rationalize our results by introducing a new elastoplastic model, which qualitatively reproduces the simulation results and offers valuable insight into the physics of yielding transition under oscillatory shear deformation.</description>

      <title>Radiation Produced with Slow-Wave Fundamental Mode and Generalized Fundamental mode in Periodic Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.02526v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study suggests an idea that radiation in a periodic leaky-wave antenna (PLWA) should be considered to be produced with the fundamental mode, regardless of whether it is fast-wave or slow-wave. The idea is different from the conventional PLWA theory, which considers it a fact that a PLWA produces radiation with its fast-wave space harmonic when the fundamental mode is slow-wave. To elaborate the idea, it is proved that there is not an eigen-equation like Pythagorean theorem for the fundamental mode in PLWAs. Then a non-uniform structure antenna is designed to show that slow-wave modes can produce leaky-wave radiation. Again it is proved that the difference of the phase constants between a slow-wave fundamental mode and its fast-wave space harmonics has not any effect on the radiation pattern of a PLWA. Moreover, it is clarified that the fundamental mode has a more definite physical significance than space harmonics. Finally, a concept of generalized fundamental modes is proposed without using Fourier expansion. The generalized fundamental modes have the same phase and attenuation constants as any space harmonics, and have physical significance as the conventional fundamental mode. Therefore, it could replace the roles that the space harmonics used to play.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12696v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Presented here is the optimization of a planar two-terminal perovskite/silicon tandem solar cell with a texture structure. The developed simulation model is fitted to published experimental results, and the importance of current matching in the two-terminal structure is discussed. With the texture structure optimized and considering current matching, the optimal texture structure improves $J_{sc}$ from 17.9~mA/cm$^2$ to 20.87~mA/cm$^2$ compared to the planar structure, as well as improving the power conversion efficiency from 25.8% to 35.9%. Furthermore, if the quality of the perovskite thin film and tunneling junction efficiency with a smaller voltage penalty can be improved, then the efficiency can be further improved to 38.13%. This indicates that this tandem solar cell still has much room for improvement.</description>

      <title>Radiometric propulsion: Advancing with the order-of-magnitude enhancement through graphene aerogel-coated vanes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15592v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Radiometer is a light-induced aerodynamic propulsive device under the rarefied gas environment, which holds great potential for the next-gen near-space flight. However, its practical applications are hindered by the weak propulsion forces on the conventional radiometer vanes. Herein, this material-aerodynamics cross-disciplinary study develops novel radiometer vanes with graphene aerogel coatings, which for the first time realize an order of magnitude enhancement in radiometric propulsion. The improvement is manifested as up to 29.7 times faster rotation speed at a low pressure of 0.2 Pa, 13.8 times faster at the pressure (1.5 Pa) with maximum speeds, and 4 orders of magnitude broader operating pressure range (10E-4 - 10E2 Pa). Direct Simulation Monte Carlo calculations reveal that the outstanding performance is ascribed to the improved temperature gradient and gas-solid momentum transfer efficiency tailored by surface porous microstructures. Moreover, we demonstrate a stable and long-term levitation prototype under both 1 sun irradiation and a rarefied gas environment.</description>

      <title>Spatially Resolved Conductivity of Rectangular Interconnects considering Surface Scattering -- Part I: Physical Modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14366v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate modeling of interconnect conductivity is important for performance evaluation of chips in advanced technologies. Surface scattering in interconnects is usually treated by using Fuchs-Sondheimer (FS) approach. While the FS model offer explicit inclusion of the physical parameters, it lacks spatial dependence of conductivity across the interconnect cross-section. To capture the space-dependency of conductivity, an empirical modeling approach based on "cosh" function has been proposed, but it lacks physical insights. In this work, we present a 2D spatially resolved FS (SRFS) model for rectangular interconnects derived from the Boltzmann transport equations. The proposed SRFS model for surface scattering offers both spatial dependence and explicit relation of conductivity to physical parameters such as mean free path and specularity of electrons and interconnect geometry. We highlight the importance of physics-based spatially resolved conductivity model by showing the differences in the spatial profiles between the proposed physical approach and the previous empirical approach. In Part II of this work, we build upon the SRFS approach to propose a compact model for spatially-resolved conductivity accounting for surface scattering in rectangular interconnects.</description>

      <title>Hot electrons and dark excitons modulate strong-coupling conditions in metal-organic optical microcavities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14835v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Polaritons are promising for important applications including organic solar cells, optical logic gates, and qubits. In low-Q microcavities, polaritonic signatures of strongly hybridized photons and Frenkel excitons were previously found to decay together with dark excitons. There remain unresolved questions regarding whether dark excitons affect the strength of exciton-photon coupling. Additionally, the contributions of dark excitons in organic layers and hot electrons in metal films to the polaritonic response are not fully understood. Here, we identified that due to delocalization of polaritons over organic and metal layers, they are sensitive to both dark excitons and hot electrons. Dark excitons modulate exciton-photon coupling strength, whereas hot-electrons imprint two-temperature dynamics onto the polaritonic response. Both organic and metal films contribute to transient Fano-like gain-loss spectra of exciton-polaritons. These and other mechanistic insights into the strong-coupling dynamics were supported by the theory of non-Hermitian Hamiltonian mechanics, axially-resolved optical simulations, global analysis of pump-probe spectra, and statistical correlation analysis. The developed methodology can be applied to other microcavity structures. Our findings are important for disentangling pure polaritonic effects from other excitations in organic and metal layers, with the ultimate aim of achieving photonic control over photophysical and photochemical processes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.03193v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Complex oxides offer a wide range of functional properties, and recent advances in fabrication of freestanding membranes of these oxides are adding new mechanical degrees of freedom to this already rich functional ecosystem. Here, we demonstrate photoactuation in freestanding thin film resonators of ferroelectric Barium Titanate (BaTiO3) and paraelectric Strontium Titanate (SrTiO3). The free-standing films, transferred onto perforated supports, act as nano-drums, oscillating at their natural resonance frequency when illuminated by a frequency-modulated laser. The light-induced deflections in the ferroelectric BaTiO3 membranes are two orders of magnitude larger than in the paraelectric SrTiO3 ones. Time-resolved X-ray micro-diffraction under illumination and temperature-dependent and holographic interferometry provide combined evidence for the photostrictive strain in BaTiO3 originating from partial screening of ferroelectric polarization by photo-excited carriers, which decreases the tetragonality of the unit cell. These findings showcase the potential of photostrictive freestanding ferroelectric films as wireless actuators operated by light.</description>

      <title>Proton-CAT: a Novel Proposal for Enhanced Proton Therapy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02760v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an innovative nitrogen targeting Proton-Carbon-Alpha Therapy method, abbreviated as Proton-CAT, which partially converts protons into carbon-12 and alpha particles through nuclear reactions between protons and nitrogen-15. The effectiveness of Proton-CAT is validated using Monte Carlo simulations, and the study focuses on the relative energy deposition distribution. The findings indicate that the presence of nitrogen enhances the maximum dose level of protons, resulting in more effective damage confined to tumor cells. Statistical analysis of secondary ions shows that the Proton-CAT significantly increases the efficiency of carbon-12 and alpha particle production. Furthermore, our results reveal that elevating the nitrogen concentration significantly boosts the dose of carbon and alpha particles within the tumor region. These outcomes offer a novel pathway for proton radiation therapy and hold promise for contributing to the future development of proton therapy.</description>

      <title>A proposed PKU-Muon experiment for muon tomography and dark matter search</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13483v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose here a set of new methods to directly detect light mass dark matter through its scattering with abundant atmospheric muons or accelerator beams. Firstly, we plan to use the free cosmic-ray muons interacting with dark matter in a volume surrounded by tracking detectors, to trace possible interaction between dark matter and muons. Secondly, we will interface our device with domestic or international muon beams. Due to much larger muon intensity and focused beam, we anticipate the detector can be made further compact and the resulting sensitivity on dark matter searches will be improved. Furthermore, we will measure precisely directional distributions of cosmic-ray muons, either at mountain or sea level, and the differences may reveal possible information of dark matter distributed near the earth. Specifically, our methods can have advantages over `exotic' dark matters which are either muon-philic or slowed down due to some mechanism, and sensitivity on dark matter and muon scattering cross section can reach as low as microbarn level.</description>
