      <title>Aviation sector decarbonization within the hydrogen economy A UAE case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The UAE aviation sector is vital for its economy and is forecast to grow substantially in the coming decades, increasing thereby fuel consumption. At the same time, the country is committed to cutting greenhouse gas emissions to mitigate climate change. Liquid green hydrogen is expected to emerge as an important aviation fuel in the future. The UAE can use its vast solar energy resources to produce cost-competitive hydrogen at scale, securing so its aviation fuel supply. This development, however, needs several decades to materialize. The PV farms needed to produce the electricity for water electrolysis need yet to be constructed. The infrastructure to produce, liquify, store and transport hydrogen is yet to unfold. Hydrogen-powered aircrafts need to yet evolve from the current small scale demonstration projects to long-haul commercial airplanes. It is realistically by 2050 when hydrogen gains momentum and by 2070 when it becomes the primary aviation fuel. This paper details why and how liquid green hydrogen will find its gap as aviation fuel in the UAE and provides the strategy and policy recommendations to facilitate this development.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Advanced Nuclear Fission Technologies for Future Decarbonized Power Grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the coming decades, the United States aims to undergo an energy transition away from fossil fuels and toward a fully decarbonized power grid. There are many pathways that the US could pursue toward this objective, each of which relies on different types of generating technologies to provide clean and reliable electricity. One potential contributor to these pathways is advanced nuclear fission, which encompasses various innovative nuclear reactor designs. However, little is known about how cost-competitive these reactors would be compared to other technologies, or about which aspects of their designs offer the most value to a decarbonized power grid. We employ an electricity system optimization model and a case study of a decarbonized U.S. Eastern Interconnection circa 2050 to generate initial indicators of future economic value for advanced reactors and the sensitivity of future value to various design parameters, the availability of competing technologies, and the underlying policy environment. These results can inform long-term cost targets and guide near-term innovation priorities, investments, and reactor design decisions. We find that advanced reactors should cost \$5.1-\$6.6/W to gain an initial market share (assuming 30 year asset life and 3.5-6.5% real WACC), while those that include thermal storage in their designs can cost up to \$5.5-\$7.0/W (not including cost of storage). Since the marginal value of advanced fission reactors declines as market penetration increases, break-even costs fall around 19% at 100 GW of cumulative capacity and around 40% at 300 GW. Additionally, policies that provide investment tax credits for nuclear energy create the most favorable environment for advanced nuclear fission. Stakeholders and investors should consider these findings when deciding which technologies to consider for decarbonizing the US power grid.</description>

      <title>Exact Cluster Dynamics of Indirect Reciprocity in Complete Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heider's balance theory emphasizes cognitive consistency in assessing others, as is expressed by ``The enemy of my enemy is my friend.'' At the same time, the theory of indirect reciprocity provides us with a dynamical framework to study how to assess others based on their actions as well as how to act toward them based on the assessments. Well-known are the `leading eight' from L1 to L8, the eight norms for assessment and action to foster cooperation in social dilemmas while resisting the invasion of mutant norms prescribing alternative actions. In this work, we begin by showing that balance is equivalent to stationarity of dynamics only for L4 and L6 (Stern Judging) among the leading eight. Stern Judging reflects an intuitive idea that good merits reward whereas evil warrants punishment. By analyzing the dynamics of Stern Judging in complete graphs, we prove that this norm almost always segregates the graph into two mutually hostile groups as the graph size grows. We then compare L4 with Stern Judging: The only difference of L4 is that a good player's cooperative action toward a bad one is regarded as good. This subtle difference transforms large populations governed by L4 to a ``paradise'' where cooperation prevails and positive assessments abound. Our study thus helps us understand the relationship between individual norms and their emergent consequences at a population level, shedding light on the nuanced interplay between cognitive consistency and segregation dynamics.</description>

      <title>Assessing frustration in real-world signed networks: traditional or relaxed balance?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: According to traditional balance theory, individual social actors avoid establishing triads with an odd number of negative links. Generalising, mesoscopic balance is realised when the nodes of a signed graph can be grouped into positively connected subsets, mutually connected by negative links. If this prescription is interpreted rigidly without allowing for statistical noise, it quickly dismisses most real graphs as frustrated. As an alternative, a relaxed, yet qualitative, definition of balance has been advanced. After rephrasing both variants in statistically testable terms, we propose an inference scheme to unambiguously assess if a signed graph is traditionally or relaxedly balanced.</description>

      <title>Mining higher-order triadic interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex systems often present higher-order interactions which require us to go beyond their description in terms of pairwise networks. Triadic interactions are a fundamental type of higher-order interaction that occurs when one node regulates the interaction between two other nodes. Triadic interactions are a fundamental type of higher-order networks, found in a large variety of biological systems, from neuron-glia interactions to gene-regulation and ecosystems. However, triadic interactions have been so far mostly neglected. In this article, we propose a theoretical principle to model and mine triadic interactions from node metadata, and we apply this framework to gene expression data finding new candidates for triadic interactions relevant for Acute Myeloid Leukemia. Our work reveals important aspects of higher-order triadic interactions often ignored, which can transform our understanding of complex systems and be applied to a large variety of systems ranging from biology to the climate.</description>

      <title>Information Cocoons on Social Media: Why and How Should the Government Regulate Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Information cocoons are frequently cited in the literature on whether and how social media might lead to ideological segregation and political polarization. From the behavioural and communication perspectives, this paper first examines why algorithm-based social media, as opposed to its traditional counterpart, is more likely to produce information cocoons. We then explore populism and short-termism in voting, bias and noise in decision-making, and prerequisite capital for innovation, demonstrating the importance of information diversity for a sustainable information environment. Finally, this study argues for libertarian paternalism by evaluating the criteria and trade-offs involved in regulating algorithms and proposes to employ nudges to address the core issues while preserving freedom of choice.</description>

      <title>An adaptation of InfoMap to absorbing random walks using absorption-scaled graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.10953v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: InfoMap is a popular approach to detect densely connected "communities" of nodes in networks. To detect such communities, InfoMap uses random walks and ideas from information theory. Motivated by the dynamics of disease spread on networks, whose nodes can have heterogeneous disease-removal rates, we adapt InfoMap to absorbing random walks. To do this, we use absorption-scaled graphs (in which edge weights are scaled according to absorption rates) and Markov time sweeping. One of our adaptations of InfoMap converges to the standard version of InfoMap in the limit in which the node-absorption rates approach $0$. We demonstrate that the community structure that one obtains using our adaptations of InfoMap can differ markedly from the community structure that one detects using methods that do not account for node-absorption rates. We also illustrate that the community structure that is induced by heterogeneous absorption rates can have important implications for susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) dynamics on ring-lattice networks. For example, in some situations, the outbreak duration is maximized when a moderate number of nodes have large node-absorption rates.</description>

      <title>A Non-Expert's Introduction to Data Ethics for Mathematicians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.07794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.07794v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I give a short introduction to data ethics. I begin with some background information and societal context for data ethics. I then discuss data ethics in mathematical-science education and indicate some available course material. I briefly highlight a few efforts -- at my home institution and elsewhere -- on data ethics, society, and social good. I then discuss open data in research, research replicability and some other ethical issues in research, and the tension between privacy and open data and code, and a few controversial studies and reactions to studies. I then discuss ethical principles, institutional review boards, and a few other considerations in the scientific use of human data. I then briefly survey a variety of research and lay articles that are relevant to data ethics and data privacy. I conclude with a brief summary and some closing remarks.
  My focal audience is mathematicians, but I hope that this chapter will also be useful to others. I am not an expert about data ethics, and this chapter provides only a starting point on this wide-ranging topic. I encourage you to examine the resources that I discuss and to reflect carefully on data ethics, its role in mathematics education, and the societal implications of data and data analysis. As data and technology continue to evolve, I hope that such careful reflection will continue throughout your life.</description>

      <title>Firm-level supply chains to minimize unemployment and economic losses in rapid decarbonization scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.08987v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Urgently needed carbon emissions reductions might lead to strict command-and-control decarbonization strategies with potentially negative economic consequences. Analysing the entire firm-level production network of a European economy, we have explored how the worst outcomes of such approaches can be avoided. We compared the systemic relevance of every firm in Hungary with its annual CO2 emissions to identify optimal emission-reducing strategies with a minimum of additional unemployment and economic losses. Setting specific reduction targets, we studied various decarbonization scenarios and quantified their economic consequences. We determined that for an emissions reduction of 20%, the most effective strategy leads to losses of about 2% of jobs and 2% of economic output. In contrast, a naive scenario targeting the largest emitters first results in 28% job losses and 33% output reduction for the same target. This demonstrates that it is possible to use firm-level production networks to design highly effective decarbonization strategies that practically preserve employment and economic output.</description>

      <title>Analyzing User Ideologies and Shared News During the 2019 Argentinian Elections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08701v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The extensive data generated on social media platforms allow us to gain insights over trending topics and public opinions. Additionally, it offers a window into user behavior, including their content engagement and news sharing habits. In this study, we analyze the relationship between users' political ideologies and the news they share during Argentina's 2019 election period. Our findings reveal that users predominantly share news that aligns with their political beliefs, despite accessing media outlets with diverse political leanings. Moreover, we observe a consistent pattern of users sharing articles related to topics biased to their preferred candidates, highlighting a deeper level of political alignment in online discussions. We believe that this systematic analysis framework can be applied to similar scenarios in different countries, especially those marked by significant political polarization, akin to Argentina.</description>
