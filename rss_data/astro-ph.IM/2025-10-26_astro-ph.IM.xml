      <title>pyROX: Rapid Opacity X-sections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, significant advances have been made in exoplanet and brown dwarf observations. By using state-of-the-art models, astronomers can determine properties of their atmospheres, such as temperatures, the presence of clouds, or the chemical abundances of molecules and atoms. Accurate and up-to-date opacities are crucial to avoid inconclusive or biased results, but it can be challenging to compute opacity cross-sections from the line lists provided by various online databases.
  We introduce pyROX, an easy-to-use Python package to calculate molecular and atomic cross-sections. Since pyROX works on CPUs, it can compute a small line list on a regular workstation, but it is also easily parallelised on a cluster for larger line lists. In addition to line opacities, pyROX also supports calculations of collision-induced absorption. Tutorials are provided in the online documentation which explain the configuration parameters and different functionalities of pyROX.</description>

      <title>EBOP MAVEN: A machine learning model to estimate the input parameters for analytic fitting of detached eclipsing binary light curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detached eclipsing binary stars (dEBs) are a key source of data on fundamental stellar parameters. Within the light curve databases of survey missions such as Kepler and TESS are a wealth of new systems awaiting characterisation. We aim to improve the scalability of efforts to process these data by developing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) machine learning model to assist in the automation of their analysis. From a phase-folded and binned dEB light curve the model predicts system parameters relating to stellar fractional radii, orbital inclination and eccentricity, and the stellar brightness ratio, for use as input values in subsequent formal analysis with the established JKTEBOP analytic code. We find the model able to predict these parameters for a previously unseen test dataset of 20000 synthetic dEB systems with a mean error of 14.1% when compared with the label values, improving to 8.6% against a subset representative of real systems. When tested with the TESS light curves of a set of real well-characterised systems, the model's predictions yield a mean error of $8.7\pm0.7\%$ when compared with label values derived from existing published analyses. Subsequent fitting of the TESS light curves with the JKTEBOP analytic code while using the model predictions as input values finds 27 of the 28 systems achieving a good fit. On the strength of these results, we plan to build a new characterisation pipeline based on the machine learning model and JKTEBOP code with the intention of producing a target catalogue of dEB systems for potential observation with the forthcoming PLATO mission.</description>

      <title>LEO Satellite Track Correction for CSST Multi-Band Imaging Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low Earth Orbit satellite (LEOsat) mega-constellations are considered to be an unavoidable source of contamination for survey observations to be carried out by the China Space Station Telescope (CSST) over the next decade. This study reconstructs satellite trail profiles based on simulated parameters, including brightness levels and orbital altitudes, in combination with multi-band simulated images. Compared to our previous work, the simulated images in this study more accurately replicate the realistic observational conditions of CSST and extend beyond single-band analysis. Variations in LEOsat trail brightness, source brightness, background noise, and source density across different bands result in differing levels of accuracy in trail reconstruction and subsequently affect the reliability of photometric measurements. The reconstructed trail profiles are subsequently applied to correct the contaminated regions. Simulation results reveal varying levels of contamination effects across different bands following LEOsat trail correction, including both reconstruction and subtraction. To evaluate the effectiveness of the correction, we quantified the fraction of affected sources using two metrics: (1) magnitude errors greater than 0.01 mag attributable to LEOsats, and (2) LEOsat-induced noise exceeding 10% of other noise contributions. Following trail repair, the analysis reveals a reduction of over 50% in the fraction of affected sources in the NUV band for both 550 km and 1200 km altitudes, assuming a maximum brightness of 7 in the V band. In the i band, the reduction exceeds 30%. The degree of improvement varies across spectral bands, and depends on both satellite altitude and the adopted brightness model.</description>

      <title>Ab uno disce omnes: Single-harmonic search for extreme mass-ratio inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) are one of the key sources of gravitational waves for space-based detectors such as LISA. However, their detection remains a major data analysis challenge due to the signals' complexity and length. We present a semi-coherent, time-frequency search strategy for detecting EMRI harmonics without relying on full waveform templates. We perform an injection and search campaign of single mildly-eccentric equatorial EMRIs in stationary Gaussian noise. The detection statistic is constructed solely from the EMRI frequency evolution, which is modeled phenomenologically using a Singular Value Decomposition basis. The pipeline and the detection statistic are implemented in time-frequency, enabling efficient searches over one year of data in approximately one hour on a single GPU. The search pipeline achieves 94% detection probability at $\mathrm{SNR} = 30$ for a false-alarm probability of $10^{-2}$, recovering the frequency evolution of the dominant harmonic to 1% relative error. By mapping the EMRI parameters consistent with the recovered frequency evolution, we show that the semi-coherent detection statistic enables a sub-percent precision estimation of the EMRI intrinsic parameters. These results establish a computationally efficient framework for constructing EMRI proposals for the LISA global fit.</description>

      <title>Auger@TA: In-situ Cross-Calibration of the World's Largest Cosmic Ray Observatories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Pierre Auger Observatory (Auger) and the Telescope Array (TA) are the world's two largest ultra-high-energy cosmic ray (UHECR) observatories. They operate in the Southern and Northern hemispheres, respectively, at similar latitudes but with distinct surface detector (SD) designs. A significant challenge in studying UHECR physics across the full sky is the apparent discrepancy in flux measurements between the two experiments. This discrepancy could arise from astrophysical differences and/or systematic effects related to their detector designs and sensitivities to extensive air shower components. To address this, the Auger@TA working group aims to cross-calibrate the two observatories with a self-triggering micro-Auger array within the TA array. This micro-array consists of eight Auger Surface Detector (SD) stations equipped with Water Cherenkov Detectors (WCDs) and AugerPrime Surface Scintillator Detectors. Seven SD stations, configured with a centered-1-PMT design, are arranged in a hexagonal pattern with one station in the center, with 1.5 km spacing, mirroring the Auger layout. The eighth station, which features a standard 3-PMT Auger station, is located in conjunction with a TA detector at the center of the hexagon, forming a triplet for high-statistics and low-uncertainty cross-calibration. A custom communication system that uses readily available components enables seamless communication between stations and remote access to each station through a central computer. The micro-array is now fully deployed, and initial data-taking is about to start. This presentation will detail the instrumentation, communication systems, central data acquisition system, expected performance of the micro-array, and preliminary results as appropriate.</description>

      <title>Optimizing searches for gravitational wave bursts 2 using coherent WaveBurst 2G</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The most general searches for gravitational wave transients (GWTs) rely on data analysis methods that do not assume prior knowledge of the signal waveform, direction, or arrival time on Earth. These searches provide data-driven signal reconstructions that are crucial both for testing available emission models and for discovering yet-to-be-uncovered sources. Here, we discuss progress in the detection performance of the coherent WaveBurst second-generation pipeline (cWB-2G), which is highly adaptable to both minimally modeled and model-informed searches for GWTs. Several search configurations for GWTs are examined using approximately 14.8 days of observation time from the third observing run by LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK). Recent enhancements include a ranking statistic fully based on multivariate classification with eXtreme Gradient Boosting, a thorough validation of the statistical significance accuracy of GWT candidates, and a measurement of the correlations of false alarms and simulated detections between different concurrent searches. For the first time, we provide a comprehensive comparison of cWB-2G performance on data from networks made of two and three detectors, and we demonstrate the advantage of combining concurrent searches for GWTs of generic morphology in a global observatory. This work offers essential insights for assessing our data analysis strategies in ongoing and future LVK searches for generic GWTs.</description>

      <title>TES Proton Irradiation Result Analysis for Future Space Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As observed on the signal of the Planck-HFI highly sensitive bolometers, the effect of cosmic rays on detectors is a major concern for future similar space missions. Their instruments will have a larger detection surface, increased sensitivity, and more stringent requirements on the suppression of systematic effects. To study the impact of cosmic rays on detector prototypes in operational conditions, IAS has designed a state-of-the-art cryogenic system to irradiate particles by coupling this facility to particle accelerators. An irradiation campaign has been carried out on LiteBIRD-HFT TES prototypes to study their response to particle hits. In this article, we present the results and the analysis of this first test campaign.</description>

      <title>Comparing the data reduction pipelines of FRIPON, DFN, WMPL, and AMOS: Geminids Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Methods. We processed a dataset of 584 Geminid fireballs observed by FRIPON between 2016 and 2023. The single-station astrometric data is converted into the Global Fireball Exchange (GFE) standard format for uniform processing. We assess variations in trajectory, velocity, radiant, and orbital element calculations across the pipelines and compare them to previously published Geminid measurements.
  Results. The radiant and velocity solutions provided by the four data reduction pipelines are all within the range of previously published values. However, there are some nuances. Particularly, the radiants estimated by WMPL, DFN, and AMOS are nearly identical. Whereas FRIPON reports a systematic shift in right ascension (-0.3 degrees), caused by improper handling of the precession. Additionally, the FRIPON data reduction pipeline also tends to overestimate the initial velocity (+0.3 km s-1) due to the deceleration model used as the velocity solver. The FRIPON velocity method relies on having a well-constrained deceleration profile; however, for the Geminids, many are low-deceleration events, leading to an overestimation of the initial velocity. On the other end of the spectrum, the DFN tends to predict lower velocities, particularly for poorly observed events. However, this velocity shift vanishes for the DFN when we only consider Geminids with at least three observations or more. The primary difference identified in the analysis concerns the velocity uncertainties. Despite all four pipelines achieving similar residuals between their trajectories and observations, their velocity uncertainties vary systematically, with WMPL outputting the smallest values, followed by AMOS, FRIPON, and DFN.</description>

      <title>Stellar intensity interferometry in the photon-counting regime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22446v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stellar intensity interferometry consists in measuring the correlation of the light intensity fluctuations at two telescopes observing the same star. The amplitude of the correlation is directly related to the luminosity distribution of the star, which would be unresolved by a single telescope. This technique is based on the well-known Hanbury Brown and Twiss effect. After its discovery in the 1950s, it was used in astronomy until the 1970s, and then replaced by direct (``amplitude'') interferometry, which is much more sensitive, but also much more demanding. However, in recent years, intensity interferometry has undergone a revival. In this article, we present a summary of the state-of-the-art, and we discuss in detail the signal-to-noise ratio of intensity interferometry in the framework of photon-counting detection.</description>

      <title>SolarZip: An Efficient and Adaptive Compression Framework for Solar EUV Imaging Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13504v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context: With the advancement of solar physics research, next-generation solar space missions and ground-based telescopes face significant challenges in efficiently transmitting and/or storing large-scale observational data. Aims: We develop an efficient compression and evaluation framework for solar EUV data, specifically optimized for Solar Orbiter Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI) data, significantly reducing data volume while preserving scientific usability. Methods: We systematically evaluated four error-bounded lossy compressors across two EUI datasets. However, the existing methods cannot perfectly handle the EUI datasets (with continuously changing distance and significant resolution differences). Motivated by this, we develop an adaptive hybrid compression strategy with optimized interpolation predictors. Moreover, we designed a two-stage evaluation framework integrating distortion analysis with downstream scientific workflows, ensuring that observational analysis is not affected at high compression ratios. Results: Our framework SolarZip achieved up to 800x reduction for Full Sun Imager (FSI) data and 500x for High Resolution Imager (HRI$_{\text{EUV}}$) data. It significantly outperformed both traditional and advanced algorithms, achieving 3-50x higher compression ratios than traditional algorithms, surpassing the second-best algorithm by up to 30%. Simulation experiments verified that SolarZip can reduce data transmission time by up to 270x while ensuring the preservation of scientific usability. Conclusions: The SolarZip framework significantly enhances solar observational data compression efficiency while preserving scientific usability by dynamically selecting optimal compression methods based on observational scenarios and user requirements. This provides a promising data management solution for deep space missions like Solar Orbiter.</description>

      <title>Application of Non-Linear Noise Regression in the Virgo Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06220v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work presents the first demonstration of non-linear noise regression in the Virgo detector using deep learning techniques. We use DeepClean, a convolutional autoencoder previously shown to be effective in denoising LIGO data, as our tool for modeling and subtracting environmental and technical noise in Virgo. The method uses auxiliary witness channels to learn correlated noise features and remove them from the strain data. For this study, we apply DeepClean to Virgo O3b data, using 225 witness channels selected across 13 targeted frequency bands. Our analysis confirms the presence of non-linear couplings in the subtracted noise, highlighting the importance of DeepClean-like tools in capturing such effects. We observe up to a 1.3 Mpc improvement in the binary neutron star inspiral range (~2.5% gain), and an average increase of 1.7% in the recovered signal-to-noise ratio for injected binary black hole signals. Parameter estimation studies further confirm that DeepClean does not introduce bias in the recovery of source parameters. These results demonstrate the robustness of DeepClean on Virgo data and support its adoption in real-time noise subtraction frameworks for future observing runs.</description>

      <title>Spiking Neural Networks for Radio Frequency Interference Detection in Radio Astronomy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06124v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) promise efficient and dynamic spatio-temporal data processing. This paper reformulates a significant challenge in radio astronomy, Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) detection, as a time-series segmentation task suited for SNN execution. Automated systems capable of real-time operation with minimal energy consumption are increasingly important in modern radio telescopes. We explore several spectrogram encoding methods and network parameters, applying first and second-order leaky integrate and fire SNNs to tackle RFI detection. We introduce a divisive normalisation-inspired pre-processing step, improving detection performance across multiple encodings strategies. Our approach achieves competitive performance on a synthetic dataset and compelling initial results on real data from the Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR). We position SNNs as a viable path towards real-time RFI detection, with many possibilities for follow-up studies. These findings highlight the potential for SNNs performing complex time-series tasks, paving the way towards efficient, real-time processing in radio astronomy and other data-intensive fields.</description>

Abstract: The Tibet AS$\gamma$ experiment successfully detected sub-PeV $\gamma$-rays from the Crab nebula using a Surface Array and underground muon detector. Considering this, we are building in Bolivia a new experiment to explore the Southern Hemisphere, looking for the origins of cosmic rays in our Galaxy. The name of this project is Andes Large area PArticle detector for Cosmic ray physics and Astronomy (ALPACA). A prototype array called ALPAQUITA, with $1/4$ the total area of the full ALPACA, started observations in September $2022$. In this paper we introduce the status of ALPAQUITA and the plans to extend the array. We also report the results of the observation of the moon shadow in cosmic rays.</description>

      <title>Multilevel neural simulation-based inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06087v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural simulation-based inference (SBI) is a popular set of methods for Bayesian inference when models are only available in the form of a simulator. These methods are widely used in the sciences and engineering, where writing down a likelihood can be significantly more challenging than constructing a simulator. However, the performance of neural SBI can suffer when simulators are computationally expensive, thereby limiting the number of simulations that can be performed. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to neural SBI which leverages multilevel Monte Carlo techniques for settings where several simulators of varying cost and fidelity are available. We demonstrate through both theoretical analysis and extensive experiments that our method can significantly enhance the accuracy of SBI methods given a fixed computational budget.</description>

      <title>Prospects for High-Frequency Gravitational-Wave Detection with GEO600</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08315v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current ground-based interferometers are optimized for sensitivity from a few tens of Hz to about 1 kHz. While they are not currently utilized for GW detection, interferometric detectors also feature narrow bands of strong sensitivity at higher frequencies where the sideband fields created by a GW are resonantly amplified in the optical system. For certain interferometer configurations, small changes to system parameters allow the narrow band of high sensitivity to be scanned over a much larger range of frequencies, potentially enabling broadband detection at high frequencies. In this paper, we investigate whether simply modifying the detuning angle of the signal-recycling mirror of the GEO600 interferometer can make this experiment sensitive to GWs in the kilohertz frequency range. We compute the strain sensitivity for GEO600 across a frequency range from several kHz to tens of kHz for various detuning angles. We also show that LIGO cannot attain the same effect assuming that the optical components are not changed due to the narrow band response of the Fabry-Perot cavities. We then calculate the sensitivity of GEO600 to various proposed high-frequency GW sources and compare it to the sensitivity of other ground-based detectors.</description>

      <title>The Pierre Auger Observatory: Contributions to the 39th International Cosmic Ray Conference (ICRC 2025)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13771v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Pierre Auger Observatory, located in La Pampa Amarilla, Argentina, has been continuously acquiring data since 2004. It comprises a surface detector array covering 3,000 km$^2$ and 27 fluorescence telescopes, designed to detect extensive air showers initiated by ultra-high-energy cosmic rays. An upgrade to the Observatory was commissioned in 2024, enhancing the existing water-Cherenkov detectors with additional radio antennas, surface scintillator detectors, and a buried scintillator array. This compilation of contributions to the 39th International Cosmic Ray Conference, held in Geneva, Switzerland (July 15-24, 2025), presents recent results from the Pierre Auger Collaboration, addressing a wide range of fundamental questions in astroparticle physics. The included papers cover measurements of the energy spectrum, mass composition, and arrival directions of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays, investigations of hadronic interactions in extensive air showers, and searches for ultra-high-energy photons and neutrinos. Additional topics include radio detection techniques, solar-related phenomena, and atmospheric events such as ELVES and TGFs. The list also contains first results and performance evaluations of the upgraded detectors, AugerPrime, along with reports on outreach and social engagement initiatives conducted by the Collaboration.</description>

      <title>Enabling Early Transient Discovery in LSST via Difference Imaging with DECam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22156v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present SLIDE, a pipeline that enables transient discovery in data from the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), using archival images from the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) as templates for difference imaging. We apply this pipeline to the recently released Data Preview 1 (DP1; the first public release of Rubin commissioning data) and search for transients in the resulting difference images. The image subtraction, photometry extraction, and transient detection are all performed on the Rubin Science Platform. We demonstrate that SLIDE effectively extracts clean photometry by circumventing poor or missing LSST templates. We identified 29 previously unreported transients, 12 of which would not have been detected based on the DP1 DiaObject catalog. SLIDE will be especially useful for transient analysis in the early years of LSST, when template coverage will be largely incomplete or when templates may be contaminated by transients present at the time of acquisition. We present multiband light curves for a sample of known transients, along with new transient candidates identified through our search. Finally, we discuss the prospects of applying this pipeline during the main LSST survey. Our pipeline is broadly applicable and will support studies of all transients with slowly evolving phases.</description>

      <title>Discrete Fourier Transform versus Discrete Chi-Square Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01540v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compare two time series analysis methods, the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and our Discrete Chi-square Method (DCM).
  DCM is designed for detecting many signals superimposed on an unknown trend. The solution for the non-linear DCM model is an ill-posed problem. The backbone of DCM is the Gauss-Markov theorem that the least squares fit is the best unbiased estimator for linear regression models. DCM is a simple numerical time series analysis method that performs a massive number of linear least squares fits. Hence, the data spacing, even or uneven, is irrelevant. We show that our numerical solution for the DCM model fulfils the three conditions of a well-posed problem: existence, uniqueness and stability.The Fisher-test is used to identify the best DCM model from all alternative tested DCM models. The correct DCM model must also pass our Predictivity-test. Our analyses of seven different simulated data samples expose the weaknesses of DFT and the efficiency of DCM. The DCM signal and trend detection depend only on the sample size and the accuracy of data. DCM is an ideal forecasting method because the time span of observations is irrelevant. If the Gauss-Markov theorem is valid, DCM can not fail. We recommend fast sampling of large high quality datasets and the analysis of those datasets using numerical DCM parallel computation Python code.</description>

      <title>Pulsar timing array analysis in a Legendre polynomial basis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05913v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use Legendre polynomials, previously employed in this context by Lee et al. [1], van Haasteren and Levin [2], and Pitrou and Cusin [3], to model signals in pulsar timing arrays (PTA). These replace the (Fourier mode) basis of trigonometric functions normally used for data analysis. The Legendre basis makes it simpler to incorporate pulsar modeling effects, which remove constant-, linear-, and quadratic-in-time terms from pulsar timing residuals. In the Legendre basis, this zeroes the amplitudes of the the first three Legendre polynomials. We use this basis to construct an optimal quadratic cross-correlation estimator $\widehat{\mu}$ of the Hellings and Downs (HD) correlation and compute its variance $\sigma^2_{\widehat{\mu}}$ in the way described by Allen and Romano [4]. Remarkably, if the gravitational-wave background (GWB) and pulsar noise power spectra are (sums of) power laws in frequency, then in this basis one obtains analytic closed forms for many quantities of interest.</description>

      <title>Predictions of the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope Galactic Exoplanet Survey. IV. Lens Mass and Distance Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13974v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As part of the Galactic Bulge Time Domain Survey (GBTDS), the Nancy Grace Roman Galactic Exoplanet Survey (RGES) will use microlensing to discover cold outer planets and free-floating planets unbound to stars. NASA has established several science requirements for the GBTDS to ensure RGES success. A key advantage of RGES is Roman's high angular resolution, which will allow detection of flux from many host stars. One requirement specifies that Roman must measure the masses and distances of 40% of detected planet hosts with 20% precision or better. To test this, we simulated microlensing events toward the GBTDS fields and used Fisher matrix analysis to estimate light curve parameter uncertainties. Combining these with Roman imaging observables (lens flux, relative lens-source proper motion), we estimated the achievable precision of lens mass and distance measurements. Using pyLIMASS, a publicly available code for estimating lens properties, we applied this analysis to 3,000 simulated events. Assuming the Cassan et al. (2012) exoplanet mass function, we find that &gt;40% of host stars meet the required 20% precision threshold, confirming that the GBTDS can satisfy the mission requirement. We validated our approach by comparing our inferred lens masses and distances to empirical measurements from detailed image-constrained light curve modeling of historical microlensing events with Hubble and Keck follow-up imaging. Our results agree within roughly 1 sigma, demonstrating that both approaches yield consistent and reliable mass and distance estimates, and confirming the robustness of our simulations for Roman-era microlensing science.</description>
