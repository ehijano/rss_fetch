      <title>Asymptotic cycles in fractional generalizations of multidimensional maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In regular dynamics, discrete maps are model presentations of discrete dynamical systems, and they may approximate continuous dynamical systems. Maps are used to investigate general properties of dynamical systems and to model various natural and socioeconomic systems. They are also used in engineering. Many natural and almost all socioeconomic systems possess memory which, in many cases, is power-law-like memory. Generalized fractional maps, in which memory is not exactly the power-law memory but the asymptotically power-law-like memory, are used to model and investigate general properties of these systems. In this paper we extend the definition of the notion of generalized fractional maps of arbitrary positive orders that previously was defined only for maps which, in the case of integer orders, converge to area/volume-preserving maps. Fractional generalizations of H'enon and Lozi maps belong to the newly defined class of generalized fractional maps. We derive the equations which define periodic points in generalized fractional maps. We consider applications of our results to the fractional and fractional difference H'enon and Lozi maps.</description>

      <title>A dynamical mechanism rooted in the Lorenz system for giant negative and positive mobility of a memory-driven active particle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On applying a small bias force, non-equilibrium systems may respond in paradoxical ways such as with giant negative mobility (GNM) -- a large net drift opposite to the applied bias, or giant positive mobility (GPM) -- an anomalously large drift in the same direction as the applied bias. We consider an idealized model of a memory-driven active particle inspired from experiments with walking/superwalking droplets that takes the form of the celebrated Lorenz system. By adding a small bias force to this Lorenz model, we uncover a mechanism for simultaneous emergence of GNM and GPM in the parameter space. Within the chaotic sea of the parameter space, a symmetric pair of coexisting asymmetric limit cycles separate and migrate under applied bias force, resulting in anomalous transport behaviors that are sensitive to the particle's memory. This provides a general dynamical mechanism for the emergence of anomalous transport behaviors for self-driven particles described by low-dimensional autonomous chaotic systems.</description>

      <title>Asymmetrical temporal dynamics of edge modes in Su-Schrieffer-Heeger lattice with Kerr nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00538v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical bistability and oscillating phases exist in a Sagnac interferometer and a single ring resonator made of $\chi^{(3)}$ nonlinear medium where the refractive indices are modulated by the light intensity due to the Kerr nonlinearity. An array of coupled nonlinear ring resonators behave similarly but with more complexity due to the presence of the additional couplings. Here, we theoretically demonstrate the bifurcation of edge modes which leads to optical bistability in the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger lattice with the Kerr nonlinearity. Additionally, we demonstrate periodic and chaotic switching behaviors in an oscillating phase resulting from the coupling between the edge mode and bulk modes with different chiralities, i.e., clockwise and counter-clockwise circulations.</description>

      <title>Annealing approach to root-finding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15338v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Newton-Raphson method is a fundamental root-finding technique with numerous applications in physics. In this study, we propose a parameterized variant of the Newton-Raphson method, inspired by principles from physics. Through analytical and empirical validation, we demonstrate that this novel approach offers increased robustness and faster convergence during root-finding iterations. Furthermore, we establish connections to the Adomian series method and provide a natural interpretation within a series framework. Remarkably, the introduced parameter, akin to a temperature variable, enables an annealing approach. This advancement sets the stage for a fresh exploration of numerical iterative root-finding methodologies.</description>
