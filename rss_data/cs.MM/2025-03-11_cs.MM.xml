      <title>Visual and Text Prompt Segmentation: A Novel Multi-Model Framework for Remote Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pixel-level segmentation is essential in remote sensing, where foundational vision models like CLIP and Segment Anything Model(SAM) have demonstrated significant capabilities in zero-shot segmentation tasks. Despite their advances, challenges specific to remote sensing remain substantial. Firstly, The SAM without clear prompt constraints, often generates redundant masks, and making post-processing more complex. Secondly, the CLIP model, mainly designed for global feature alignment in foundational models, often overlooks local objects crucial to remote sensing. This oversight leads to inaccurate recognition or misplaced focus in multi-target remote sensing imagery. Thirdly, both models have not been pre-trained on multi-scale aerial views, increasing the likelihood of detection failures. To tackle these challenges, we introduce the innovative VTPSeg pipeline, utilizing the strengths of Grounding DINO, CLIP, and SAM for enhanced open-vocabulary image segmentation. The Grounding DINO+(GD+) module generates initial candidate bounding boxes, while the CLIP Filter++(CLIP++) module uses a combination of visual and textual prompts to refine and filter out irrelevant object bounding boxes, ensuring that only pertinent objects are considered. Subsequently, these refined bounding boxes serve as specific prompts for the FastSAM model, which executes precise segmentation. Our VTPSeg is validated by experimental and ablation study results on five popular remote sensing image segmentation datasets.</description>

      <title>FastCache: Optimizing Multimodal LLM Serving through Lightweight KV-Cache Compression Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) serving systems commonly employ KV-cache compression to reduce memory footprint. However, existing compression methods introduce significant processing overhead and queuing delays, particularly in concurrent serving scenarios. We present \texttt{FastCache}, a novel serving framework that effectively addresses these challenges through two key innovations: (1) a dynamic batching strategy that optimizes request scheduling across prefill, compression, and decode stages, and (2) an efficient KV-cache memory pool mechanism that eliminates memory fragmentation while maintaining high GPU utilization. Our comprehensive experiments on the GQA and MileBench datasets demonstrate that \texttt{FastCache} achieves up to 19.3$\times$ reduction in Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) and 12.1$\times$ improvement in throughput compared to state-of-the-art baselines. The system maintains stable performance under high-concurrency scenarios (up to 40 req/s) while reducing average memory consumption by 20\%. These results establish \texttt{FastCache} as an efficient solution for real-world LLM serving systems with KV-cache compression.</description>

      <title>COMODO: Cross-Modal Video-to-IMU Distillation for Efficient Egocentric Human Activity Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Egocentric video-based models capture rich semantic information and have demonstrated strong performance in human activity recognition (HAR). However, their high power consumption, privacy concerns, and dependence on lighting conditions limit their feasibility for continuous on-device recognition. In contrast, inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensors offer an energy-efficient and privacy-preserving alternative, yet they suffer from limited large-scale annotated datasets, leading to weaker generalization in downstream tasks. To bridge this gap, we propose COMODO, a cross-modal self-supervised distillation framework that transfers rich semantic knowledge from the video modality to the IMU modality without requiring labeled annotations. COMODO leverages a pretrained and frozen video encoder to construct a dynamic instance queue, aligning the feature distributions of video and IMU embeddings. By distilling knowledge from video representations, our approach enables the IMU encoder to inherit rich semantic information from video while preserving its efficiency for real-world applications. Experiments on multiple egocentric HAR datasets demonstrate that COMODO consistently improves downstream classification performance, achieving results comparable to or exceeding fully supervised fine-tuned models. Moreover, COMODO exhibits strong cross-dataset generalization. Benefiting from its simplicity, our method is also generally applicable to various video and time-series pre-trained models, offering the potential to leverage more powerful teacher and student foundation models in future research. The code is available at https://github.com/Breezelled/COMODO .</description>

      <title>Uni$\textbf{F}^2$ace: Fine-grained Face Understanding and Generation with Unified Multimodal Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unified multimodal models (UMMs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm in foundational computer vision research, demonstrating significant potential in both image understanding and generation. However, existing research in the face domain primarily focuses on $\textbf{coarse}$ facial attribute understanding, with limited capacity to handle $\textbf{fine-grained}$ facial attributes and without addressing generation capabilities. To overcome these limitations, we propose Uni$\textbf{F}^2$ace, the first UMM tailored specifically for fine-grained face understanding and generation. In general, we train Uni$\textbf{F}^2$ace on a self-constructed, specialized dataset utilizing two mutually beneficial diffusion techniques and a two-level mixture-of-experts architecture. Specifically, we first build a large-scale facial dataset, Uni$\textbf{F}^2$ace-130K, which contains 130K image-text pairs with one million question-answering pairs that span a wide range of facial attributes. Second, we establish a theoretical connection between discrete diffusion score matching and masked generative models, optimizing both evidence lower bounds simultaneously, which significantly improves the model's ability to synthesize facial details. Finally, we introduce both token-level and sequence-level mixture-of-experts, enabling efficient fine-grained representation learning for both understanding and generation tasks. Extensive experiments on Uni$\textbf{F}^2$ace-130K demonstrate that Uni$\textbf{F}^2$ace outperforms existing UMMs and generative models, achieving superior performance across both understanding and generation tasks.</description>

      <title>FilmComposer: LLM-Driven Music Production for Silent Film Clips</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we implement music production for silent film clips using LLM-driven method. Given the strong professional demands of film music production, we propose the FilmComposer, simulating the actual workflows of professional musicians. FilmComposer is the first to combine large generative models with a multi-agent approach, leveraging the advantages of both waveform music and symbolic music generation. Additionally, FilmComposer is the first to focus on the three core elements of music production for film-audio quality, musicality, and musical development-and introduces various controls, such as rhythm, semantics, and visuals, to enhance these key aspects. Specifically, FilmComposer consists of the visual processing module, rhythm-controllable MusicGen, and multi-agent assessment, arrangement and mix. In addition, our framework can seamlessly integrate into the actual music production pipeline and allows user intervention in every step, providing strong interactivity and a high degree of creative freedom. Furthermore, we propose MusicPro-7k which includes 7,418 film clips, music, description, rhythm spots and main melody, considering the lack of a professional and high-quality film music dataset. Finally, both the standard metrics and the new specialized metrics we propose demonstrate that the music generated by our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of quality, consistency with video, diversity, musicality, and musical development.

      <title>EgoBlind: Towards Egocentric Visual Assistance for the Blind People</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present EgoBlind, the first egocentric VideoQA dataset collected from blind individuals to evaluate the assistive capabilities of contemporary multimodal large language models (MLLMs). EgoBlind comprises 1,210 videos that record the daily lives of real blind users from a first-person perspective. It also features 4,927 questions directly posed or generated and verified by blind individuals to reflect their needs for visual assistance under various scenarios. We provide each question with an average of 3 reference answers to alleviate subjective evaluation. Using EgoBlind, we comprehensively evaluate 15 leading MLLMs and find that all models struggle, with the best performers achieving accuracy around 56\%, far behind human performance of 87.4\%. To guide future advancements, we identify and summarize major limitations of existing MLLMs in egocentric visual assistance for the blind and provide heuristic suggestions for improvement. With these efforts, we hope EgoBlind can serve as a valuable foundation for developing more effective AI assistants to enhance the independence of the blind individuals' lives.</description>

      <title>AnyMoLe: Any Character Motion In-betweening Leveraging Video Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite recent advancements in learning-based motion in-betweening, a key limitation has been overlooked: the requirement for character-specific datasets. In this work, we introduce AnyMoLe, a novel method that addresses this limitation by leveraging video diffusion models to generate motion in-between frames for arbitrary characters without external data. Our approach employs a two-stage frame generation process to enhance contextual understanding. Furthermore, to bridge the domain gap between real-world and rendered character animations, we introduce ICAdapt, a fine-tuning technique for video diffusion models. Additionally, we propose a ``motion-video mimicking'' optimization technique, enabling seamless motion generation for characters with arbitrary joint structures using 2D and 3D-aware features. AnyMoLe significantly reduces data dependency while generating smooth and realistic transitions, making it applicable to a wide range of motion in-betweening tasks.</description>

      <title>YuE: Scaling Open Foundation Models for Long-Form Music Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We tackle the task of long-form music generation--particularly the challenging \textbf{lyrics-to-song} problem--by introducing YuE, a family of open foundation models based on the LLaMA2 architecture. Specifically, YuE scales to trillions of tokens and generates up to five minutes of music while maintaining lyrical alignment, coherent musical structure, and engaging vocal melodies with appropriate accompaniment. It achieves this through (1) track-decoupled next-token prediction to overcome dense mixture signals, (2) structural progressive conditioning for long-context lyrical alignment, and (3) a multitask, multiphase pre-training recipe to converge and generalize. In addition, we redesign the in-context learning technique for music generation, enabling versatile style transfer (e.g., converting Japanese city pop into an English rap while preserving the original accompaniment) and bidirectional generation. Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate that YuE matches or even surpasses some of the proprietary systems in musicality and vocal agility. In addition, fine-tuning YuE enables additional controls and enhanced support for tail languages. Furthermore, beyond generation, we show that YuE's learned representations can perform well on music understanding tasks, where the results of YuE match or exceed state-of-the-art methods on the MARBLE benchmark.

Abstract: Generating semantically and temporally aligned audio content in accordance with video input has become a focal point for researchers, particularly following the remarkable breakthrough in text-to-video generation. In this work, we aim to offer insights into the video-to-audio generation paradigm, focusing on three crucial aspects: vision encoders, auxiliary embeddings, and data augmentation techniques. Beginning with a foundational model built on a simple yet surprisingly effective intuition, we explore various vision encoders and auxiliary embeddings through ablation studies. Employing a comprehensive evaluation pipeline that emphasizes generation quality and video-audio synchronization alignment, we demonstrate that our model exhibits state-of-the-art video-to-audio generation capabilities. Furthermore, we provide critical insights into the impact of different data augmentation methods on enhancing the generation framework's overall capacity. We showcase possibilities to advance the challenge of generating synchronized audio from semantic and temporal perspectives. We hope these insights will serve as a stepping stone toward developing more realistic and accurate audio-visual generation models.</description>

      <title>Towards Open-Vocabulary Audio-Visual Event Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11278v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Audio-Visual Event Localization (AVEL) task aims to temporally locate and classify video events that are both audible and visible. Most research in this field assumes a closed-set setting, which restricts these models' ability to handle test data containing event categories absent (unseen) during training. Recently, a few studies have explored AVEL in an open-set setting, enabling the recognition of unseen events as ``unknown'', but without providing category-specific semantics. In this paper, we advance the field by introducing the Open-Vocabulary Audio-Visual Event Localization (OV-AVEL) problem, which requires localizing audio-visual events and predicting explicit categories for both seen and unseen data at inference. To address this new task, we propose the OV-AVEBench dataset, comprising 24,800 videos across 67 real-life audio-visual scenes (seen:unseen = 46:21), each with manual segment-level annotation. We also establish three evaluation metrics for this task. Moreover, we investigate two baseline approaches, one training-free and one using a further fine-tuning paradigm. Specifically, we utilize the unified multimodal space from the pretrained ImageBind model to extract audio, visual, and textual (event classes) features. The training-free baseline then determines predictions by comparing the consistency of audio-text and visual-text feature similarities. The fine-tuning baseline incorporates lightweight temporal layers to encode temporal relations within the audio and visual modalities, using OV-AVEBench training data for model fine-tuning. We evaluate these baselines on the proposed OV-AVEBench dataset and discuss potential directions for future work in this new field.</description>

      <title>ReTaKe: Reducing Temporal and Knowledge Redundancy for Long Video Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20504v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in video understanding. However, existing VideoLLMs often inherit the limitations of their backbone LLMs in handling long sequences, leading to challenges for long video understanding. Common solutions either simply uniformly sample videos' frames or compress visual tokens, which focus primarily on low-level temporal visual redundancy, overlooking high-level knowledge redundancy. This limits the achievable compression rate with minimal loss. To this end. we introduce a training-free method, $\textbf{ReTaKe}$, containing two novel modules DPSelect and PivotKV, to jointly model and reduce both temporal visual redundancy and knowledge redundancy for long video understanding. Specifically, DPSelect identifies keyframes with local maximum peak distance based on their visual features, which are closely aligned with human video perception. PivotKV employs the obtained keyframes as pivots and conducts KV-Cache compression for the non-pivot tokens with low attention scores, which are derived from the learned prior knowledge of LLMs. Experiments on benchmarks VideoMME, MLVU, and LVBench, show that ReTaKe can support 4x longer video sequences with minimal performance loss (&lt;1%) and outperform all similar-size VideoLLMs with 3%-5%, even surpassing or on par with much larger ones.

      <title>Knowledge Bridger: Towards Training-free Missing Multi-modality Completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19834v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Previous successful approaches to missing modality completion rely on carefully designed fusion techniques and extensive pre-training on complete data, which can limit their generalizability in out-of-domain (OOD) scenarios. In this study, we pose a new challenge: can we develop a missing modality completion model that is both resource-efficient and robust to OOD generalization? To address this, we present a training-free framework for missing modality completion that leverages large multimodal models (LMMs). Our approach, termed the "Knowledge Bridger", is modality-agnostic and integrates generation and ranking of missing modalities. By defining domain-specific priors, our method automatically extracts structured information from available modalities to construct knowledge graphs. These extracted graphs connect the missing modality generation and ranking modules through the LMM, resulting in high-quality imputations of missing modalities. Experimental results across both general and medical domains show that our approach consistently outperforms competing methods, including in OOD generalization. Additionally, our knowledge-driven generation and ranking techniques demonstrate superiority over variants that directly employ LMMs for generation and ranking, offering insights that may be valuable for applications in other domains.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05639v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Video inpainting, which aims to restore corrupted video content, has experienced substantial progress. Despite these advances, existing methods, whether propagating unmasked region pixels through optical flow and receptive field priors, or extending image-inpainting models temporally, face challenges in generating fully masked objects or balancing the competing objectives of background context preservation and foreground generation in one model, respectively. To address these limitations, we propose a novel dual-stream paradigm VideoPainter that incorporates an efficient context encoder (comprising only 6% of the backbone parameters) to process masked videos and inject backbone-aware background contextual cues to any pre-trained video DiT, producing semantically consistent content in a plug-and-play manner. This architectural separation significantly reduces the model's learning complexity while enabling nuanced integration of crucial background context. We also introduce a novel target region ID resampling technique that enables any-length video inpainting, greatly enhancing our practical applicability. Additionally, we establish a scalable dataset pipeline leveraging current vision understanding models, contributing VPData and VPBench to facilitate segmentation-based inpainting training and assessment, the largest video inpainting dataset and benchmark to date with over 390K diverse clips. Using inpainting as a pipeline basis, we also explore downstream applications including video editing and video editing pair data generation, demonstrating competitive performance and significant practical potential. Extensive experiments demonstrate VideoPainter's superior performance in both any-length video inpainting and editing, across eight key metrics, including video quality, mask region preservation, and textual coherence.</description>
