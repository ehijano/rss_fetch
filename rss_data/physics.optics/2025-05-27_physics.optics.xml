      <title>SP2RINT: Spatially-Decoupled Physics-Inspired Progressive Inverse Optimization for Scalable, PDE-Constrained Meta-Optical Neural Network Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: DONNs harness the physics of light propagation for efficient analog computation, with applications in AI and signal processing. Advances in nanophotonic fabrication and metasurface-based wavefront engineering have opened new pathways to realize high-capacity DONNs across various spectral regimes. Training such DONN systems to determine the metasurface structures remains challenging. Heuristic methods are fast but oversimplify metasurfaces modulation, often resulting in physically unrealizable designs and significant performance degradation. Simulation-in-the-loop training methods directly optimize a physically implementable metasurface using adjoint methods during end-to-end DONN training, but are inherently computationally prohibitive and unscalable.To address these limitations, we propose SP2RINT, a spatially decoupled, progressive training framework that formulates DONN training as a PDE-constrained learning problem. Metasurface responses are first relaxed into freely trainable transfer matrices with a banded structure. We then progressively enforce physical constraints by alternating between transfer matrix training and adjoint-based inverse design, avoiding per-iteration PDE solves while ensuring final physical realizability. To further reduce runtime, we introduce a physics-inspired, spatially decoupled inverse design strategy based on the natural locality of field interactions. This approach partitions the metasurface into independently solvable patches, enabling scalable and parallel inverse design with system-level calibration. Evaluated across diverse DONN training tasks, SP2RINT achieves digital-comparable accuracy while being 1825 times faster than simulation-in-the-loop approaches. By bridging the gap between abstract DONN models and implementable photonic hardware, SP2RINT enables scalable, high-performance training of physically realizable meta-optical neural systems.</description>

      <title>Photon emission gain in Er doped Si light emitting diodes by impact excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work demonstrates photon emission gain, i.e., emission of multiple photons per injected electron, through impact excitation in Er-doped silicon light-emitting diodes (LEDs). Conventional methods for exciting Er ions in silicon suffer from low efficiency due to mismatched energy transfer between exciton recombination and Er excitation. Here, we propose a reverse-biased Si PN junction diode where ballistically accelerated electrons induce inelastic collisions with Er ions, enabling tunable excitation via electric field modulation. Theoretical modeling reveals that photon emission gain arises from multiple impact excitations by a single electron traversing the electroluminescence region, with the gain value approximating the ratio of emission region width to electron mean free path, i.e., G = Lex/l. Experimental results show an internal quantum efficiency (IQE) of 1.84% at 78 K, representing a 20-fold enhancement over room-temperature performance. This work provides a critical foundation for on-chip integration of silicon-based communication-band lasers and quantum light sources.</description>

      <title>Effects of off-diagonal permittivity terms on polarization singularities in anisotropic grating system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolutions of polarization singularities, including bound states in the continuum (BICs) and circularly polarized states (C points), are usually realized by tuning the geometric parameters of photonic crystal slabs. Here, we use the off-diagonal terms of permittivity tensor to manipulate polarization singularities without breaking the structural symmetry in an anisotropic grating system. By controlling the optical axis of anisotropic media, BICs can be shifted to different positions or split into C points, meanwhile, the creation and annihilation of multiple C points are also observed during the evolution process for both TE and TM modes, respectively. Remarkably, two different splitting directions of BICs can be achieved by tuning the off-diagonal terms of permittivity tensor for the two modes. This work illustrates the important role of off-diagonal terms on the far-field polarization singularities and provide an alternative way to precisely manipulate optical singularities</description>

      <title>Topological Quenching of Noise in a Free-Running Moebius Microcomb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microcombs require ultralow-noise repetition rates to enable next-generation applications in metrology, high-speed communications, microwave photonics, and sensing. Regardless of the stabilisation method, spectral purity ultimately depends on the quality of the free-running spectrum. Traditionally, sources operate at 'quiet points' in parameter space, fixed by device and material properties. Creating broad, tuneable low-noise regions-especially in self-locked systems-remains an open challenge. Here, inspired by topological protection, we demonstrate a microcomb with intrinsically low phase noise in a fully free-running configuration, operating without external referencing or control. Using a microresonator-filtered laser, we implement a Moebius geometry via interleaved microcavity modes. Upon formation of a topological Moebius soliton molecule, the free-running laser exhibits over 15 dB of phase noise suppression across 10 Hz to 10 kHz at a 100 GHz repetition rate, yielding -63 dBc/Hz phase noise at 1 kHz and an Allan deviation of 4 x 10^-10 at 10 s gate time, without any external control. The state persists across dynamical regimes, including an Ising-Bloch-like transition, a hallmark of non-equilibrium physics, where the soliton molecule shifts from a resting to a moving state. Parametrisation of the group velocity minimises the repetition rate's sensitivity to global system parameters, enabling long-term drift compensation from within the system dynamics. Our results establish a new route to intrinsically noise-quenched microcombs, operating in a standalone, fully free-running configuration governed entirely by internal physical principles. This benefits applications such as chip-based microwave generation, metrology-grade optical clocks, and field-deployable systems, where built-in long-term stability and low-noise performance are critical.</description>

      <title>Silicon nitride PIC beam formers for light sheet fluorescent microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) has transformed the way we visualize biological tissues in three dimensions, offering high-resolution imaging while minimizing photo-induced damage to the samples. Recent breakthroughs in tissue-clearing methods have further improved LSFM's capabilities, making it possible to study larger, intact samples in unprecedented detail. To overcome limitations like shallow penetration and light diffraction in traditional LSFM setups, advanced beam shaping with devices such as spatial light modulators and digital micromirror arrays has been utilized. These improve the resolution and the extent of tissues that can be imaged. Advances such as Bessel-beam-based LSFM and lattice light sheet microscopy increase the field of view that can be imaged with low background noise, but often require complex and bulky equipment. Addressing these complexities, a new approach builds on silicon nitride photonic integrated circuits to create a structured light sheet in a very compact device. This system incorporates beam-steering based on wavelength control in a limited tuning range and enables the generation of light sheets with optimized characteristics in regard to thickness and diffraction-length limited penetration depth. Simulations include extensive fabrication tolerance analysis that confirm the practicability of the approach, that can be straightforwardly extended to dual wavelength excitation. This compact, chip-based LSFM system could make high-quality imaging more accessible and transform biomedical instrumentation.</description>

      <title>Nano-Raman Spectroscopy Analysis of Nanoprotuberances in MoSe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contaminations in the formation of two-dimensional heterostructures can hinder or generate desired properties. Recent advancements have highlighted the potential of tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS) for studying materials in the 2D semiconductor class. In this work, we investigate the influence of 50-200nm sized nanoprotuberances within a monolayer of MoSe$_2$ deposited on hBN using nano-Raman spectroscopy, establishing correlations between the presence of localized contaminations and the observed hyperspectral variations. A figure of merit is established for the identification of surface impurities, based on MoSe$_2$ peaks ratio. Notably, new spectral peaks were identified, which are associated with the presence of nanoprotuberances and may indicate contamination and oxidation.</description>

      <title>Neural nanophotonic object detector with ultra-wide field-of-view</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intelligent object detection, which extracts crucial information like targets categories and locations, plays a vital role in emerging technologies including autonomous driving, the Internet of Things, and next-generation mobile communication systems. With the advancement of intelligent object detectors towards higher integration and miniaturization, their portability and adaptability to a broader range of scenarios have been significantly enhanced. However, this progress comes at the cost of reduced detection quality and narrower field-of-view, which severely impacts overall performances. Here we present a neural nanophotonic object detector based on a metalens array, capable of delivering high-quality imaging with an ultra-wide field-of-view of 135{\deg}. The combined neural network not only further improves the imaging quality, but also enables the detector to achieve high-precision target recognition and localization. Moreover, we integrated the neural nanophotonic object detector into a miniature unmanned aerial vehicle to enable wide-angle imaging and intelligent recognition of various real-world dynamic objects, demonstrating the high mobility and flexibility of our neural nanophotonic object detector. Our study presents a systematic framework for advancing revolutionary intelligent detection systems, offering significant potential for a wide range of future applications.</description>

      <title>Radiative coupling between plasmon and electron-hole pairs in a metallic film based on extended Bohm-Pines theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hot carrier generation in metals, where high-energy electron-hole pairs are produced via plasmon excitation,
  has emerged as a promising mechanism for photoelectric conversion and photocatalysis. However, conventional
  theories often describe this process through phenomenological relaxation via Landau damping, which fails to
  account for the microscopic origin of the frequency-dependent internal quantum efficiency (IQE) observed in
  experiments. To address this gap, we develop an extended Bohm-Pines theory for a metallic thin film that
  explicitly incorporates light-matter interactions within a non-local response framework. Our approach treats
  collective (plasmonic) and individual (electron-hole) excitations on equal footing and includes their coupling
  mediated by both longitudinal and transverse electromagnetic fields. This results in a self-consistent theory
  of the optical response of metallic films. The derived total Hamiltonian includes radiative corrections that
  recover the known dispersion of surface plasmon polaritons and, importantly, predict a frequency-dependent
  radiative coupling between collective and individual modes. This previously neglected transverse coupling
  naturally explains the IQE peak near the plasmon resonance and reveals a new mechanism of hot carrier
  generation distinct from conventional Landau damping. Our results provide a unified theoretical foundation for
  understanding plasmon-induced hot carrier dynamics and offer guidance for resonance-based photonic design
  strategies to enhance energy conversion efficiency in metal nanostructures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Space group theory is pivotal in the design of nanophotonics devices, enabling the characterization of periodic optical structures such as photonic crystals. The aim of this study is to extend the application of nonsymmorphic space groups in the field of numerical analysis for research and design of nanophotonics devices. In this work, we introduce the nonsymmorphic symmetry adapted finite element method, and provide a systematic approach for efficient band structure analysis of photonic structures with nonsymmorphic groups. We offer a formal and rigorous treatment by specifically deriving the boundary constraint conditions associated with the symmetry operations and their irreducible representations and decomposing the original problem into different subtasks. our method fully accounting for non-primitive translations and nonstructural symmetries like time-reversal symmetry and hidden symmetries. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method via computing the band structure of photonic structures with a layer group, a plane group, and a space group. The results exhibit excellent agreement with those obtained using the standard finite element method, showcasing improved computational efficiency. Furthermore, the decomposition of the original problem facilitates band structure classification and analysis, enabling the identification of the different bands among the band structure in various subtasks. This advancement paves the way for innovative designs in nanophotonics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coherence time of thermal photons in rubidium vapor cells with varying thicknesses, reveal that there is clear dependence of the photon correlation time on cell thickness. Standard theoretical models accurately predict the coherence time in centimeter-scale cells. In this study we demonstrated, that these models break down in micrometer and sub-micrometer regimes. Cell sizes ranging from mm-scale down to 200 nm did not adhere to prediction based on the standard models. In order to address this shortcoming, we develop an alternative approach better suited for estimating photonic coherence times in ultra-thin vapor cells. This work, highlights the need for a modified theoretical treatment of the coherence time in the nanoscale regime.</description>

      <title>Challenges and perspectives in using multimodal imaging techniques to advance the understanding of fish intestinal microvilli</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The primary function of intestinal microvilli is to increase the surface area of the intestinal lining to maximize nutrient absorption. Despite its importance to the fish health, the small size and dense footprint of microvilli hinders its investigation and necessitates the need of advanced microscopy methods for its visualization. Characterization of the microvilli using super-resolution microscopy provides insights into their structural organization, spatial distribution, and surface properties. Here, we present a comprehensive investigation of different optical, electron and force microscopy methods for analysis of fish microvilli. The super-resolution optical microscopy methods used are 3D structured illumination microscopy (SIM), stimulated emission depletion microscopy (STED), and fluorescence fluctuation microscopy. We also visualized the intestinal microvilli in fish using diffraction-limited optical microscopy methods including confocal and total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy. Additionally, label-free microscopy methods, such as quantitative phase microscopy (QPM) and bright-field imaging, were also employed. To obtain ultra-high resolution, we used scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). We demonstrate a systematic comparison of these microscopy techniques in resolving and quantifying microvilli features, ranging from 1-2 {\mu}m structural morphology to 10-100 nm surface details. Our results highlight the advantages, limitations, and complementary nature of each method in capturing microvilli characteristics across different scales. These techniques are used for super-resolution and high-resolution imaging of Atlantic salmon microvilli gastrointestinal tract.</description>

      <title>Physically Plausible Vectorial Metrics for Polarization Information Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Mueller Matrix Polar Decomposition method decomposes a Mueller matrix into a diattenuator, a retarder, and a depolarizer. Among these elements, the retarder, which plays a key role in medical and material characterization, is modelled as a circular retarder followed by a linear retarder when using this approach. However, this model may not accurately reflect the actual structure of the retarder in certain cases, as many practical retarders do not have a layered structure or consist of multiple (unknown) layers. Misinterpretation, therefore, may occur when the actual structure differs from the model. Here we circumvent this limitation by proposing to use a physically plausible parameter set that includes the axis orientation angle $\phi$, the degree of ellipticity $\chi$, and the elliptical retardance $\rho$. By working with this set of parameters, an overall characterization of a retarder is provided, encompassing its full optical response without making any assumptions about the structure of the material. In this study, experiments were carried out on liquid crystalline samples to validate the feasibility of our approach, demonstrating that the physically plausible parameter set adopted provides a useful tool for a broader range of applications in both biomedical imaging and optical material analysis.</description>

      <title>Selective Enhancement of Optical Chirality and Spin Angular Momentum in Plasmonic Near-Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction between circularly polarized (CP) light and matter is governed by two fundamental quantities: spin angular momentum (SAM) and optical chirality (OC). While these quantities are inseparable in free space, they can be selectively enhanced in plasmonic near-field regions through appropriately designed structures. We demonstrate that the excitation of circular plasmonic nanostructures with CP light enables selective or simultaneous enhancement of SAM and OC through the excitation of rotating plasmon modes. Electromagnetic field analysis reveals that SAM enhancement originates from transverse SAM induced by unidirectional evanescent waves, whereas OC enhancement is governed by the interference between the plasmonic electric field and incident magnetic field. The finite element method simulations confirm that circular dichroism signals arising from these enhanced near fields clearly depend on the SAM and OC of the local fields, underscoring the importance of structural design in the detection and enhancement of optically active phenomena at the nanoscale.</description>

      <title>Exploring Aperiodic Order in Photonic Time Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theoretical framework for analyzing aperiodically ordered photonic time quasicrystals (PTQCs), which are the temporal analogs of spatial photonic quasicrystals. Using a general two-symbol substitutional sequence to model temporal modulations, we extend the trace and anti-trace map formalism used for spatial photonic quasicrystals to the temporal domain. Focusing on the Thue-Morse sequence as a representative example, we examine the band structure and wave-transport properties, discussing their physical origins and highlighting both similarities and key differences with conventional periodic photonic time crystals. Furthermore, we investigate the peculiar features of PTQCs, such as multiscale spectral response and localization effects. Our findings provide valuable insights into the complex interplay between aperiodic order and wave dynamics in time-varying media, highlighting its potential to enable the development of advanced photonic devices.</description>

      <title>Phase amplification microscopy towards femtometer accuracy</title>

Abstract: Quantum devices exploiting twistronics by stacking two-dimensional materials could enable breakthroughs in computing and sensing beyond the limits of current transistors. Scaling up these devices poses grand challenges for in situ metrology, because existing tools lack the accuracy for characterizing sub-atomic structures. Here we demonstrate a laser-based interferometric method, termed Phase Amplification microscopy ({\Phi}-Amp), which can push the measurement accuracy limit to the femtometer-level and beyond in ambient conditions. We show {\Phi}-Amp amplifies weak phase signals from graphene by over 100 times through devising a phase cavity based on a novel phase-gain theory, enabling real-time, wide-field mapping of atomic layers with picometer-level accuracy. We quantified interlayer spacing differences between AB-stacked and 30-degree-twisted bilayer graphene to be ~ 0.71 {\AA}, a subtle distortion driven by quantum interactions that was previously inaccessible to in situ metrology. We envision {\Phi}-Amp as a transformative tool for both expediting wafer-scale atomic fabrication and advancing research in quantum materials by probing subatomic phenomena.</description>

      <title>Wave pulses with unusual asymptotical behavior at infinity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The behavior of wave signals in the far zone is not only of theoretical interest but also of paramount practical importance in communications and other fields of applications of optical, electromagnetic or acoustic waves. Long time ago T. T. Wu introduced models of 'electromagnetic missiles' whose decay could be made arbitrarily slower than the usual inverse distance by an appropriate choice of the high frequency portion of the source spectrum. Very recent work by Plachenov and Kiselev introduced a finite-energy scalar wave solution, different from Wu's, decaying slower than inversely proportional with the distance. A physical explanation for the unusual asymptotic behavior of the latter will be given in this article. Furthermore, two additional examples of scalar wave pulses characterized by abnormal slow decay in the far zone will be given and their asymptotic behavior will be discussed. A proof of feasibility of acoustic and electromagnetic fields with the abnormal asymptotics will be described.</description>

      <title>Tunable Entanglement of Multi-Level Atoms in Photonic Crystals: Leveraging Resonant Dipole Interactions and Quantum Interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive investigation of entanglement dynamics in multi-level V-type atomic systems embedded within PC cavities. We mainly focus on the synergistic roles of resonant dipole-dipole interactions and quantum interference through analytical modeling and numerical simulations using the Schrodinger equation. In our analysis, we show that resonant dipole-dipole interactions and quantum interference serve as potent tools for tuning and stabilizing entanglement in structured photonic environments. Key findings reveal that resonant interaction dominates when interatomic distances align with the localization length of photonic bound states induced by bandgap which enables coherent coupling via evanescent fields. The entanglement is preserved for extended times when dipoles of each atom are aligned parallel or anti-parallel while a novel oscillatory entanglement mechanism emerges from orthogonally aligned atomic dipoles. It is mainly driven by destructive interference between vacuum-mediated pathways and bandgap-engineered photonic density of states. This mechanism exhibits non-Markovian dynamics, including delayed feedback and entanglement revival. We further demonstrate that positioning the atomic excited states deeper within the photonic bandgap accelerates the decay of entanglement oscillations due to the exponential suppression of resonant energy exchange mediated by evanescent modes.</description>

      <title>Universal dissipators for driven open quantum systems and the correction to linear response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate in parallel two common pictures used to describe quantum systems interacting with their surrounding environment, i.e., the stochastic Hamiltonian description, where the environment is implicitly included in the fluctuating internal parameters of the system, and the explicit inclusion of the environment via the time-convolutionless projection operator method. Utilizing these two different frameworks, we show that the dissipator characterizing the dynamics of the reduced system, determined up to second order in the noise strength or bath-system coupling, is universal. That is, it keeps the same form regardless of the drive term, as long as the drive is weak. We thoroughly discuss the assumptions on which this treatment is based and its limitations. By considering the first non-vanishing higher-order term in our expansion, we also derive the linear response correction due to memory-mediated environmental effects in driven-dissipative systems. We demonstrate this technique to be highly accurate for the problems of dephasing in a driven qubit and for the theory of pseudomodes for quantum environments.</description>

      <title>Phase Biasing System for Optical Gyroscope Using Passive Non-Reciprocal Polarization Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interferometric Fiber Optic Gyroscopes (IFOGs) are widely used in precision navigation systems due to their high sensitivity, robustness, and solid-state nature. To ensure linear response and accurate angular velocity measurement, a fixed $\pi/2$ phase bias is typically introduced between the clockwise (CW) and counter-clockwise (CCW) beams using active modulation components. However, these active elements increase system complexity, power consumption, cost, and susceptibility to thermal drift and long-term degradation. In this work, we present a novel IFOG configuration that, to the best of our knowledge, achieves for the first time, simultaneous operation at two quadrature points ($\pi/2$ and $3\pi/2$), providing natural noise suppression without relying on active components. This is made possible through the integration of a Non-Reciprocal Polarization-Dependent Phase Shifter (NRPPS), which introduces a pure $\pi/2$ passive phase shift. We detail the optical architecture and provide theoretical modeling using Jones calculus to demonstrate how the NRPPS element introduces passive quadrature biasing. Simulation results show that the proposed NRPPS-IFOG achieves significantly improved sensitivity, with Angular Random Walk (ARW) values up to 40x lower than those of conventional IFOGs, depending on the fiber coil length. The design further leverages quadrature-phase signal detection and adjustable temporal offsets between photodetectors to enhance noise suppression. This passive biasing approach eliminates the need for active modulation, offering reduced power consumption, improved stability, and enhanced long-term reliability.</description>

      <title>Ring artifacts correction method in x-ray computed tomography based on stripe classification and removal in sinogram images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: X-ray computed tomography (CT) is widely utilized in the medical, industrial, and other fields to nondestructively generate three-dimensional structural images of objects. However, CT images are often affected by various artifacts, with ring artifacts being a common occurrence that significantly compromises image quality and subsequent structural interpretation. In this study, a ring artifact correction method based on stripe classification and removal in sinogram images was proposed. The proposed method classifies ring artifacts into single stripes and multiple stripes, which were identified and eliminated using median filtering and multiphase decomposition, respectively. A novel algorithm combining median filtering, polyphase decomposition and median filtering was further developed to eliminate all forms of stripes simultaneously and effectively. The efficacy of the proposed method was validated through both simulated and experimental CT data. The study provides a novel perspective and integrated approach to addressing ring artifacts in X-ray CT. It will be of significant illuminating to a diverse readership, including radiologists, clinical researchers, and industrial scientists.</description>

      <title>Temporal dynamics in the Bragg reflection of light by cold atoms: flash effect and superradiant decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the temporal dynamics of light interacting with a one-dimensional lattice of cold atoms. In such a system, a photonic band gap opens up, yielding an efficient Bragg reflection for an incident field incoming with the right angle and detuning. Here, we report two new effects appearing in the Bragg reflection. First, for some detunings, there is a ``flash'', i.e., a transient increase of the reflected intensity when the incident field is switched off. Second, the subsequent extinction of the reflected field is clearly superradiant, with decay rates up to 8 times the natural decay rate of the atomic excited state. Numerical simulations are in qualitative agreement with the observations, which can be explained by a classical photonic model.</description>

      <title>Classical-to-quantum transfer of geometric phase for non-interferometric phase measurement and manipulation of quantum state</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The geometric phase, originating from the cyclic evolution of a state, such as polarization on the Poincar\'e sphere, is typically measured through interferometric approaches that often include unwanted contributions from the dynamic phase. Here, we present a non-interferometric technique based on quantum correlation of pair photons to measure the geometric phase of a classical beam. The transfer of geometric phase of the classical pump beam arising from the cyclic evolution of its polarization state on the Poincar\'e sphere onto the polarization-entangled pair photons generated via spontaneous parametric down-conversion in a Sagnac interferometer enables easy control over the quantum state. Characterization of the generated quantum states reveals that the geometric phase of the pump beam controls the coincidence counts, entanglement visibility, Bell's parameter, quantum state tomography, and fidelity in close agreement with theoretical predictions. We observe sinusoidal modulation of the Bell's parameter and state fidelity with changes in the geometric phase, resulting in transitions between orthogonal Bell states and Bell-like maximally entangled states. Our results establish the geometric phase of the classical pump as a tunable parameter for quantum state control, offering a compact, passive platform for phase manipulation in quantum photonic systems, enabling geometric phase-based quantum gates, and compensating unwanted phase acquired by the quantum state on propagation.</description>

Abstract: Graphene plasmons hold immense potential for terahertz (THz) detector application due to their fascinating interactions between radiation and matter. However, it has remained challenging to excite and manipulate graphene plasmons within continuous graphene that is free of patterning technique. Here, we report an adaptive wavelength-sensitive terahertz detector consisting of continuous graphene integrated onto a ferroelectric thin film with periodic polarization domains. This designed device is capable of absorbing THz waves with zero input bias voltage because of highly confinement of surface plasmons within the interface between graphene and ferroelectrics. By reconfiguring an interweaving squared ferroelectric domain array with alternating upward and downward polarizations, our devices theoretically own an ultrahigh responsivity of 17.56 A W-1 and a specific detectivity of 1.11*10^11 Jones at room temperature. We also demonstrate that the photodetectors make possible for spectrum reconstruction application of portable spectrometer at a broad operation band of 4.97 to 7.85 THz with resolution up to 0.02 THz combining the mathematical algorithms.</description>

      <title>Absorption and scattering properties of nanoparticles in an absorbing medium: modeling with experimental validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04248v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Absorption and scattering properties of nanoparticles immersed in an absorbing medium are essential in understanding the overall properties of composites and in designing materials with expected functionalities. In this paper, we establish a model based on both Kubelka-Munk theory and Mie theory that links the absorption and scattering properties of individual particles with the reflectance and transmittance spectra of its thin-film composite, supported by detailed experiments. Thin films consisting of TiO$_2$ nanoparticles embedded in PMMA are fabricated on glass substrates using spin-coating and then peeled off to form standalone samples for spectroscopy measurements. By using the Kubelka-Munk theory in combination with the Saunderson correction, the absorption $K$ and scattering $S$ coefficients of multiple nanoparticles are extracted from the measured transmittance and reflectance. On the other hand, the absorption $K$ and scattering $S$ coefficients are the function of absorption and scattering cross-sections of individual particles, which are calculated from the Mie theory specified for particles in an absorbing medium. The overall model is validated by matching well between the $K-S$ coefficients extracted from experimental data and theoretical calculations. This agreement provides deep insight into the significant attenuating effect of absorption and scattering on each particle due to the surrounding medium. The validated model of nanoparticles immersed in an absorbing medium can be used to obtain preliminary results for materials designed in a number of applications, such as radiative cooling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18576v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a theoretical model to investigate wave propagation in media with random time-varying properties, where temporal fluctuations lead to complex scattering dynamics. Focusing on the ensemble-averaged field, we derive an exact expression for the average Green's function in the presence of finite temporal disorder, and extend the analysis to the thermodynamic limit. In contrast to spatial disorder, causality prevents recurrent scattering, allowing us to achieve a non-perturbative solution. We introduce an effective medium description providing a simple analysis of the propagation regimes. Our findings offer new insights into wave dynamics in temporally disordered media, with potential applications in time-varying metamaterials, dynamic sensing, and imaging in turbulent or chaotic environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03728v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Used extensively in sensing applications, the application of solution-state electrochemiluminescent devices (ECLDs) in lighting and displays has been constrained by their low luminance and short operational lifetime. Here, we report a record improvement in the luminance, efficiency, and operational longevity of ECLDs by introducing electrochemically induced hyperfluorescence (ECiHF) and demonstrate its use in a calligraphic display. We use the double-decker arrangement assumed by the electron donor and acceptor segments of the molecule TpAT-tFFO to realize thermally activated delayed fluorescence from an electrogenerated charge-transfer (CT) excimer state and a subsequent energy transfer to the rubrene emitter TBRb. ECLDs based on this strategy achieve an unprecedented luminance of &gt;6,200 cd/m2 and their operational lifetime is more than 10-fold longer than all previous ECLDs with meaningful efficiency or brightness. We identify energy level alignment between excimer and emitter as a crucial factor for efficient ECiHF; spectroelectrochemical analysis reveals that devices with energy gaps &lt; 0.4 eV operate on a pure excimer mechanism across a wide range of frequencies. Our findings highlight the potential of ECiHF for improving ECLDs and pave the way to commercial applications of this form of fluid light.</description>

      <title>Twist-enabled Transmissive Metasurface with Co-polarized Geometric Phase</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06618v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Metasurfaces have offered unprecedented control over electromagnetic (EM) waves across a wide range of frequency spectrum by manipulating their phase, amplitude, and polarization at subwavelength scales. Full wavefront control using metasurfaces requires 2{\pi} phase modulation, which is essential for advanced optical and photonic engineering. Common approaches, such as the Pancharatnam-Berry (PB) phases and resonant phases, face stringent limitations: PB phases essentially depend on circular polarization conversion, while resonant phases are inherently narrowband and require a complex design process. To overcome these challenges, we propose a broadband metasurface with a co-polarized transmissive geometric phase that achieves 2{\pi} phase coverage while conserving the circular polarization of incident EM waves. This co-polarized phase is enabled by a local twist angle between the upper and lower metallic patterns, forming a branch cut in the parameter space determined by the twist angle and frequency. The branch cut connects phase singularities of opposite chirality, ensuring broadband 2{\pi} phase coverage. We experimentally validate the presence of the branch cut and demonstrate broadband generation of arbitrary orbital angular momentum (OAM) for co-polarized output. Our approach provides a versatile method for designing broadband metasurfaces without altering circular polarizations, paving the way for development of compact optical and photonic devices.</description>

      <title>A General Model for Linearly Polarized Optical Vector Beams</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00471v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an approach for deriving a broad class of propagation models for inhomogeneously, linearly polarized ``vector'' beams. Our formulation leverages a complex scalar potential along with an appropriately constructed Lagrangian energy density. Importantly, we show that polarization inhomogeneities can be included by simple addition of a spatially dependent polarization angle to the complex potential phase. Thus, phase and polarization are seen to be equivalent from an energy perspective. As part of our development, we also show how the complex scalar potential arises naturally when considering polarization angle as a field symmetry during construction of the Lagrangian. We further show that the definition of linear momentum density in terms of the complex potential holds a distinct advantage over the conventional definition for inhomogeneously polarized beams.</description>

Abstract: This paper examines the historical development that led to error-free phase demodulation of pixelated spatial-carrier interferograms between 2004 and 2010. It also evaluates evidence suggesting that 4D Technology Corporation (4DTC), in their SPIE 7790 publication [18], may have adopted key concepts from a manuscript submitted by Servin and collaborators, which at that time was still under peer review [17]. We analyze 4DTC algorithms based on 2x2 and 3x3 spatial convolution phase shifting algorithms (SC-PSA), developed from 2004 to 2009 [9-15], and show that they were fundamentally limited to narrow bandwidth fringe demodulation. Notably, only one 4DTC's paper [13] acknowledged major phase errors when these methods were applied to wideband pixelated fringes, but the problem remained unsolved. In 2010, the team at Centro de Investigaciones en Optica (CIO), led by Servin, entered the field [16,17]. At that point, CIO and 4DTC were the only two known groups pursuing error free demodulation of wideband pixelated interferograms. In June 2010, Servin et al submitted to Optics Express [17] a definitive error-free solution introducing a new method: the complex fringe-carrier product followed by step-edge low-pass Fourier filtering. This approach fully superseded the 2x2 and 3x3 kernels used by 4DTC [9-15], reaching the theoretical slope limit for pixelated sensors. Given the notable phase demodulation similarities between papers [17] and [18], and that the presentation of [18] was just seven weeks after Servin submission [17], it is plausible that 4DTC or an affiliate had early access to the submission. The circumstantial evidence suggests that core ideas from [17] were incorporated into 4DTC August presentation [18]. This paper retraces that scientific path and examines the ethical implications of uncredited appropriation in optical research.</description>

      <title>Highly ordered LIPSS on Au thin film for plasmonic sensing fabricated by double femtosecond pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.03180v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Periodic plasmonic arrays making possible excitations of surface lattice resonances (SLRs) or quasi-resonant features are of great importance for biosensing and other applications. Fabrication of such arrays over a large area is typically very costly and time-consuming when performed using conventional electron beam lithography and other methods, which reduce application prospects. Here, we propose a technique of double femtosecond pulse (~ 170 fs) laser-assisted structuring of thin (~ 32 nm) Au films deposited on a glass substrate and report a single-step fabrication of homogeneous and highly ordered Au-based Laser Induced Periodic Surface Structures (LIPSS) over a large area. Our experimental results unveil the key importance of the interpulse delay as the determining factor rendering possible the homogeneity of laser induced structures and confirm that highly ordered, functional LIPSS occur solely upon double pulse irradiation under a specific interpulse delay range. A theoretical investigation complements experimental results providing remarkable insights on the structure formation mechanism. Ellipsometric measurements show that such LIPSS structures can exhibit highly valuable plasmonic features in light reflection. In particular, we observed ultranarrow resonances associated with diffraction-coupled SLRs, which are of paramount importance for biosensing and other applications. The presented data suggest that femtosecond double pulse structuring of thin metal films can serve as a valuable and low-cost tool for a large-scale fabrication of highly ordered functional elements and structures.</description>

      <title>Markov chain Monte Carlo Detector Tomography applied to a NbTiN nanobridge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11430v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the use of a flexible and highly accurate Markov chain Monte Carlo Quantum Detector Tomography method as a minimization algorithm to best describe the response of an efficient $120 nm$ wide NbTiN superconducting nanobridge single photon detector. Separation of the internal quantum efficiency and external quantum efficiency is possible due to the difference in saturation behavior of an ideal 1-photon threshold detector as compared to a detector with non-unity 1-photon internal quantum efficiency. From a statistical analysis of our measurements (at $T=4.23\pm0.01K$, $I=29.4\pm0.1\mu A$, $I/I_\text{switch}=0.90\pm0.01$) we find an external quantum efficiency $\eta=(1.60\pm0.05)\cdot10^{-6}$, a 1-photon internal quantum efficiency $p_1=0.568\pm0.008$ and unity multi-photon (2 or more) internal quantum efficiency.</description>
