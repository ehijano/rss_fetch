      <title>Fingerprint Matrix Concept for Detecting, Localizing and Characterizing Targets in Complex Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As waves propagate through a complex medium, they undergo multiple scattering events. This phenomenon is detrimental to imaging, as it causes a full blurring of the image beyond a transport mean free path. Here, we show how to detect, localize, and characterize any scattering target through the reflection matrix of the complex medium in which this target is embedded and thus hidden from direct view. More precisely, we introduce a fingerprint operator that contains the specific signature of the target with respect to its environment. Applied to the recorded reflection matrix, this operator provides a likelihood index of the target in any given state, despite the scattering fog induced by the surrounding environment. This state can be the target position for localization purposes, its shape for characterization, or any other parameter that influences the target response. Our concept is versatile and broadly applicable to different type of waves for which multi-element technology allows a reflection matrix to be measured. We demonstrate this here explicitly by performing different proof-of-concept experiments with ultrasound on targets buried inside a strongly scattering granular suspension, on lesion markers for clinical applications, and on the architecture of muscle tissue.</description>

      <title>Evolution of cooperation in a bimodal mixture of conditional cooperators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extensive behavioral experiments reveal that conditional cooperation is a prevalent phenomenon. Previous game-theoretical studies have predominantly relied on hard-manner models, where cooperation is triggered only upon reaching a specific threshold. However, this approach contrasts with the observed flexibility of human behavior, where individuals adapt their strategies dynamically based on their surroundings. To capture this adaptability, we introduce a soft form of conditional cooperation by integrating the Q-learning algorithm from reinforcement learning. In this framework, players not only reciprocate mutual cooperation but may also defect in highly cooperative environments or cooperate in less cooperative settings to maximize rewards. To explore the effects of hard and soft conditional cooperators, we examine their interactions in two scenarios: structural mixture (SM) and probabilistic mixture (PM), where the two behavioral modes are fixed and probabilistically adopted, respectively. In SM, hard conditional cooperators enhance cooperation when the threshold is low but hinder it otherwise. Surprisingly, in PM, the cooperation prevalence exhibits two first-order phase transitions as the probability is varied, leading to high, low, and vanishing levels of cooperation. Analysis of Q-tables offers insights into the "psychological shifts" of soft conditional cooperators and the overall evolutionary dynamics. Model extensions confirm the robustness of our findings. These results highlight the novel complexities arising from the diversity of conditional cooperators.</description>

      <title>Phenomenology of many-body localization in bond-disordered spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10062v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many-body localization (MBL) hinders the thermalization of quantum many-body systems in the presence of strong disorder. In this work, we study the MBL regime in bond-disordered spin-1/2 XXZ spin chain, finding the multimodal distribution of entanglement entropy in eigenstates, sub-Poissonian level statistics, and revealing a relation between operators and initial states required for examining the breakdown of thermalization in the time evolution of the system. We employ a real space renormalization group scheme to identify these phenomenological features of the MBL regime that extend beyond the standard picture of local integrals of motion relevant for systems with disorder coupled to on-site operators. Our results pave the way for experimental probing of MBL in bond-disordered spin chains.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic mixed state topological order in a stabilizer system under stochastic decoherence: Strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking from percolation point of view</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14258v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Discovering quantum orders in mixed many-body systems is an ongoing issue. Very recently, the notion of an intrinsic mixed state topologically-ordered (IMTO) state was proposed. As a concrete example, we observe the emergence of IMTO by studying the toric code system under stochastic maximal decoherence by $ZX$-diagonal type projective measurement without monitoring. We study how the toric code state changes to an IMTO state at the level of the averaged quantum trajectories. This phase transition is understood from the viewpoint of spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) of 1-form weak symmetry, that is, the IMTO is characterized by the symmetry restoration from the SSB, which comes from the proliferation of anyons. To understand the emergent IMTO, order and disorder parameters of 1-form symmetry are numerically studied by stabilizer simulation. The present study clarifies the existence of two distinct microscopic string operators for the fermionic anyons, that leads to distinct fermionic strong and weak 1-form symmetries, and also the obtained critical exponents indicate strong relation between IMTO and percolation.</description>
