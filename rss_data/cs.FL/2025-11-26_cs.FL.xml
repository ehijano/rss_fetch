      <title>Softmax Transformers are Turing-Complete</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hard attention Chain-of-Thought (CoT) transformers are known to be Turing-complete. However, it is an open problem whether softmax attention Chain-of-Thought (CoT) transformers are Turing-complete. In this paper, we prove a stronger result that length-generalizable softmax CoT transformers are Turing-complete. More precisely, our Turing-completeness proof goes via the CoT extension of the Counting RASP (C-RASP), which correspond to softmax CoT transformers that admit length generalization. We prove Turing-completeness for CoT C-RASP with causal masking over a unary alphabet (more generally, for letter-bounded languages). While we show this is not Turing-complete for arbitrary languages, we prove that its extension with relative positional encoding is Turing-complete for arbitrary languages. We empirically validate our theory by training transformers for languages requiring complex (non-linear) arithmetic reasoning.</description>

      <title>Parameterized Verification of Quantum Circuits (Technical Report)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first fully automatic framework for verifying relational properties of parameterized quantum programs, i.e., a program that, given an input size, generates a corresponding quantum circuit. We focus on verifying input-output correctness as well as equivalence. At the core of our approach is a new automata model, synchronized weighted tree automata (SWTAs), which compactly and precisely captures the infinite families of quantum states produced by parameterized programs. We introduce a class of transducers to model quantum gate semantics and develop composition algorithms for constructing transducers of parameterized circuits. Verification is reduced to functional inclusion or equivalence checking between SWTAs, for which we provide decision procedures. Our implementation demonstrates both the expressiveness and practical efficiency of the framework by verifying a diverse set of representative parameterized quantum programs with verification times ranging from milliseconds to seconds.</description>

      <title>A Diamond Structure in the Transducer Hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.05481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.05481v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We answer an open question in the theory of transducer degrees on the existence of a diamond structure in the transducer hierarchy. Transducer degrees are the equivalence classes formed by word transformations which can be realized by a finite state transducer, which form an order based on which words can be transformed into other words. We provide a construction which proves the existence of a diamond structure, while also introducing a new function on streams which may be useful for proving more results about the transducer hierarchy.</description>

      <title>Explorable Parity Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23187v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define the class of explorable automata on finite or infinite words. This is a generalization of History-Deterministic (HD) automata, where this time non-deterministic choices can be resolved by building finitely many simultaneous runs instead of just one. We show that recognizing HD parity automata of fixed index among explorable ones is in PTime, thereby giving a strong link between the two notions. We then show that recognizing explorable automata is ExpTime-complete, in the case of finite words or parity automata up to index [0, 2]. Additionally, we define the notion of {\omega}-explorable automata on infinite words, where countably many runs can be used to resolve the non-deterministic choices. We show ExpTime-completeness for {\omega}-explorability of automata on infinite words for the safety and coB\"uchi acceptance conditions. We finally characterize the expressivity of ({\omega}-)explorable automata with respect to the parity index hierarchy.</description>

      <title>Smallest Suffixient Sets: Effectiveness, Resilience, and Calculation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05638v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A suffixient set is a novel combinatorial object that captures the essential information of repetitive strings in a way that, provided with a random access mechanism, supports various forms of pattern matching. In this paper, we study the size $\chi$ of the smallest suffixient set as a repetitiveness measure: we place it between known measures and study its sensitivity to various string operations. As a corollary of our results, we give simple online algorithms to compute smallest suffixient sets.</description>

      <title>Weighted Automata for Exact Inference in Discrete Probabilistic Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15074v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In probabilistic programming, the inference problem asks to determine a program's posterior distribution conditioned on its "observe" instructions. Inference is challenging, especially when exact rather than approximate results are required. Inspired by recent work on probability generating functions (PGFs), we propose encoding distributions on $\mathbb{N}^k$ as weighted automata over a commutative alphabet with $k$ symbols. Based on this, we map the semantics of various imperative programming statements to automata-theoretic constructions. For a rich class of programs, this results in an effective translation from prior to posterior distribution, both encoded as automata. We prove that our approach is sound with respect to a standard operational program semantics.</description>
