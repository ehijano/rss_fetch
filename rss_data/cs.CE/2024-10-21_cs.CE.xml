      <title>On the feasibility of foundational models for the simulation of physical phenomena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the feasibility of foundation models for the simulation of physical phenomena, with emphasis on continuum (solid and fluid) mechanics. Although so-called learned simulators have shown some success when applied to specific tasks, it remains to be studied to what extent they are able to undergo severe changes in domain shape, boundary conditions and/or constitutive laws and still provide robust (i.e., hallucination-free) and accurate results. In this paper we perform an exhaustive study of these features, put ourselves in the worst-case scenario and study their resistance to such strong changes in their domain of application.</description>

      <title>UCFE: A User-Centric Financial Expertise Benchmark for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the UCFE: User-Centric Financial Expertise benchmark, an innovative framework designed to evaluate the ability of large language models (LLMs) to handle complex real-world financial tasks. UCFE benchmark adopts a hybrid approach that combines human expert evaluations with dynamic, task-specific interactions to simulate the complexities of evolving financial scenarios. Firstly, we conducted a user study involving 804 participants, collecting their feedback on financial tasks. Secondly, based on this feedback, we created our dataset that encompasses a wide range of user intents and interactions. This dataset serves as the foundation for benchmarking 12 LLM services using the LLM-as-Judge methodology. Our results show a significant alignment between benchmark scores and human preferences, with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.78, confirming the effectiveness of the UCFE dataset and our evaluation approach. UCFE benchmark not only reveals the potential of LLMs in the financial sector but also provides a robust framework for assessing their performance and user satisfaction.The benchmark dataset and evaluation code are available.</description>

      <title>You Only Look Twice! for Failure Causes Identification of Drill Bits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient identification of the root causes of drill bit failure is crucial due to potential impacts such as operational losses, safety threats, and delays. Early recognition of these failures enables proactive maintenance, reducing risks and financial losses associated with unforeseen breakdowns and prolonged downtime. Thus, our study investigates various causes of drill bit failure using images of different blades. The process involves annotating cutters with their respective locations and damage types, followed by the development of two YOLO Location and Damage Cutter Detection models, as well as multi-class multi-label Decision Tree and Random Forests models to identify the causes of failure by assessing the cutters' location and damage type. Additionally, RRFCI is proposed for the classification of failure causes. Notably, the cutter location detection model achieved a high score of 0.97 mPA, and the cutter damage detection model yielded a 0.49 mPA. The rule-based approach over-performed both DT and RF in failure cause identification, achieving a macro-average F1-score of 0.94 across all damage causes. The integration of the complete automated pipeline successfully identified 100\% of the 24 failure causes when tested on independent sets of ten drill bits, showcasing its potential to efficiently assist experts in identifying the root causes of drill bit damages.</description>

      <title>Blockchain-Based Trust and Transparency in Airline Reservation Systems using Microservices Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This research gives a detailed analysis of the application of blockchain technology to the airline reservation systems in order to bolster trust, transparency, and operational efficiency by overcoming several challenges including customer control and data integrity issues. The study investigates the major components of blockchain technology such as decentralised databases, permanent records of transactions and transactional clauses executed via codes of programs and their impacts on automated systems and real-time tracking of audits. The results show a 30% decrease in booking variations together with greater data synchronization as a result of consensus processes and resistant data formations. The approach to the implementation of a blockchain technology for the purpose of this paper includes many APIs for the automatic multi-faceted record-keeping system including the smart contract execution and controllable end-users approach. Smart contracts organized the processes improving the cycle times by 40% on the average while guaranteeing no breach of agreements. In addition to this, the architecture of the system has no single point failure with over 98% reliability while measures taken to improve security have led to 85% of the customers expressing trust in the services provided. In summation, the results suggest that reservations in the airline sector stand a chance of being redefined with blockchain through savoring the benefits of a single source of truth while attempting to resolve this intrinsic problem of overcomplexity. Although the system improves the experience of customers and the level of operational transparency, issues concerning scalability and regulatory adherence. This research is also a stepping stone for further studies that are intended to address these challenges and more applicable to the airline industry.</description>

      <title>Discrete empirical interpolation in the tensor t-product framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM) is a well-established approach, widely used for state reconstruction using sparse sensor/measurement data, nonlinear model reduction, and interpretable feature selection. We introduce the tensor t-product Q-DEIM (t-Q-DEIM), an extension of the DEIM framework for dealing with tensor-valued data. The proposed approach seeks to overcome one of the key drawbacks of DEIM, viz., the need for matricizing the data, which can distort any structural and/or geometric information. Our method leverages the recently developed tensor t-product algebra to avoid reshaping the data. In analogy with the standard DEIM, we formulate and solve a tensor-valued least-squares problem, whose solution is achieved through an interpolatory projection. We develop a rigorous, computable upper bound for the error resulting from the t-Q-DEIM approximation. Using five different tensor-valued datasets, we numerically illustrate the better approximation properties of t-Q-DEIM and the significant computational cost reduction it offers.</description>

      <title>Using Sentiment and Technical Analysis to Predict Bitcoin with Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cryptocurrencies have gained significant attention in recent years due to their decentralized nature and potential for financial innovation. Thus, the ability to accurately predict its price has become a subject of great interest for investors, traders, and researchers. Some works in the literature show how Bitcoin's market sentiment correlates with its price fluctuations in the market. However, papers that consider the sentiment of the market associated with financial Technical Analysis indicators in order to predict Bitcoin's price are still scarce. In this paper, we present a novel approach for predicting Bitcoin price movements by combining the Fear &amp; Greedy Index, a measure of market sentiment, Technical Analysis indicators, and the potential of Machine Learning algorithms. This work represents a preliminary study on the importance of sentiment metrics in cryptocurrency forecasting. Our initial experiments demonstrate promising results considering investment returns, surpassing the Buy &amp; Hold baseline, and offering valuable insights about the combination of indicators of sentiment and market in a cryptocurrency prediction model.</description>

      <title>A Mixed Tree-Cotree Gauge for the Reduced Basis Approximation of Maxwell's Eigenvalue Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11276v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Model order reduction methods are a powerful tool to drastically reduce the computational effort of problems which need to be evaluated repeatedly, i.e., when computing the same system for various parameter values. When applying a reduced basis approximation algorithm to the Maxwell eigenvalue problem, we encounter spurious solutions in the reduced system which hence need to be removed during the basis construction. In this paper, we discuss two tree-cotree gauge-based methods for the removal of the spurious eigenmodes.</description>

      <title>A survey on multi-fidelity surrogates for simulators with functional outputs: unified framework and benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17075v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-fidelity surrogate models combining dimensionality reduction and an intermediate surrogate in the reduced space allow a cost-effective emulation of simulators with functional outputs. The surrogate is an input-output mapping learned from a limited number of simulator evaluations. This computational efficiency makes surrogates commonly used for many-query tasks. Diverse methods for building them have been proposed in the literature, but they have only been partially compared.
  This paper introduces a unified framework encompassing the different surrogate families, followed by a methodological comparison and the exposition of practical considerations. More than a dozen of existing multi-fidelity surrogates have been implemented under the unified framework and evaluated on a set of benchmark problems. Based on the results, guidelines and recommendations are proposed regarding multi-fidelity surrogates with functional outputs.
  Our study shows that most multi-fidelity surrogates outperform their tested single-fidelity counterparts under the considered settings. But no particular surrogate is performing better on every test case. Therefore, the selection of a surrogate should consider the specific properties of the emulated functions, in particular the correlation between the low- and high-fidelity simulators, the size of the training set, the local nonlinear variations in the residual fields, and the size of the training datasets.</description>

      <title>MolecularGPT: Open Large Language Model (LLM) for Few-Shot Molecular Property Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12950v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Molecular property prediction (MPP) is a fundamental and crucial task in drug discovery. However, prior methods are limited by the requirement for a large number of labeled molecules and their restricted ability to generalize for unseen and new tasks, both of which are essential for real-world applications. To address these challenges, we present MolecularGPT for few-shot MPP. From a perspective on instruction tuning, we fine-tune large language models (LLMs) based on curated molecular instructions spanning over 1000 property prediction tasks. This enables building a versatile and specialized LLM that can be adapted to novel MPP tasks without any fine-tuning through zero- and few-shot in-context learning (ICL). MolecularGPT exhibits competitive in-context reasoning capabilities across 10 downstream evaluation datasets, setting new benchmarks for few-shot molecular prediction tasks. More importantly, with just two-shot examples, MolecularGPT can outperform standard supervised graph neural network methods on 4 out of 7 datasets. It also excels state-of-the-art LLM baselines by up to 15.7% increase on classification accuracy and decrease of 17.9 on regression metrics (e.g., RMSE) under zero-shot. This study demonstrates the potential of LLMs as effective few-shot molecular property predictors. The code is available at https://github.com/NYUSHCS/MolecularGPT.</description>

      <title>AgileRate: Bringing Adaptivity and Robustness to DeFi Lending Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13105v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Decentralized Finance (DeFi) has revolutionized lending by replacing intermediaries with algorithm-driven liquidity pools. However, existing platforms like Aave and Compound rely on static interest rate curves and collateral requirements that struggle to adapt to rapid market changes, leading to inefficiencies in utilization and increased risks of liquidations. In this work, we propose a dynamic model of the lending market based on evolving demand and supply curves, alongside an adaptive interest rate controller that responds in real-time to shifting market conditions. Using a Recursive Least Squares algorithm, our controller estimates tracks the external market and achieves stable utilization, while also minimizing risk. We provide theoretical guarantees on the interest rate convergence and utilization stability of our algorithm. We establish bounds on the system's vulnerability to adversarial manipulation compared to static curves, while quantifying the trade-off between adaptivity and adversarial robustness. Our dynamic curve demand/supply model demonstrates a low best-fit error on Aave data, while our interest rate controller significantly outperforms static curve protocols in maintaining optimal utilization and minimizing liquidations.</description>
