      <title>Multi-Beam Integrated Sensing and Communication: State-of-the-Art, Challenges and Opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has been envisioned as a critical enabling technology for the next-generation wireless communication, which can realize location/motion detection of surroundings with communication devices. This additional sensing capability leads to a substantial network quality gain and expansion of the service scenarios. As the system evolves to millimeter wave (mmWave) and above, ISAC can realize simultaneous communications and sensing of the ultra-high throughput level and radar resolution with compact design, which relies on directional beamforming against the path loss. With the multi-beam technology, the dual functions of ISAC can be seamlessly incorporated at the beamspace level by unleashing the potential of joint beamforming. To this end, this article investigates the key technologies for multi-beam ISAC system. We begin with an overview of the current state-of-the-art solutions in multi-beam ISAC. Subsequently, a detailed analysis of the advantages associated with the multi-beam ISAC is provided. Additionally, the key technologies for transmitter, channel and receiver of the multi-beam ISAC are introduced. Finally, we explore the challenges and opportunities presented by multi-beam ISAC, offering valuable insights into this emerging field.</description>

      <title>Large-scale Outdoor Cell-free mMIMO Channel Measurement in an Urban Scenario at 3.5 GHz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The design of cell-free massive MIMO (CF-mMIMO) systems requires accurate, measurement-based channel models. This paper provides the first results from the by far most extensive outdoor measurement campaign for CF-mMIMO channels in an urban environment. We measured impulse responses between over 20,000 potential access point (AP) locations and 80 user equipments (UEs) at 3.5 GHz with 350 MHz bandwidth (BW). Measurements use a "virtual array" approach at the AP and a hybrid switched/virtual approach at the UE. This paper describes the sounder design, measurement environment, data processing, and sample results, particularly the evolution of the power-delay profiles (PDPs) as a function of the AP locations, and its relation to the propagation environment.</description>

      <title>IoT on the Road to Sustainability: Vehicle or Bandit?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) can support the evolution towards a digital and green future. However, the introduction of the technology clearly has in itself a direct adverse ecological impact. This paper assesses this impact at both the IoT-node and at the network side. For the nodes, we show that the electronics production of devices comes with a carbon footprint that can be much higher than during operation phase. We highlight that the inclusion of IoT support in existing cellular networks comes with a significant ecological penalty, raising overall energy consumption by more than 15%. These results call for novel design approaches for the nodes and for early consideration of the support for IoT in future networks. Raising the 'Vehicle or bandit?' question on the nature of IoT in the broader sense of sustainability, we illustrate the need for multidisciplinary cooperation to steer applications in desirable directions.</description>

      <title>UAV-Enabled Wireless Networks with Movable-Antenna Array: Flexible Beamforming and Trajectory Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, movable antenna (MA) array becomes a promising technology for improving the communication quality in wireless communication systems. In this letter, an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) enabled multi-user multi-input-single-output system enhanced by the MA array is investigated. To enhance the throughput capacity, we aim to maximize the achievable data rate by jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming, the UAV trajectory, and the positions of the MA array antennas. The formulated data rate maximization problem is a highly coupled non-convex problem, for which an alternating optimization based algorithm is proposed to get a sub-optimal solution. Numerical results have demonstrated the performance gain of the proposed method compared with conventional method with fixed-position antenna array.</description>

      <title>Cross-Talk Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While far-field multi-talker mixtures are recorded, each speaker can wear a close-talk microphone so that close-talk mixtures can be recorded at the same time. Although each close-talk mixture has a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the wearer, it has a very limited range of applications, as it also contains significant cross-talk speech by other speakers and is not clean enough. In this context, we propose a novel task named cross-talk reduction (CTR) which aims at reducing cross-talk speech, and a novel solution named CTRnet which is based on unsupervised or weakly-supervised neural speech separation. In unsupervised CTRnet, close-talk and far-field mixtures are stacked as input for a DNN to estimate the close-talk speech of each speaker. It is trained in an unsupervised, discriminative way such that the DNN estimate for each speaker can be linearly filtered to cancel out the speaker's cross-talk speech captured at other microphones. In weakly-supervised CTRnet, we assume the availability of each speaker's activity timestamps during training, and leverage them to improve the training of unsupervised CTRnet. Evaluation results on a simulated two-speaker CTR task and on a real-recorded conversational speech separation and recognition task show the effectiveness and potential of CTRnet.</description>

      <title>Quality-Aware Task Offloading for Cooperative Perception in Vehicular Edge Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Task offloading in Vehicular Edge Computing (VEC) can advance cooperative perception (CP) to improve traffic awareness in Autonomous Vehicles. In this paper, we propose the Quality-aware Cooperative Perception Task Offloading (QCPTO) scheme. Q-CPTO is the first task offloading scheme that enhances traffic awareness by prioritizing the quality rather than the quantity of cooperative perception. Q-CPTO improves the quality of CP by curtailing perception redundancy and increasing the Value of Information (VOI) procured by each user. We use Kalman filters (KFs) for VOI assessment, predicting the next movement of each vehicle to estimate its region of interest. The estimated VOI is then integrated into the task offloading problem. We formulate the task offloading problem as an Integer Linear Program (ILP) that maximizes the VOI of users and reduces perception redundancy by leveraging the spatially diverse fields of view (FOVs) of vehicles, while adhering to strict latency requirements. We also propose the Q-CPTO-Heuristic (Q-CPTOH) scheme to solve the task offloading problem in a time-efficient manner. Extensive evaluations show that Q-CPTO significantly outperforms prominent task offloading schemes by up to 14% and 20% in terms of response delay and traffic awareness, respectively. Furthermore, Q-CPTO-H closely approaches the optimal solution, with marginal gaps of up to 1.4% and 2.1% in terms of traffic awareness and the number of collaborating users, respectively, while reducing the runtime by up to 84%.</description>

      <title>Beaconless Auto-Alignment for Single-Wavelength 5 Tbit/s Mode-Division Multiplexing Free-Space Optical Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mode-division multiplexing has shown its ability to significantly increase the capacity of free-space optical communications. An accurate alignment is crucial to enable such links due to possible performance degradation induced by mode crosstalk and narrow beam divergence. Conventionally, a beacon beam is necessary for system alignment due to multiple local maximums in the mode-division multiplexed beam profile. However, the beacon beam introduces excess system complexity, power consumption, and alignment errors. Here we demonstrate a beaconless system with significantly higher alignment accuracy and faster acquisition. This system also excludes excess complexity, power consumption, and alignment errors, facilitating simplified system calibration and supporting a record-high 5.14 Tbit/s line rate in a single-wavelength free-space optical link. We anticipate our paper to be a starting point for more sophisticated alignment scenarios in future multi-Terabit mode-division multiplexing free-space optical communications for long-distance applications with a generalised mode basis.</description>

      <title>Waveform Design for Over-the-Air Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In response to the increasing number of devices anticipated in next-generation networks, a shift toward over-the-air (OTA) computing has been proposed. Leveraging the superposition of multiple access channels, OTA computing enables efficient resource management by supporting simultaneous uncoded transmission in the time and the frequency domain. Thus, to advance the integration of OTA computing, our study presents a theoretical analysis addressing practical issues encountered in current digital communication transceivers, such as time sampling error and intersymbol interference (ISI). To this end, we examine the theoretical mean squared error (MSE) for OTA transmission under time sampling error and ISI, while also exploring methods for minimizing the MSE in the OTA transmission. Utilizing alternating optimization, we also derive optimal power policies for both the devices and the base station. Additionally, we propose a novel deep neural network (DNN)-based approach to design waveforms enhancing OTA transmission performance under time sampling error and ISI. To ensure fair comparison with existing waveforms like the raised cosine (RC) and the better-than-raised-cosine (BRTC), we incorporate a custom loss function integrating energy and bandwidth constraints, along with practical design considerations such as waveform symmetry. Simulation results validate our theoretical analysis and demonstrate performance gains of the designed pulse over RC and BTRC waveforms. To facilitate testing of our results without necessitating the DNN structure recreation, we provide curve fitting parameters for select DNN-based waveforms as well.</description>

      <title>Attention-aware Semantic Communications for Collaborative Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07217v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a communication-efficient collaborative inference framework in the domain of edge inference, focusing on the efficient use of vision transformer (ViT) models. The partitioning strategy of conventional collaborative inference fails to reduce communication cost because of the inherent architecture of ViTs maintaining consistent layer dimensions across the entire transformer encoder. Therefore, instead of employing the partitioning strategy, our framework utilizes a lightweight ViT model on the edge device, with the server deploying a complicated ViT model. To enhance communication efficiency and achieve the classification accuracy of the server model, we propose two strategies: 1) attention-aware patch selection and 2) entropy-aware image transmission. Attention-aware patch selection leverages the attention scores generated by the edge device's transformer encoder to identify and select the image patches critical for classification. This strategy enables the edge device to transmit only the essential patches to the server, significantly improving communication efficiency. Entropy-aware image transmission uses min-entropy as a metric to accurately determine whether to depend on the lightweight model on the edge device or to request the inference from the server model. In our framework, the lightweight ViT model on the edge device acts as a semantic encoder, efficiently identifying and selecting the crucial image information required for the classification task. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed collaborative inference framework can reduce communication overhead by 68% with only a minimal loss in accuracy compared to the server model on the ImageNet dataset.</description>

      <title>Spiketrum: An FPGA-based Implementation of a Neuromorphic Cochlea</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15923v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel FPGA-based neuromorphic cochlea, leveraging the general-purpose spike-coding algorithm, Spiketrum. The focus of this study is on the development and characterization of this cochlea model, which excels in transforming audio vibrations into biologically realistic auditory spike trains. These spike trains are designed to withstand neural fluctuations and spike losses while accurately encapsulating the spatial and precise temporal characteristics of audio, along with the intensity of incoming vibrations. Noteworthy features include the ability to generate real-time spike trains with minimal information loss and the capacity to reconstruct original signals. This fine-tuning capability allows users to optimize spike rates, achieving an optimal balance between output quality and power consumption. Furthermore, the integration of a feedback system into Spiketrum enables selective amplification of specific features while attenuating others, facilitating adaptive power consumption based on application requirements. The hardware implementation supports both spike-based and non-spike-based processors, making it versatile for various computing systems. The cochlea's ability to encode diverse sensory information, extending beyond sound waveforms, positions it as a promising sensory input for current and future spike-based intelligent computing systems, offering compact and real-time spike train generation.</description>

      <title>Application based Evaluation of an Efficient Spike-Encoder, "Spiketrum"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15927v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spike-based encoders represent information as sequences of spikes or pulses, which are transmitted between neurons. A prevailing consensus suggests that spike-based approaches demonstrate exceptional capabilities in capturing the temporal dynamics of neural activity and have the potential to provide energy-efficient solutions for low-power applications. The Spiketrum encoder efficiently compresses input data using spike trains or code sets (for non-spiking applications) and is adaptable to both hardware and software implementations, with lossless signal reconstruction capability. The paper proposes and assesses Spiketrum's hardware, evaluating its output under varying spike rates and its classification performance with popular spiking and non-spiking classifiers, and also assessing the quality of information compression and hardware resource utilization. The paper extensively benchmarks both Spiketrum hardware and its software counterpart against state-of-the-art, biologically-plausible encoders. The evaluations encompass benchmarking criteria, including classification accuracy, training speed, and sparsity when using encoder outputs in pattern recognition and classification with both spiking and non-spiking classifiers. Additionally, they consider encoded output entropy and hardware resource utilization and power consumption of the hardware version of the encoders. Results demonstrate Spiketrum's superiority in most benchmarking criteria, making it a promising choice for various applications. It efficiently utilizes hardware resources with low power consumption, achieving high classification accuracy. This work also emphasizes the potential of encoders in spike-based processing to improve the efficiency and performance of neural computing systems.</description>

      <title>Anatomical Region Recognition and Real-time Bone Tracking Methods by Dynamically Decoding A-Mode Ultrasound Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19542v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate bone tracking is crucial for kinematic analysis in orthopedic surgery and prosthetic robotics. Traditional methods (e.g., skin markers) are subject to soft tissue artifacts, and the bone pins used in surgery introduce the risk of additional trauma and infection. For electromyography (EMG), its inability to directly measure joint angles requires complex algorithms for kinematic estimation. To address these issues, A-mode ultrasound-based tracking has been proposed as a non-invasive and safe alternative. However, this approach suffers from limited accuracy in peak detection when processing received ultrasound signals. To build a precise and real-time bone tracking approach, this paper introduces a deep learning-based method for anatomical region recognition and bone tracking using A-mode ultrasound signals, specifically focused on the knee joint. The algorithm is capable of simultaneously performing bone tracking and identifying the anatomical region where the A-mode ultrasound transducer is placed. It contains the fully connection between all encoding and decoding layers of the cascaded U-Nets to focus only on the signal region that is most likely to have the bone peak, thus pinpointing the exact location of the peak and classifying the anatomical region of the signal. The experiment showed a 97% accuracy in the classification of the anatomical regions and a precision of around 0.5$\pm$1mm under dynamic tracking conditions for various anatomical areas surrounding the knee joint. In general, this approach shows great potential beyond the traditional method, in terms of the accuracy achieved and the recognition of the anatomical region where the ultrasound has been attached as an additional functionality.</description>

Abstract: Advancements in neural engineering have enabled the development of Robotic Prosthetic Hands (RPHs) aimed at restoring hand functionality. Current commercial RPHs offer limited control through basic on/off commands. Recent progresses in machine learning enable finger movement decoding with higher degrees of freedom, yet the high computational complexity of such models limits their application in portable devices. Future RPH designs must balance portability, low power consumption, and high decoding accuracy to be practical for individuals with disabilities. To this end, we introduce a novel attractor-based neural network to realize on-chip movement decoding for next-generation portable RPHs. The proposed architecture comprises an encoder, an attention layer, an attractor network, and a refinement regressor. We tested our model on four healthy subjects and achieved a decoding accuracy of 80.3%. Our proposed model is over 120 and 50 times more compact compared to state-of-the-art LSTM and CNN models, respectively, with comparable (or superior) decoding accuracy. Therefore, it exhibits minimal hardware complexity and can be effectively integrated as a System-on-Chip.</description>

Abstract: Many real-world systems can be represented as graphs where the different entities in the system are presented by nodes and their interactions by edges. An important task in studying large datasets with graphical structure is graph clustering. While there has been a lot of work on graph clustering using the connectivity between the nodes, many real-world networks also have node attributes. Clustering attributed graphs requires joint modeling of graph structure and node attributes. Recent work has focused on combining these two complementary sources of information through graph convolutional networks and graph filtering. However, these methods are mostly limited to lowpass filtering and do not explicitly learn the filter parameters for the clustering task. In this paper, we introduce a graph signal processing based approach, where we learn the parameters of Finite Impulse Response (FIR) and Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA) graph filters optimized for clustering. The proposed approach is formulated as a two-step iterative optimization problem, focusing on learning interpretable graph filters that are optimal for the given data and that maximize the separation between different clusters. The proposed approach is evaluated on attributed networks and compared to the state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Primal Dual Continual Learning: Balancing Stability and Plasticity through Adaptive Memory Allocation</title>

Abstract: Continual learning is inherently a constrained learning problem. The goal is to learn a predictor under a no-forgetting requirement. Although several prior studies formulate it as such, they do not solve the constrained problem explicitly. In this work, we show that it is both possible and beneficial to undertake the constrained optimization problem directly. To do this, we leverage recent results in constrained learning through Lagrangian duality. We focus on memory-based methods, where a small subset of samples from previous tasks can be stored in a replay buffer. In this setting, we analyze two versions of the continual learning problem: a coarse approach with constraints at the task level and a fine approach with constraints at the sample level. We show that dual variables indicate the sensitivity of the optimal value of the continual learning problem with respect to constraint perturbations. We then leverage this result to partition the buffer in the coarse approach, allocating more resources to harder tasks, and to populate the buffer in the fine approach, including only impactful samples. We derive a deviation bound on dual variables as sensitivity indicators, and empirically corroborate this result in diverse continual learning benchmarks. We also discuss the limitations of these methods with respect to the amount of memory available and the expressiveness of the parametrization.</description>

      <title>Quality of Service-Constrained Online Routing in High Throughput Satellites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07557</link>

Abstract: High throughput satellites (HTSs) outpace traditional satellites due to their multi-beam transmission. The rise of low Earth orbit mega constellations amplifies HTS data rate demands to terabits/second with acceptable latency. This surge in data rate necessitates multiple modems, often exceeding single device capabilities. Consequently, satellites employ several processors, forming a complex packet-switch network. This can lead to potential internal congestion and challenges in adhering to strict quality of service (QoS) constraints. While significant research exists on constellation-level routing, a literature gap remains on the internal routing within a single HTS. The intricacy of this internal network architecture presents a significant challenge to achieve high data rates.
  This paper introduces an online optimal flow allocation and scheduling method for HTSs. The problem is presented as a multi-commodity flow instance with different priority data streams. An initial full time horizon model is proposed as a benchmark. We apply a model predictive control (MPC) approach to enable adaptive routing based on current information and the forecast within the prediction time horizon while allowing for deviation of the latter. Importantly, MPC is inherently suited to handle uncertainty in incoming flows. Our approach minimizes the packet loss by optimally and adaptively managing the priority queue schedulers and flow exchanges between satellite processing modules. Central to our method is a routing model focusing on optimal priority scheduling to enhance data rates and maintain QoS. The model's stages are critically evaluated, and results are compared to traditional methods via numerical simulations. Through simulations, our method demonstrates performance nearly on par with the hindsight optimum, showcasing its efficiency and adaptability in addressing satellite communication challenges.</description>

      <title>Non-asymptotic Convergence of Discrete-time Diffusion Models: New Approach and Improved Rate</title>

Abstract: The denoising diffusion model has recently emerged as a powerful generative technique that converts noise into data. While there are many studies providing theoretical guarantees for diffusion processes based on discretized stochastic differential equation (D-SDE), many generative samplers in real applications directly employ a discrete-time (DT) diffusion process. However, there are very few studies analyzing these DT processes, e.g., convergence for DT diffusion processes has been obtained only for distributions with bounded support. In this paper, we establish the convergence guarantee for substantially larger classes of distributions under DT diffusion processes and further improve the convergence rate for distributions with bounded support. In particular, we first establish the convergence rates for both smooth and general (possibly non-smooth) distributions having a finite second moment. We then specialize our results to a number of interesting classes of distributions with explicit parameter dependencies, including distributions with Lipschitz scores, Gaussian mixture distributions, and any distributions with early-stopping. We further propose a novel accelerated sampler and show that it improves the convergence rates of the corresponding regular sampler by orders of magnitude with respect to all system parameters. Our study features a novel analytical technique that constructs a tilting factor representation of the convergence error and exploits Tweedie's formula for handling Taylor expansion power terms.</description>

      <title>Cached Model-as-a-Resource: Provisioning Large Language Model Agents for Edge Intelligence in Space-air-ground Integrated Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05826</link>

Abstract: Edge intelligence in space-air-ground integrated networks (SAGINs) can enable worldwide network coverage beyond geographical limitations for users to access ubiquitous and low-latency intelligence services. Facing global coverage and complex environments in SAGINs, edge intelligence can provision approximate large language models (LLMs) agents for users via edge servers at ground base stations (BSs) or cloud data centers relayed by satellites. As LLMs with billions of parameters are pre-trained on vast datasets, LLM agents have few-shot learning capabilities, e.g., chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting for complex tasks, which raises a new trade-off between resource consumption and performance in SAGINs. In this paper, we propose a joint caching and inference framework for edge intelligence to provision sustainable and ubiquitous LLM agents in SAGINs. We introduce "cached model-as-a-resource" for offering LLMs with limited context windows and propose a novel optimization framework, i.e., joint model caching and inference, to utilize cached model resources for provisioning LLM agent services along with communication, computing, and storage resources. We design "age of thought" (AoT) considering the CoT prompting of LLMs, and propose a least AoT cached model replacement algorithm for optimizing the provisioning cost. We propose a deep Q-network-based modified second-bid (DQMSB) auction to incentivize network operators, which can enhance allocation efficiency by 23% while guaranteeing strategy-proofness and free from adverse selection.</description>
