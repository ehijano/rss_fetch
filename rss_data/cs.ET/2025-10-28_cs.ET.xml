      <title>Quantum Autoencoders for Anomaly Detection in Cybersecurity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anomaly detection in cybersecurity is a challenging task, where normal events far outnumber anomalous ones with new anomalies occurring frequently. Classical autoencoders have been used for anomaly detection, but struggles in data-limited settings which quantum counterparts can potentially overcome. In this work, we apply Quantum Autoencoders (QAEs) for anomaly detection in cybersecurity, specifically on the BPF-extended tracking honeypot (BETH) dataset. QAEs are evaluated across multiple encoding techniques, ansatz types, repetitions, and feature selection strategies. Our results demonstrate that an 8-feature QAE using Dense-Angle encoding with a RealAmplitude ansatz can outperform Classical Autoencoders (CAEs), even when trained on substantially fewer samples. The effects of quantum encoding and feature selection for developing quantum models are demonstrated and discussed. In a data-limited setting, the best performing QAE model has a F1 score of 0.87, better than that of CAE (0.77). These findings suggest that QAEs may offer practical advantages for anomaly detection in data-limited scenarios.</description>

      <title>Jenga: Responsive Tiered Memory Management without Thrashing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A heterogeneous memory has a single address space with fast access to some addresses (a fast tier of DRAM) and slow access to other addresses (a capacity tier of CXL-attached memory or NVM). A tiered memory system aims to maximize the number of accesses to the fast tier via page migrations between the fast and capacity tiers. Unfortunately, previous tiered memory systems can perform poorly due to (1) allocating hot and cold objects in the same page and (2) abrupt changes in hotness measurements that lead to thrashing.
  This paper presents Jenga, a tiered memory system that addresses both problems. Jenga's memory allocator uses a novel context-based page allocation strategy. Jenga's accurate measurements of page hotness enable it to react to memory access behavior changes in a timely manner while avoiding thrashing. Compared to the best previous tiered memory system, Jenga runs memory-intensive applications 28% faster across 10 applications, when the fast tier capacity matches the working set size, at a CPU overhead of &lt;3% of a single core and a memory overhead of &lt;0.3%</description>

      <title>Boundaries of Acceptable Defectiveness: Redefining Surface Code Robustness under Heterogeneous Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A variety of past research on superconducting qubits shows that these devices exhibit considerable variation and thus cannot be accurately depicted by a uniform noise model. To combat this often unrealistic picture of homogeneous noise in quantum processors during runtime, our work aims to define the boundaries of acceptable defectiveness (BADs), or the upper boundary of a qubits physical error, past which this defective qubit entirely degrades the logical computation and should be considered faulty and removed from the surface code mapping. Using the QEC simulation package STIM, repetition code circuits on rotated surface codes were generated, sampled, and analyzed from distances 3 to 17, with various defective error rates and outlier defect locations. In addition, we simulated heterogeneous noise models using the same parameters to test how increasingly deviated distributions of physical errors scale across code distances under realistic, heterogeneous noise models that are informed by current superconducting hardware. The results suggest that there are, in fact, boundaries of acceptable defectiveness in which a defective qubit, with a physical error rate $&lt;= .75$\%, can be left in the lattice with negligible impact on logical error rate given sufficient code distances and proper placement in the lattice. On the other hand, we find that substantial qubit variation around a seemingly acceptable physical error rate can severely degrade logical qubit performance. As a result, we propose that defectiveness of both individual qubits and the overall uniformity of lattice fidelity should not be viewed as all or nothing, but instead as a spectrum. Our research demonstrates how heterogeneity directly impacts logical error rate and provides preliminary goals and metrics for hardware designers to meet in order to achieve target logical performance with imperfect, non-uniform qubit qualities.</description>

      <title>Barriers to Integrating Low-Power IoT in Engineering Education: A Survey of the Literature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-power Internet of Things (IoT) technologies are becoming increasingly important in engineering education as a tool to help students connect theory to real applications. However, many institutions face barriers that slow down their adoption in courses and labs. This paper reviews recent studies to understand these barriers and organizes them into three groups: technical, organizational, and curricular/pedagogical. Technical barriers include energy management, scalability, and integration issues. Organizational barriers are related to cost, planning, and the need for trained staff. Curricular and pedagogical barriers include gaps in student readiness, limited lab time, and platform choices that depend on budget. By detailing these barriers with practical examples, this paper aims to help educators and academic leaders develop more effective strategies to adopt low-power IoT in engineering programs.</description>

      <title>qc-kmeans: A Quantum Compressive K-Means Algorithm for NISQ Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Clustering on NISQ hardware is constrained by data loading and limited qubits. We present \textbf{qc-kmeans}, a hybrid compressive $k$-means that summarizes a dataset with a constant-size Fourier-feature sketch and selects centroids by solving small per-group QUBOs with shallow QAOA circuits. The QFF sketch estimator is unbiased with mean-squared error $O(\varepsilon^2)$ for $B,S=\Theta(\varepsilon^{-2})$, and the peak-qubit requirement $q_{\text{peak}}=\max\{D,\lceil \log_2 B\rceil + 1\}$ does not scale with the number of samples. A refinement step with elitist retention ensures non-increasing surrogate cost. In Qiskit Aer simulations (depth $p{=}1$), the method ran with $\le 9$ qubits on low-dimensional synthetic benchmarks and achieved competitive sum-of-squared errors relative to quantum baselines; runtimes are not directly comparable. On nine real datasets (up to $4.3\times 10^5$ points), the pipeline maintained constant peak-qubit usage in simulation. Under IBM noise models, accuracy was similar to the idealized setting. Overall, qc-kmeans offers a NISQ-oriented formulation with shallow, bounded-width circuits and competitive clustering quality in simulation.</description>

      <title>Atlas Urban Index: A VLM-Based Approach for Spatially and Temporally Calibrated Urban Development Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the {\em Atlas Urban Index} (AUI), a metric for measuring urban development computed using Sentinel-2 \citep{spoto2012sentinel2} satellite imagery. Existing approaches, such as the {\em Normalized Difference Built-up Index} (NDBI), often struggle to accurately capture urban development due to factors like atmospheric noise, seasonal variation, and cloud cover. These limitations hinder large-scale monitoring of human development and urbanization. To address these challenges, we propose an approach that leverages {\em Vision-Language Models }(VLMs) to provide a development score for regions. Specifically, we collect a time series of Sentinel-2 images for each region. Then, we further process the images within fixed time windows to get an image with minimal cloud cover, which serves as the representative image for that time window. To ensure consistent scoring, we adopt two strategies: (i) providing the VLM with a curated set of reference images representing different levels of urbanization, and (ii) supplying the most recent past image to both anchor temporal consistency and mitigate cloud-related noise in the current image. Together, these components enable AUI to overcome the challenges of traditional urbanization indices and produce more reliable and stable development scores. Our qualitative experiments on Bangalore suggest that AUI outperforms standard indices such as NDBI.</description>

      <title>IoT-Driven Smart Management in Broiler Farming: Simulation of Remote Sensing and Control Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parameter monitoring and control systems are crucial in the industry as they enable automation processes that improve productivity and resource optimization. These improvements also help to manage environmental factors and the complex interactions between multiple inputs and outputs required for production management. This paper proposes an automation system for broiler management based on a simulation scenario that involves sensor networks and embedded systems. The aim is to create a transmission network for monitoring and controlling broiler temperature and feeding using the Internet of Things (IoT), complemented by a dashboard and a cloud-based service database to track improvements in broiler management. We look forward this work will serve as a guide for stakeholders and entrepreneurs in the animal production industry, fostering sustainable development through simple and cost-effective automation solutions. The goal is for them to scale and integrate these recommendations into their existing operations, leading to more efficient decision-making at the management level.</description>

      <title>AutoStreamPipe: LLM Assisted Automatic Generation of Data Stream Processing Pipelines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data pipelines are essential in stream processing as they enable the efficient collection, processing, and delivery of real-time data, supporting rapid data analysis. In this paper, we present AutoStreamPipe, a novel framework that employs Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate the design, generation, and deployment of stream processing pipelines. AutoStreamPipe bridges the semantic gap between high-level user intent and platform-specific implementations across distributed stream processing systems for structured multi-agent reasoning by integrating a Hypergraph of Thoughts (HGoT) as an extended version of GoT. AutoStreamPipe combines resilient execution strategies, advanced query analysis, and HGoT to deliver pipelines with good accuracy. Experimental evaluations on diverse pipelines demonstrate that AutoStreamPipe significantly reduces development time (x6.3) and error rates (x5.19), as measured by a novel Error-Free Score (EFS), compared to LLM code-generation methods.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Computing Optimization of Complex Spin-Glass Topologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin glass systems as lattices of disordered magnets with random interactions have important implications within the theory of magnetization and applications to a wide-range of hard combinatorial optimization problems. Nevertheless, despite sustained efforts, algorithms that attain both high accuracy and efficiency remain elusive. Due to their topologies being low-$k$-partite such systems are well suited to a probabilistic computing (PC) approach using probabilistic bits (P-bits). Here we present complex spin glass topologies solved on a simulated PC realization of an Ising machine. First, we considered a number of three dimensional Edwards-Anderson cubic spin-glasses randomly generated as well as found in the literature as a benchmark. Second, biclique topologies were identified as a likely candidate for a comparative advantage compared to other state-of-the-art techniques, with a range of sizes simulated. We find that the number of iterations necessary to find solutions of a given quality has constant scaling with system size past a saturation point if one assumes perfect parallelization of the hardware. Therefore a PC architecture can trade the computational depth of other methods for parallelized width by connecting a number of P-bits that scales linearly in system size. This constant scaling is shown to persist across a number of solution qualities, up to a certain limit beyond which resource constraints limited further investigation. The saturation point varies between topologies and qualities and becomes exponentially hard in the limit of finding the ground truth. Furthermore we demonstrate that our PC architecture can solve spin-glass topologies to the same quality as the most advanced quantum annealer in minutes, making modest assumptions about their implementation on hardware.</description>

      <title>Building Network Digital Twins Part II: Real-Time Adaptive PID for Enhanced State Synchronization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20753v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As we evolve towards more heterogeneous and cutting-edge mobile networks, Network Digital Twins (NDTs) are proving to be a promising paradigm in solving challenges faced by network operators, as they give a possibility of replicating the physical network operations and testing scenarios separately without interfering with the live network. However, with mobile networks becoming increasingly dynamic and heterogeneous due to massive device connectivity, replicating traffic and having NDTs synchronized in real-time with the physical network remains a challenge, thus necessitating the need to develop real-time adaptive mechanisms to bridge this gap. In this part II of our work, we implement a novel framework that integrates an adaptive Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller to dynamically improve synchronization. Additionally, through an interactive user interface, results of our enhanced approach demonstrate an improvement in real-time traffic synchronization.</description>

      <title>MI9: An Integrated Runtime Governance Framework for Agentic AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03858v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Agentic AI systems capable of reasoning, planning, and executing actions present fundamentally distinct governance challenges compared to traditional AI models. Unlike conventional AI, these systems exhibit emergent and unexpected behaviors during runtime, introducing novel agent-related risks that cannot be fully anticipated through pre-deployment governance alone. To address this critical gap, we introduce MI9, the first fully integrated runtime governance framework designed specifically for safety and alignment of agentic AI systems. MI9 introduces real-time controls through six integrated components: agency-risk index, agent-semantic telemetry capture, continuous authorization monitoring, Finite-State-Machine (FSM)-based conformance engines, goal-conditioned drift detection, and graduated containment strategies. Operating transparently across heterogeneous agent architectures, MI9 enables the systematic, safe, and responsible deployment of agentic systems in production environments where conventional governance approaches fall short, providing the foundational infrastructure for safe agentic AI deployment at scale. Detailed analysis through a diverse set of scenarios demonstrates MI9's systematic coverage of governance challenges that existing approaches fail to address, establishing the technical foundation for comprehensive agentic AI oversight.</description>
