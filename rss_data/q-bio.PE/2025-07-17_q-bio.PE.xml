      <title>Interacting Hosts with Microbiome Exchange: An Extension of Metacommunity Theory for Discrete Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microbiomes, which are collections of interacting microbes in an environment, often substantially impact the environmental patches or living hosts that they occupy. In microbiome models, it is important to consider both the local dynamics within an environment and exchanges of microbiomes between environments. One way to incorporate these and other interactions across multiple scales is to employ metacommunity theory. Metacommunity models commonly assume continuous microbiome dispersal between the environments in which local microbiome dynamics occur. Under this assumption, a single parameter between each pair of environments controls the dispersal rate between those environments. This metacommunity framework is well-suited to abiotic environmental patches, but it fails to capture an essential aspect of the microbiomes of living hosts, which generally do not interact continuously with each other. Instead, living hosts interact with each other in discrete time intervals. In this paper, we develop a modeling framework that encodes such discrete interactions and uses two parameters to separately control the interaction frequencies between hosts and the amount of microbiome exchange during each interaction. We derive analytical approximations of models in our framework in three parameter regimes and prove that they are accurate in those regimes. We compare these approximations to numerical simulations for an illustrative model. We demonstrate that both parameters in our modeling framework are necessary to determine microbiome dynamics. Key features of the dynamics, such as microbiome convergence across hosts, depend sensitively on the interplay between interaction frequency and strength.</description>

      <title>Detection of evolutionary shifts in variance under an Ornsten-Uhlenbeck model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17480v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sudden changes in environmental conditions can lead to evolutionary shifts not only in the optimal trait value, but also in the diffusion variance under the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) model. While several methods have been developed to detect shifts in optimal values, few explicitly account for concurrent shifts in both evolutionary variance and diffusion variance. We use a multi-optima and multi-variance OU model to describe trait evolution with shifts in both optimal value and diffusion variance and analyze how covariance between species is affected when shifts in variance occur along the phylogeny. We propose a new method that simultaneously detects shifts in both variance and optimal values by formulating the problem as a variable selection task using an L1-penalized loss function. Our method is implemented in the R package ShiVa (Detection of evolutionary shifts in variance). Through simulations, we compare ShiVa with existing methods that can automatically detect evolutionary shifts under the OU model (l1ou, PhylogeneticEM, and PCMFit). Our method demonstrates improved predictive ability and significantly reduces false positives in detecting optimal value shifts when variance shifts are present. When only shifts in optimal value occur, our method performs comparably to existing approaches. We apply ShiVa to empirical data on floral diameter in Euphorbiaceae and buccal morphology in Centrarchidae sunfishes.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Egg Quiescence on the Efficacy of Wolbachia-Infected Mosquito Releases for Arbovirus Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08217v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An ordinary differential model is proposed to understand the role of egg quiescence on the efficacy of releasing Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes to control arbovirus transmission. The model admits up to five equilibrium points and four biologically meaningful scenarios: extinction of both populations; persistence of the uninfected population with extinction of the infected one; persistence of the infected population with extinction of the uninfected one; and coexistence of both populations. This occurs because the coexistence scenario allows for bistability in the system. A sensitivity analysis shows that mosquitoes optimize their fitness by adjusting the quiescence rate. Because Wolbachia-infected eggs do not survive quiescence, or the adults that emerge are infertile, quiescence negatively impacts the fitness of infected mosquitoes, thereby reducing the prevalence of infection in the mosquito population. This increases the chance of encountering an uninfected mosquito, which is more likely to carry the dengue virus compared to a Wolbachia-infected one, potentially increasing the risk of dengue transmission during or after environmental stress that triggers quiescence. More importantly, quiescence can compromise the establishment of infection within the mosquito population by increasing the number of infected mosquitoes required during the release period. Therefore, the use of Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes to control arbovirus transmission in regions where quiescence occurs at a high rate can be jeopardized.</description>
