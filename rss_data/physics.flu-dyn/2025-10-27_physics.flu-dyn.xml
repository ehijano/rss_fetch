      <title>Spiral Wave Solutions in Water Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiral wave solutions are found in linear and weakly nonlinear irrotational water wave equations. These unsteady spiral waves evolve from suitable initial conditions; they are not induced by external forcing. In the linear case, a long-time asymptotic result is obtained via the method of stationary phase. The asymptotic approximation is found to be in good agreement with the exact solution and reveals hyperbolic spiral structure. Numerical simulations show that these spiral waves persist in the presence of weak nonlinearity. While spiral solutions are frequently found in excitable media governed by reaction-diffusion systems, they comprise a new class of interesting two space one time dimensional solutions in fundamental linear and nonlinear dispersive wave systems.</description>

      <title>Air-driven dynamics of viscoplastic liquid layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Airway clearance by coughing is a key mechanism for mucus transport, particularly in obstructive lung diseases associated with altered mucus rheology. We investigate the dynamics of a viscoplastic liquid film driven by flow in a turbulent air layer, which is a model for air-driven mucus transport that incorporates yield-stress effects. Our theoretical analysis is based on a long-wave model for the liquid film flow, and we complement this with experiments, in which layers of Newtonian and yield-stress liquids are exposed to air flow in a rectangular duct. We demonstrate how perturbations to the layer depth can lead to localised yielding and wave generation. Rapid wave growth occurs when the fluid ahead of the oncoming wave is unyielded, so that as the wave propagates, it consumes this static fluid while depositing a much thinner film behind. This mechanism causes dramatic "blow-out" events in experiments, where liquid hits the roof of the tank. By contrast, in Newtonian thin films, multiple surface waves typically form, and blow-out only occurs in experiments when a Newtonian film is sufficiently thick.</description>

      <title>Sparse surface pressure-based reconstruction of the flow around a thick airfoil over a range of angles of attack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an efficient neural-based approach to estimate the instantaneous flow field around an airfoil from limited surface pressure measurements. The model, denoted SNN-POD, relies on two independent shallow neural networks to predict the instantaneous flow over a wide range of angles of attack [10{\textdegree},20{\textdegree}]. At all angles the global model correctly recovers the average characteristics of the flow from single-time sensor data, thus allowing combination with local, angle-dependent models. The method is applied to 2D URANS simulations of a thick airfoil at a Reynolds number of Re=4.5e6. The training set consists of snapshots obtained from a coarse sampling (1-2{\textdegree}) of the angle of attack range. A variance-based criterion is used to determine the number and positions of sensors. Tests are carried out for unseen snapshots at angles of attack within the set (sampled angles) as well as outside the set (interpolated angles). The maximum MSE error of attack for sampled and interpolated angles is respectively 2.9% and 6.6%. This makes it possible to develop adaptive strategies to improve the estimation if necessary.</description>

      <title>Statistics of near-inertial waves over a background flow via quantum and statistical mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the interaction of an initially uniform near-inertial wave (NIW) field with a steady background flow, with the goal of predicting the subsequent organization of the wave field. To wit, we introduce an exact analogy between the Young Ben Jelloul (YBJ) equation and the quantum dynamics of a charged particle in a steady electromagnetic field, whose potentials are expressed in terms of the background flow. We derive the time-averaged spatial distributions of wave kinetic energy, potential energy and Stokes drift in two asymptotic limits. In the `strongly quantum' limit where the background flow is weak compared to wave dispersion, we compute the wave statistics by extending a strong-dispersion expansion initially introduced by YBJ. In the `quasi-classical' limit where the background flow is strong compared to wave dispersion, we compute the wave statistics by leveraging the equilibrium statistical mechanics of classical systems. We compare our predictions to numerical simulations of the YBJ equation, using an instantaneous snapshot from a two-dimensional turbulent flow as the steady background flow. The agreement is very good in both limits. In particular, we quantitatively describe the preferential concentration of NIW energy in anticyclones. We predict weak NIW concentration in both asymptotic limits of weak and strong background flow, and maximal anticyclonic concentration for background flows of intermediate strength, providing theoretical underpinning to observations reported by Danioux, Vanneste and B\"uhler (Journal of Fluid Mechanics, 773, 2015).</description>

      <title>On the Propulsion of a Rigid Body in a Viscous Liquid Under the Action of a Time-Periodic Force</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A rigid body $\mathcal{B}$ moves in an otherwise quiescent viscous liquid filling the whole space outside $\mathcal{B}$, under the action of a time-periodic force $\boldsymbol{\mathsf{f}}$ of period $T$ applied to a given point of $\mathcal{B}$ and of fixed direction. We assume that the average of $\boldsymbol{\mathsf{f}}$ over an interval of length $T$ does not not vanish, and that the amplitude, $\delta$, of $\boldsymbol{\mathsf{f}}$ is sufficiently small. Our goal is to investigate when $\mathcal{B}$ executes a non-zero net motion; that is, $\mathcal{B}$ is able to cover any prescribed distance in a finite time. We show that, at the order $\delta$, this happens if and only if $\boldsymbol{\mathsf{f}}$ and $\mathcal{B}$ satisfy a certain condition. We also show that this is always the case if $\mathcal{B}$ is prevented from spinning. Finally, we provide explicit examples where the condition above is satisfied or not. All our analysis is performed in a general class of weak solutions to the coupled system body-liquid problem.</description>

      <title>On the Propulsion of a Rigid Body in a Viscous Liquid by Time-Periodic Force with a Zero Average</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform analytical and numerical analyses of the propulsion of a rigid body in a viscous fluid subjected to a periodic force with zero average over a period. This general formulation specifically addresses the significant case, where propulsion is generated by the oscillation of a mass located in an internal cavity of the body. We provide a rigorous proof of the necessary and sufficient conditions for propulsion at the second order of magnitude of the force. These conditions are implemented and confirmed by numerical tests for bodies without fore-and-aft symmetry, while they are silent for bodies with such symmetry, like round ellipsoids. Consequently, in this case, propulsion can only occur at an order higher than the second. This problem is investigated by numerically integrating the entire set of equations, and the result shows that, in fact, propulsion does occur, thus opening new avenues for further analytical studies.</description>

      <title>Chocolate suspensions as a model for jamming and nonlinear rheology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the rheology of dark chocolate pastes in both industrially relevant pre-refined form and simplified model systems. Steady and oscillatory shear experiments reveal yielding, pronounced shear-thinning, and stress-dependent hysteresis governed by solid loading. Fitting the viscosity data with the Maron-Pierce model provides stress-dependent maximum flowable fractions $\phi_{\rm{m}}(\sigma)$, defining yield loci in the $(\phi, \sigma)$ plane. Their variation with stress quantifies the coupled roles of friction and adhesion in setting flow limits. Large-amplitude oscillatory shear tests characterize transitions from elastic to viscous behavior and identify distinct recovery pathways near jamming. Contact-stress decomposition separates hydrodynamic and frictional contributions, confirming that adhesive contact networks dominate stress transmission in pre-refined pastes. These results establish chocolate pastes as dense, adhesive suspensions whose flow is controlled by the interplay of friction and adhesion, offering quantitative benchmarks for constitutive modeling and linking chocolate processing to the broader physics of constraint rheology.</description>

      <title>Normality-based analysis of multiscale velocity gradients and energy transfer in direct and large-eddy simulations of isotropic turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19356v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Symmetry-based analyses of multiscale velocity gradients highlight that strain self-amplification (SS) and vortex stretching (VS) drive forward energy transfer in turbulent flows. By contrast, a strain-vorticity covariance mechanism produces backscatter that contributes to the bottleneck effect in the subinertial range of the energy cascade. We extend these analyses by using a normality-based decomposition of filtered velocity gradients in forced isotropic turbulence to distinguish contributions from normal straining, pure shearing and rigid rotation at a given scale. Our analysis of direct numerical simulation (DNS) data illuminates the importance of shear layers in the inertial range and (especially) the subinertial range of the cascade. Shear layers contribute significantly to SS and VS and play a dominant role in the backscatter mechanism responsible for the bottleneck effect. Our concurrent analysis of large-eddy simulation (LES) data characterizes how different closure models affect the flow structure and energy transfer throughout the resolved scales. We thoroughly demonstrate that the multiscale flow features produced by a mixed model closely resemble those in a filtered DNS, whereas the features produced by an eddy viscosity model resemble those in an unfiltered DNS at a lower Reynolds number. This analysis helps explain how small-scale shear layers, whose imprint is mitigated upon filtering, amplify the artificial bottleneck effect produced by the eddy viscosity model in the inertial range of the cascade. Altogether, the present results provide a refined interpretation of the flow structures and mechanisms underlying the energy cascade and insight for designing and evaluating LES closure models.</description>

      <title>Computational Modelling of Thixotropic Multiphase Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02766v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multiphase systems are ubiquitous in engineering, biology, and materials science, where understanding their complex interactions and rheological behavior is crucial for advancing applications ranging from emulsion stability to cellular phase separation. This study presents a numerical methodology for modeling thixotropic multiphase fluids, emphasizing the transient behavior of viscosity and the intricate interactions between phases. The model incorporates phase-dependent viscosities, interfacial tension effects, and the dynamics of phase separation, coalescence, and break-up, making it suitable for simulating systems with complex flow regimes. A key feature of the methodology is its ability to capture thixotropic behavior, where viscosity evolves over time due to microstructural changes induced by shear history. This approach enables the simulation of aging and recovery processes in materials such as gels, emulsions, and biological tissues. The model is rigorously validated against benchmark cases, demonstrating its accuracy in predicting multiphase systems under static and dynamic conditions. Subsequently, the methodology is applied to investigate systems with varying levels of microstructural evolution, revealing the impact of thixotropic dynamics on overall system behavior. The results provide new insights into the time-dependent rheology of multiphase fluids and highlight the versatility of the model for applications in industrial and biological systems involving complex fluid interactions.</description>

      <title>Polydisperse collision kernels in droplet-laden turbulence with implications for rain formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15326v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The collision kernel of droplets in warm clouds is a crucially important quantity for the parameterization of precipitation in weather and climate models. Nevertheless, its accurate representation remains a challenge, specifically in the bottleneck range $15\,\mu\text{m}&lt;r&lt;40\,\mu\text{m}$, within which turbulence is believed to be a key contributor to droplet growth. In this work, we address this problem by performing direct numerical simulations of polydisperse inertial particles suspended in three-dimensional turbulence at Reynolds number $Re_\lambda=418$. Collision statistics are obtained for droplet pairs across the Stokes number range $St\in[0.02,2]$. Our analysis reveals that polydispersity enhances collisions between light droplets through differential sampling, but attenuates collisions at larger Stokes numbers by rapidly reducing the spatial overlap of droplet clusters. We quantify and discuss this decorrelating effect in bidisperse clustering and compare our DNS results with the model of Onishi &amp; Seifert [Atmos. Chem. Phys. 16, 12441 (2016)]. A novel phenomenological parameterization for the collision kernel is proposed, showing significant improvements in the predictions for the bidisperse case. Finally, we study the broadening of droplet size distributions due to turbulence and demonstrate the influence of fluctuations of the dissipation rate on accelerated droplet growth.</description>

      <title>Reduced-order modeling of large-scale turbulence using Koopman $\beta$-variational autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18754v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reduced-order models (ROM) are very popular for surrogate modeling of full-order computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, allowing for real-time approximation of complex flow phenomena. However, their application to CFD models including large eddy simulation (LES) and direct numerical simulaton (DNS) is limited due to the highly chaotic and multi-scale nature of resolved turbulent flow. Due to the large amounts of noise present in small-scale turbulent structures, error propagation becomes a major issue, making long-term prediction of unsteady flow infeasible. While linear subspace methods like dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) can be used to pre-process turbulent flow data to remove small-scale structures, this often requires a very large number of modes and a non-trivial mode selection process. In this work, a ROM framework using Koopman $\beta$-variational autoencoders ($\beta$-VAEs) is introduced for reduced-order modeling of large-scale turbulence. The Koopman operator captures the variation of a non-linear dynamical system through a linear representation of state observables. By constraining the latent space of a $\beta$-VAE to grow linearly using a Koopman-inspired loss function, small-scale turbulent structures are filtered out in reconstructions of input data and latent variables are denoised in an unsupervised manner so that they can be sufficiently modeled over time. Combined with a long short-term memory (LSTM) ensemble for time series prediction of latent variables, the model is tested on LES flow past a Windsor body at multiple yaw angles, showing that the Koopman $\beta$-VAE can effectively denoise latent variables and remove small-scale structures from reconstructions while acting globally over multiple cases.</description>
