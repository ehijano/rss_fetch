      <title>Measurement of coincident photon-initiated processes in ultra-peripheral Pb+Pb collisions with the ATLAS detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Lorentz-contracted electromagnetic fields of the ions in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions generate intense quasi-real photon fluxes. These lead to photon-induced interactions that are observed in ultra-peripheral collisions (UPCs), such as vector meson and lepton-pair production. The high photon flux also enables the occurrence of multiple photon-induced processes in a single collision. Presented is the first measurement of the coincident production of $\gamma\gamma \rightarrow \mu^{+}\mu^{-}$ and $\gamma+A\rightarrow\rho^{0}+A$ in UPC Pb+Pb collisions at centre-of-mass energies of 5.02 TeV and 5.36 TeV with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. The rate of the coincident process relative to the exclusive $\gamma\gamma \rightarrow \mu^{+}\mu^{-}$ process is measured differentially in intervals of forward event activity, quantified by the Zero Degree Calorimeters. The relative rate, summed over forward event activity, for the coincident $\rho^{0}$ production is measured to be $(9.3\,\pm0.4\,\mathrm{(stat.)}\,\pm0.2\,\mathrm{(syst.)})\times10^{-3}$. Correlations between the dimuon kinematic properties, such as its mass, and the coincident $\rho^{0}$ meson production rate, are also presented. These measurements confirm the presence of multi photon-induced processes in UPC collisions, and can provide new insight into the impact parameter dependence of photon-induced vector meson production.</description>

      <title>High-order fluctuations of temperature in hot QCD matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the temperature fluctuations in hot quantum chromodynamics (QCD) matter. A new thermodynamic state function is introduced to describe the mean transverse momentum fluctuations of charged particles in heavy-ion collisions, enabling analytic expressions for the temperature fluctuations of different orders. This formalism is applied to the QCD thermodynamics described by a 2+1 flavor low energy effective field theory within the functional renormalization group approach. It is found that the temperature fluctuations are suppressed remarkably as the matter is evolved from the phase of hadron resonance gas to the quark-gluon plasma phase with increasing temperature or baryon chemical potential, which is attributed to the significant increase of the heat capacity of matter. Furthermore, the same mechanism leads to a negative skewness in the temperature fluctuations.</description>

      <title>High efficiency quantification of $^{90}$Sr contamination in cow milk after a nuclear accident</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monitoring $^{90}$Sr contamination in milk following a nuclear accident is critical due to its radiotoxicity and calcium-mimicking behaviour, leading to accumulation in bones and teeth. This study presents a high-efficiency protocol for quantifying$^{90}$Sr in cow milk by integrating freeze-drying, high-temperature calcination, ion exchange chromatography and liquid scintillation spectroscopy (LSC). The method was validated using reference milk samples with 0.45~Bq/mL of $^{90}$Sr, achieving a chemical yield of 100 $\pm$ 2\%, ensuring near-complete recovery and accurate quantification.
  The minimum detectable activity (MDA) was estimated at 0.33 Bq/L under optimal conditions, demonstrating the protocol's sensitivity for low-level detection. A comparative analysis with existing methods centrifugation-based approaches and Dowex resin techniques revealed that our protocol outperforms in both strontium recovery and organic matter elimination. Alternative methods showed lower recovery rates (68 $\pm$ 2\% for Gu\'erin's method, 65 $\pm$6\% for Dowex resin) and suffered from procedural drawbacks, such as incomplete organic matter removal.
  Applying this methodology to compare samples from certified laboratories confirmed its robustness, with liquid scintillation spectroscopy radioactivity values doubling after 14 days, consistent with secular equilibrium between $^{90}$Sr and $^{90}$Y. While the protocol is optimized for milk, future research should explore its applicability to other food matrices. The high yield, reliability, and ease of implementation position this method as an effective tool for nuclear emergency response and routine radiological monitoring.</description>

      <title>Probing fluctuating protons using forward neutrons in soft and hard inelastic proton-nucleus scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a model for the distribution of the number of forward neutrons emitted in soft (minimum bias) and hard inelastic proton-nucleus ($pA$) scattering at the LHC. It is based on the Gribov-Glauber model for the distribution over the number of inelastic collisions (wounded nucleons) combined with a parametrization of cross section (color) fluctuations in the projectile proton, which depend on the parton momentum fraction $x_p$, and the assumption of independent neutron emissions. It allows us to qualitatively explain the ATLAS data on the ZDC energy spectra of forward neutrons emitted in dijet production in inelastic $pA$ scattering at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=8.16$ TeV.</description>

      <title>Radiative $\alpha$ capture on $^{12}$C in cluster effective field theory: short review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Study of radiative $\alpha$ capture on $^{12}$C, $^{12}$C($\alpha$,$\gamma$)$^{16}$O, in cluster effective field theory (EFT) is reviewed. A low energy EFT for $^{12}$C($\alpha$,$\gamma$)$^{16}$O at the Gamow-peak energy, $E_G=0.3$~MeV, is constructed, and the theory is first applied to the study of elastic $\alpha$-$^{12}$C scattering at low energies. The effective range parameters are fitted to the precise phase shift data of the elastic scattering and the astrophysical $S_{E1}$ factor of the $E1$ transition of $^{12}$C($\alpha$,$\gamma$)$^{16}$O at $E_G$ is estimated. For the study of the $E2$ transition of $^{12}$C($\alpha$,$\gamma$)$^{16}$O, we discuss a difficulty to determine the asymptotic normalization coefficient (ANC) of the subthreshold $2_1^+$ state of $^{16}$O from the elastic scattering data, and demonstrate the difficulty with the estimate of the astrophysical $S_{E2}$ factor of $^{12}$C($\alpha$,$\gamma$)$^{16}$O at $E_G$. We discuss the uncertainty in the estimate of the $S$ factors at $E_G$ in the present approach.</description>
