      <title>Weighted norm inequalities of various square functions and Volterra integral operators on the unit ball</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate various square functions on the unit complex ball. We prove the weighted inequalities of the Lusin area integral associated with Poisson integral in terms of $A_p$ weights for all $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$; this gives an affirmative answer to an open question raised by Segovia and Wheeden. To that end, we establish the weighted inequalities for Littlewood-Paley type square functions. As an interesting application, we obtain the weighted inequalities of the Lusin area integral associated with Bergman gradient. In addition, we get an equivalent characterization of weighted Hardy spaces by means of the Lusin area integral in the context of holomorphic functions. We also obtain the weighted inequalities for Volterra integral operators. The key ingredients of our proof involve complex analysis, Calder\'on-Zygmund theory, the local mean oscillation technique and sparse domination.</description>

      <title>Local algebraicity and localization of the Bergman kernel on Stein spaces with finite type boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On a two dimensional Stein space with isolated, normal singularities, smooth finite type boundary, and locally algebraic Bergman kernel, we establish an estimate on the type of the boundary in terms of the local algebraic degree of the Bergman kernel. As an application, we characterize two dimensional ball quotients as the only Stein spaces with smooth finite type boundary and locally rational Bergman kernel. A key ingredient in the proof of the degree estimate is a new localization result for the Bergman kernel of a pseudoconvex, finite type domain in a complex manifold.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Suppose that $F$ is a smooth and connected complex surface (not necessarily compact) containing a smooth rational curve with positive self-intersection. We prove that if there exists a non-constant meromorphic function on $F$, then the field of meromorphic functions on $F$ is isomorphic to the field of rational functions in one or two variables over $\mathbb C$.</description>

      <title>On K\"ahler manifolds with non-negative mixed curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate compact K\"ahler manifolds with non-negative or quasi-positive mixed curvature coming from a linear combination of the Ricci and holomorphic sectional curvature, which covers various notions of curvature considered in the literature. Specifically, we prove a splitting theorem, analogous to the Cheeger-Gromoll splitting theorem, for complete K\"ahler manifolds with non-negative mixed curvature containing a line, and then establish a structure theorem for compact K\"ahler manifolds with non-negative mixed curvature. We also show that the Hodge numbers of compact K\"ahler manifolds with quasi-positive mixed curvature must vanish. Both results are based on the conformal perturbation method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review the basic properties of paired operators and their adjoints, the transposed paired operators, with particular reference to commutation relations, and we study the properties of their kernels, bringing out their similarities and also, somewhat surprisingly, their stark differences. Various notions expressing different invariance properties are also reviewed and we extend to paired operators some known invariance results.</description>

Abstract: We determine a simple expression of the Picard-Fuchs system for a family of Kummer surfaces for all principally polarized Abelian surfaces. It is given by a system of linear partial differential equations in three variables of rank five. Our results are based on a Jacobian elliptic fibration on Kummer surfaces and a GKZ hypergeometric system suited to the elliptic fibration.</description>

      <title>On the existence of balanced metrics of Hodge-Riemann type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the paper we study the existence of balanced metrics of Hodge-Riemann type on non-K\"ahler complex manifolds. We first find some general obstructions, for instance that a Hodge-Riemann balanced manifold of complex dimension $n$ has to be $(n - 2)$-K\"ahler. Then, we focus on the case of compact quotients of Lie groups by lattices, endowed with an invariant complex structure. In particular, we prove non existence results on non-K\"ahler complex parallelizable manifolds and some classes of solvmanifolds, and we show that the only nilmanifolds admitting invariant structures of this type are tori. Finally, we construct the first non-K\"ahler example of a Hodge-Riemann balanced structure, on a non-compact complex manifold obtained as the product of the Iwasawa manifold by $\C$.</description>

      <title>Deformation Families of Quasi-Projective Varieties and Symmetric Projective K3 Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16208v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The main aim of this paper is to construct a complex analytic family of symmetric projective K3 surfaces through a compactifiable deformation family of complete quasi-projective varieties from $\text{CP}^2 \text{$\#$9} \overline{\text{CP}}^2$. Firstly, for an elliptic curve $C_0$ embedded in $\text{CP}^2$, let $S \cong \text{CP}^2 \text{$\#$9} \overline{\text{CP}}^2$ be the blow up of $\text{CP}^2$ at nine points on the image of $C_0$ and $C$ be the strict transform of the image. Then if the normal bundle satisfies the Diophantine condition, a tubular neighborhood of the elliptic curve $C$ can be identified through a toroidal group. Fixing the Diophantine condition, a smooth compactifiable deformation of $S\backslash C$ over a 9-dimensional complex manifold is constructed. What's more, with an ample line bundle fixed on $S$, complete K\"ahler metrics can be constructed on the quasi-projective variety $S\backslash C$. So complete K\"ahler metrics are constructed on each quasi-projective variety fiber of the smooth compactifiable deformation family. Then a complex analytic family of symmetric projective K3 surfaces over a 10-dimensional complex manifold is constructed through the smooth compactifiable deformation family of complete quasi-projective varieties and an analogue deformation family.</description>

      <title>Lauricella hypergeometric functions, unipotent fundamental groups of the punctured Riemann sphere, and their motivic coactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.06603</link>
      <description>arXiv:1907.06603v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to raise the possibility that there exists a meaningful theory of `motives' associated to certain hypergeometric integrals, viewed as functions of their parameters. It goes beyond the classical theory of motives, but should be compatible with it. Such a theory would explain a recent and surprising conjecture arising in the context of scattering amplitudes for a motivic Galois group action on Gauss' ${}_2F_1$ hypergeometric function, which we prove in this paper by direct means. More generally, we consider Lauricella hypergeometric functions and show on the one hand how the coefficients in their Taylor expansions can be promoted, via the theory of motivic fundamental groups, to motivic multiple polylogarithms. The latter are periods of ordinary motives and admit an action of the usual motivic Galois group, which we call the `local' action. On the other hand, we define lifts of the full Lauricella functions as matrix coefficients in a Tannakian category of twisted cohomology, which inherit an action of the corresponding Tannaka group. We call this the `global' action. We prove that these two actions, local and global, are compatible with each other, even though they are defined in completely different ways. The main technical tool is to prove that metabelian quotients of generalised Drinfeld associators on the punctured Riemann sphere are hypergeometric functions. We also study single-valued versions of these hypergeometric functions, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Local structure of the Teichm\"uller and the Riemann moduli stacks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15244v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The goal of this note is to introduce an interesting question proposed by D. Rydh on an analytic version of the local structure of Artin stacks saying that near points with linearly reductive stabilizers, Artin stacks are \'etale-locally quotient stacks. We give some supporting evidence by verifying it on two fundamental classes of classical analytic moduli spaces: the Teichm\"uller moduli space and the Riemann moduli space of integrable complex structures whose analytic stack versions have been constructed by a recent work of L. Meersseman.</description>

      <title>On the irregular Riemann-Hilbert correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04260v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The original Riemann-Hilbert problem asks to find a Fuchsian ordinary differential equation with prescribed singularities and monodromy in the complex line. In the early 1980's Kashiwara solved a generalized version of the problem, valid on complex manifolds of any dimension. He presented it as a correspondence between regular holonomic D-modules and perverse sheaves. The analogous problem where one drops the regularity condition remained open for about thirty years. We solved it in the paper that received a 2024 Frontiers of Science Award. Our construction requires in particular an enhancement of the category of perverse sheaves. Here, using some examples in dimension one, we wish to convey the gist of the main ingredients used in our work.
  This is a written account of a talk given by the first named author at the International Congress of Basic Sciences on July 2024 in Beijing.</description>

Abstract: We study Hodge loci as leaf schemes of foliations. The main ingredient is the Gauss-Manin connection matrix of families of projective varieties. We also aim to investigate a conjecture on the ring of definition of leaf schemes and its consequences such as the algebraicity of leaf schemes (Cattani-Deligne-Kaplan theorem in the case of Hodge loci). This conjecture is a consequence of a local-global principle for leaf schemes.</description>
