      <title>A complex Gaussian representation of continuum wavefunctions respectful of their asymptotic behaviour</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex Gaussian basis sets are optimized to accurately represent continuum radial wavefunctions over the whole space. First, attention is put on the technical ability of the optimization method to get more flexible series of Gaussian exponents, in order to improve the accuracy of the fitting approach. Second, an indirect fitting method is proposed, allowing for the oscillatory behaviour of continuum functions to be conserved up to infinity as a factorized asymptotic function, while the Gaussian representation is applied to some appropriately defined distortion factor with limited spatial extension. As an illustration, the method is applied to radial Coulomb functions with realistic energy parameters. We also show that the indirect fitting approach keeps the advantageous analytical structure of typical one-electron transition integrals occurring in molecular ionization applications.</description>

      <title>Efficient Exploration of Chemical Kinetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating reaction rates and chemical stability is fundamental, yet efficient methods for large-scale simulations remain out of reach despite advances in modeling and exascale computing. Direct simulation is limited by short timescales; machine-learned potentials require large data sets and struggle with transition state regions essential for reaction rates. Reaction network exploration with sufficient accuracy is hampered by the computational cost of electronic structure calculations, and even simplifications like harmonic transition state theory rely on prohibitively expensive saddle point searches. Surrogate model-based acceleration has been promising but hampered by overhead and numerical instability.
  This dissertation presents a holistic solution, co-designing physical representations, statistical models, and systems architecture in the Optimal Transport Gaussian Process (OT-GP) framework. Using physics-aware optimal transport metrics, OT-GP creates compact, chemically relevant surrogates of the potential energy surface, underpinned by statistically robust sampling. Alongside EON software rewrites for long timescale simulations, we introduce reinforcement learning approaches for both minimum-mode following (when the final state is unknown) and nudged elastic band methods (when endpoints are specified). Collectively, these advances establish a representation-first, modular approach to chemical kinetics simulation. Large-scale benchmarks and Bayesian hierarchical validation demonstrate state-of-the-art performance and practical exploration of chemical kinetics, transforming a longstanding theoretical promise into a working engine for discovery.</description>

      <title>Fragmentation of Virtual Orbitals for Quantum Computing: Reducing Qubit Requirements through Many-Body Expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of quantum computing for molecular simulations is constrained by the limited number of qubits available on current Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. The present work introduces the Virtual Orbital Fragmentation (FVO) method, a systematic approach that reduces qubit requirements by 40--66\% while maintaining chemical accuracy. The method partitions the virtual orbital space into chemically intuitive fragments and employs many-body expansion techniques analogous to spatial fragmentation methods. Applications to six molecular systems demonstrate that the 2-body FVO expansion achieves errors below 3 kcal/mol, while the 3-body expansion provides sub-kcal/mol accuracy. When integrated with the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) and combined with the Effective Fragment Molecular Orbital (EFMO) method for multi-molecular systems, the hierarchical Q-EFMO-FVO approach achieves 96--100\% accuracy relative to full calculations. The method provides a practical pathway for quantum chemical calculations on current 50--100 qubit processors and establishes virtual orbital fragmentation as a complementary strategy to spatial fragmentation for managing quantum computational complexity.</description>

      <title>The spinterface mechanism for the chiral-induced spin selectivity effect: A Critical Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The chiral-induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect, whereby chiral molecules preferentially transmit electrons of one spin orientation, remains one of the most intriguing and debated phenomena at the interface of spintronics, molecular electronics, and quantum materials. Despite extensive experimental observations across diverse platforms - including transport junctions, photoemission, and enantioselective chemistry - a comprehensive theoretical framework is still lacking. In this perspective, we critically examine the spinterface mechanism as a unifying explanation for the CISS effect. The spinterface model, which hypothesizes a feedback interaction between electron motion in chiral molecules and fluctuating surface magnetic moments, is shown to quantitatively reproduce experimental data across various systems and conditions. We contrast it with some existing theoretical models, highlighting key experimental features. Importantly, we also address open questions and criticisms of this model, including the nature of surface magnetism, the role of dissipation, and the applicability of the mechanism to non-helical or electrode-free systems. By offering falsifiable predictions and reconciling theory with experimental raw data, this work aims to sharpen the dialogue surrounding the microscopic origin of CISS and stimulate further experimental and theoretical progress.</description>

      <title>Kramers rate for Brownian particles in excitable media with deformable double-well substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the Kramers escape problem for Brownian particles in bistable substrates with deformable double-well shapes. The shape deformability is considered of three distinct forms: in one, the positions of the two degenerate minima can be shifted continuously without affecting the barrier height. In the second the minima positions are kept fix while the barrier height is continuously shifted. In the third the minima positions and barrier height can be tuned simultaneously by changing a single real parameter that we refer to as deformability parameter. We obtain the analytical expression of the Kramers escape rate for the three different double-well models, and identify a critical value of the deformability parameter above which non-Gaussian corrections become relevant. Remarkable enough in the latter region, statistical mechanics predicts a first-order transition in quantum tunneling using the functional action associated with the family of deformable double-well potentials.</description>

      <title>Fast adaptive discontinuous basis sets for electronic structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a discontinuous Galerkin (DG) framework for automatically constructing adaptive basis sets for electronic structure calculations. By allowing basis functions to be discontinuous across element interfaces, our approach supports flexible combinations of atom-centered and polynomial basis sets, maintains favorable numerical conditioning, and induces structured sparsity of the one- and two-electron integrals, which we compute using specialised numerical integration strategies. We also introduce multigrid-preconditioned Poisson solvers that enable fast algorithms for both Hartree-Fock (HF) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations within our DG basis sets. Moreover, these basis sets naturally support adaptive multigrid preconditioning for the linear eigensolvers employed within the self-consistent field iteration for HF and DFT. Numerical experiments for HF and DFT demonstrate that our approach achieves chemical accuracy with modest basis sizes that compare favorably to the sizes of ordinary GTO basis sets achieving similar accuracy, while offering additional structured sparsity and improved computational scalability in the size-extensive limit. The framework thus provides a flexible route toward the construction of systematically improvable and structured adaptive basis sets for electronic structure theory.</description>

      <title>Faradaic and capacitive charging of an electrolyte-filled pore in response to a small applied potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electrochemical devices often charge both through Faradaic reactions and electric double layer formation. Here, we study these coupled processes in a model system of a long electrolyte-filled pore subject to a small suddenly-applied potential, close to the equilibrium potential $\Psi^\text{eq}$ at which there is no net Faradaic charge transfer. Specifically, we solve the coupled Poisson-Nernst-Planck and Frumkin-Butler-Volmer equations by asymptotic approximations, using the pore's small inverse aspect ratio as the small parameter. In the early-time limit, the reaction-diffusion equations yield an extended Faradaic transmission line model that includes a voltage source, $\Psi_\text{eq}$, biasing the Faradaic reactions, captured by the resistance $R_F$. In the long-time limit, the model exhibits a nontrivial potential of zero charge, $\Psi_\text{pzc} = \Psi_\text{eq}[1 - \hat{Z}(0)/R_F]$, where $\hat{Z}(0)$ is the experimentally accessible zero-frequency impedance of the system. This expression provides a new means to experimentally measure the Faradaic contribution to $\Psi_\text{pzc}$.</description>

      <title>Defects at Play: Shaping the Photophysics and Photochemistry of Ice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16568v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mechanisms by which light interacts with ice and the impact of photo-induced reactions are central to our understanding of environmental, atmospheric and astrophysical processes. However, a microscopic description of the photoproducts originating from UV absorption and emission processes has remained elusive. Here we explore the photochemistry of ice using time-dependent hybrid density functional theory on various models of pristine and defective ice Ih. Our investigation of the excited state potential energy surface of the crystal shows that UV absorption can lead to the formation of hydronium ions, hydroxyl radicals and excess electrons. One of the dominant mechanisms of decay from the excited to the ground-state involves the recombination of the electron with the hydroxyl radical yielding hydronium-hydroxide ion-pairs. We find that the details of this charge recombination process sensitively depend on the presence of defects in the lattice, such as vacancies and pre-existing photoproducts. We also observe the formation of Bjerrum defects following UV absorption; we suggest that, together with hydroxide anions, they are likely responsible for prominent features experimentally detected in long UV exposure absorption spectra, remarkably red-shifted relative to short exposure spectra. Our results highlight the key role of defects in determining the onset of absorption and emission processes in ice.</description>

      <title>Deconstructing the Origins of Interfacial Catalysis: Why Electric Fields are Inseparable from Solvation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23988v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the last decade, there has been a surge of experiments showing that certain chemical reactions undergo an enormous boost when taken from bulk aqueous conditions to microdroplet environments. The microscopic basis of this phenomenon remains elusive and continues to be widely debated. One of the key driving forces invoked are the specific properties of the air-water interface including the presence of large electric fields and distinct solvation at the surface. Here, using a combination of classical molecular dynamics simulations, the chemical physics of solvation, and unsupervised learning approaches, we place these assumptions under close scrutiny. Using phenol as a model system, we demonstrate that the electric field at the surface of water is not anomalous or unique compared to bulk water conditions. Furthermore, the electric field fluctuations de-correlate on a timescale of ~10 ps implying that their role in activating much slower chemical reactions remains inconclusive. We deploy a recently developed unsupervised learning approach, dubbed information balance, which detects in an agnostic fashion the relationship between the electric field and solvation collective variables. It turns out that the electric field on the hydroxyl group of the phenol is mostly determined by phenol hydration including the proximity and orientation of nearby water molecules. We caution that the growing attention of the role that electric fields have garnered in enhancing chemical reactivity at the air-water interface, may not reflect their actual importance.</description>

Abstract: The Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) formalism, combined with the $GW$ approximation for ionization energies and electron affinities, is emerging as an efficient and accurate method for predicting optical excitations in molecules. In this letter, we present the first derivation and implementation of fully analytic nuclear gradients for the BSE@$G_0W_0$ method. Building on recent developments for $G_0W_0$ nuclear gradients, we derive analytic nuclear gradients for several BSE@$G_0W_0$ variants. We validate our implementation against numerical gradients and compare excited-state geometries and adiabatic excitation energies obtained from different BSE@$G_0W_0$ variants with those from state-of-the-art wavefunction methods.</description>

      <title>QCell: Comprehensive Quantum-Mechanical Dataset Spanning Diverse Biomolecular Fragments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09939v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning force fields (MLFFs) are revolutionizing molecular simulations by bridging the gap between quantum-mechanical (QM) accuracy and the computational efficiency of mechanistic potentials. However, the development of reliable MLFFs for biomolecular systems remains constrained by the scarcity of high-quality, chemically diverse QM datasets that span all of the major classes of biomolecules expressed in living cells. Crucially, such a comprehensive dataset must be computed using non-empirical or minimally empirical approximations to solving the Schr\"odinger equation. To address these limitations, we introduce the QCell dataset -- a curated collection of 525k new QM calculations for biomolecular fragments encompassing carbohydrates, nucleic acids, lipids, dimers, and ion clusters. QCell complements existing datasets, bringing the total number of available data points to 41 million molecular systems, all calculated using hybrid density functional theory with nonlocal many-body dispersion interactions, as captured by the PBE0+MBD(-NL) level of quantum mechanics. The QCell dataset therefore provides a valuable resource for training next-generation MLFFs capable of modeling the intricate interactions that govern biomolecular dynamics beyond small molecules and proteins.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19106v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Marcus theory of electron transfer assumes that diabatic energy gaps are sampled from a single ensemble. This assumption can break down in spatially anisotropic environments, such as electrochemical interfaces or biomolecular structures, where distinct solvent ensembles arise along a collective variable describing the anisotropy. Treating this collective variable as an additional reaction coordinate linearly independent from the Marcus reaction coordinate, we develop a formalism that enables calculation of the resulting Coupled Ion-Electron Transfer (CIET) free-energy surface directly from constrained ab initio trajectories. Applied to CO2 redox on a gold electrode, this method reveals strong coupling to the anisotropy, predicting significantly different activation barriers compared to either coordinate alone.</description>

      <title>Applying R-Matrix Theory to Atom-Molecule Inelastic Collisions: the case study of H$_2$O + H</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19963v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present study presents a comprehensive theoretical investigation of atom and asymmetric top molecule inelastic scattering based on the R-matrix formalism. The proposed methodology establishes a rigorous framework for treating inelastic collisions in the space-fixed coordinate system. The excellent numerical performance of the method is demonstrated through the comparison of state-to-state rotationally inelastic R-matrix cross sections for the H + H$_2$O system with those obtained using conventional close-coupling (CC) theory. The R-matrix approach is shown to deliver results of comparable accuracy while achieving substantially reduced computation times. The method is furthermore shown to achieve more than one order-of-magnitude speedup by exploiting GPU-accelerated diagonalisation through the MAGMA library. This combination of accuracy and computational efficiency positions the R--matrix approach as a powerful and scalable tool for investigating inelastic scattering involving complex polyatomic systems, thereby paving the way for systematic studies of molecule-molecule interactions in astrophysical, atmospheric, and cold-matter environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.04121v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rapid progress in the experimental control and interrogation of molecules, combined with developments in precise calculations of their structure, are enabling new opportunities in the investigation of nuclear and particle physics phenomena. Molecules containing heavy, octupole-deformed nuclei such as radium are of particular interest for such studies, offering an enhanced sensitivity to the properties of fundamental particles and interactions. Here, we report precision laser spectroscopy measurements and theoretical calculations of the structure of the radioactive radium monofluoride molecule, $^{225}$Ra$^{19}$F. Our results allow fine details of the short-range electron-nucleus interaction to be revealed, indicating the high sensitivity of this molecule to the distribution of magnetization, currently a poorly constrained nuclear property, within the radium nucleus. These results provide a direct and stringent test of the description of the electronic wavefunction inside the nuclear volume, highlighting the suitability of these molecules to investigate subatomic phenomena.</description>

      <title>FEAT: Free energy Estimators with Adaptive Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11516v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present Free energy Estimators with Adaptive Transport (FEAT), a novel framework for free energy estimation -- a critical challenge across scientific domains. FEAT leverages learned transports implemented via stochastic interpolants and provides consistent, minimum-variance estimators based on escorted Jarzynski equality and controlled Crooks theorem, alongside variational upper and lower bounds on free energy differences. Unifying equilibrium and non-equilibrium methods under a single theoretical framework, FEAT establishes a principled foundation for neural free energy calculations. Experimental validation on toy examples, molecular simulations, and quantum field theory demonstrates improvements over existing learning-based methods. Our PyTorch implementation is available at https://github.com/jiajunhe98/FEAT.</description>

      <title>On Robust $\beta$-Spectra Shape Parameter Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11510v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Experimental extraction of $\beta$-shape functions, C(W), is challenging. Comparing different experimental $\beta$-shapes to each other and to those predicted by theory in a consistent manner is difficult. This difficulty is compounded when different parameterizations of the $\beta$-shape function are used. Usually some form of a power polynomial of the total electron energy is chosen for this parametrization. This choice results in extracted coefficients that are highly correlated, with their physical meaning and numerical value dependent on the order of polynomial chosen. This is true for both theoretical and experimental coefficients, and leads to challenges when comparing coefficients from polynomials of different orders. Accurately representing the highly correlated uncertainties is difficult and subtle. These issues impact the underlying physical interpretation of shape function parameters. We suggest an alternative approach based on orthogonal polynomials. Orthogonal polynomials offer more stable coefficient extraction which is less dependent on the order of the polynomial, allow for easier comparison between theory and experimental coefficients from polynomials of different orders, and offer some observations on simple physical meaning and on the statistical limits of the extracted coefficients.</description>
