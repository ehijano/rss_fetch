      <title>Birational complexity of log Calabi-Yau 3-folds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the birational complexity of log Calabi-Yau $3$-folds. For such a pair $(X,B)$ of index one and coregularity zero, we show that $c_{\rm bir}(X,B)\in \{0,2,3\}$. Further, we prove that $(X,B)$ has a log Calabi-Yau crepant birational model that admits a crepant contraction to $(\mathbb{P}^{3-c},H_0+\dots+H_{3-c})$, where $c=c_{\rm bir}(X,B)$. To prove this, we give a geometric characterization of standard $\mathbb{P}^1$-links.</description>

      <title>Smooth connectivity in real algebraic varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A standard question in real algebraic geometry is to compute the number of connected components of a real algebraic variety in affine space. By adapting an approach for determining connectivity in complements of real hypersurfaces by Hong, Rohal, Safey El Din, and Schost, algorithms are presented for computing the number of connected components, the Euler characteristic, and deciding the connectivity between two points for a smooth manifold arising as the complement of a real hypersurface of a real algebraic variety. When taking such real hypersurface to be the set of singular points, this yields an approach for determining smooth connectivity in a real algebraic variety. The method is based upon gradient ascent/descent paths on the real algebraic variety and several examples are included to demonstrate the approach.</description>

      <title>Facets of module theory over semirings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We set up some basic module theory over semirings, with particular attention to scheme theory over semirings. We show that while not all the usual definitions of vector bundle agree over semirings, all the usual definitions of line bundle do agree. We also show that the narrow class group of a number field can be recovered as a reflexive Picard group of its subsemiring of totally nonnegative algebraic integers.</description>

      <title>Dependency equilibria: Boundary cases and their real algebraic geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is a significant step forward in understanding dependency equilibria within the framework of real algebraic geometry encompassing both pure and mixed equilibria. We start by breaking down the concept for a general audience, using concrete examples to illustrate the main results. In alignment with Spohn's original definition of dependency equilibria, we propose three alternative definitions, allowing for an algebro-geometric comprehensive study of all dependency equilibria. We give a sufficient condition for the existence of a pure dependency equilibrium and show that every Nash equilibrium lies on the Spohn variety, the algebraic model for dependency equilibria. For generic games, the set of real points of the Spohn variety is Zariski dense. Furthermore, every Nash equilibrium in this case is a dependency equilibrium. Finally, we present a detailed analysis of the geometric structure of dependency equilibria for $(2\times2)$-games.</description>

      <title>Fourier transform and Radon transform for mixed Hodge modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a generalization to bi-filtered $\mathcal D$-modules underlying mixed Hodge modules of the relation between microlocalization along $f_1,...,f_r \in \mathcal O_X(X)$ and vanishing cycles along $g = \sum_{i=1}^r y_i f_i$. This leads to an interesting isomorphism between localization triangles. As an application, we use these results to compare the $k$-plane Radon transform and the Fourier-Laplace transform for mixed Hodge modules. This is then applied to the Hodge module structure of certain GKZ systems.</description>

      <title>Stable degeneration of families of klt singularities with constant local volume</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that for a locally stable family of klt singularities with constant local volume, the ideal sequences of the minimizing valuations for the normalized volume function form a family of ideals with flat cosupport, which induces a degeneration to a locally stable family of K-semistable log Fano cone singularities. Our proof is a family version of the method of C. Xu and Z. Zhuang proving finite generation by Koll\'ar models and multiple degenerations.</description>

      <title>Hilbert Series of Bipartite Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the algebraic structure of the mesonic moduli spaces of bipartite field theories by computing the Hilbert series. Bipartite field theories form a large family of 4d N=1 supersymmetric gauge theories that are defined by bipartite graphs on Riemann surfaces with boundaries. By calculating the Hilbert series, we are able to identify the generators and defining generator relations of the mesonic moduli spaces of these theories. Moreover, we show that certain bipartite field theories exhibit enhanced global symmetries which can be identified through the computation of the corresponding refined Hilbert series. As part of our study, we introduce two one-parameter families of bipartite field theories defined on cylinders whose mesonic moduli spaces are all complete intersection toric Calabi-Yau 3-folds.</description>

      <title>Algebraization of Mochizuki's anabelian variation of ring structures, perfectoid geometry and formal groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.06840</link>
      <description>arXiv:1906.06840v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a multiplicative monoid with identity. Then I show that there is a universal one dimensional formal group law equipped with an action of $M$. If $M$ is $p$-perfect (i.e. $m\mapsto m^p$ is an isomorphism for some prime number $p$) then the universal $M$-formal group law comes equipped with a natural Frobenius endomorphism. There are a number of concrete applications of this result. If $K$ is a $p$-adic field and $\mathcal{O}=\mathcal{O}_K$ is the multiplicative monoid of the ring of integers of $K$, then there is a universal formal group (over a suitable (non-zero) ring) which is equipped with an action of the multiplicative monoid $\mathcal{O}$. Lubin-Tate formal groups arise from this universal monoid formal group law. This has applications to Mochizuki's anabelian ideas: if two p-adic fields have isomorphic absolute Galois groups then they have isomorphic multiplicative monoids $\mathcal{O}$ (but possibly non-isomorphic ring structures). The existence of the universal monoid formal group law for the monoid $\mathcal{O}$ implies that the additive structures of a ring can be interpolated into a universal algebraic family (while keeping the multiplicative structure of the ring fixed). Here is another important example covered by my result: let $R$ be a perfectoid ring and let $R^\flat$ be its tilt and the multiplicative monoid $R^\flat$ of $R^\flat$. Then there exists a universal monoid formal group law for this monoid which interpolates the additive structures of untilts with tilt $R^\flat$. Thus in some sense one has a unified approach to various phenomenon which are well-known in anabelian geometry and in perfectoid geometry.</description>

Abstract: The study of torus orbit closures in the (complete) flag variety was initiated by Klyachko and Gelfand--Serganova in the mid-1980s, but it seems that not much has been done since then. In this chapter, we present some of the work by Klyachko and Gelfand--Serganova and our recent work on the topology, geometry, and combinatorics of torus orbit closures in the flag variety.</description>

      <title>Motivic integration on special rigid varieties and the motivic integral identity conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.03921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.03921v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove in this paper the original version of Kontsevich and Soibelman's motivic integral identity conjecture for formal functions by developing a novel framework for equivariant motivic integration on special rigid varieties. This theory is built upon our recent research on equivariant motivic integration within the realm of special formal schemes. The central element of our approach lies in demonstrating that two formal models of a given smooth rigid variety can be dominated by a third formal model. Notably, a similar assertion for quasi-compact rigid varieties was obtained by Bosch, L\"utkebohmert, and Raynaud in 1993. Consequently, we establish a concept of motivic volume for a special smooth rigid variety, ensuring independence from the selection of its models. We demonstrate that this motivic volume can be extended to a homomorphism from a certain Grothendieck ring of special smooth rigid varieties to the classical Grothendieck ring of varieties. Moreover, our developed motivic volume exhibits a Fubini-type property, which recovers Nicaise and Payne's motivic Fubini theorem for the tropicalization map.</description>

      <title>Filtrations of the Chow group of zero-cycles on abelian varieties and behavior under isogeny</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.14372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.14372v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For an abelian variety $A$ over a field $k$ the author defined in \cite{Gazaki2015} a Bloch-Beilinson type filtration $\{F^r(A)\}_{r\geq 0}$ of the Chow group of zero-cycles, $\text{CH}_0(A)$, with successive quotients related to a Somekawa $K$-group. In this article we show that this filtration behaves well with respect to isogeny, and in particular if $n:A\to A$ is the multiplication by $n$ map on $A$, then its push-forward $n_\star$ is given on the quotient $F^r/F^{r+1}$ by multiplication by $n^r$. In the special case when $A=E_1\times\cdots\times E_d$ is a product of elliptic curves, we show that this filtration agrees with a filtration defined by Raskind and Spiess and with the Pontryagin filtration previously considered by Beauville and Bloch. We also obtain some results in the more general case when $A$ is isogenous to a product of elliptic curves. When $k$ is a finite extension of $\mathbb{Q}_p$, using Jacobians of curves isogenous to products of elliptic curves, we give new evidence for a conjecture of Raskind and Spiess and Colliot-Th\'{e}l\`{e}ne, which predicts that the kernel of the Albanese map is the direct sum of a divisible group and a finite group.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.13227v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct spaces of coinvariants at principally polarized abelian varieties with respect to the action of an infinite-dimensional Lie algebra. We show how these spaces globalize to twisted $\mathcal{D}$-modules on moduli of principally polarized abelian varieties, and we determine the Atiyah algebra of a line bundle acting on them. We prove analogous results on the universal abelian variety. An essential aspect of our arguments involves analyzing the Atiyah algebra of the Hodge and canonical line bundles on moduli of abelian varieties and the universal abelian variety.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the first geometric construction of codes in the sum-rank metric, which we called linearized Algebraic Geometry codes, using quotients of the ring of Ore polynomials with coefficients in the function field of an algebraic curve. We study the parameters of these codes and give lower bounds for their dimension and minimum distance. Our codes exhibit quite good parameters, respecting a similar bound to Goppa's bound for Algebraic Geometry codes in the Hamming metric. Furthermore, our construction yields codes asymptotically better than the sum-rank version of the Gilbert-Varshamov bound.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.03070v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the holomorphic convexity of the covering of a complex projective {normal} variety $X$, which corresponds to the intersection of kernels of reductive representations $\rho:\pi_1(X)\to {\rm GL}_{N}(\mathbb{C})$, therefore answering a question by Eyssidieux, Katzarkov, Pantev, and Ramachandran in 2012. It is worth noting that Eyssidieux had previously proven this result in 2004 when $X$ is smooth. While our approach follows the general strategy employed in Eyssidieux's proof, it introduces several improvements and simplifications. Notably, it avoids the necessity of using the reduction mod $p$ method in Eyssidieux's original proof.
  Additionally, we construct the Shafarevich morphism for complex reductive representations of fundamental groups of complex quasi-projective varieties unconditionally, and proving its algebraic nature at the function field level.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14659v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $S$ be a minimal irregular surface of general type, whose Albanese map induces a fibration $f:\,S \to C$ of genus $g$.We prove a linear upper bound on the genus $g$ if $K_S^2\leq 4\chi(\mathcal{O}_S)$. Examples are constructed showing that the above linear upper bound is sharp. We also give a characterization of the Albanese fibrations reaching the above upper bound when $\chi(\mathcal{O}_S)\geq 5$.On the other hand, we will construct a sequence of surfaces $S_n$ of general type with $K_{S_n}^2/\chi(\mathcal{O}_{S_n})&gt;4$ and with an Albanese fibration $f_n$, such that the genus $g_n$ of a general fiber of $f_n$ increases quadratically with $\chi(\mathcal{O}_{S_n})$,and that $K_{S_n}^2/\chi(\mathcal{O}_{S_n})$ can be arbitrarily close to $4$.</description>

      <title>3D genome reconstruction from partially phased Hi-C data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.11764v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The 3-dimensional (3D) structure of the genome is of significant importance for many cellular processes. In this paper, we study the problem of reconstructing the 3D structure of chromosomes from Hi-C data of diploid organisms, which poses additional challenges compared to the better-studied haploid setting. With the help of techniques from algebraic geometry, we prove that a small amount of phased data is sufficient to ensure finite identifiability, both for noiseless and noisy data. In the light of these results, we propose a new 3D reconstruction method based on semidefinite programming, paired with numerical algebraic geometry and local optimization. The performance of this method is tested on several simulated datasets under different noise levels and with different amounts of phased data. We also apply it to a real dataset from mouse X chromosomes, and we are then able to recover previously known structural features.</description>

      <title>On Vafa-Witten equations over Kaehler manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.02964v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the analytic properties of solutions to the Vafa-Witten equation over a compact Kaehler manifold. Simple obstructions to the existence of nontrivial solutions are identified. The gauge theoretical compactness for the $\mathbb{C}^*$ invariant locus of the moduli space is shown to behave similarly as the Hermitian-Yang-Mills connections. More generally, this holds for solutions with uniformly bounded spectral covers such as nilpotent solutions. When spectral covers are unbounded, we manage to take limits of the renormalized Higgs fields which are intrinsically characterized by the convergence of the associated spectral covers. This gives a simpler proof for Taubes' results on rank two solutions over Kaehler surfaces together with a new complex geometric interpretation. The moduli space of $SU(2)$ monopoles and some related examples are also discussed in the final section.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by their central role in fault-tolerant quantum computation, we study the sets of gates of the third-level of the Clifford hierarchy and their distinguished subsets of `nearly diagonal' semi-Clifford gates. The Clifford hierarchy gates can be implemented via gate teleportation given appropriate magic states. The vast quantity of these resource states required for achieving fault-tolerance is a significant bottleneck for the practical realisation of universal quantum computers. Semi-Clifford gates are important because they can be implemented with far more efficient use of these resource states.
  We prove that every third-level gate of up to two qudits is semi-Clifford. We thus generalise results of Zeng-Chen-Chuang (2008) in the qubit case and of the second author (2020) in the qutrit case to the case of qudits of arbitrary prime dimension $d$.
  Earlier results relied on exhaustive computations whereas our present work leverages tools of algebraic geometry. Specifically, we construct two schemes corresponding to the sets of third-level Clifford hierarchy gates and third-level semi-Clifford gates. We then show that the two algebraic sets resulting from reducing these schemes modulo $d$ share the same set of rational points.</description>
