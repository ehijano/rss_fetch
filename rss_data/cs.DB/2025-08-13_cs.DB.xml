      <title>ELASTIC: Event-Tracking Data Synchronization in Soccer Without Annotated Event Locations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of event and tracking data has become essential for advanced analysis in soccer. However, synchronizing these two modalities remains a significant challenge due to temporal and spatial inaccuracies in manually recorded event timestamps. Existing synchronizers typically rely on annotated event locations, which themselves are prone to spatial errors and thus can distort synchronization results. To address this issue, we propose ELASTIC (Event-Location-AgnoSTIC synchronizer), a synchronization framework that only uses features derived from tracking data. ELASTIC also explicitly detects the end times of pass-like events and separates the detection of major and minor events, which improves the completeness of the synchronized output and reduces error cascade across events. We annotated the ground truth timestamps of 2,134 events from three Eredivisie matches to measure the synchronization accuracy, and the experimental results demonstrate that ELASTIC outperforms existing synchronizers by a large margin.</description>

      <title>LLMLog: Advanced Log Template Generation via LLM-driven Multi-Round Annotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern computing systems, such as HDFS and Spark, produce vast quantities of logs that developers use for tasks like anomaly detection and error analysis. To simplify log analysis, template generation methods have been proposed to standardize log formats, transforming unstructured data into structured templates. Existing heuristic-based methods and neural network-based methods suffer from low accuracy problems due to the reliance on handcrafted heuristics or specific log patterns in training sets. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential in log template generation. However, they often struggle with ambiguous, complex, or highly specific log content, which can lead to errors in generating accurate templates. To address these challenges, we propose LLMLog, a multi-round annotation framework with adaptive in-context learning. We first propose an edit-distance-based similarity metric to evaluate log similarity. Then, we introduce a method to select the most informative $k$ unlabeled logs for annotation by considering both the representativeness of the logs and the confidence of LLM predictions. Additionally, we design an adaptive context selection strategy that adaptively selects labeled logs to ensure comprehensive keyword coverage for unlabeled logs. These labeled logs serve as the context for LLMs to better understand the unlabeled logs, thereby enhancing the accuracy of template generation. Extensive experiments on sixteen datasets demonstrate that LLMLog outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches.</description>

      <title>A Lightweight Learned Cardinality Estimation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cardinality estimation is a fundamental task in database management systems, aiming to predict query results accurately without executing the queries. However, existing techniques either achieve low estimation accuracy or incur high inference latency. Simultaneously achieving high speed and accuracy becomes critical for the cardinality estimation problem. In this paper, we propose a novel data-driven approach called CoDe (Covering with Decompositions) to address this problem. CoDe employs the concept of covering design, which divides the table into multiple smaller, overlapping segments. For each segment, CoDe utilizes tensor decomposition to accurately model its data distribution. Moreover, CoDe introduces innovative algorithms to select the best-fitting distributions for each query, combining them to estimate the final result. By employing multiple models to approximate distributions, CoDe excels in effectively modeling discrete distributions and ensuring computational efficiency. Notably, experimental results show that our method represents a significant advancement in cardinality estimation, achieving state-of-the-art levels of both estimation accuracy and inference efficiency. Across various datasets, CoDe achieves absolute accuracy in estimating more than half of the queries.</description>

      <title>AmbiGraph-Eval: Can LLMs Effectively Handle Ambiguous Graph Queries?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated strong capabilities in translating natural language into database queries, especially when dealing with complex graph-structured data. However, real-world queries often contain inherent ambiguities, and the interconnected nature of graph structures can amplify these challenges, leading to unintended or incorrect query results. To systematically evaluate LLMs on this front, we propose a taxonomy of graph-query ambiguities, comprising three primary types: Attribute Ambiguity, Relationship Ambiguity, and Attribute-Relationship Ambiguity, each subdivided into Same-Entity and Cross-Entity scenarios. We introduce AmbiGraph-Eval, a novel benchmark of real-world ambiguous queries paired with expert-verified graph query answers. Evaluating 9 representative LLMs shows that even top models struggle with ambiguous graph queries. Our findings reveal a critical gap in ambiguity handling and motivate future work on specialized resolution techniques.</description>

      <title>Presenting DiaData for Research on Type 1 Diabetes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disorder that leads to the destruction of insulin-producing cells, resulting in insulin deficiency, as to why the affected individuals depend on external insulin injections. However, insulin can decrease blood glucose levels and can cause hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia is a severe event of low blood glucose levels ($\le$70 mg/dL) with dangerous side effects of dizziness, coma, or death. Data analysis can significantly enhance diabetes care by identifying personal patterns and trends leading to adverse events. Especially, machine learning (ML) models can predict glucose levels and provide early alarms. However, diabetes and hypoglycemia research is limited by the unavailability of large datasets. Thus, this work systematically integrates 15 datasets to provide a large database of 2510 subjects with glucose measurements recorded every 5 minutes. In total, 149 million measurements are included, of which 4% represent values in the hypoglycemic range. Moreover, two sub-databases are extracted. Sub-database I includes demographics, and sub-database II includes heart rate data. The integrated dataset provides an equal distribution of sex and different age levels. As a further contribution, data quality is assessed, revealing that data imbalance and missing values present a significant challenge. Moreover, a correlation study on glucose levels and heart rate data is conducted, showing a relation between 15 and 55 minutes before hypoglycemia.</description>

      <title>PETLP: A Privacy-by-Design Pipeline for Social Media Data in AI Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social media data presents AI researchers with overlapping obligations under the GDPR, copyright law, and platform terms -- yet existing frameworks fail to integrate these regulatory domains, leaving researchers without unified guidance. We introduce PETLP (Privacy-by-design Extract, Transform, Load, and Present), a compliance framework that embeds legal safeguards directly into extended ETL pipelines. Central to PETLP is treating Data Protection Impact Assessments as living documents that evolve from pre-registration through dissemination. Through systematic Reddit analysis, we demonstrate how extraction rights fundamentally differ between qualifying research organisations (who can invoke DSM Article 3 to override platform restrictions) and commercial entities (bound by terms of service), whilst GDPR obligations apply universally. We reveal why true anonymisation remains unachievable for social media data and expose the legal gap between permitted dataset creation and uncertain model distribution. By structuring compliance decisions into practical workflows and simplifying institutional data management plans, PETLP enables researchers to navigate regulatory complexity with confidence, bridging the gap between legal requirements and research practice.</description>

      <title>Columbo: Expanding Abbreviated Column Names for Tabular Data Using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Expanding the abbreviated column names of tables, such as ``esal'' to ``employee salary'', is critical for numerous downstream data tasks. This problem arises in enterprises, domain sciences, government agencies, and more. In this paper we make three contributions that significantly advances the state of the art. First, we show that synthetic public data used by prior work has major limitations, and we introduce 4 new datasets in enterprise/science domains, with real-world abbreviations. Second, we show that accuracy measures used by prior work seriously undercount correct expansions, and we propose new synonym-aware measures that capture accuracy much more accurately. Finally, we develop Columbo, a powerful LLM-based solution that exploits context, rules, chain-of-thought reasoning, and token-level analysis. Extensive experiments show that Columbo significantly outperforms NameGuess, the current most advanced solution, by 4-29\%, over 5 datasets. Columbo has been used in production on EDI, a major data portal for environmental sciences.</description>

      <title>Scalable Graph Indexing using GPUs for Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08744v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) in high-dimensional vector spaces has a wide range of real-world applications. Numerous methods have been proposed to handle ANNS efficiently, while graph-based indexes have gained prominence due to their high accuracy and efficiency. However, the indexing overhead of graph-based indexes remains substantial. With exponential growth in data volume and increasing demands for dynamic index adjustments, this overhead continues to escalate, posing a critical challenge. In this paper, we introduce Tagore, a fast library accelerated by GPUs for graph indexing, which has powerful capabilities of constructing refinement-based graph indexes such as NSG and Vamana. We first introduce GNN-Descent, a GPU-specific algorithm for efficient k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) graph initialization. GNN-Descent speeds up the similarity comparison by a two-phase descent procedure and enables highly parallelized neighbor updates. Next, aiming to support various k-NN graph pruning strategies, we formulate a universal computing procedure termed CFS and devise two generalized GPU kernels for parallel processing complex dependencies in neighbor relationships. For large-scale datasets exceeding GPU memory capacity, we propose an asynchronous GPU-CPU-disk indexing framework with a cluster-aware caching mechanism to minimize the I/O pressure on the disk. Extensive experiments on 7 real-world datasets exhibit that Tagore achieves 1.32x-112.79x speedup while maintaining the index quality.</description>

      <title>WebArXiv: Evaluating Multimodal Agents on Time-Invariant arXiv Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00938v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has enabled the development of autonomous web agents capable of navigating and interacting with real websites. However, evaluating such agents remains challenging due to the instability and inconsistency of existing benchmarks, which often rely on dynamic content or oversimplified simulations. In this work, we introduce WebArXiv, a static and time-invariant benchmark comprising 275 web-based tasks grounded in the arXiv platform. WebArXiv ensures reproducible and reliable evaluation by anchoring tasks in fixed web snapshots with deterministic ground truths and standardized action trajectories. Through behavioral analysis, we identify a common failure mode, Rigid History Reflection, where agents over-rely on fixed interaction histories. To address this, we propose a lightweight dynamic reflection mechanism that allows agents to selectively retrieve relevant past steps during decision-making. We evaluate ten state-of-the-art web agents on WebArXiv. Results demonstrate clear performance differences across agents and validate the effectiveness of our proposed reflection strategy.</description>

      <title>Approximate DBSCAN under Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08749v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper revisits the DBSCAN problem under differential privacy (DP). Existing DP-DBSCAN algorithms aim at publishing the cluster labels of the input points. However, we show that both empirically and theoretically, this approach cannot offer any utility in the published results. We therefore propose an alternative definition of DP-DBSCAN based on the notion of spans. We argue that publishing the spans actually better serves the purposes of visualization and classification of DBSCAN. Then we present a linear-time DP-DBSCAN algorithm achieving the sandwich quality guarantee in any constant dimensions, as well as matching lower bounds on the approximation ratio. A key building block in our algorithm is a linear-time algorithm for constructing a histogram under pure-DP, which is of independent interest. Finally, we conducted experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets to verify the practical performance of our DP-DBSCAN algorithm.</description>
