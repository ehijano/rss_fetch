      <title>Spectral Transfers of Sign-Definite Invariants in Wave Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the spectral transfers of sign-definite invariants in general wave turbulence systems equipped with a wave kinetic equation. We develop a formalism to investigate and to characterize these transfers, based on the ability to track the exchanges within individual interactions by the detailed-conservation properties of the resonant interactions. We consider the three-wave, four-wave, five-wave and six-wave kinetic equations, introducing measures of locality of general wave turbulence system and of median step size in wave-wave scattering. We then use the proposed method to study the Majda-McLaughlin-Tabak one-dimensional model and examine the characteristics of energy and action transport. We show that energy in the direct energy cascade is dominated by local interactions, but shows a nonlocal inverse "return flow" that counters the direction of the cascade. The inverse action cascade is instead ruled by more nonlocal interactions, but shows a highly local direct "return flow". We also show that for both cascades a scale separation of over an order of magnitude is necessary to ensure a negligible interaction rate with forcing or dissipation regions, hinting at why in numerical simulations of the model an extremely large box size is necessary in order to realize the theoretical Kolmogorov-Zakharov spectra.</description>

      <title>Computing Classical Escape Rates from Periodic Orbits in Chaotic Hydrogen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When placed in parallel magnetic and electric fields, the electron trajectories of a classical hydrogen atom are chaotic. The classical escape rate of such a system can be computed with classical trajectory Monte Carlo techniques, but these computations require enormous numbers of trajectories, provide little understanding of the dynamical mechanisms involved, and must be completely rerun for any change of system parameter, no matter how small. We demonstrate an alternative technique to classical trajectory Monte Carlo computations, based on classical periodic orbit theory. In this technique, escape rates are computed from a relatively modest number (a few thousand) of periodic orbits of the system. One only needs the orbits' periods and stability eigenvalues. A major advantage of this approach is that one does not need to repeat the entire analysis from scratch as system parameters are varied; one can numerically continue the periodic orbits instead. We demonstrate the periodic orbit technique for the ionization of a hydrogen atom in applied parallel electric and magnetic fields. Using fundamental theories of phase space geometry, we also show how to generate nontrivial symbolic dynamics for acquiring periodic orbits in physical systems. A detailed analysis of heteroclinic tangles and how they relate to bifurcations in periodic orbits is also presented.</description>

      <title>On a hyperbolic Duffing oscillator with linear damping and periodic forcing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01196v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Duffing oscillator describes the dynamics of a mass suspended on a spring with position-dependent stiffness. The mass is assumed to experience a linear damping and a time-dependent external forcing. The model has been instrumental in theoretical investigations of dynamical properties of systems with parity-conserving symmetry, where a double-well substrate connects two metastable states separated by a barrier. Physical systems of interest include nonlinear feedback-controlled mass-spring-damper oscillators, active hysteresis circuits (e.g. memristors), protein chains prone to hydrogen bond-mediated conformational transitions, centro-symmetric crystals and so on. In this work we consider a Duffing-type oscillator with a double-well potential represented by a hyperbolic function of mass position. The hyperbolic double-well potential has two degenerate minima that can be smoothly tuned by varying a deformability parameter, leaving unchanged the barrier height. We investigate solutions of the equation of motion in the absence and presence of damping and forcing. In the absence of perturbations numerical solutions lead to a periodic train of anharmonic oscillations featuring a crystal of pulse solitons of sech types. However, when the hyperbolic double-well potential is inverted, analytical solutions can be obtained which turn out to be kink-soliton crystals described by Jacobi elliptic functions. When damping and forcing are taken into consideration, the system dynamics can transit from periodic to chaotic phases or vice-versa via period-doubling or period-halving bifurcations, by simply varying the deformability parameter. The Poincar\'e map of the proposed model carries the well-known characteristic signatures of chaos presursors of the standard Duffing model, which happens to be just a particular case of the bistable oscillator model with the hyperbolic double-well potential.</description>

      <title>Transitions to Intermittent Chaos in Quorum Sensing Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14363v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study analyses the dynamical consequences of heterogeneous temporal delays within a quorum sensing-inspired (QS-inspired) system, specifically addressing the differential response kinetics of two subpopulations to signalling molecules. A nonlinear delay differential equation (DDE) model, predicated upon an activator-inhibitor framework, is formulated to represent the interspecies interactions. Key analytical techniques, including the derivation of the pseudo-characteristic polynomial and the determination of Hopf bifurcation criteria, are employed to investigate the stability properties of steady-state solutions. The analysis reveals the critical role of multiple, dissimilar delays in modulating system dynamics and inducing bifurcations. Numerical simulations, conducted in conjunction with analytical results, reveal the emergence of periodic self-sustained oscillations and intermittent chaotic behaviour. These observations emphasise the intricate relationship between temporal heterogeneity and the stability landscape of systems exhibiting QS-inspired dynamics. This interplay highlights the capacity for temporal variations to induce complex dynamical transitions within such systems. These findings assist to the comprehension of temporal dynamics within these and related systems, and may contribute to the development of strategies aimed at modulating intercellular communication and engineering synthetic biological systems with temporal control.</description>
