      <title>Describing the Numerical Range With Specht's Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use Specht's Theorem, which classifies when matrices are unitarily equivalent, to describe the numerical range of a matrix. In the case of $2$-by-$2$ matrices we recover the Elliptical Range Theorem, which shows that the numerical range of a $2$-by-$2$ matrix is an ellipse. We then show a specified point lies in the numerical range of a $3$-by-$3$ matrix if and only if a system of matrix trace equations is satisfied.</description>

      <title>Lower-Order Refinements of Greedy Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For two countable ordinals $\alpha$ and $\beta$, a basis of a Banach space $X$ is said to be $(\alpha, \beta)$-quasi-greedy if it is
  1) quasi-greedy,
  2) $\mathcal{S}_\alpha$-unconditional but not $\mathcal{S}_{\alpha+1}$-unconditional, and
  3) $\mathcal{S}_\beta$-democratic but not $\mathcal{S}_{\beta+1}$-democratic.
  If $\alpha$ or $\beta$ is replaced with $\infty$, then the basis is required to be unconditonal or democratic, respectively. Previous work constructed a $(0,0)$-quasi-greedy basis, an $(\alpha, \infty)$-quasi-greedy basis, and an $(\infty, \alpha)$-quasi-greedy basis. In this paper, we construct $(\alpha, \beta)$-quasi-greedy bases for $\beta\le \alpha+1$ (except the already solved case $\alpha = \beta = 0$).</description>

      <title>Banach space theoretical construction of (primitive) spectra of $C^*$-algebras and the Naimark problem revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Naimark problem asks whether $C^*$-algebras with singleton spectra are necessarily elementary. The separable case was solved affirmatively in 1953 by Rosenberg. In 2004, Akemann and Weaver gave a counterexample to the Naimark problem for non-separable $C^*$-algebras in the setting of ZFC $+~\diamondsuit_{\aleph_1}$, where $\diamondsuit_{\aleph_1}$ is Jensen's diamond principle. From this, at least, the affirmative answer to the Naimark problem can no longer be expected although a counterexample is not constructed in ZFC alone yet. In this paper, we study the difference between elementary $C^*$-algebras and those with singleton spectra, and find a property $P$ written in the language of closure operators such that a $C^*$-algebra is elementary if and only if it has the singleton spectrum and the property $P$. Banach space theoretical construction of (primitive) spectra of $C^*$-algebras plays important roles in the theory. Characterizations of type I or CCR or (sub)homogeneous $C^*$-algebras are also given. These results are applied to a geometric nonlinear classification problem for $C^*$-algebras.</description>

      <title>Some aspects of generalized Dunkl-Williams constant in Banach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article delves into an exploration of two innovative constants, namely DW(X,{\alpha},\b{eta}) and DWB (X,{\alpha},\b{eta}), both of which constitute extensions of the Dunkl-Williams constant. We derive both the upper and lower bounds for these two constants and establish two equivalent relations between them. Moreover, we elucidate the relationships between these constants and several well-known constants. Additionally, we have refined the value of the DWB (X,{\alpha},\b{eta}) constant in certain specific Banach spaces.</description>

      <title>Nehari's Theorem for Schatten class Hankel operators for convex domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently it was proven that for a convex subset of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ that has infinitely many extreme vectors, the Nehari theorem fails, that is, there exists a bounded Hankel operator $H_{\phi}$ on the Paley--Wiener space $PW(\Omega)$ that does not admit a bounded symbol. In this paper we examine whether Nehari's theorem can hold under the stronger assumption that the Hankel operator $H_{\phi}$ is in the Schatten class $S^{p}(PW(\Omega))$. We prove that this fails for $p&gt;4$ for any convex subset of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$, $n\geq2$, of boundary with a $C^{2}$ neighborhood of nonzero curvature. Furthermore we prove that for a simple polytope $P$ in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$, the inequality $$\int_{\mathbb{R}^{n}}\dfrac{|\widehat{f}(x)|^{2}}{m(P\cap (x-P))}dx\leq C\|f\|_{L^{1}}^{2},$$ holds for all $f\in PW^{1}(2P)$, and consequently any Hilbert--Schmidt Hankel operator on a Paley--Wiener space of a simple polytope is generated by a bounded function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we focus on the construction of multivariate fractal functions in Lebesgue spaces along with some properties of associated fractal operator. First, we give a detailed construction of the fractal functions belonging to Lebesgue spaces. Then, we give analytical properties of the defined fractal operator in Lebesgue spaces. We end this article by showing the existence of Schauder basis of the associated fractal functions for the space $\mathcal{L}^q(I^n, \mu_p)$.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the space of non-local Sobolev functions associated with an integral kernel. We prove an extension result, Sobolev and Poincar\'e inequalities and an isoperimetric inequality for the non-local perimeter restricted to a set. Finally, we remark on non-local isoperimetric problems, even when the underlying kernel is not necessarily radially symmetric.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The existence and uniqueness of weak solutions to a size-structured growth-coagulation-fragmentation (GCF) equation with a renewal boundary condition are shown for a class of unbounded coagulation and fragmentation kernels. The existence proof is based on a weak compactness framework in the weighted $L^1$-space. This result extends the existence results of Banasiak and Lamb [14] and Ackleh et al. [2,4]. Furthermore, we establish a stability result and derive uniqueness as a direct consequence of it. Moreover, this study explores the large time behavior of weak solutions.</description>

      <title>Duality for operator systems with generating cones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $S$ be a complete operator system with a generating cone; i.e. $S_\sa = S_+ - S_+$. We show that there is a matrix norm on the dual space $S^*$, under which, and the usual dual matrix cone, $S^*$ becomes a dual operator system with a generating cone, denoted by $S^\rd$. The canonical complete order isomorphism $\iota_{S^*}: S^* \to S^\rd$ is a dual Banach space isomorphism. Furthermore, we construct a canonical completely contractive weak$^*$-homeomorphism $\beta_S: (S^\rd)^\rd\to S^{**}$, and verify that it is a complete order isomorphism.
  For a complete operator system $T$ with a generating cone and a completely positive complete contraction $\varphi:S\to T$, there is a weak$^*$-continuous completely positive complete contraction $\varphi^\rd:T^\rd \to S^\rd$ with $\iota_{S^*}\circ \varphi^* = \varphi^\rd \circ \iota_{T^*}$. This produces a faithful functor from the category of complete operator systems with generating cones (where morphisms are completely positive complete contractions) to the category of dual operator systems with generating cones (where morphisms are weak$^*$-continuous completely positive complete contractions).
  We define the notion of approximately unital operator systems, and verify that operator systems considered in \cite{CvS} and \cite{CvS2} are approximately unital. If $S$ is approximately unital, then $\iota_{S^*}:S^* \to S^\rd$ is an operator space isomorphism and $\beta_S: (S^\rd)^\rd\to S^{**}$ is a complete isometry. We will also establish that the restriction of the faithful functor $(S,T,\varphi)\mapsto (T^\rd, S^\rd, \varphi^\rd)$ to the category of approximately unital complete operator systems is both full and injective on objects.</description>

      <title>Monotonicity of functionals associated to product measures via their Fourier transform and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mu$ be a probability measure on $\mathbb{R}$. We give conditions on the Fourier transform of its density for functionals of the form $H(a)=\int_{\mathbb{R}^n}h(\langle a,x\rangle)\mu^n(dx)$ to be Schur monotone. As applications, we put certain known and new results under the same umbrella, given by a condition on the Fourier transform of the density. These results include certain moment comparisons for independent and identically distributed random vectors, when the norm is given by intersection bodies, and the corresponding vector Khinchin inequalities. We also extend the discussion to higher dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1901.10261v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply Wermuth's theorem on commuting operator exponentials to show that if $A, B \in B(X)$, $X$ being Banach space and $A$ of $2\pi i$-congruence free spectrum, then $e^A B = B e^A$ if and only if $AB=BA$. We employ this observation to provide alternative proof of similar result by Chaban and Mortad, applicable for $X$ being a Hilbert space.</description>

      <title>A Lagrangian approach to totally dissipative evolutions in Wasserstein spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.05211v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce and study the class of totally dissipative multivalued probability vector fields (MPVF) $\boldsymbol{\mathrm F}$ on the Wasserstein space $(\mathcal{P}_2(\mathsf{X}),W_2)$ of Euclidean or Hilbertian probability measures. We show that such class of MPVFs is in one to one correspondence with law-invariant dissipative operators in a Hilbert space $L^2(\Omega,\mathcal{B},\mathbb{P};\mathsf{X})$ of random variables, preserving a natural maximality property. This allows us to import in the Wasserstein framework many of the powerful tools from the theory of maximal dissipative operators in Hilbert spaces, deriving existence, uniqueness, stability, and approximation results for the flow generated by a maximal totally dissipative MPVF and the equivalence of its Eulerian and Lagrangian characterizations. We will show that demicontinuous single-valued probability vector fields satisfying a metric dissipativity condition are in fact totally dissipative. Starting from a sufficiently rich set of discrete measures, we will also show how to recover a unique maximal totally dissipative version of a MPVF, proving that its flow provides a general mean field characterization of the asymptotic limits of the corresponding family of discrete particle systems.Such an approach also reveals new interesting structural properties for gradient flows of displacement convex functionals with a core of discrete measures dense in energy.</description>

      <title>On Subspaces of Indecomposable Banach Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12382v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the following question: what is the class of Banach spaces isomorphic to subspaces of indecomposable Banach spaces? We show that this class includes all Banach spaces of density not bigger than the continuum which do not admit $\ell_\infty$ as a quotient (equivalently do not admit a subspace isomorphic to $\ell_1(\cc)$). This includes all Asplund spaces and all weakly Lindel\"of determined Banach spaces of density not bigger than the continuum. However, we also show that this class includes some Banach spaces admitting $\ell_\infty$ as a quotient. This sheds some light on the question asked in [S. Argyros, R. Haydon, \emph{Bourgain-Delbaen $L^\infty$-spaces, the scalar-plus-compact property and related problems}, Proceedings of the International Congress of Mathematicians (ICM 2018), Vol. III, 1477--1510. Page 1502] whether all Banach spaces not containing $\ell_\infty$ embed in some indecomposable Banach spaces. Our method of constructing indecomposable Banach spaces above a given Banach space is a considerable modification of the method of constructing Banach spaces of continuous functions with few$^*$ operators developed before by the first-named author.</description>

      <title>Iterated convolution inequalities on Riemannian Symmetric Spaces of non-compact type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05257v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For $G$ a connected, non-compact, semi-simple Lie group with finite center and $K$ a maximal compact subgroup of $G$, we study the $K$-biinvariant, real-valued solutions $f \in L^1(G)$ of the iterated convolution inequality \begin{equation*} f \ge \displaystyle\sum_{n=2}^N a_n \left(*^n f\right) \:, \end{equation*} where $N \ge 2$ is an integer, for $2 \le n \le N$, $a_n$ are non-negative integers with at least one of them positive and \begin{equation*} *^n f = \underbrace{f * \cdots *f }_{n-times}\:. \end{equation*} We prove that $f$ must be non-negative and satisfy the non-trivial bound $\|f\|_{L^1(G)}\le t_{\mathcal{Q}}$ where \begin{equation*} \mathcal{Q}(t):=t-\displaystyle\sum_{n=2}^N a_n\:t^n\:, \end{equation*} and $t_{\mathcal{Q}}$ is the unique zero of $\mathcal{Q}'$ in $(0,\infty)$. Our arguments involve Spherical Fourier Analysis on Riemannian Symmetric Spaces of non-compact type and Complex analysis. We then apply our result to obtain an a priori estimate for solutions of an integro-differential equation which is related to the physical problem of the ground state energy of the Bose gas in the classical Euclidean setting. Our results are new even for $\mathbb{R}^n$ and generalize recent works by Carlen-Jauslin-Lieb-Loss (Int Math Res Not 24:18604-18612, 2021) and Nakamura-Sawano (J Geom Anal 35:68, 2025) for two-fold and $m$-fold monomial convolution inequalities respectively, on $\mathbb{R}^n$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15628v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently the Kac formula for the conditional expectation of the first recurrence time of a conditionally ergodic conditional expectation preserving system was established in the measure free setting of vector lattices (Riesz spaces). We now give a formulation of the Kakutani-Rokhlin decomposition for conditionally ergodic systems in terms of components of weak order units in a vector lattice. In addition, we prove that every aperiodic conditional expectation preserving system can be approximated by a periodic system.</description>

      <title>Spectral analysis of Dirac operators for dislocated potentials with a purely imaginary jump</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06480v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we present a complete spectral analysis of Dirac operators with non-Hermitian matrix potentials of the form $i\operatorname{sgn}(x)+V(x)$ where $V\in L^1$. For $V=0$ we compute explicitly the matrix Green function. This allows us to determine the spectrum, which is purely essential, and its different types. It also allows us to find sharp enclosures for the pseudospectrum and its complement, in all parts of the complex plane. Notably, this includes the instability region, corresponding to the interior of the band that forms the numerical range. Then, with the help of a Birman-Schwinger principle, we establish in precise manner how the spectrum and pseudospectrum change when $V\not=0$, assuming the hypotheses $\|V\|_{L^1}&lt;1$ or $V\in L^1\cap L^p$ where $p&gt;1$. We show that the essential spectra remain unchanged and that the $\varepsilon$-pseudospectrum stays close to the instability region for small $\varepsilon$. We determine sharp asymptotic for the discrete spectrum, whenever $V$ satisfies further conditions of decay at infinity. Finally, in one of our main findings, we give a complete description of the weakly-coupled model.</description>
