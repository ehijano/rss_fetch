      <title>Intermediate bond-order-wave phase and nature of the order-to-order transition in the one-dimensional Hubbard-Holstein model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hubbard-Holstein model is one of the central models that describe the competition between electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions. In one dimension and at half-filling, the interplay between an electronic spin-density wave and a phonon-driven charge-density wave is considered to stabilize an intermediate Luther-Emery liquid. Here we show that, once the extended metallic regime disappears, a narrow bond-order-wave phase emerges. We use an exact directed-loop quantum Monte Carlo method for retarded interactions to simulate system sizes of several hundred sites, necessary to observe the weak signatures of this novel phase. Our results suggest a second-order quantum phase transition between the two charge orders that only turns first-order at strong coupling. Our findings are reminiscent of the extended Hubbard model, but they are driven by competing frequency dependencies of the same dynamically-screened Hubbard interaction.</description>

      <title>Topological charge excitations and Green's function zeros in paramagnetic Mott insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of topological features in the charge excitations of Mott insulators in the Chern-Hubbard model. In the strong correlation regime, treating electrons as the sum of holons and doublons excitations, we compute the topological phase diagram of Mott insulators at half-filling using composite operator formalism. The Green function zeros manifest as the tightly bound pairs of such elementary excitations of the Mott insulators. Our analysis examines the winding number associated with the occupied Hubbard bands and the band of Green's function zeros. We show that both the poles and zeros show gapless states and zeros, respectively, in line with bulk-boundary correspondence. The gapless edge states emerge in a junction geometry connecting a topological Mott band insulator and a topological Mott zeros phase. These include an edge electronic state that carries a charge and a charge-neutral gapless zero mode. Our study is relevant to several twisted materials with flat bands where interactions play a dominant role.</description>

      <title>Density Matrix Renormalization Group simulations of the SU(N) Fermi-Hubbard chain implementing the full SU(N) symmetry via Semi-Standard Young Tableaux and Unitary Group Subduction Coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have developed an efficient method for performing density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations of the SU(N) Fermi-Hubbard chain with open boundary conditions, fully leveraging the SU(N) symmetry of the problem. This method extends a previously developed approach for the SU(N) Heisenberg model and relies on the systematic use of the semi-standard Young tableaux (SSYT) basis in a DMRG algorithm `a la White. Specifically, the method aligns the site-by-site growth process of the infinite-size part of the DMRG, in its original formulation, with the site-by-site construction of the SSYT (or Gelfand-like) basis, based on the chain of unitary subgroups $U(1)\subset U(2) \subset U(3) \subset U(4)\cdots $. We give special emphasis to the calculation of the symmetry-resolved reduced matrix elements of the hopping terms between the left and the right block, which makes direct use of the basis of SSYT and of the Gelfand-Tsetlin coefficients, offering a computational advantage in scaling with N compared to alternative methods that rely on summing over Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. Focusing on the model with homogeneous hopping between nearest neighbors, we have calculated the ground state energy as a function of U, i.e the atom-atom interaction amplitude, up to N=6 for filling 1/N (one particle per site in average), and for one atom (resp. hole) away from filling 1/N, alllowing us to compute the charge gaps, and to estimate in the thermodynamical limit, the critical value $U_c$, separating the Mott insulator from the metallic phase. Central charges c are extracted from the entanglement entropy using the Calabrese-Cardy formula, and are consistent with the theoretical predictions: c=N-1, expected from the $SU(N)_1$ Wess-Zumino-Witten CFTs in the spin sector for the Mott phase, and c=N in the metallic phase, reflecting the presence of one additional (charge) gapless critical mode.</description>

      <title>Revealing the anisotropic charge-density-wave order of TiSe$_2$ through high harmonic generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Titanium diselenide (TiSe$_{2}$) is a transition-metal dichalcogenide material that undergoes a charge-density-wave (CDW) transition at $T_{c}\approx 200\,\mathrm{K}$. In a recent experiment [I. Tyulnev et al., arXiv:2409.04216], the high harmonic generation (HHG) spectra of this material has been studied, which exhibits asymmetric behavior with respect to the polarization angle of the incident light and provides a new perspective to the CDW phase transition. In this work, we work out a theoretical explanation for the experimentally observed behavior of HHG spectra. We propose a simplified phenomenological mean-field model for this material, based on which the HHG spectra is calculated through the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation. This model correctly describes the measured intensity distribution of the third-, fifth-, and seventh-order harmonic generation as a function of polarization direction and reveals a strong asymmetry due to the anisotropic CDW order in the low temperature phase. Our work provides a basis for applying high harmonic spectroscopy to reveal a new perspective on the nature of CDW orders.</description>

      <title>Two types of colossal magnetoresistance with distinct mechanisms in Eu5In2As6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent reports of colossal negative magnetoresistance (CMR) in a few magnetic semimetals and semiconductors have attracted attention, because these materials are devoid of the conventional mechanisms of CMR such as mixed valence, double exchange interaction, and Jahn-Teller distortion. New mechanisms have thus been proposed, including topological band structure, ferromagnetic clusters, orbital currents, and charge ordering. The CMR in these compounds has been reported in two forms: either a resistivity peak or a resistivity upturn suppressed by a magnetic field. Here we reveal both types of CMR in a single antiferromagnetic semiconductor Eu5In2As6. Using the transport and thermodynamic measurements, we demonstrate that the peak-type CMR is likely due to the percolation of magnetic polarons with increasing magnetic field, while the upturn-type CMR is proposed to result from the melting of a charge order under the magnetic field. We argue that similar mechanisms operate in other compounds, offering a unifying framework to understand CMR in seemingly different materials.</description>

      <title>Distinct amplitude mode dynamics upon resonant and off-resonant excitation across the charge density wave energy gap in LaTe3 investigated by time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-equilibrium states generated by ultrafast laser pulses are characterized by specific phenomena that are not accessible in static measurements. Previous time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (TARPES) studies on rare-earth tritelluride materials have revealed the laser-driven melting of the charge density wave order as well as its collective amplitude mode excitation. Variation of the excess energy deposited by optical pumping in the material promises pathways to control the dynamic material response. To this end, we use an optical parametric amplifier to generate a tunable pump photon energy. Studying LaTe3 we compare the dynamics driven by pumping resonantly across the charge density wave energy gap with the effect of pumping at a twice higher photon energy in a TARPES pump-probe experiment. We clearly identify a pump photon energy dependent behavior. At the larger pump photon energy, the excess electronic energy generates lattice heating mediated by e-ph coupling and softening of the amplitude mode frequency from 3 to 2 THz. Remarkably, the resonant pumping across the CDW gap results in a time-independent amplitude mode frequency. We conclude that the resonant excitation across the energy gap excites the amplitude mode selectively while additional electronic excess energy deposited at higher pump photon energy modifies the crystal properties transiently by incoherent dissipative processes.</description>

      <title>The large $|U|$ expansion for a half-filled asymmetric Hubbard model on a triangular ladder in the presence of spin-dependent magnetic flux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a half-filled system of spin-1/2 fermions with spin-dependent hopping on a triangular ladder in the presence of spin-dependent flux penetrating the lattice. Using the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation, we derive an effective spin (pseudospin i.e.\ charge) Hamiltonian describing the infrared properties of the system in the limit of strong on-site repulsion (attraction). The expansion is performed up to the third order in the hopping amplitude over on-site energy. It is shown that the low-energy spin (charge) excitations are described by an anisotropic ${\gamma \geqslant 1}$ $XXZ$ Heisenberg model with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction and an unconventional three-spin (correlated exchange) term in the presence of an extended magnetic field. The magnetic field couples not only to $z$-projection of the total spin on a triangular plaquette but also to the product of $z$-components of three spins located on vertices of the triangle. In the limiting case of spin-symmetric flux, the magnetic field and the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya term are absent and the three-spin term reduces to the standard scalar spin chirality term $\sim \mathbf{S}_i \cdot\left[\mathbf{S}_j \times \mathbf{S}_k\right]$. In the case of strong attractive interaction, the corresponding effective model is derived from the repulsive one using the one-spin-component particle-hole transformation. The effective Hamiltonian is given by the same $XXZ$ Heisenberg model, as in the repulsive case, but in terms of pseudospin ($\eta$-charge) operators. The magnetic field and the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya term vanish in the limit of anti-symmetric flux (modulo $\pi$) configuration. In the latter case the three-spin coupling term is given by the scalar pseudospin chirality operator $\sim \mathbf{\eta}_i \cdot \left[\mathbf{\eta}_j \times \mathbf{\eta}_k\right]$.</description>

      <title>Correlated interaction effects in an anisotropic flat band fermion system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An anisotropic flat band fermion system with a novel dispersion that is linear along one direction and cubic along another is proposed in Phys. Rev. X. 13, 021012 (2023). We study the effects of Coulomb interaction in this fermion system by renormalization group theory and Dyson-Schwinger gap equation. We perform renormalizaton group analysis and find that fermion velocity is always restored along the direction that the fermions take cubic dispersion originally. Accordingly, the system takes the similar behaviors to the two-dimensional Dirac fermion system with Coulomb interaction in the low energy regime. Based on Dyson-Schwinger gap equation method, we find that an excitonic gap is generated if the Coulomb strength is large enough, and the system becomes a novel excitonic Chern insulator with quantized anomalous Hall conductivity. Observable quantities of this system in free case, under weak and strong enough Coulomb interaction are all analyzed.</description>

      <title>Coarsening dynamics of Ising-nematic order in a frustrated Heisenberg antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the phase ordering dynamics of the classical antiferromagnetic $J_1$-$J_2$ (nearest-neighbor and next-nearest-neighbor couplings) Heisenberg model on the square lattice in the strong frustration regime ($J_2/J_1 &gt; 1/2$). While thermal fluctuations preclude any long-range magnetic order at finite temperatures, the system exhibits a long-range spin-driven nematic phase at low temperatures. The transition into the nematic phase is further shown to belong to the two-dimensional Ising universality class based on the critical exponents near the phase transition. Our large-scale stochastic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert simulations find a two-stage phase ordering when the system is quenched from a high-temperature paramagnetic state into the nematic phase. In the early stage, collinear alignments of spins lead to a locally saturated Ising-nematic order. Once domains of well-defined Ising order are developed, the late-stage relaxation is dominated by curvature-driven domain coarsening, as described by the Allen-Cahn equation. The characteristic size of Ising-nematic domains scales as the square root of time, similar to the kinetic Ising model described by the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau theory. Our results confirm that the late-stage ordering kinetics of the spin-driven nematic, which is a vestigial order of the frustrated Heisenberg model, belongs to the dynamical universality class of a non-conserved Ising order. Interestingly, the system shows no violation of the superuniversality hypothesis under weak bond disorder. The dynamic scaling invariance is preserved in the presence of weak bond disorder. We also discuss possible applications of our results to materials for which vestigial Ising-nematic order is realized.</description>

      <title>High-resolution nonequilibrium $GW$ calculations based on quantics tensor trains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the challenges in diagrammatic simulations of nonequilibrium phenomena in lattice models is the large memory demand for storing momentum-dependent two-time correlation functions. This problem can be overcome with the recently introduced quantics tensor train (QTT) representation of multivariable functions. Here, we demonstrate nonequilibrium $GW$ simulations with high momentum resolution, up to times which exceed the capabilities of standard implementations and are long enough to study, e.g., thermalization dynamics and transient Floquet physics during multi-cycle electric field pulses. The self-consistent calculation on the three-leg Kadanoff-Baym contour employs only QTT-compressed functions, and input functions which are either generated directly in QTT form, or obtained via quantics tensor cross interpolation.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional spin helix and magnon-induced singularity in twisted bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twisted bilayer graphene exhibits two prominent correlated phenomena in distinct regimes: a Kondo lattice near the magic angle, resembling heavy fermion systems, and a triangular correlated domain wall network under interlayer bias, akin to sliding Luttinger liquids previously introduced for cuprates. Combining these characteristics, here we investigate a system where interacting electrons in the domain wall network couple to localized spins. Owing to inter-domain-wall correlations, a two-dimensional spin helix phase emerges as a result of spatial phase coherence across parallel domain walls. Within the spin helix phase, magnons can induce a singularity in the scaling dimensions of various operators, accessible by adjusting the interaction strength between electrons. We predict observable features in magnetic resonance and anisotropic paramagnetic spin susceptibility for the spin helix and the magnon-induced singularity, serving as experimental indicators of the interplay between the Kondo lattice and sliding Luttinger liquids.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Screening of Local Spin Moments at Metal-Molecule Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transition-metal phthalocyanine molecules have attracted considerable interest in the context of spintronics device development due to their amenability to diverse bonding regimes and their intrinsic magnetism. The latter is highly influenced by the quantum fluctuations that arise at the inevitable metal-molecule interface in a device architecture. In this study, we have systematically investigated the dynamical screening effects in phthalocyanine molecules hosting a series of transition-metal ions (Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni) in contact with the Cu(111) surface. Using comprehensive density functional theory plus Anderson's Impurity Model calculations, we show that the orbital-dependent hybridization and electron correlation together result in strong charge and spin fluctuations. While the instantaneous spin moments of the transition-metal ions are near atomic-like, we find that screening gives rise to considerable lowering or even quenching of these. Our results highlight the importance of quantum fluctuations in metal-contacted molecular devices, which may influence the results obtained from theoretical or experimental probes, depending on their possibly material-dependent characteristic sampling time-scales.</description>

      <title>Inhomogeneous SU(2) symmetries in homogeneous integrable U(1) circuits and transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09371v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study symmetries of quantum circuits with nearest-neighbor U(1) gates discovering new inhomogeneous screw SU(2) and ${\rm U}_q({\rm sl}_2)$ symmetries. Despite the model being homogeneous -- all gates are the same -- symmetry generators are not. Rather, they exhibit an even-odd staggering and a nonzero quasi-momentum, and depend on gate parameters. Such parameter-dependent symmetries can be identified by the Ruelle-Pollicott spectrum of a momentum-resolved truncated propagator. They can be thought of as a generalization of the standard SU(2) symmetry of the XXZ model that uppon introducing the staggered field splits into a local SU(2) symmetry and a non-local ${\rm U}_q({\rm sl}_2)$. Picking an arbitrary U(1) gate and varying the gate duration one will transition through different phases: fractal ballistic transport, Kardar-Parisi-Zhang superdiffusion at the critical manifold including superdiffusive helix states, and diffusion within which there is also localization. To correctly explain transport the non-local SU(2) symmetries do not matter, while the inhomogeneous local ones that almost commute with the propagator do.</description>

Abstract: Ordered phases of matter have close connections to computation. Two prominent examples are spin glass order, with wide-ranging applications in machine learning and optimization, and topological order, closely related to quantum error correction. Here, we introduce the concept of topological quantum spin glass (TQSG) order which marries these two notions, exhibiting both the complex energy landscapes of spin glasses, and the quantum memory and long-range entanglement characteristic of topologically ordered systems. Using techniques from coding theory and a quantum generalization of Gibbs state decompositions, we show that TQSG order is the low-temperature phase of various quantum LDPC codes on expander graphs, including hypergraph and balanced product codes. Our work introduces a topological analog of spin glasses that preserves quantum information, opening new avenues for both statistical mechanics and quantum computer science.</description>

      <title>The SU(N) Fermi-Hubbard Model on two sites: Bethe Ansatz solution and Quantum Phase Transition of the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick Model in the large-N limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the SU(N) Fermi-Hubbard model (FHM) on two sites, where N is the number of flavors of each fermion, corresponds to an exactly solvable two-level many-boson model that R.W. Richardson analytically solved long time ago. We express the Bethe ansatz solutions as a function of the physical parameters of the SU(N) FHM, and recast its eigenvalues and eigenstates in terms of the Richardson pair energies and creation operators. %In this framework the so-called exponential complexity of the system, whose total Hilbert space dimension scales as $4^N$, collapses, leaving In this context, the connection with the well studied Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick (LMG) model, known as equivalent to the Richardson model, is established and serves as a guideline to the prediction of some N-body physics phenomena in the two-sites SU(N) FHM with N particles. In particular, the LMG second order Quantum Phase Transition (QPT) is shown to occur in the $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ FHM for an attractive density density interaction U equal to $U_c=-1/(2N)$, in units of the (absolute value of the) tunneling amplitude between the two sites. We show the finite size energies, the gap, and the kinetic energy which all reveal the transition, as a function of U for values of N from N=3 to N=36, suggesting that the QPT could be experimentally achieved with current technologies involving SU(N) ultracold atoms or molecules. Finally, we show the entanglement entropy of the first site with respect to the second, and it scales like $N$ at the transition, in contrast with several two-modes models.</description>

      <title>Parastatistics and a secret communication challenge</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the most unconventional features of topological phases of matter is the emergence of quasiparticles with exotic statistics, such as non-Abelian anyons in two dimensional systems. Recently, a different type of exotic particle statistics that is consistently defined in any dimension, called parastatistics, is also shown to be possible in a special family of topological phases. Here we demonstrate a distinctive physical consequence of parastatistics by proposing a challenge game that can only be won using physical systems hosting paraparticles, as passing the challenge requires the two participating players to secretly communicate in an indirect way by exploiting the nontrivial exchange statistics of the quasiparticles. The winning strategy using emergent paraparticles is robust against noise, as well as the most relevant class of eavesdropping via local measurements. This provides both an operational definition and an experimental identity test for paraparticles, alongside a potential application in secret communication.</description>

      <title>Projective purification of correlated reduced density matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the search for accurate approximate solutions of the many-body Schr\"odinger equation, reduced density matrices play an important role, as they allow to formulate approximate methods with polynomial scaling in the number of particles. However, these methods frequently encounter the issue of $N$-representability, whereby in self-consistent applications of the methods, the reduced density matrices become unphysical. A number of algorithms have been proposed in the past to restore a given set of $N$-representability conditions once the reduced density matrices become defective. However, these purification algorithms have either ignored symmetries of the Hamiltonian related to conserved quantities, or have not incorporated them in an efficient way, thereby modifying the reduced density matrix to a greater extent than is necessary. In this paper, we present an algorithm capable of efficiently performing all of the following tasks in the least invasive manner: restoring a given set of $N$-representability conditions, maintaining contraction consistency between successive orders of reduced density matrices, and preserving all conserved quantities. We demonstrate the superiority of the present purification algorithm over previous ones in the context of the time-dependent two-particle reduced density matrix method applied to the quench dynamics of the Fermi-Hubbard model.</description>

      <title>Spin correlations in the parent phase of Li$_{1-x}$Fe$_x$ODFeSe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Elucidating spin correlations in the parent compounds of high-temperature superconductors is crucial for understanding superconductivity. We used neutron scattering to study spin correlations in Li$_{1-x}$Fe$_x$ODFeSe, an insulating material with reduced electron carriers compared to its superconducting counterpart ($T_c$ = 41 K), serving as the undoped parent compound. Our findings show a reduced total fluctuating moment in this insulator relative to FeSe and 122 iron pnictides, likely due to increased interlayer distances from intercalation, which enhance fluctuations and reduce the intensity of spin excitations. Moreover, we observed a V-shaped spin wave-like excitation dispersion, contrasting with the twisted hourglass pattern in the superconducting counterpart. Electron doping shifts spin excitation from ($\pi$, 0) point to an incommensurate position towards ($\pi$, $\pi$) direction below 65 meV. This transition from V-shaped to hourglass-like dispersion, akin to behaviors in hole-doped cuprates, suggests a potential shared mechanism in magnetism and superconductivity across these diverse systems.</description>

      <title>Turning qubit noise into a blessing: Automatic state preparation and long-time dynamics for impurity models on quantum computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Noise is often regarded as a limitation of quantum computers. In this work, we show that in the dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) approach to strongly-correlated systems, it can actually be harnessed to our advantage. Indeed, DMFT maps a lattice model onto an impurity model, namely a finite system coupled to a dissipative bath. While standard approaches require a large number of high-quality qubits in a unitary context, we propose a circuit that harvests amplitude damping to reproduce the dynamics of this model with a blend of noisy and noiseless qubits. We find compelling advantages with this approach: a substantial reduction in the number of qubits, the ability to reach longer time dynamics, and no need for ground state search and preparation. This method would naturally fit in a partial quantum error correction framework.</description>

      <title>Exceptional stationary state in a dephasing many-body open quantum system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a dephasing many-body open quantum system that hosts, together with the infinite-temperature state, another additional stationary state. The latter is exceptional in many respects, as it is pure and retains memory of the initial condition, whereas any orthogonal state evolves towards the infinite-temperature state erasing any information on the initial state. We discuss the approach to stationarity of the model focusing in particular on the fate of interfaces between the two states; a simple classical model based on a membrane picture helps developing an effective hydrodynamic theory even if the dynamics does not feature any conserved quantity. The fact that the model reaches stationary properties on timescales that depend on the system size while the asymptotic decay rate is finite is duly highlighted. We point out the reasons for considering these exceptional stationary states as quantum many-body scars in the open system framework.</description>

      <title>Oscillators with imaginary coupling: spectral functions in quantum mechanics and quantum field theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The axioms of Quantum Mechanics require that the hamiltonian of any closed system is self-adjoint, so that energy levels are real and time evolution preserves probability. On the other hand, non-hermitian hamiltonians with ${\cal{PT}}$-symmetry can have both real spectra and unitary time evolution. In this paper, we study in detail a pair of quantum oscillators coupled by an imaginary bilinear term, both in quantum mechanics and in quantum field theory. We discuss explicitly how such hamiltonians lead to perfectly sound physical theories with real spectra and unitary time evolution, in spite of their non-hermiticity. We also analyze two-point correlation functions and their associated K\"allen-Lehmann representation. In particular, we discuss the intimate relation between positivity violation of the spectral functions and the non-observability of operators in a given correlation function. Finally, we conjecture that positivity violation of some spectral functions of the theory could be a generic sign of the existence of complex pairs of energy eigenvalues (i.e., a ${\cal{PT}}$-broken phase) somewhere in its parameter space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetry-resolved entanglement, capturing the refined structure of quantum entanglement in systems with global symmetries, has attracted a lot of attention recently. In this manuscript, introducing the notion of symmetry-resolved generalized entropies, we aim to develop a computational framework suitable for the study of excited state symmetry-resolved entanglement as well as the dynamical evolution of symmetry-resolved entanglement in symmetry-preserving out-of-equilibrium settings. We illustrate our framework using the example of (1+1)-d free massless compact boson theory, and benchmark our results using lattice computation in the XX chain. As a byproduct, our computational framework also provides access to the probability distribution of the symmetry charge contained within a subsystem and the corresponding full counting statistics.</description>

      <title>Theory of robust quantum many-body scars in long-range interacting systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.12504v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum many-body scars (QMBS) are exceptional energy eigenstates of quantum many-body systems associated with violations of thermalization for special non-equilibrium initial states. Their various systematic constructions require fine-tuning of local Hamiltonian parameters. In this work we demonstrate that long-range interacting quantum spin systems generically host robust QMBS. We analyze spectral properties upon raising the power-law decay exponent $\alpha$ of spin-spin interactions from the solvable permutationally-symmetric limit $\alpha=0$. First, we numerically establish that despite spectral signatures of chaos appear for infinitesimal $\alpha$, the towers of $\alpha=0$ energy eigenstates with large collective spin are smoothly deformed as $\alpha$ is increased, and exhibit characteristic QMBS features. To elucidate the nature and fate of these states in larger systems, we introduce an analytical approach based on mapping the spin Hamiltonian onto a relativistic quantum rotor non-linearly coupled to an extensive set of bosonic modes. We analitycally solve for the eigenstates of this interacting impurity model by means of a novel polaron-type canonical transformation, and show their self-consistent localization in large-spin sectors of the original Hamiltonian for $0&lt;\alpha&lt;d$ (with $d$ = spatial dimension of the lattice). Our theory unveils the stability mechanism of such QMBS for arbitrary system size and predicts instances of its breakdown, e.g. near dynamical critical points or in presence of semiclassical chaos, which we verify numerically in long-range quantum Ising chains. As a byproduct, we find a predictive criterion for presence or absence of heating under periodic driving for $0&lt;\alpha&lt;d$, beyond existing Floquet-prethermalization theorems.</description>

Abstract: In this study, a novel material from the rare-earth based breathing pyrochlore family, Ba3Tm2Zn5O11, was successfully synthesized. Powder x-ray diffraction and high-resolution powder neutron diffraction confirmed phase purity and the F-43m breathing pyrochlore crystal structure, while thermogravimetric analysis revealed incongruent melting behavior compared to its counterpart, Ba3Yb2Zn5O11. High-quality single crystals of Ba3Tm2Zn5O11 were grown using the traveling solvent floating zone technique and assessed using Laue x-ray diffraction and single crystal x-ray diffraction. Thermodynamic characterization indicated paramagnetic behavior down to 0.05 K, and inelastic neutron scattering measurements identified distinct dispersionless crystal electric field energy bands, with the fitted crystal electric field model predicting a single-ion singlet ground state and an energy gap of ~9 meV separating it from the first excited (singlet) state. Additional low-energy excitation studies on single crystals revealed dispersionless bands at 0.8 and 1 meV. Computed phonon dispersions from first-principles calculations ruled out phonons as the origin of these modes, further illustrating the puzzling and unique properties of Ba3Tm2Zn5O11.</description>

      <title>Magnetic properties and field-induced phenomena in the Jeff = 1/2 distorted kagome antiferromagnet</title>

Abstract: The intertwining between competing degrees of freedom, anisotropy, and frustration-induced quantum fluctuations offers an ideal ground to realize exotic quantum phenomena in the rare-earth-based kagome lattice. The magnetic susceptibility reveals the presence of two energy scales in agreement with the INS results. The higher energy state is dominated by CEF excitations, where the lowest Kramers ground-state doublet is well separated from the excited state suggesting that the compound realizes a low-energy state at low temperatures. The second energy scale is witnessed via thermodynamic results that reveal an anomaly at 0.3 K typical of a phase transition, which is attributed to the presence of complex magnetic ordering phenomena. The broad maximum in the specific heat well above 0.3 K indicates the presence of short-range spin correlations that is corroborated by muon spin relaxation rate results. The isothermal magnetization reveals a field-induced 1/3 magnetization plateau at low temperatures. muSR relaxation rate experiments, on the other hand, neither show the signature of a phase transition nor spin-freezing down to 34 mK. The ZF muSR relaxation is governed by the Orbach process and reveals the presence of a fluctuating state owing to the depopulation of crystal field levels reflected as a constant value of relaxation rate in the temperature range 0.4-10 K. NMR results indicate the presence of fluctuating Nd3+ moments down to 1.8 K consistent with muSR experiments. Our comprehensive results reveal that a field-induced quantum critical phenomenon is at play in this frustrated kagome magnet and enable us to construct a phase diagram exemplifying the proximity effect of competing magnetic states. This sets the stage to investigate the broad RE3BWO9 family of rare-earth kagome magnets promising to host exotic quantum states driven by spin-orbit coupling and geometrical frustration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.10673v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The superconducting metal-organic framework Cu-BHT forms a kagome lattice with metals at the vertices and ligands along the bonds. This bipartite motif is common in reticular materials. We show that a tight-binding model on this lattice yields partially occupied interference-induced flat bands at half-filling with large gaps between them and all other bands. Long-range hopping induces curvature in the bands but leaves them flatter and more isolated than those in twisted bilayer graphene. The slave boson theory of the t-J model on this lattice shows highly unconventional superconductivity including an f -wave singlet phase. Thus, framework materials provide an ideal lattice-driven approach to strongly correlated phenomena in flat bands at high electronic densities.</description>

Abstract: We consider a system of interacting fermions on the three-dimensional torus in the mean-field scaling limit. Our objective is computing the occupation number of the Fourier modes in a trial state obtained through the random phase approximation for the ground state. Our result shows that -- in the trial state -- the momentum distribution has a jump discontinuity, i. e., the system has a well-defined Fermi surface. Moreover the Fermi momentum does not depend on the interaction potential (it is universal).</description>
