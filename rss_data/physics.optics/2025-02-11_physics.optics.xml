      <title>Chirality-selective optical transport of nanoparticles in the evanescent field of a nanofiber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical nanofibers are waveguides known for their unique property to produce intense evanescent fields which have subwavelength transverse confinement easily extendable over thousands of wavelengths along the fiber axis. Moreover, circularly polarized fundamental modes of a nanofiber are chiral, that is, lacking mirror symmetry. Here, we use these two properties to demonstrate chirality-selective optical transport of a waterborne chiral material object - a chemically synthesized gold nanocube with twisted faces. Our experiments, supported by numerical simulations, show that right- and left-handed circularly polarized modes produce clearly distinct velocities of optically trapped nanocubes along the nanofiber axis, whereas non-chiral gold nanospheres of a similar size do not show any such dissymmetry. Furthermore, using a counterpropagating mode configuration, the non-chiral component of the optical force can be effectively zeroed out, yielding selective forward and backward transport of chiral nanocubes. In addition, the chiral optical force was found to be significant even for particle ensembles with natural variations in size and form, showing average behavior in agreement with numerical simulations. This is a clear implementation of optical separation of chiral enantiomers at the scale of 100 nm. Further development towards waveguide-assisted enantio-selective manipulation approaching the molecular scale can be envisaged.</description>

      <title>High-Order Exceptional Point-Based Rotation Sensing in Anti-Parity time Symmetric Microresonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs), which arise from non-Hermitian systems, have been extensively investigated for the development of high-performance gyroscopes. However, operating a non-Hermitian gyroscope at high-order EP (HOEP) to achieve extreme performance requires strict and precise control of parameters. Here, we propose the design of an anti-parity-time (anti-PT) symmetric optical gyroscope operating at a fourth-order EP, achieving both ultra-sensitivity and high robustness. Our configuration exhibits eigenfrequency splitting two orders of magnitude higher than that of anti-PT gyroscopes operating at second-order EP. Furthermore, we demonstrate a significant reduction in angular random walk (ARW) under noise limits, compared to anti-parity symmetric gyroscopes based on second-order EP. Our results provide a novel approach for developing high-sensitivity rotation detection based on HOEPs.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable nonlinear optical computing device for retina-inspired computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical neural networks are at the forefront of computational innovation, utilizing photons as the primary carriers of information and employing optical components for computation. However, the fundamental nonlinear optical device in the neural networks is barely satisfied because of its high energy threshold and poor reconfigurability. This paper proposes and demonstrates an optical sigmoid-type nonlinear computation mode of Vertical-Cavity Surface-Emitting Lasers (VCSELs) biased beneath the threshold. The device is programmable by simply adjusting the injection current. The device exhibits sigmoid-type nonlinear performance at a low input optical power ranging from merely 3-250 {\mu}W. The tuning sensitivity of the device to the programming current density can be as large as 15 {\mu}W*mm2/mA. Deep neural network architecture based on such device has been proposed and demonstrated by simulation on recognizing hand-writing digital dataset, and a 97.3% accuracy has been achieved. A step further, the nonlinear reconfigurability is found to be highly useful to enhance the adaptability of the networks, which is demonstrated by significantly improving the recognition accuracy by 41.76%, 19.2%, and 25.89% of low-contrast hand-writing digital images under high exposure, low exposure, and high random noise respectively.</description>

      <title>Molecular optomechanically-induced transparency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular cavity optomechanics (COM), characterized by remarkably efficient optomechanical coupling enabled by a highly localized light field and ultra-small effective mode volume, holds significant promise for advancing applications in quantum science and technology. Here, we study optomechanically induced transparency and the associated group delay in a hybrid molecular COM system. We find that even with an extremely low optical quality factor, an obvious transparency window can appear, which is otherwise unattainable in a conventional COM system. Furthermore, by varying the ports of the probe light, the optomechanically induced transparency or absorption can be achieved, along with corresponding slowing or advancing of optical signals. These results indicate that our scheme provides a new method for adjusting the storage and retrieval of optical signals in such a molecular COM device.</description>

      <title>QUPERS: Quantum Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present experimental demonstration of a recently predicted path interference phenomenon [Nanophotonics 7, 1687 (2018)]. A SERS process becomes resonant when both incident and the converted frequencies match with two plasmon resonances -- a condition which is hard to satisfy experimentally. Yet, presence of a quantum dot~(QD) coupled to the lower-energy plasmon mode has been predicted to introduce interference effect in the conversion paths and to bring the SERS process into resonance. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a 7-fold additional enhancement factor~(EF) {\it multiplying} the conventional SERS enhancement owing to the presence of QDs in addition to metal nanoparticles~(MNPs). We eliminate influence of alternative enhancement mechanisms and show that observed additional EF of 7 is solely because of the path interference~(Fano) effect taking place in the presence of the QDs. As the most significant evidence: we observe that when QD/MNP ratio exceeds $1$, EF starts to decrease. Two or more QDs sitting at different~(random) positions on a nanostar MNP surface starts to degrade the path interference effect. Even though the theoretically predicted maximum EFs of $\sim$100--1000 when QD is in the MNP hotspot are not always experimentally feasible in stochastic nature of large area SERS substrate, still, observation of a 7-fold overall increase in such a setting is significant for fabricating Raman-based sensor applications. More importantly, our scheme allows for designing selective SERS substrates. As the QD resonances can actively be shifted by external factors, such as by applying an electric field (Stark effect), it provides a previously-not-existing tool: active selective enhancement of Raman bands via an applied voltage.</description>

      <title>Extraction of power transmission parameters from PT-symmetric waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The PT-symmetric waveguides have been frequently discussed in the photonics community due to their extraordinary properties. Especially, the study of power transmission is significant for switching applications. The aim of this study is to extract the mode power transmission parameters based on the coupled mode equations and analyze the power properties of the PT-symmetric system. The equations relying on the coupled mode theory are constructed according to the two different orthogonality relations between the original and adjoint system. The results matching well with the finite difference simulations demonstrate the validity of our method, while the conventional coupled mode theory fails. The power properties in the PT-symmetric and PT-broken phases are also observed. Furthermore, a new integration is implemented from which the conserved quantity is defined and extracted, which reflects the Hamiltonian invariant of the system. Our method fully incorporates the properties of complex modes and allows the study of the power transmission properties based on the orthogonality relations, which is also applicable to other types of non-Hermitian optical systems. This work provides a new perspective for the power analysis of PT-symmetric waveguides and is helpful to design the switching devices.</description>

      <title>Multifunctional meta-optic azimuthal shear interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Azimuthal shear interferometry is a versatile tool for analyzing wavefront asymmetries. However, conventional systems are bulky, alignment-sensitive, and prone to nonuniform shear. We present a broadband, compact, and robust meta-optics-based azimuthal shear interferometer in a common-path configuration, reducing the system size to the millimeter scale. Unlike conventional designs, the meta-optic azimuthal shear interferometer utilizes the localized wavefront modulation capabilities of meta-optics to achieve uniform azimuthal shear displacement independent of radial position, significantly enhancing accuracy and stability. Our approach eliminates the need for bulky optical components and precise multi-path alignment, making it more resilient to environmental disturbances. Its multifunctionality is demonstrated through applications in all-optical edge detection, differential interference contrast microscopy, and aberrated wavefront sensing. These results underscore its potential for real-time analog image processing, advanced optical imaging, and optical testing.</description>

      <title>Deciphering Carrier Dynamics in Polycarbonate Following Excitation with Ultrashort Laser Pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polymers exposed to ultrashort pulsed lasers (UPL) experience a range of physical and chemical changes that play a key role in applications ranging from material processing to advanced photonics, and biomedicine. To elucidate the interaction of UPL with polymeric materials, ultrafast phenomena such as carrier dynamics, recombination and relaxation are investigated assuming polycarbonate (PC) as a test material exposed to laser pulses of moderate energies. A theoretical model developed for dielectric materials is extended to describe the, previously, unexplored excitation and carrier dynamics for PC while femtosecond Transient Absorption Spectroscopy is used to elucidate the evolution of the materials response and ultrafast dynamics. Interpreting the experimental measurements using the theoretical model suggests the existence of an energy level that facilitates the formation of self-trapped exciton metastates between the conduction and valence bands (approximately 2.4-2.8 eV below the conduction band). It also predicts the electron-plasma lifetime (around 110-150 fs), the recombination time (about 34 ps), and the non-linear part of the refractive index due to Kerr effect (with n_2 values ranging from (1.1-1.5)x10^{-16} cm2/W). Furthermore, the dominant character of multi-photon assisted ionisation is emphasised while the optical breakdown threshold is also calculated and found to be equal to 2.55 x10^12 W/cm2. The results are expected to support future efforts aimed at elucidating how intense ultrashort laser pulses interact with polymeric materials which is crucial for optimizing the manufacturing processes of these materials for potential applications.</description>

      <title>Local perfect chirality at reflection-zeros away from exceptional points in optical whispering gallery microcavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, a local and imperfect chirality of the resonant eigenmode at the exceptional point (EP) has been reported in the optical whispering gallery microcavity system perturbed by two strong nanoscatterers [Phys. Rev. A 108, L041501 (2023)]. Here, we discover a local perfect chirality of the resonant eigenmode away from the EP in the parameter space of the strongly perturbed microcavity system. By considering the multiple scattering process of the azimuthally propagating modes (APMs) at the nanoscatterers with a first-principles-based model, the local perfect chirality is predicted to result from the unidirectional reflectionlessness, i.e., the reflection-zero (R-zero) of the APMs at the two nanoscatterers. Numerical results and model predictions consistently show that the structural parameters of the R-zero typically deviate from those of the EP, which means that the pair of split resonant eigenmodes at the R-zero have different complex resonance frequencies and electromagnetic fields. In general, only one of the pair of split eigenmodes exhibits a local perfect chirality within the local azimuthal range divided by the two nanoscatterers. With the decrease of the two nanoscatterers' sizes or their relative azimuthal angle, the R-zero tends to coincide with the EP.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the fabrication of 8-inch crack-free, dispersion-engineered Si$_3$N$_4$-SiO$_2$-Si wafers fully compatible with industrial foundry silicon photonics fabrication lines. By combining these wafers with a developed amorphous silicon (a-Si) hardmask etching technique, we achieve ultra-low-loss Si$_3$N$_4$ photonic integrated circuits (PICs) with intrinsic quality factors exceeding $25 \times 10^6$ using electron beam lithography and $24 \times 10^6$ using standard ultraviolet stepper photolithography. Frequency-comb generation is demonstrated on these high-quality Si$_3$N$_4$ PICs, corroborating the designed anomalous dispersion. These results establish the feasibility of mass-manufacturing high-performance, dispersion-engineered Si$_3$N$_4$ PICs using standard foundry-grade processes, opening new pathways for applications in optical communications, nonlinear optics, and quantum optics.</description>

      <title>Dammann Metasurface Route to Overcoming the Uniformity Defects in Two-Dimensional Beam Multipliers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dammann gratings - beam-shaping optical elements acting as beam multipliers with equal-power beams - are a key element in three-dimensional imaging based on structured light and beam combiners for high-power laser applications. However, two-dimensional Dammann grating structures suffer from a significant reduction of the uniformity among the diffraction orders. Here, we report Dammann metasurfaces based on the geometric phase as the structure realization for the target phase profile, which outperform the capabilities of Dammann gratings by overcoming the uniformity defects in their two-dimensional diffraction patterns. We showed that two-dimensional Dammann metasurfaces exhibit high uniformity and diffraction efficiency, in contrast to Dammann gratings, by overcoming the uniformity defects via a robust and highly precise phase imprint. Moreover, Dammann metasurfaces outperform their grating counterparts by exhibiting a polarization-independent response and a broadband operation. This study reveals that by providing physics-driven solutions, metasurfaces can outperform the capabilities of their bulk optics counterparts while facilitating virtually flat, ultrathin, and lightweight optics.</description>

      <title>Universal point spread function engineering for 3D optical information processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Point spread function (PSF) engineering has been pivotal in the remarkable progress made in high-resolution imaging in the last decades. However, the diversity in PSF structures attainable through existing engineering methods is limited. Here, we report universal PSF engineering, demonstrating a method to synthesize an arbitrary set of spatially varying 3D PSFs between the input and output volumes of a spatially incoherent diffractive processor composed of cascaded transmissive surfaces. We rigorously analyze the PSF engineering capabilities of such diffractive processors within the diffraction limit of light and provide numerical demonstrations of unique imaging capabilities, such as snapshot 3D multispectral imaging without involving any spectral filters, axial scanning or digital reconstruction steps, which is enabled by the spatial and spectral engineering of 3D PSFs. Our framework and analysis would be important for future advancements in computational imaging, sensing and diffractive processing of 3D optical information.</description>

      <title>Tip-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy of Cell Wall Heterogeneity for Aspergillus Fumigatus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS) enables nanoscale chemical mapping of biological structures, providing high-resolution, high-signal-to-noise ratio imaging into molecular distribution and interactions beyond the capabilities of conventional Raman imaging. However, challenges such as the deformation of fragile biological cells and the complexity of signal interpretation would increase the difficulty in investigating biological samples with TERS. Here, we demonstrate using TERS to investigate the cell wall heterogeneity of Aspergillus fumigatus spores. Using TERS imaging and spectral analysis, we map the chemical components including melanin within the fungal cell wall. The results reveal distinct spectral features associated with polysaccharides, lipids, and proteins. Furthermore, by comparing the wild-type and albino mutant spores, we illuminate the biochemical characteristics of Dihydroxynaphthalene melanin (DHN-melanin) in the fungal cell wall.</description>

Abstract: Laser intensity noise is a main limitation of measurement and sensing mission represented by gravitational wave detection. We develop a noise decomposition model and design the core elements of the feedback loop independently based on the analysis results. We construct a fiber amplifier system with ultra-low intensity noise in the 0.1 mHz-1 Hz frequency band by the employment of an optoelectronic feedback loop that is specially designed. The study provides experimental basis and technologies for precise measurement and sensing system at ultra-low frequency.</description>

      <title>Imaging artefacts in scattering-type scanning near field optical microscopy arising from optical diffraction effects and contrast-active sub-surface features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The scattering-type Scanning Near-Field Optical Microscope (s-SNOM) is acknowledged as an excellent tool to investigate the optical properties of different materials and biological samples at the nanoscale. In this study we show that s-SNOM data are susceptible to being affected by specific artefacts related to the light diffraction phenomena and to stray contributions from shallow buried, contrast-active, structures. We focus on discussing the diffraction contributions from sample edges, next to those corresponding to one- or two-dimensional periodic structures, and undesired contributions from shallow buried periodic features. Each scenario was examined individually through both experimental methods and simulations. Our experimental findings reveal that such artefacts affect not only s-SNOM images demodulated at the direct-current (DC) component and the fundamental frequency, but also images demodulated at higher harmonic frequencies. We show that image artefacts caused by diffraction resemble the undesirable effects caused by illumination with a laser beam of unstable intensity, and that buried features can yield s-SNOM signals that cannot be distinguished from those originating from the sample surface, in absence of prior knowledge of the sample structure. Performed simulations confirm these experimental findings. This work enhances the understanding of s-SNOM data and paves the way for new data acquisition and postprocessing methods that can enable next-generation s-SNOM imaging and spectroscopy with significantly enhanced signal-to-noise ratio and resolution.</description>

      <title>Temperature-insensitive fused-tapered fiber couplers based on negative thermal expansion material coating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new method based on negative thermal expansion material coating is proposed to realize temperature insensitive fiber coupler. By coating a layer of modified epoxy resin with a negative thermal expansion coefficient onto the coupling region of fiber coupler, a stable splitting ratio over a wide temperature range can be achieved. A finite-element model for simulating the influence of thermal fluctuations on fused-tapered fiber coupler's splitting ratio is built and verified via experimental test. Furthermore, using this model, the influence of the thickness, length, and thermal expansion coefficient of the coating material on the splitting ratio is studied. Through adjusting the parameters of the coating, the temperature stability of the fiber coupler splitting ratio can be improved by more than one order of magnitude and improved to 1.2*10-5/K. The temperature-insensitive fused-tapered fiber coupler can find important application in optical precision measurement under extreme temperature environment, such as inter-satellite laser interferometry and high-precision fiber gyroscopes.</description>

      <title>Dispersion of backward-propagating waves in a surface defect on a 3D photonic band gap crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally study the dispersion relation of waves in a two-dimensional (2D) defect layer with periodic nanopores that sits on a three-dimensional (3D) photonic band gap crystal made from silicon by CMOS-compatible methods. The nanostructures are probed by momentum-resolved broadband near-infrared imaging of p-polarized reflected light that is collected inside the light cone as a function of off-axis wave vectors. We identify surface defect modes at frequencies inside the band gap with a narrow relative linewidth ($\Delta\omega/\omega$ = 0.028), which are absent in defect-free 3D crystals. We calculate the dispersion of modes with relevant mode symmetries using a plane-wave-expansion supercell method with no free parameters. The calculated dispersion matches very well with the measured data. The dispersion is negative in one of the off-axis directions, corresponding to backward-propagating waves where the phase velocity and the group velocity point in opposite directions, as confirmed by finite-difference time-domain simulations. We also present an analytic model of a 2D grating sandwiched between vacuum and a negative real $\epsilon'$ &lt; 0 that mimics the 3D photonic band gap. The model's dispersion agrees with the experiments and with the fuller theory and shows that the backward propagation is caused by the surface grating. We discuss possible applications, including a device that senses the output direction of photons emitted by quantum emitters in response to their frequency.</description>

      <title>Modeling Nonlinear Optics with the Transfer Matrix Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Transfer Matrix Method (TMM) is a widely used technique for modeling linear propagation of electromagnetic waves through stratified layered media. However, since its extension to inhomogeneous and nonlinear systems is not straightforward, much more computationally demanding methods such as Finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) or Method of lines (MoL) are typically used. In this work, we extend the TMM framework to incorporate the effects of nonlinearity. We consider the case when strong coupling between excitons (electron-hole pairs) and photons leads to the formation of exciton-polaritons. This extension is crucial for accurately simulating the behavior of light in polariton microcavities, where nonlinearities arising from exciton-exciton interactions play a key role. We perform efficient simulations of light transmission and reflection in a multidimensional system using the plane wave basis. Additionally, we compare our extended TMM approach with the state-of-the-art admittance transfer method, and highlight the computational advantage of extended TMM for large-scale systems. The extended TMM not only provides a robust and computationally efficient numerical framework, but also paves the way for the development of future low-power nonlinear optical devices, polariton-based photonic circuits, and quantum photonic technologies.</description>

      <title>Quasi-bound states in the continuum in finite waveguide grating couplers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finite-size effects occurring for quasi-bound states in the continuum (qBIC) formed in symmetric and asymmetric all-dielectric waveguide grating couplers are investigated using numerical simulations for different configuration parameters. We find that the beam size plays a crucial role in the formation of additional qBIC resonances originating in forbidden for plane-wave incidence BIC resonances, whose manifestation is strongly influenced by the beam divergence. Another parameter is the strength of Bragg reflection, determining the spatial extension of a distributed Bragg resonator (DBR): in configurations with strong Bragg reflection, the excited and Bragg reflected counterpropagating waveguide modes are confined within the footprint of the incident beam. Conversely, the DBR formed in configurations with weak Bragg reflection extends well beyond the incident beam footprint, resulting in high sensitivity of the system response to the grating width and incident beam position. We believe that our findings provide valuable insights for optimizing photonic devices that leverage qBIC resonances in finite-sized structures under realistic excitation conditions.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate strong light-matter interaction of a dielectric nanocavity with deep sub-wavelength confinement of light and excitons in a monolayer of molybdenum ditelluride (MoTe2). Avoided crossing is demonstrated with both photoluminescence and reflection measurements, from which we extract a light-matter interaction strength of $g \approx 5$ meV. The associated Rabi splitting is twice as large as the system's losses. These values are in good agreement with numerically-obtained values with the exciton-reaction coordinate formalism, yielding $4.6$ meV. The strong light-matter interaction, combined with the low losses and the sub-wavelength light confinement, could pave the way towards single-photon nonlinearities.</description>

      <title>Comment on "Comment on Attosecond electron microscopy and diffraction"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past few decades, following the first demonstration of ultrafast electron microscopy, numerous research groups have focused on achieving attosecond temporal resolution in electron microscopy with the goal of imaging electron and atomic motion. Recently, several studies have claimed to achieve attosecond temporal resolution in imaging(1-3). These claims are based on the generation of attosecond electron pulse trains. However, in typical time-resolved measurements used to capture dynamic processes in real-time, the temporal resolution is determined by the envelope of the pulse train. The reliance of using attosecond electron pulse trains fails to account for the distinct temporal resolution advantages enabled by our attosecond optical gating, which are absent in the case of using a continuous-wave or long laser pulse. These oversights highlight the limitations of this methodology (1-3) in studying ultrafast phenomena of matter. It is crucial to clarify this distinction to avoid confusion, misinterpretation, and potential miscitations within the community regarding attosecond temporal resolution in electron microscopy and the attosecond imaging of matter dynamics. In contrast, Hui et al. (4) present the first realistic demonstration of attosecond imaging resolution in electron microscopy, enabling the diffraction imaging of electron motion dynamics in graphene. In a commentary by Peter Baum and Claus Ropers, the authors conjecture that the graphene dynamics observed in our time-resolved diffraction experiment (Fig. 5, Hui et al. 2024) (4) is an optical interference artifact or light modulation of electrons effects, similar to what was reported previously (1-3), in addition to raising other technical concerns. In this reply, we are pleased to address these allegations and provide clarifications to resolve the raised technical questions.</description>

      <title>Dynamic spectral tailoring of a 10 GHz laser frequency comb for enhanced calibration of astronomical spectrographs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Laser frequency combs (LFCs) are an important component of Doppler radial velocity (RV) spectroscopy that pushes fractional precision to the $10^{-10}$ level, as required to identify and characterize Earth-like exoplanets. However, large intensity variations across the LFC spectrum that arise in nonlinear broadening limit the range of comb lines that can be used for optimal wavelength calibration with sufficient signal-to-noise ratio. Furthermore, temporal spectral-intensity fluctuations of the LFC, that are coupled to flux-dependent detector defects, alter the instrumental point spread function (PSF) and result in spurious RV shifts. To address these issues and improve calibration precision, spectral flattening is crucial for LFCs to maintain a constant photon flux per comb mode. In this work, we demonstrate a dynamic spectral shaping setup using a spatial light modulator (SLM) over the wavelength range of 800nm to 1300nm. The custom shaping compensates for amplitude fluctuations in real time and can also correct for wavelength-dependent spectrograph transmission, achieving a spectral profile that delivers the constant readout necessary for maximizing precision. Importantly, we characterize the out-of-loop properties of the spectral flattener to verify a twofold improvement in spectral stability. This technique, combined with our approach of pumping the waveguide spectral broadener out-of-band at 1550 nm, reduces the required dynamic range. While this spectral region is tailored for the LFC employed at the Habitable-zone Planet Finder (HPF) spectrograph, the method is broadly applicable to any LFC used for astronomical spectrograph calibration.</description>

      <title>Postselection-Free Cavity-Enhanced Narrow-Band Orbital Angular Momentum Entangled Photon Source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cavity-enhanced spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) provides a significant way to produce $\sim$10 MHz narrow-band photon pairs, which matches the bandwidth of photon for quantum memory. However, the output photon pairs from the cavity is not entangled and the postselection is required to create the entanglement outside the cavity, so the direct output of cavity-enhanced narrow-band entangled photon pairs is still an open challenge. Here we propose a solution that realizes the first postselection-free cavity-enhanced narrow-band entangled photon pairs. The entanglement is achieved in degree of freedom (DOF) of orbital angular momentum (OAM) by implementing an OAM-conservation SPDC process in an actively and precisely controlled cavity supporting degenerate high-order OAM modes. The measured linewidth for the two photons is 13.8 MHz and the measured fidelity is 0.969(3) for the directly generated OAM entangled two photons. We deterministically transfer the OAM entanglement to polarization one with almost no loss and obtain polarization entangled two photons with a fidelity of 0.948(2). Moreover, we produce narrow-band OAM-polarization hyperentangled photon pairs with a fidelity of 0.850(2) by establishing polarization entanglement with preservation of OAM entanglement, which is realized by interfering the two photons on a polarizing beam splitter (PBS) and post-selecting the events of one and only one photon in on each of the PBS port. Novel cavity may find applications in cavity-based light-matter interaction. Our results provide an efficient and promising approach to create narrow-band entangled photon sources for memory-based long-distance quantum communication and network.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate the time of arrival probability distribution of a quantum particle using the Bohmian formalism. The pilot-wave is given by the wave function of the one dimensional vacuum squeezed state but written in the Schr\"odinger representation. We made use of the unitary representation of the symplectic group in the Hilbert space $L^2(\mathbb{R})$. The solution to the Bohmian equations are analytical function thus allowing for a closed expression of the time of arrival distribution which differs from the counterparts in the standard quantum mechanics formulation.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Control of Third-order Nonlinear Optical Properties of Gold Nanoparticle/Liquid Crystal Composites under External Electric Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the dynamic control of third-order nonlinear optical absorption properties of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) dispersed in nematic liquid crystals (LC). By leveraging the reconfigurable nature of liquid crystals under external electric fields, we demonstrate the ability to manipulate AuNP alignment, dimer formation, and subsequently the plasmon coupling effects. Planar oriented and degenerate LC cells were prepared, and their optical responses under varying electric fields were characterized using polarization microscopy, UV-VIS spectroscopy, and Z-scan techniques. In planar cells, the applied electric field reorients LC molecules and AuNPs, influencing plasmon coupling and the nonlinear absorption. Conversely, degenerate cells exhibit more complex behaviors due to multiple LC alignment directions. These findings illustrate the potential of AuNP/nematic LC systems for creating tunable photonic devices responsive to external stimuli.</description>

      <title>The Importance of Pure Dephasing in the Optical Response of Excitons in High-quality van der Waals Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Excitons in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) dominate their optical response due to exceptionally large binding energies arising from their two-dimensional nature. Several theoretical models have been proposed to describe this excitonic behavior, however, it remains unclear which model most accurately captures the underlying physical properties of the response. In this work, we experimentally measure the optical response of high-quality monolayer TMD heterostructures and compare the results with the different theoretical models to address this uncertainty. We find that in high-quality heterostructures, quantum mechanical interactions in the form of pure dephasing plays a dominant role, which has been challenging to isolate experimentally in previous studies. Furthermore, accounting for an additional decay rate to the commonly used radiative and non-radiative rates is found to be important for the accurate description of the excitonic response. These findings establish a robust framework for understanding and predicting the optical properties of TMD-based heterostructures, crucial for both fundamental research and optoelectronic applications.</description>

      <title>Nonlinearity-induced Fractional Thouless Pumping of Solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have shown that a soliton can be {\it fractionally} transported by slowly varying a system parameter over one period in a nonlinear system. This phenomenon is attributed to the nontrivial topology of the corresponding energy bands of a linear Hamiltonian. Here we find the occurrence of fractional Thouless pumping of solitons in a nonlinear off-diagonal Aubry-Andr\'{e}-Harper model. Surprisingly, this happens despite the fact that all the energy bands of the linear Hamiltonian are topologically trivial, indicating that nonlinearity can induce fractional Thouless pumping of solitons. Specifically, our results show that a soliton can be pumped across one unit cell over one, two, three or four pump periods, implying an average displacement of $1$, $1/2$, $1/3$ or $1/4$ unit cells per cycle, respectively. We attribute these behaviors to changes in on-site potentials induced by a soliton solution, leading to the nontrivial topology for the modified linear Hamiltonian. Given that our model relies solely on varying nearest-neighbor hoppings, it is readily implementable on existing state-of-the-art photonic platforms.</description>

      <title>GHz-rate optical phase shift in light matter interaction-engineered, silicon-ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08833v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Organic electro-optic materials have demonstrated promising performance in developing electro-optic phase shifters. Their integration with other silicon photonic processes, nanofabrication complexities, and durability remains to be developed. While the required poling step in electro-optic polymers limits their potential and utilization on a large scale, devices made of paraelectric nematic liquid crystals suffer from slow bandwidth. In ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals, we report an additional GHz-fast phase shift that ultimately allows for significant second-order nonlinear optical coefficients related to the Pockels effect. It avoids poling issues and can pave the way for hybrid silicon-organic systems with CMOS-foundry compatibility. We report DC and AC modulation efficiencies of $\approx$~0.25 V$\cdot$mm (from liquid crystal orientation) and $\approx$~25.7 V$\cdot$mm (from Pockels effect), respectively, an on-chip insertion loss of $\approx$~2.6 dB, and an electro-optic bandwidth of $f_\text{-6dB}$&gt;4.18 GHz, employing improved light-matter interaction in a waveguide architecture that calls for only one lithography step.</description>

      <title>Disordered Optical Metasurfaces: Basics, Properties, and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09425v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optical metasurfaces are conventionally viewed as organized flat arrays of photonic or plasmonic nanoresonators, also called metaatoms. These metasurfaces are typically highly ordered and fabricated with precision using expensive tools. However, the inherent imperfections in large-scale nanophotonic devices, along with recent advances in bottom-up nanofabrication techniques and design strategies, have highlighted the potential benefits of incorporating disorder to achieve specific optical functionalities. This review offers an overview of the key theoretical, numerical, and experimental aspects related to the exploration of disordered optical metasurfaces. It introduces fundamental concepts of light scattering by disordered metasurfaces and outlines theoretical and numerical methodologies for analyzing their optical behavior. Various fabrication techniques are discussed, highlighting the types of disorder they deliver and their achievable precision level. The review also explores critical applications of disordered optical metasurfaces, such as light manipulation in thin film materials and the design of structural colors and visual appearances. Finally, the article offers perspectives on the burgeoning future research in this field. Disordered optical metasurfaces offer a promising alternative to their ordered counterparts, often delivering unique functionalities or enhanced performance. They present a particularly exciting opportunity in applications demanding large-scale implementation, such as sustainable renewable energy systems, as well as aesthetically vibrant coatings for luxury goods and architectural designs.</description>

      <title>Modeling of optical scattering from topographic surface measurements of high-quality mirrors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15733v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we revisit computational methods to obtain an angular profile of optical scattering from a smooth surface, given a two-dimensional map of topographic height errors of the surface. Quick derivations of some traditional equations and relevant references are organized to shorten the search time. A practical data-processing flow of the methods is discussed. As a case study of this flow, the core mirrors of the KAGRA interferometer are examined, and we obtain a representative scattering profile that is easily applicable to ray-tracing simulations.</description>

      <title>Heat Generation in Spatially Confined Solids Through Electronic Light Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05922v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this Letter, we study the optical heating of spatially dispersive solids due to electronic light scattering (ELS), a phenomenon driven by indirect optical transitions. In this process, a spatial heterogeneity generates an optical near-field photon with expanded momentum, leading to electron-photon momentum matching, followed by thermalization of the electron system promoting optical heating. We experimentally demonstrate this effect by melting spatially confined semiconductor (Si) and metal (Au) under continuous-wave laser pump within the transparency window. ELS is a dominant physical process in media with strong spatial dispersion, underlying a variety of thermo-optical applications.</description>

      <title>Scalable intensity-based photonic matrix-vector multiplication processor using single-wavelength time-division-multiplexed signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18194v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photonic integrated circuits provide a compact platform for ultrafast and energy-efficient matrix-vector multiplications (MVMs) in the optical domain. Recently, schemes based on time-division multiplexing (TDM) have been proposed as scalable approaches for realizing large-scale photonic MVM processors. However, existing demonstrations rely on coherent detection or multiple wavelengths, both of which complicate their operations. In this work, we demonstrate a scalable TDM-based photonic MVM processor that uses only single-wavelength intensity-modulated optical signals, thereby avoiding coherent detection and enabling simplified operations. A 32-channel processor is fabricated on a Si-on-insulator (SOI) platform and used to experimentally perform convolution operations in a convolutional neural network (CNN) for handwritten digit recognition, achieving a classification accuracy of 93.47% for 1500 images.</description>

      <title>Spatial-offset pump-probe imaging of nonradiative dynamics at optical resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03384v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonradiative photothermal (PT) and photoacoustic (PA) processes have found widespread applications in imaging, stimulation, and therapy. Mapping the generation and propagation of PA and PT waves with resolution is important to elucidate how these fields interact with biological systems. To this end, we introduce spatial offset pump-probe imaging (SOPPI). By spatially offsetting the pump beam and the probe beam, SOPPI can image simultaneously PA and PT wave propagation with nanosecond temporal resolution, micrometer spatial resolution, 65 MHz detection bandwidth, and a sensitivity of 9.9 Pa noise equivalent pressure. We first map the PA and PT evolution from a fiber emitter, and how the wave interacting with a mouse skull and brain slices. SOPPI imaging of PA waves from a tapered fiber with water as an absorber shows a wavelength-dependent generation, evanescent wave generated PA, and back-propagated acoustic Mach Cone. At last, a SOPPI-PACT is developed to reconstruct the pigment distribution inside a zebrafish larva with high precision and signal-to-noise ratio.</description>

      <title>PiLocNet: Physics-informed neural network on 3D localization with rotating point spread function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13295v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For the 3D localization problem using point spread function (PSF) engineering, we propose a novel enhancement of our previously introduced localization neural network, LocNet. The improved network is a physics-informed neural network (PINN) that we call PiLocNet. Previous works on the localization problem may be categorized separately into model-based optimization and neural network approaches. Our PiLocNet combines the unique strengths of both approaches by incorporating forward-model-based information into the network via a data-fitting loss term that constrains the neural network to yield results that are physically sensible. We additionally incorporate certain regularization terms from the variational method, which further improves the robustness of the network in the presence of image noise, as we show for the Poisson and Gaussian noise models. This framework accords interpretability to the neural network, and the results we obtain show its superiority. Although the paper focuses on the use of single-lobe rotating PSF to encode the full 3D source location, we expect the method to be widely applicable to other PSFs and imaging problems that are constrained by known forward processes.</description>

      <title>Spatial averaging for light reflection and transmission through cold atom arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18855v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically and computationally investigate the role that the spatial spread of atoms plays in the transmission and reflection of weak light from atom arrays. In particular, we investigate whether coherent wave functions for the atoms' positions leads to different results from a thermal distribution with the same spatial spread. We find that the coherence is not relevant when the light is weak and the electronic states evolve on time scales shorter than the oscillation period of the atoms in their traps. Full numerical calculations and derivations using the sudden approximation show that reflection and transmission agree with the simple averaging over atom positions for these conditions. For parameters outside these restrictions, the simple spatial averaging may lead to inaccurate results.</description>

      <title>Unbalanced CRLH Leaky-wave Antenna With Broadside Radiation Based On Spin Photonic Topological Insulator Featured Hexagonal Configuration In Armchair Arrangement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15820v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new X-band leaky-wave antenna has been developed using spin photonic topological insulators. This antenna features a hexagonal unit cell arranged in an armchair configuration. This arrangement provides advantages over the zigzag configuration, particularly by offering a wider operational region and a more suitable pattern. To design the structure, a parametric study on the cell dimensions has been conducted, and another study has designed the transition region to couple the topological structure with the classical line. The proposed antenna has a low profile and illuminates two sides of the structure simultaneously. Additionally, it offers a 53-degree scanning range and a bandwidth of 2.7 GHz, making it a groundbreaking improvement over other leaky-wave antennas that utilize photonic topological insulators. The proposed antenna is an unbalanced CRLH leaky-wave antenna capable of radiating in both backward and forward directions. Notably, as it transitions through the broadside within its scanning range, there is no significant drop in performance, even in the presence of an open stop band. To the best of our knowledge, this characteristic is unique among unbalanced CRLH leaky-wave antennas.</description>

      <title>Molecular tuning of excitons in four-atom-thick hybrid bilayer crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12027v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bilayer crystals, formed by stacking monolayers of two-dimensional (2D) crystals, create interlayer potentials that govern excitonic phenomena but are constrained by their fixed covalent lattices. Replacing one layer with an atomically thin molecular crystal overcomes this limitation, as precise control of functional groups enables tunable 2D molecular lattices and, consequently, electronic structures. Here, we report molecular tuning of lattices and excitons in four-atom-thick hybrid bilayer crystals (HBCs), synthesized as monolayers of perylene-based molecular and transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) single crystals. In HBCs, we observe an anisotropic photoluminescence signal exhibiting characteristics of both molecular and TMD excitons, directly tuned by molecular geometry and HBC composition. Ab initio calculations reveal that this anisotropic emission arises from hybrid excitons, which inherit properties from both layers through a hybridized bilayer band structure. Our work establishes a synthetically derived, molecule-based 2D quantum materials platform with the potential for engineering interlayer potentials.</description>
