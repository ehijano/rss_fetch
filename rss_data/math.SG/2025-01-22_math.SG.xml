      <title>Homoclinic orbits, Reeb chords and nice Birkhoff sections for Reeb flows in 3D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that for a $C^\infty$-generic contact form defining a given co-oriented contact structure on a closed $3$-manifold, every hyperbolic periodic Reeb orbit admits a transverse homoclinic connection in each of the branches of its stable and unstable manifolds. We exploit this result to prove that for a $C^\infty$-generic contact form defining a given co-oriented contact structure, given any finite collection $\Gamma$ of periodic Reeb orbits and any Legendrian link $L$, there exists a global surface of section (embedded Birkhoff section) for the Reeb flow that contains $\Gamma$ in its boundary, and that contains in its interior a Legendrian link that is Legendrian isotopic to $L$ by a $C^0$-small isotopy. Finally we prove that if the Reeb vector field admits a $\partial$-strong Birkhoff section then every Legendrian knot has infinitely many geometrically distinct Reeb chords, except possibly when the ambient manifold is a lens space or the sphere and the Reeb flow has exactly two periodic orbits. In particular, $C^\infty$-generically on the contact form there are infinitely many geometrically distinct Reeb chords for every Legendrian knot. In the case of geodesic flows, every Legendrian knot has infinitely many disjoint chords, without any further assumptions.</description>

      <title>A note On the existence of solutions to Hitchin's self-duality equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1987, Hitchin introduced the self-duality equations on rank-2 complex vector bundles over compact Riemann surfaces with genus greater than one as a reduction of the Yang-Mills equation and established the existence of solutions to these equations starting from a Higgs stable bundle. In this paper, we fill in some technical details in Hitchin's original proof by the following three steps. First, we reduce the existence of a solution of class $L_1^2$ to minimizing the energy functional within a Higgs stable orbit of the $L_2^2$ complex gauge group action. Second, using this transformation, we obtain a solution of class $L_1^2$ in this orbit. These two steps primarily follow Hitchin's original approach. Finally, using the Coulomb gauge, we construct a smooth solution by applying an $L_2^2$ unitary gauge transformation to the $L_1^2$ solution constructed previously. This last step provides additional technical details to Hitchin's original proof.</description>

      <title>Polarizations and Convergences of holomorphic sections on the tangent bundle of a Bohr-Sommerfeld Lagrangian submanifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $(M, \omega)$ be a K\"ahler manifold and let $(L, \nabla)$ be a prequantum line bundle over $M$. Let $X \subset M$ be a Bohr-Sommerfeld Lagrangian submanifold of $(L, \nabla)$. In this paper, we study an asymptotic behaviour of holomorphic sections of $L^k$ as $k \to \infty$. Our first result shows that the $L^2$-norm of sections of $L^k$ are bounded below around $X$ if these sections converge on $X$ under a suitable trivialization of $L^k$. Since $X$ is a Lagrangian submanifold, we consider that a neighborhood of $X$ is embedded in the tangent bundle $TX$. Let $\Psi_{k}: TX \to TX$ be a multiplication by $\frac{1}{\sqrt{k}}$ in the fibers. The pullback of the K\"ahler polarization by $\Psi_k$ converges to the real polarization, whose leaves are fibers of $TX$, as $k \to \infty$. Let $(f_k)_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$ be holomorphic sections of $L^k$ near $X$. By trivializing $L^k$, we consider $f_k$ as a function. In our second result, we show that $\Psi^* f_k$ converges to a fiberwise constant function on $TX$ as $k \to \infty$ under some condition on Sobolev norms of $f_k$.</description>

      <title>Subleading asymptotics of link spectral invariants and homeomorphism groups of surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.10749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.10749v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper continues the study of link spectral invariants on compact surfaces, introduced in our previous work and shown to satisfy a Weyl law in which they asymptotically recover the Calabi invariant. Here we study their subleading asymptotics on surfaces of genus zero. We show the subleading asymptotics are bounded for smooth time-dependent Hamiltonians, and recover the Ruelle invariant for autonomous disc maps with finitely many critical values. We deduce that the Calabi homomorphism admits infinitely many extensions to the group of compactly supported area-preserving homeomorphisms, and that the kernel of the Calabi homomorphism on the group of hameomorphisms is not simple.</description>

      <title>Quantitative conditions for right-handedness of flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.12512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.12512v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a numerical condition for right-handedness of a dynamically convex Reeb flow on the $3$-sphere. Our condition is stated in terms of an asymptotic ratio between the amount of rotation of the linearised flow and the linking number of trajectories with a periodic orbit that spans a disk-like global surface of section. As an application, we find an explicit constant $\delta_* &lt; 0.7225$ such that if a Riemannian metric on the $2$-sphere is $\delta$-pinched with $\delta &gt; \delta_*$, then its geodesic flow lifts to a right-handed flow on the $3$-sphere. In particular, all finite non-empty collections of periodic orbits of such a geodesic flow bind open books whose pages are global surfaces of section.</description>

      <title>Betti numbers and compatible almost complex structures on the Hard Lefschetz condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16948v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A special class of symplectic manifolds is those satisfying the Hard Lefschetz condition. The algebraic property of $\mathfrak{sl}_2(\mathbb C)$-module gives a natural constraint on the Betti numbers. However, such a constraint is only necessary, and it is not so clear what condition on the Betti numbers is equivalent to the Hard Lefschetz condition. In this paper, we give an equivalent condition on the first Betti number for compact symplectic $4$-manifolds satisfying the Hard Lefschetz condition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18398v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kim, Kresch and Oh defined unramified Gromov-Witten invariants. For a threefold, Pandharipande conjectured that they are equal to Gopakumar-Vafa invariants (BPS invariants) in the case of Fano classes and primitive Calabi-Yau classes. We prove the conjecture using a wall-crossing technique. This provides an algebro-geometric construction of Gopakumar-Vafa invariants in these cases.</description>

      <title>Lagrangian Skeleta and Koszul Duality on Bionic Symplectic Varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13286v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the category of modules over sheaves of Deformation-Quantization (DQ) algebras on bionic symplectic varieties. These spaces are equipped with both an elliptic $\mathbb{G}_m$-action and a Hamiltonian $\mathbb{G}_m$-action, with finitely many fixed points. On these spaces one can consider geometric category $\mathcal{O}$: the category of (holonomic) modules supported on the Lagrangian attracting set of the Hamiltonian action. We show that there exists a local generator in geometric category $\mathcal{O}$ whose dg endomorphism ring, cohomologically supported on the Lagrangian attracting set, is derived equivalent to the category of all DQ-modules. This is a version of Koszul duality generalizing the equivalence between D-modules on a smooth variety and dg-modules over the de Rham complex.</description>

      <title>Invariant measures for some dissipative systems from the Jacobi last multiplier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08167v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hamiltonian dynamics describing conservative systems naturally preserves the standard notion of phase-space volume, a result known as the Liouville's theorem which is central to the formulation of classical statistical mechanics. In this paper, we obtain explicit expressions for invariant phase-space measures for certain (generally dissipative) mechanical systems, namely, systems described by conformal vector fields on symplectic manifolds that are cotangent bundles, contact Hamiltonian systems, and systems of the Li\'enard class. The latter class of systems can be described by certain generalized conformal vector fields on the cotangent bundle of the configuration space. The computation of the invariant measures is achieved by making use of the formalism of Jacobi last multipliers.</description>
