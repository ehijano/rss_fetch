      <title>Causal Machine Learning Analysis of Empirical Relative Biological Effectiveness (RBE) for Mandible Osteoradionecrosis in Head and Neck Cancer Radiotherapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mandible Osteoradionecrosis (ORN) is one of the most severe adverse events (AEs) for head and neck (H&amp;N) cancer radiotherapy. Previous retrospective investigations on real-world data relied on conventional statistical models that primarily elucidate correlation rather than establishing causal relationships. Through the novel causal machine learning, we aim to obtain empirical relative biological effectiveness (RBE) for ORN in H&amp;N cancer patients treated with pencil-beam-scanning proton therapy (PBSPT). 335 patients treated by PBSPT and 931 patients treated by volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT) were included. We use 1:1 case-matching to minimize the imbalance in clinical factors between PBSPT and VMAT. The bias test of standardized mean differences (SMD) was applied on the case-matched patient cohorts. The causal machine learning method, causal forest (CF), was adopted to investigate the causal effects between dosimetric factors and the incidence of ORN. The dose volume constraints (DVCs) for VMAT and PBSPT were derived based on causal effects. RBE values were further empirically derived based on tolerance curves formed from DVCs. 335 VMAT patients were case-matched to 335 PBSPT patients; however, SMD analysis revealed persistent covariate imbalances within each group, indicating residual confounding influence. Using CF modeling, we identified DVCs of mandible ORN and found that PBSPT had lower critical volumes than those of VMAT, leading to empirical RBE exceeding 1.1 in the moderate dose range (1.61 at 40 Gy[RBE=1.1], 1.30 at 50 Gy, and 1.13 at 60 Gy). This study presents a novel application of causal machine learning to evaluate mandible ORN in radiotherapy. The results indicate that proton RBE may significantly exceed 1.1 in the moderate dose range, underscoring the importance of incorporating the variable RBE into PBSPT treatment planning to mitigate the risk of ORN.</description>

      <title>Verification, Validation, and Uncertainty Quantification (VVUQ) of PBPK Models for Theranostic Digital Twins: Towards Reliable Model-Informed Treatment Planning for Radiopharmaceutical Therapies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models provide a mechanistic framework for simulating radiopharmaceutical kinetics and estimating patient-specific absorbed doses (ADs). PBPK models incorporate prior knowledge of patient physiology and drug-specific properties, which can enhance the models predictive performance. PBPK models can ultimately be used to predict treatment response and thereby enable theranostic digital twins (TDTs) for personalized treatment planning in radiopharmaceutical therapies (RPTs). To achieve this potential of precision RPT, however, the reliability of the underlying modeling, including the PBPK-based dosimetry, must be established through rigorous verification, validation, and uncertainty quantification (VVUQ). This review outlines the role of VVUQ in ensuring the credibility and clinical applicability of PBPK models in radiotheranostics. Key methodologies for PBPK model VVUQ are discussed, including goodness-of-fit (GOF) assessment, prediction evaluation, and uncertainty propagation.</description>

      <title>EqDiff-CT: Equivariant Conditional Diffusion model for CT Image Synthesis from CBCT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) is widely used for image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT). It provides real time visualization at low cost and dose. However, photon scattering and beam hindrance cause artifacts in CBCT. These include inaccurate Hounsfield Units (HU), reducing reliability for dose calculation, and adaptive planning. By contrast, computed tomography (CT) offers better image quality and accurate HU calibration but is usually acquired offline and fails to capture intra-treatment anatomical changes. Thus, accurate CBCT-to-CT synthesis is needed to close the imaging-quality gap in adaptive radiotherapy workflows.
  To cater to this, we propose a novel diffusion-based conditional generative model, coined EqDiff-CT, to synthesize high-quality CT images from CBCT. EqDiff-CT employs a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) to iteratively inject noise and learn latent representations that enable reconstruction of anatomically consistent CT images. A group-equivariant conditional U-Net backbone, implemented with e2cnn steerable layers, enforces rotational equivariance (cyclic C4 symmetry), helping preserve fine structural details while minimizing noise and artifacts.
  The system was trained and validated on the SynthRAD2025 dataset, comprising CBCT-CT scans across multiple head-and-neck anatomical sites, and we compared it with advanced methods such as CycleGAN and DDPM. EqDiff-CT provided substantial gains in structural fidelity, HU accuracy and quantitative metrics. Visual findings further confirm the improved recovery, sharper soft tissue boundaries, and realistic bone reconstructions. The findings suggest that the diffusion model has offered a robust and generalizable framework for CBCT improvements. The proposed solution helps in improving the image quality as well as the clinical confidence in the CBCT-guided treatment planning and dose calculations.</description>

      <title>Characterization and virtualization of a medical ultrasound transducer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rise of data-driven ultrasound imaging technologies, realistic simulation of ultrasound fields and radio-frequency data is becoming increasingly important. Accurate transducer characterization is crucial for realistic simulations. In this work, we present a streamlined ultrasound characterization pipeline that creates a virtual transducer model from acoustic holography measurements of the ultrasound field. The pipeline enables the extraction of the transmit impulse response, the receive impulse response, the size of the transducer aperture, and the focal distance of the lens. The method relies on acoustic field projections using either the angular spectrum method or Rayleigh integrals. Additionally, we present a method to compensate for misalignment in the measurement setup, based on the angular spectrum of the holographic measurement. We demonstrate the application of the characterization pipeline to a P4-1 phased array transducer. The resulting virtual transducer model can be imported into the PROTEUS simulation software for the generation of physically realistic ultrasound fields and ultrasound radio-frequency data with arbitrary transmit settings. The characterization pipeline has been released as an open-source toolkit to enable the ultrasound community to perform transducer characterization with increased accuracy and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-based beam delivery time model for Mevion 250i with Hyperscan technology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: Accurate prediction of beam delivery time (BDT) is essential for operational efficiency, 4D dose calculations, and advanced proton therapy techniques. Despite its importance, no machine-specific BDT model exists for Mevion systems.
  Methods: We developed the first machine learning-based BDT model for the Mevion S250i Hyperscan system. Institutional machine log files from 11 patients (1120 files) were used to extract features including spot position, energy layer changes, Adaptive Aperture (AA) movements, and spot charge. Inter-pulse time ($\Delta$T) was the target variable. A Random Forest model was trained with cross-validation and tested on held-out data. SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) analysis was used to quantify feature contributions.
  Results: The model achieved mean absolute errors (MAE) ranging from 0.9 ms for short intervals (&lt;50 ms) to 222 ms for long delays (&gt;1000 ms). AA movements were the dominant global predictor for $\Delta$T &gt; 50 ms, while spot positions and pulse charge influenced short intervals. Energy changes had minor global impact but locally contributed to large $\Delta$T values, consistent with range modulator physics. The model was tested in two clinical applications: volumetric repainting and 4D dose recalculation for interplay evaluation. Predicted cumulative delivery times deviated by only -1.7% from machine log data, and dosimetric metrics (D98, D95, V95) remained within intrinsic delivery variability.
  Conclusions: This study presents the first machine-specific BDT model for the Mevion S250i, accurately capturing temporal dynamics and predictive performance. SHAP analysis provided insight into system behavior, highlighting the roles of AA adjustments, energy switching, and spot positioning. The model supports applications in interplay assessment, 4D dose calculation, and delivery time-based plan optimization.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Timing Parameters in Commercial SERF-OPM Multichannel Systems for Biomagnetic Field Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-Exchange Relaxation-Free Optically Pumped Magnetometers (SERF-OPMs) are increasingly used in multichannel biomagnetic sensing, yet their timing performance remains poorly characterized. This contribution presents the first cross-platform study of time delay, group delay, intra-channel variability, and settling time across four commercial SERF-OPM systems: Neuro-1 and QZFM Gen.2 (QuSpin Inc.), and HEDscan and FLv2 (FieldLine Inc.). Measurements were performed inside a magnetically shielded room (BMSR-2.1, PTB, Berlin) using an already introduced test bench. Results show frequency-dependent delays of 1-10 ms, intra-channel spreads up to +-1 ms, group delays between 1-15 ms, and settling times of 2-55 ms. Clear differences in manufacturer strategies were observed: QuSpin minimizes intra-channel variability through digital delay equalization, whereas FieldLine employs per-sensor calibration to optimize bandwidth and phase matching. In all systems, the time delay deviation between channels is in the sub-millisecond range in the 20-140 Hz band, which is sufficient for magnetoencephalography source localization. However, longer settling times in some platforms limit performance for rapid stimulation protocols. These findings provide the first vendor-comprehensive benchmarks for timing parameters in commercial SERF-OPM systems. They highlight the trade-offs between bandwidth, delay, and calibration strategies, and underscore the need for rigorous timing characterization to ensure waveform fidelity. The results are directly relevant to applications such as stimulation-evoked responses, brain-computer interfaces, and closed-loop neuromodulation.</description>

      <title>Organ dose optimization for a point-of-care forearm X-ray photon-counting CT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Spectral shaping is a computed tomography (CT) dose optimization technique that adjusts source voltage and filtration to reduce patient radiation exposure without compromising image quality. Traditionally, radiation dose has been assessed using the computed tomography dose index (CTDI). However, emerging dosimetric approaches aim to enable patient-specific evaluations by estimating organ absorbed doses, providing a more accurate representation of the biological impact. This study investigates spectral shaping for an extremity photon-counting detector (PCD) CT, through organ absorbed dose estimation and image quality evaluation. Method: Monte Carlo simulations were conducted to evaluate various combinations of source voltage and filtration. Tube voltage ranged from 80 to 140 kV, combined with three distinct filtration material and thicknesses. Simulations included three stages: a standardized phantom for CTDI assessment, an adult forearm phantom for organ dose measurement, and an image quality phantom for evaluation of an advanced image quality metric: the detectability index. Results: In a wrist PCD-CT imaging protocol, operating the source at 80 kV can reduce the radiation dose by up to 50%. This reduction is achieved while maintaining the same detectability index value as the standard 120 kV protocol. However, the optimal filtration depends on the organ targeted for dose reduction, as bone and skin benefit from opposing filtration approaches. While CTDI provides a useful initial estimate, it may lead to suboptimal optimization compared to organ-specific dose evaluation. Conclusions: Patient-specific dosimetry based on organ absorbed dose estimation offers a more accurate framework for optimizing CT protocols through spectral shaping than conventional CTDI-based approaches.</description>

      <title>Metric-Guided Conformal Bounds for Probabilistic Image Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15274v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern deep learning reconstruction algorithms generate impressively realistic scans from sparse inputs, but can often produce significant inaccuracies. This makes it difficult to provide statistically guaranteed claims about the true state of a subject from scans reconstructed by these algorithms. In this study, we propose a framework for computing provably valid prediction bounds on claims derived from probabilistic black-box image reconstruction algorithms. The key insights behind our framework are to represent reconstructed scans with a derived clinical metric of interest, and to calibrate bounds on the ground truth metric with conformal prediction (CP) using a prior calibration dataset. These bounds convey interpretable feedback about the subject's state, and can also be used to retrieve nearest-neighbor reconstructed scans for visual inspection. We demonstrate the utility of this framework on sparse-view computed tomography (CT) for fat mass quantification and radiotherapy planning tasks. Results show that our framework produces bounds with better semantical interpretation than conventional pixel-based bounding approaches. Furthermore, we can flag dangerous outlier reconstructions that look plausible but have statistically unlikely metric values.</description>
