      <title>On infinite sets with no $3$ on a line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a construction of an infinite set of points $A$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$ such that any subset $P\subseteq A$ has a constant density subset $P'$ with no three points collinear and yet $A$ cannot be separated into finitely many subsets such that each subset has no three points collinear. This provides a new proof of a question of Erd\H{o}s, Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il, and R\"{o}dl. The construction was generated by an internal model at OpenAI.</description>

      <title>Theta-Relations Among Degree-Based Tree Indices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Degree-based topological indices enable structural analysis of graphs, with key applications in chemical graph theory. This paper explores connections among three tree indices: Albertson, Sombor, and Sigma. The Sigma index tightly bounds the Sombor index via sharp two-sided inequalities, revealing their asymptotic equivalence up to constants. A pure $\Theta$-relationship links Sombor and Albertson indices for extremal trees with fixed degree sequences, showing quadratic degree interactions scale with absolute degree disparities. These results position the Sombor index as an intermediate descriptor, bridging global degree dispersion and local edge irregularity in trees.</description>

      <title>Signed network models for dimensionality reduction of portfolio optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a time-series-based signed network model for dimensionality reduction in portfolio optimization, grounded in Markowitz's portfolio theory and extended to incorporate higher-order moments of asset return distributions. Unlike traditional correlation-based approaches, we construct a complete signed graph for each trading day within a specified time window, where the sign of an edge between a pair of assets is determined by the relative behavior of their log returns with respect to their mean returns. Within this framework, we introduce a combinatorial interpretation of higher-order moments, showing that maximizing skewness and minimizing kurtosis correspond to maximizing balanced triangles and balanced 4-cliques with specific signed edge configurations respectively. We establish that the latter leads to an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem, while the former is naturally guaranteed by the structural properties of the signed graph model. Based on this interpretation, we propose a dimensionality reduction method using a combinatorial formulation of the mean-variance optimization problem through a combinatorial hedge score metric for assets. The proposed framework is validated through extensive backtesting on 199 S\&amp;P 500 assets over a 16-year period (2006 - 2021), demonstrating the effectiveness of reduced asset universes for portfolio construction using both Markowitz optimization and equally weighted strategy.</description>

      <title>On the spectra of k-uniform threshold hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we introduce a definition of k-uniform thresholds hypergraphs through a binary sequence, a natural extension of the classical definition for thresholds graphs. We characterize some of its eigenvalues and multiplicities by means of combinatorial numbers, derived from edge counts. An important problem addressed in Spectral Graph Theory is to find graphs with few distinct eigenvalues. Our characterization allows us to construct k-uniform threshold hypergraphs having an arbitrary number of vertices with few distinct eigenvalues.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.21427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the total cut complexes and their Alexander duals. The homotopy type of these complexes is calculated for de $p$th power of a cycle with at least $2rn$ vertices where $p\leq r$, solving part of a conjecture of Bayer, Denker, Milutinovi\'c, Rowlands, Sundaram and Xue. The homotopy type of the $2$-total cut complex for any $r$th power of a cycle with $r\geq3$ also is calculated, solving a conjecture of Chauhan, Shukla and Vinayak. We give some results about the connectivity. The homotopy type of the complexes for complete multipartite graph is determined. We also study the complexes of cartesian products of paths and of cartesian products of complete graphs for the total $2$-cut complex.</description>

      <title>The Multicolor Size-Ramsey Number of Bipartite Long Subdivisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a positive integer $r$, the $r$-color size-Ramsey
  number~$\widehat{R}_r(H)$ of a graph $H$ is the minimum number of
  edges in a graph $G$ such that every $r$-edge coloring of $G$
  contains a monochromatic copy of $H$. For a graph~$H$ and a
  function $\sigma:E(H)\to \mathbb{N}$, the \emph{subdivision}
  $H^\sigma$ is obtained by replacing every $e \in E(H)$ with a path
  of length $\sigma(e)$. In~\cite{javadi25:_induced_long} it is shown
  that for all integers $r,\, D\geq 2 $, there exists a constant
  $c=c(r, D)$ such that for every graph $ H $ with maximum degree $D$
  if $H^{\sigma}$ is a subdivision of~$H$ in which
  $\sigma(e) &gt; c \log n $ for every $e \in E(H)$, where
  $n=|V(H^\sigma)|$, then
  $ \widehat{R}_r(H^\sigma) = O\big(2^{34r}
  r^6 \log^5(r) D^5\log D\big)n. $ We improve upon this result in the case that~$H^{\sigma}$
  is a bipartite graph and the number of colors~$r$ is large using a
  significantly different argument, obtaining the bound
  $ \widehat{R}_r(H^{\sigma}) \leq r^{400D \log D} \, n $.</description>

      <title>2-dimensional unit vector flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study $2$-dimensional unit vector flows on graphs, that is, nowhere-zero flows that assign to each oriented edge a unit vector in $\mathbb R^{3}$. We give a new geometric characterization of $\mathbb S^{2}$-flows on cubic graphs. We also prove that the class of cubic graphs admitting an $\mathbb S^{2}$-flow is closed under a natural composition operation, which yields further constructions; in particular, blowing up a vertex into a triangle preserves the existence of an $\mathbb S^{2}$-flow. Our second contribution is algebraic: we extend the rank-based approach of [SIAM J. Discrete Math., 29 (2015), pp.~2166--2178] from $\mathbb S^{1}$-flows to $\mathbb S^{2}$-flows. More precisely, we show that if an $\mathbb S^{2}$-flow $\varphi$ satisfies $\operatorname{rank}(S_{\mathbb{Q}}(\varphi))\le 2$ and $S_{\mathbb{Q}}(\varphi)$ is odd-coordinate-free, then the graph admits a nowhere-zero $4$-flow.</description>

      <title>Signs of Hamiltonian Circles in Simple Plane Signed Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study which signs can occur among Hamiltonian circles in simple plane signed graphs. Using a face-based viewpoint, we relate the sign of a Hamiltonian circle to the product of the signs of the faces inside it, and we introduce co-Hamiltonian sequences. This yields a criterion for the existence of opposite-sign Hamiltonian circles via two co-Hamiltonian sequences with opposite face-products. Motivated by signed grid graphs, we develop local structural theorems that allow one to certify the existence of both signs without explicitly constructing the full sequences, including a ladder-type configuration where toggling along two $4$-circles produces Hamiltonian circles of opposite sign, as well as hexagon configurations that realize both signs.</description>

      <title>Spectral radius, toughness, binding number and $k$-factor of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A $k$-regular spanning subgraph of $G$ is called a $k$-factor. In this paper, we provide spectral radius and edge conditions to ensure that a graph $G$ with $\delta(G)\ge k$ admits a $k$-factor. Fan, Lin and Lu [European J. Combin. 110 (2023) 103701] presented a tight sufficient condition in terms of the spectral radius for a connected 1-tough graph to contain a connected 2-factor (Hamilton cycle). Then it is interesting to consider the following problem: What is the spectral radius condition to guarantee the existence of a $k$-factor with $k\ge3$ in a connected 1-tough graph $G$ with $\delta(G)\ge k$? We completely solve this problem, and we further obtain a sufficient spectral radius condition for the existence of a $k$-factor in a connected 1-binding graph, which solves an important problem posed by Fan and Lin [Electron. J. Combin. 31 (2024) 1--30].</description>

      <title>Equivariant log concavity and the $\operatorname{FI^\sharp}$-module structure on $H^i(\operatorname{Conf}(n,\mathbb{R}^d))$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous work has conjectured that the graded $\mathfrak{S}_n$-representations $H^\bullet(\operatorname{Conf}(n,\mathbb{R}^d);\mathbb{Q})$ are strongly equivariantly log concave, and has proven this conjecture in low degrees. By leveraging the theory of representation stability, we are able instead prove a stronger statement about the $\operatorname{FI^\sharp}$-module structure on $H^i(\operatorname{Conf}(n,\mathbb{R}^d);\mathbb{Q})$ which implies the original conjecture up to degree 19. We conjecture that this equivariant log concavity-like property holds in all degrees for the $\operatorname{FI^\sharp}$-modules $H^i(\operatorname{Conf}(n,\mathbb{R}^d);\mathbb{Q})$.</description>

      <title>On the Maximum Number of Spanning Trees in $C_4$-Free Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a ``Kirchhoff--Tur\'an'' variant of the extremal $C_4$ problem: among all simple connected $n$-vertex $C_4$-free graphs $G$, maximize the number of spanning trees $\tau(G)$. For the projective-plane orders $n=q^2+q+1$ we compute an exact formula for the Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi orthogonal polarity graph $ER_q$, namely $\tau(ER_q)=n^{(n-3)/2}$, via a polarity spectral identity and Kirchhoff's matrix--tree theorem. We also give an explicit general upper bound on $\mathrm{st}(n,C_4)$ at these $n$ using a sharp degree-sequence inequality for $\tau(G)$ and a degree-balancing argument; this matches the lower bound in the leading exponential term.</description>

      <title>On the Number of Connected Edge Cover Sets of Some Graph Families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G=(V,E)$ be a simple connected graph. A connected edge cover of $G$ is a subset $S\subseteq E$ such that every vertex of $G$ is incident with at least one edge in $S$ and the subgraph induced by $S$ is connected. The connected edge cover polynomial of $G$ is defined as $E_c(G,x)=\sum_{i} e_c(G,i)x^i$, where $e_c(G,i)$ denotes the number of connected edge covers of $G$ with exactly $i$ edges. In this paper, we derive explicit formulas for both the connected edge cover polynomials and the total number of connected edge covers for several important graph families, including wheels, complete graphs $K_n$, complete bipartite graphs $K_{2,n}$, friendship graphs, and lollipop graphs. Each formula is accompanied by a combinatorial proof and verified by computational enumeration for small orders.</description>

      <title>Perpetually Fair Assignments Via Balanced Sequences of Permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is a set of n indivisible items (or chores), and a set of n players. Each day, a single item should be assigned to each player. We want to ensure that all players feel that they have been treated fairly, not only after the last day, but after every single day. We present two 'balance' conditions on sequences of permutations. One condition can always be satisfied, but is arguably too weak; a second condition is strong, and can be satisfied for all n &lt;= 11, but cannot be satisfied for some larger values of n, including all n&gt;61.
  We then relate the 'balance' condition to the requirement that the cumulative assignment is proportional up to one item (PROP1), where proportionality holds in a strong ordinal sense -- for every valuations that are consistent with the item ranking. We present a third balance condition that implies ordinal PROP1. We show that a sequence guaranteeing this balance condition exists for all n &lt;= 12, but might not exist when n=6k for any k &gt;= 19.
  Finally, we present a fourth, weaker balance condition on a sequence, that guarantees ordinal proportionality up to two items (PROP2). Whether or not this condition can be satisfied for all n remains an open question.</description>

      <title>The average order of a connected vertex set in $K_m \times P_n$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.21791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a connected graph. Let $N(G)$ and $S(G)$ be the number of connected sets of $G$ and the sum of the orders of these connected sets of $G$, respectively. Then $A(G)=\frac{S(G)}{N(G)}$ is called the average order of a connected set of $G$. In this paper, we derive a closed-form formula for $A(K_m \times P_n)$, where $K_m \times P_n$ is the Cartesian product of the complete graph $K_m$ and the path $P_n$.</description>

      <title>Steiner Forest for $H$-Subgraph-Free Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our main result is a full classification, for every connected graph $H$, of the computational complexity of Steiner Forest on $H$-subgraph-free graphs. To obtain this dichotomy, we establish the following new algorithmic, hardness, and combinatorial results:
  Algorithms: We identify two new classes of graph-theoretical structures that make it possible to solve Steiner Forest in polynomial time. Roughly speaking, our algorithms handle the following cases: (1) a set $X$ of vertices of bounded size that are pairwise connected by subgraphs of treewidth $2$ or bounded size, possibly together with an independent set of arbitrary size that is connected to $X$ in an arbitrary way; (2) a set $X$ of vertices of arbitrary size that are pairwise connected in a cyclic manner by subgraphs of treewidth $2$ or bounded size.
  Hardness results: We show that Steiner Forest remains NP-complete for graphs with 2-deletion set number $3$. (The $c$-deletion set number is the size of a smallest cutset $S$ such that every component of $G-S$ has at most $c$ vertices.)
  Combinatorial results: To establish the dichotomy, we perform a delicate graph-theoretic analysis showing that if $H$ is a path or a subdivided claw, then excluding $H$ as a subgraph either yields one of the two algorithmically favourable structures described above, or yields a graph class for which NP-completeness of Steiner Forest follows from either our new hardness result or a previously known one.
  Along the way to classifying the hardness for excluded subgraphs, we establish a dichotomy for graphs with $c$-deletion set number at most $k$. Specifically, our results together with pre-existing ones show that Steiner Forest is polynomial-time solvable if (1) $c=1$ and $k\geq 0$, or (2) $c=2$ and $k\leq 2$, or (3) $c\geq 3$ and $k=1$, and is NP-complete otherwise.</description>

Abstract: We show that for any $d\ge 2$ and $\Delta&gt;0$ there exists $\eta&gt;0$ such that the following holds: Let $G$ be an $n$-vertex graph with at least $\Omega(n^2)$ edges and let $H$ be an $n$-vertex $d$-degenerate graph with maximum degree at most $\Delta$. Then with high probability, $G \cup G(n, n^{-1/d - \eta})$ contains a copy of $H$. We also prove that the same conclusion extends to $d$-regular graphs with $d\ge 4$ satisfying a certain edge expansion property, with the threshold improved to $n^{-2/d - \eta}$. Such a property is satisfied by almost all
  $d$-regular graphs and for even $d$, by the $(d/2)$-th power of a Hamilton cycle.</description>

      <title>Symbols frequencies in the Thue--Morse word in base $3/2$ and related conjectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a binary Thue--Morse-type sequence arising from the base-$3/2$ expansion of integers, an archetypal automatic sequence in a rational base numeration system. Because the sequence is generated by a periodic iteration of morphisms rather than a single primitive substitution, classical Perron--Frobenius methods do not directly apply to determine symbol frequencies. We prove that both symbols ${\tt 0},{\tt 1}$ occur with frequency $1/2$ and we show uniform recurrence and symmetry properties of its set of factors. The proof reveals a structural bridge between combinatorics on words and harmonic analysis: the first difference sequence is shown to be Toeplitz, providing dynamical rigidity, while filtered frequencies naturally encode a dyadic structure that lifts to the compact group of $2$-adic integers. In this $2$-adic setting, desubstitution becomes a linear operator on Fourier coefficients, and a spectral contraction argument enforces uniqueness of limiting densities. Our results answer several conjectures of Dekking (on a sibling sequence) and illustrate how harmonic analysis on compact groups can be fruitfully combined with substitution dynamics.</description>

      <title>On the expansion formulas of cluster varieties from surfaces and their combinatorial properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the cluster algebra structure of the moduli space $\mathscr{A}_{\mathrm{SL}_{n+1},\mathbb{S}}$ of twisted $\mathrm{SL}_{n+1}$-local systems on a surface. We derive general recurrence relations for cluster variables arising from flips of a triangulation, corresponding to specific sequences of mutations. Our approach is grounded in a detailed combinatorial analysis over the standard $n$-triangulated $m$-gon (with explicit calculations for $n=1,2$). As a generalization, the non-simply-laced $G_2$ type is also considered. We prove the "well-triangulated" property for cluster mutations under flips, which provides a combinatorial framework for understanding the stability and transformation rules of these cluster algebra structures, and compute the monomial counts for the cluster expansion formula.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.22089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A hereditary class of graphs has bounded clique-width if and only if its prime members do, but this lifting property fails for linear clique-width. We prove that a hereditary class has bounded linear clique-width if and only if its prime members do and it contains neither all quasi-threshold graphs nor all complements of quasi-threshold graphs. This generalizes a result of Brignall, Korpelainen, and Vatter, who established the result for cographs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.22129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of enumerating hypermatrices of format $2 \times (k + 1) \times k$ over a finite field that have nonzero hyperdeterminant and whose nonzero entries are restricted to a plane partition. We conjecture an attractive product formula for the enumeration, and prove it in many cases. In general, we show that the enumeration is given (up to a power of $q - 1$) by a polynomial in $q$ with nonnegative integer coefficients, whose value at $q = 1$ enumerates a natural family of three-dimensional rook placements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.22181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Forty-five years ago, a young researcher in finite permutation group theory encountered a paper by Robert Woodrow. The homogeneous triangle-free graph Woodrow described there seemed to be an infinite analogue of the Higman--Sims graph which had played an important role in the researcher's thesis. The encounter changed the course of the researcher's career. This paper is the story of that event and its aftermath.
  The final section of the paper suggests that Fra\"{\i}ss\'e classes of rigid structures are a potentially interesting generalisation of Ramsey classes.</description>

      <title>The constructions of Singleton-optimal locally repairable codes with minimum distance 6 and locality 3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present new constructions of $q$-ary Singleton-optimal locally repairable codes (LRCs) with minimum distance $d=6$ and locality $r=3$, based on combinatorial structures from finite geometry. By exploiting the well-known correspondence between a complete set of mutually orthogonal Latin squares (MOLS) of order $q$ and the affine plane $\mathrm{AG}(2,q)$, We systematically construct families of disjoint 4-arcs in the projective plane $\mathrm{PG}(2,q)$, such that the union of any two distinct 4-arcs forms an 8-arc. These 4-arcs form what we call 4-local arcs, and their existence is equivalent to that of the desired codes. For any prime power $q\ge 7$, our construction yields codes of length $n = 2q$, $2q-2$, or $2q-6$ depending on whether $q$ is even, $q\equiv 3 \pmod{4}$, or $q\equiv 1 \pmod{4}$, respectively.</description>

      <title>On combinatorial bounds for the total Tjurina numbers of certain curves and surfaces with isolated singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate combinatorial bounds for the total Tjurina numbers of plane curve arrangements. Focusing on arrangements of lines and conics in $\mathbb{P}^2$ that admit only ordinary quasi-homogeneous singularities, we derive new structural inequalities governing the distribution of multiple intersection points. As a consequence, we establish sharp lower bounds for the total Tjurina numbers of free line arrangements with bounded maximal multiplicity and, more generally, for free conic-line arrangements. In particular, we show that for a free arrangement of $d$ lines and $k$ conics, the total Tjurina number grows at least quadratically in $d$ and $k$, and we demonstrate that this bound is sharp. As an application, we construct a particular family of surfaces in $\mathbb{P}^3$ with only isolated singularities having arbitrarily large total Tjurina numbers. This provides new lower bounds for the total Tjurina numbers of certain hypersurfaces that are independent of detailed homological data.</description>

      <title>Maximal Recoverability: A Nexus of Coding Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the modern era of large-scale computing systems, a crucial use of error correcting codes is to judiciously introduce redundancy to ensure recoverability from failure. To get the most out of every byte, practitioners and theorists have introduced the framework of maximal recoverability (MR) to study optimal error-correcting codes in various architectures. In this survey, we dive into the study of two families of MR codes: MR locally recoverable codes (LRCs) (also known as partial MDS codes) and grid codes (GCs).
  For each of these two families of codes, we discuss the primary recoverability guarantees as well as what is known concerning optimal constructions. Along the way, we discuss many surprising connections between MR codes and broader questions in computer science and mathematics. For MR LRCs, the use of skew polynomial codes has unified many previous constructions. For MR GCs, the theory of higher order MDS codes shows that MR GCs can be used to construct optimal list-decodable codes. Furthermore, the optimally recoverable patterns of MR GCs have close ties to long-standing problems on the structural rigidity of graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06557v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that for every set $S$ of vertices of a directed graph $D$, the maximum number of vertices in $S$ contained in a collection of vertex-disjoint cycles in $D$ is at least the minimum size of a set of vertices that hits all cycles containing a vertex of $S$. As a consequence, the directed tree-width of a directed graph is linearly bounded in its cycle-width, which improves the previously known quadratic upper bound.
  We further show that the corresponding statement in bidirected graphs is true and that its edge-variant holds in both undirected and directed graphs, but fails in bidirected graphs. The vertex-version in undirected graphs remains an open problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05385v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A tuple $(G_1,\dots,G_n)$ of graphs on the same vertex set of size $n$ is said to be Hamilton-universal if for every map $\chi: [n]\to[n]$ there exists a Hamilton cycle whose $i$-th edge comes from $G_{\chi(i)}$. Bowtell, Morris, Pehova and Staden proved an analog of Dirac's theorem in this setting, namely that if $\delta(G_i)\geq (1/2+o(1))n$ then $(G_1,\dots,G_n)$ is Hamilton-universal. Combining McDiarmid's coupling and a colorful version of the Friedman-Pippenger tree embedding technique, we establish a similar result in the setting of sparse random graphs, showing that there exists $C$ such that if the $G_i$ are independent random graphs sampled from $G(n,p)$, where $p\geq C\log n/n$, then $(G_1,\dots,G_n)$ is Hamilton-universal with high probability.</description>

      <title>Perfecting the Line Graph</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23231v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces two canonical constructions that transform arbitrary finite graphs into perfect graphs: the symmetric lift $\mathrm{HL}'_2(G)$, which is purely structural and label-invariant, and the ordered lift $\mathrm{HL}_2(G)$, which depends explicitly on vertex labeling and encodes directional information. Both lifts arise as line graphs of bipartite double covers and are box-perfect. Equivalently, if $\BDC{G}$ denotes the canonical (Kronecker) bipartite double cover of $G$, then \[
  \HL'_2(G) \;=\; L(\BDC{G}), \] the line graph of $\BDC{G}$.
  The symmetric lift $\mathrm{HL}'_2(G)$ forms a canonical 2-cover of the line graph $L(G)$. This involution decomposes $\mathrm{HL}'_2(G)$ into symmetric and antisymmetric components: the symmetric part recovers $L(G)$, while the antisymmetric part yields a signed graph $L^-(G)$, the antisymmetric line graph, with $+1/-1$ edges encoding consistent versus crossed overlaps. Thus, all adjacency and Laplacian eigenvalues of $L(G)$, with multiplicities, appear within those of $\mathrm{HL}'_2(G)$, despite $L(G)$ typically not being a subgraph.
  For regular graphs such as Paley graphs, this construction yields infinite families of sparse, highly structured regular and box-perfect graphs whose lifts contain large cliques (of size $d$ for $d$-regular bases). When the base graph is an expander, the symmetric lift preserves its spectral expansion while producing dense local clique structure. Similar behavior is observed computationally for random regular base graphs, suggesting a natural framework for the study of box-perfect random regular graphs.
  Finally, we generalize these constructions to parameterized lifts $\mathrm{HL}_{r,d}(G)$ and $\mathrm{HL}_{r,d}'(G)$ defined on ordered $r$-tuples connected by Hamming distance constraints, which structurally encode the base graph and remain box-perfect.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05640v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The characterization of the finite minimal automorphic posets of width three is still an open problem. Niederle has shown that this task can be reduced to the characterization of the nice sections of width three which have a non-trivial tower of nice sections as retract. In our article, we develop a recursive approach for the determination of those nice sections of width three which have a 4-crown stack as retract. We apply the approach on a sub-class $\mathfrak{N}_2$ of nice sections of width three and determine all posets in $\mathfrak{N}_2$ with height up to six which have a 4-crown stack as retract. For each integer $n \geq 2$, the class $\mathfrak{N}_2$ contains $2^{n-2}$ different isomorphism types of posets of height $n$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15280v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: DISCLAIMER: Due to an error in the literature, we cannot be sure that the conclusions drawn in this paper are correct.
  The goal of this note is to connect some interesting results in the literature on algebraic graph theory and finite geometry. In 1999, Weng gave an almost complete classification of classical distance-regular graphs of negative type with diameter at least 4. He proved that these graphs are either dual polar graphs of Hermitian polar spaces, Hermitian forms graphs, or fall into a last category. It was recently proved by Yian et al. that the latter category does not exist when the diameter equals 3, which by Weng's results proves that they do not exist for bigger diameter. Using a result of Vanhove, this proves that certain hemisystems in Hermitian polar spaces cannot exist.</description>

As a result, we obtain the Combinatorial Invariance Conjecture, of Lusztig and of Dyer, also for Bruhat intervals of length at most $6$. We also prove the Gabber--Joseph conjecture for the second-highest $Ext$ group of a pair of Verma modules, as well as the combinatorial invariance of the dimension of this group, and of the numbers of frozen and of mutable variables in the cluster structure on Richardson varieties.</description>

      <title>The Simplicial Geometry of Integer Partitions: An Exact $O(1)$ Formula via $A_{k-1}$ Root Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03162v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a structural resolution to the exact evaluation of the restricted partition function $p_k(n)$, addressing the computational limitations of traditional recursive and asymptotic methods. By introducing the Simplicial Spectral Decomposition, we demonstrate that the partition polytope $\mathcal{P}_{n,k}$ admits a rigid minimal unimodular triangulation governed by the $A_{k-1}$ Weyl chamber. We prove the Rational Structure Theorem, establishing that the generating function of the spectral weights is always a rational function defined over cyclotomic fields. Consequently, the sequence of weights is a quasipolynomial (ultimately periodic) for all $k$. This result unifies the treatment of prime and composite $k$, showing that the computational complexity of evaluating $p_k(n)$ is strictly $O(1)$ with respect to $n$. We provide explicit formulas and a generalized algorithm verified against Euler's recurrence.</description>

      <title>Invariant covers of multipartite hypergraphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.10849v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the following ``symmetric analogue'' of Lov\'asz's estimate (1975): if an $r$-partite hypergraph of rank $r\geqslant2$ has a cover of cardinality $n&lt;\infty$, then it admits a cover of cardinality at most $nr/2$, which is invariant with respect to all automorphisms preserving the parts. We obtain also symmetric analogues of generalisations of Lov\'asz's estimate due to Aharoni, Holzman, and Krivelevich (1996).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.11355v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a refinement of Boolean-Catalan numbers and call them Boolean-Narayana numbers. We provide an explicit formula for these numbers, and prove unimodality, log-concavity, and real-roots-only results for their sequences. We also prove a three-term recurrence relation for their generating polynomials.</description>

      <title>On the Gap Structure of Generalized Stirling Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16859v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Katugampola's 2015 study of generalized fractional differential operators produced triangular arrays of integer coefficients indexed by a fractional order r and by dimensions n and k, but no combinatorial interpretation has been established for any fractional order. We give the first such interpretation, with two main results: (i) a complete combinatorial interpretation for r = 1/2 and n = 1,2,3, and (ii) a rigorous proof that this interpretation cannot extend to n &gt;= 4 within the same framework. For n = 1,2,3, we show that the coefficients for r = 1/2 count binary sequences satisfying two conditions: they contain at least one symbol B, and they have gap &lt;= 1, where the gap is the distance between the first and last occurrence of B. Each sequence is assigned a type k by a parity-dependent rule involving the gap value, and exhaustive enumeration matches Katugampola's coefficients exactly. We then prove an obstruction theorem showing that the gap &lt;= 1 condition forces any such model to produce at most two distinct types per row, whereas Katugampola's array requires at least three types for every n &gt;= 4. Thus the gap &lt;= 1 binary-sequence interpretation works if and only if n = 1,2,3. Our results turn a computational observation into a rigorous impossibility theorem and provide guidance for future attempts to obtain complete combinatorial interpretations of fractional-calculus coefficients.</description>

      <title>Semi-magic dihedral squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20774v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be a group of order $n^2$ and $SMS_{\Gamma}(n)=(a_{i,j})_{n\times n}$ be an $n\times n$ array whose entries are all distinct elements of $\Gamma$. If there exists an element $\mu\in\Gamma$ such that for every row $i$, there exists an ordering of elements such that
  $$
  a_{i,j_1} a_{i,j_2} \dots a_{i,j_{n-1}} a_{i,j_n} = \mu
  $$
  and for every column $j$ there exists an ordering of elements such that
  $$
  a_{i_1,j} a_{i_2,j} \dots a_{i_{m-1},j} a_{i_m,j} = \mu,
  $$
  then $SMS_{\Gamma}(n)$ is called a \emph{$\Gamma$-semi-magic square of side $n$} and $\mu$ is called a \emph{magic constant}.
  We provide a complete characterization of semi-magic squares of side $n$ whose entries belong to a dihedral group $D_k$. Moreover, we show that in our constructions a single semi-magic square may admit two distinct magic constants, depending on the order in which the products are computed.</description>

      <title>Polynomial Freiman-Ruzsa, Reed-Muller codes and Shannon capacity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13493v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1948, Shannon used a probabilistic argument to show the existence of codes achieving a maximal rate defined by the channel capacity. In 1954, Muller and Reed introduced a simple deterministic code construction based on polynomial evaluations, which was conjectured and eventually proven to achieve capacity. Meanwhile, polarization theory emerged as an analytic framework to prove capacity results for a variation of RM codes - the polar codes. Polarization theory further gave a powerful framework for various other code constructions, but it remained unfulfilled for RM codes. In this paper, we settle the establishment of a polarization theory for RM codes, which implies in particular that RM codes have a vanishing local error below capacity. Our proof puts forward a striking connection with the recent proof of the Polynomial Freiman-Ruzsa conjecture [40] and an entropy extraction approach related to [2]. It further puts forward a small orbit localization lemma of potential broader applicability in combinatorial number theory. Finally, a new additive combinatorics conjecture is put forward, with potentially broader applications to coding theory.</description>

      <title>Barile-Macchia Resolutions and the closed neighborhood ideal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22657v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the minimal free resolutions of closed neighborhood ideals of graphs within the framework of Barile-Macchia (BM) resolutions. We show that for any tree $T$, the closed neighborhood ideal $NI(T)$ is bridge-friendly, and hence its BM resolution is minimal. The combinatorial structure of trees further allows us to construct a maximal critical cell of size $\alpha(T)$, leading to the equality $\operatorname{pd}(R/NI(T)) = \alpha(T)$, where $\alpha(T)$ denotes the independence number of $T$ and $\operatorname{pd}$ is the projective dimension. Using Betti splitting techniques, we also obtain explicit formulas for the graded Betti numbers of $NI(P_n)$, where $P_n$ is the path graph on $n$ vertices. Finally, we make some observations on the bridge-friendly condition of the closed neighborhood ideals of chordal and bipartite graphs.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic linking of a simplicial $n$-complex embedded in $\mathbb{R}^{2n}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.19511v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the existence of minimal simplicial $n$-complexes which inevitably contain a nonsplittable two-component link formed by an $(n-1)$-sphere and an $n$-sphere in any embedding into $\mathbb{R}^{2n}$. This provides a higher-dimensional generalization of graphs that are not non-separating planar.</description>
