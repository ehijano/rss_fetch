      <title>Flexible Coupler Array with Reconfigurable Pattern: Mechanical Beamforming and Digital Agent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flexible coupler is a promising solution for enhancing wireless network capacity by moving passive couplers around a fixed-position active antenna to reshape the induced currents on passive elements. Motivated by this, this paper proposes a novel flexible coupler array that incorporates additional degrees of freedom (DoF) in radiation pattern reconfiguration and enhanced communication coverage with low hardware cost. Specifically, a new form of mechanical beamforming can be obtained by moving only the passive coupling elements while keeping the active antenna stationary. In addition, the flexible coupler antenna can slide along a rail toward users, thereby enhancing communication coverage. To fully exploit the potential of the flexible coupler array, we formulate a two-timescale sum-rate maximization problem with statistical channel state information (CSI). The antenna position is optimized based on scattering cluster-core statistics in the slow timescale, while mechanical beamforming is optimized based on multipath channel statistics in the fast timescale, subject to movement and energy constraints. To address the coupling between timescales and the high cost of extensive channel sampling, we develop a digital agent framework that leverages an electromagnetic (EM) map to generate statistical channel information for different user and antenna positions. Then, a deep neural network is trained to learn a slow-fast performance (SFP) surrogate. Mechanical beamforming at the fast timescale is obtained by selecting per-antenna radiation patterns from a predefined dictionary via a convex relaxation. Simulation results verify the performance gains achieved by the proposed flexible coupler array and the digital-agent-assisted algorithm.</description>

      <title>Optimality Analysis of RSMA Degenerating to SDMA Under Imperfect SIC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This document serves as supplementary material for our journal submission, providing detailed mathematical proofs and derivations that support the results presented in the main manuscript. Specifically, under a modeling framework that jointly considers transceiver hardware impairments and imperfect successive interference cancellation (SIC), we systematically derive and prove from an optimality perspective that: when the residual interference coefficient approaches 1 (i.e., SIC becomes severely ineffective), there exists an optimal solution such that the common stream beamformer satisfies $\bm w_c^\star=\bm 0$, and hence the optimal rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) transmission structure degenerates into space division multiple access (SDMA). This conclusion provides a verifiable theoretical justification for the convergence phenomenon observed in simulations, namely that "the RSMA performance gradually approaches that of SDMA as SIC degrades", and can also serve as a reference for multiple-access selection and system design in SIC-limited scenarios.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-Aware Jamming Mitigation with Active RIS: A Robust Stackelberg Game Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Malicious jamming presents a pervasive threat to the secure communications, where the challenge becomes increasingly severe due to the growing capability of the jammer allowing the adaptation to legitimate transmissions. This paper investigates the jamming mitigation by leveraging an active reconfigurable intelligent surface (ARIS), where the channel uncertainties are particularly addressed for robust anti-jamming design. Towards this issue, we adopt the Stackelberg game formulation to model the strategic interaction between the legitimate side and the adversary, acting as the leader and follower, respectively. We prove the existence of the game equilibrium and adopt the backward induction method for equilibrium analysis. We first derive the optimal jamming policy as the follower's best response, which is then incorporated into the legitimate-side optimization for robust anti-jamming design. We address the uncertainty issue and reformulate the legitimate-side problem by exploiting the error bounds to combat the worst-case jamming attacks. The problem is decomposed within a block successive upper bound minimization (BSUM) framework to tackle the power allocation, transceiving beamforming, and active reflection, respectively, which are iterated towards the robust jamming mitigation scheme. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in protecting the legitimate transmissions under uncertainties, and the superior performance in terms of jamming mitigation as compared with the baselines.</description>

      <title>Construction of Cyclic Codes over a Class of Matrix Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $ \mathbb F_2[u]/ \langle u^k \rangle= \mathbb F_2+u\mathbb F_2+u^2\mathbb F_2+\cdots+u^{k-1}\mathbb F_2 ,$ where $u^k=0$ for a positive integer $k$, and $\mathcal{R}=M_4 (\mathbb F_2( u)/ \langle u^k \rangle)$ be the finite noncommutative non-chain matrix ring of order $4\times4$. This paper presents the construction of cyclic codes over the finite field $\mathbb F_{16}$ via the considered matrix ring $\mathcal{R}$. In this connection, first, we discuss the structure of the ring $\mathcal{R}$ and show that $\mathcal{R}$ is isomorphic to the ring $( \mathbb F_{16}+ v\mathbb F_{16} + v^2\mathbb F_{16} + v^3\mathbb F_{16}) + u(\mathbb F_{16} + v\mathbb F_{16} + v^2\mathbb F_{16} + v^3\mathbb F_{16}) + u^2(\mathbb F_{16} + v\mathbb F_{16} + v^2\mathbb F_{16}+ v^3\mathbb F_{16}) + \cdots + u^{k-1}(\mathbb F_{16} + v\mathbb F_{16} + v^2\mathbb F_{16} + v^3\mathbb F_{16})$ where $v^4=0, u^k=0, u^iv^j=v^ju^i$ for $i \in \{1,\dots, k-1\}$ and $j \in \{1, 2, 3\}$. Then, we establish the form of ideals of the ring $\mathcal{R}$ and related cyclic codes over $\mathcal{R}$. Further, we show that these cyclic codes can be written as the direct sums of $\mathcal{R}$-submodules of $\frac{\mathcal{R}[x]}{&lt;x^n-1&gt;}$, and derive the formula for the cardinality of cyclic codes over $\mathcal{R}$. Then, we consider the Euclidean and Hermitian duals of the derived cyclic codes over $\mathcal{R}$. Under the module isometry for $\mathcal{R}$, we use the Bachoc map and the Gray map, which takes a derived cyclic code over $\mathcal{R}$ to $\mathbb F_{16}$. Finally, we provide some non-trivial examples of linear codes over $\mathbb F_{16}$ with good parameters that support our derived results and compare a few codes with existing codes in the literature.</description>

      <title>Quantum Maximum Likelihood Prediction via Hilbert Space Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent works have proposed various explanations for the ability of modern large language models (LLMs) to perform in-context prediction. We propose an alternative conceptual viewpoint from an information-geometric and statistical perspective. Motivated by Bach[2023], we model training as learning an embedding of probability distributions into the space of quantum density operators, and in-context learning as maximum-likelihood prediction over a specified class of quantum models. We provide an interpretation of this predictor in terms of quantum reverse information projection and quantum Pythagorean theorem when the class of quantum models is sufficiently expressive. We further derive non-asymptotic performance guarantees in terms of convergence rates and concentration inequalities, both in trace norm and quantum relative entropy. Our approach provides a unified framework to handle both classical and quantum LLMs.</description>

      <title>A Generalized Information Bottleneck Method: A Decision-Theoretic Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The information bottleneck (IB) method seeks a compressed representation of data that preserves information relevant to a target variable for prediction while discarding irrelevant information from the original data. In its classical formulation, the IB method employs mutual information to evaluate the compression between the original and compressed data and the utility of the representation for the target variable. In this study, we investigate a generalized IB problem, where the evaluation of utility is based on the $\mathcal{H}$-mutual information that satisfies the concave (\texttt{CV}) and averaging (\texttt{AVG}) conditions. This class of information measures admits a statistical decision-theoretic interpretation via its equivalence to the expected value of sample information. Based on this interpretation, we derive an alternating optimization algorithm to assess the tradeoff between compression and utility in the generalized IB problem.</description>

      <title>Unitarity estimation for quantum channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.09319v4 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimating the unitarity of an unknown quantum channel $\mathcal{E}$ provides information on how much it is unitary, which is a basic and important problem in quantum device certification and benchmarking. Unitarity estimation can be performed with either coherent or incoherent access, where the former in general leads to better query complexity while the latter allows more practical implementations. In this paper, we provide a unified framework for unitarity estimation, which induces ancilla-efficient algorithms that use $O(\epsilon^{-2})$ and $O(\sqrt{d}\cdot\epsilon^{-2})$ calls to $\mathcal{E}$ with coherent and incoherent accesses, respectively, where $d$ is the dimension of the system that $\mathcal{E}$ acts on and $\epsilon$ is the required precision. We further show that both the $d$-dependence and $\epsilon$-dependence of our algorithms are optimal. As part of our results, we settle the query complexity of the distinguishing problem for depolarizing and unitary channels with incoherent access by giving a matching lower bound $\Omega(\sqrt{d})$, improving the prior best lower bound $\Omega(\sqrt[3]{d})$ by Aharonov et al. (Nat. Commun. 2022) and Chen et al. (FOCS 2021).</description>

      <title>Reasoning-Native Agentic Communication for 6G</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Future 6G networks will interconnect not only devices, but autonomous machines that continuously sense, reason, and act. In such environments, communication can no longer be understood solely as delivering bits or even preserving semantic meaning. Even when two agents interpret the same information correctly, they may still behave inconsistently if their internal reasoning processes evolve differently. We refer to this emerging challenge as belief divergence. This article introduces reasoning native agentic communication, a new paradigm in which communication is explicitly designed to address belief divergence rather than merely transmitting representations. Instead of triggering transmissions based only on channel conditions or data relevance, the proposed framework activates communication according to predicted misalignment in agents internal belief states. We present a reasoning native architecture that augments the conventional communication stack with a coordination plane grounded in a shared knowledge structure and bounded belief modeling. Through enabling mechanisms and representative multi agent scenarios, we illustrate how such an approach can prevent coordination drift and maintain coherent behavior across heterogeneous systems. By reframing communication as a regulator of distributed reasoning, reasoning native agentic communication enables 6G networks to act as an active harmonizer of autonomous intelligence.</description>

      <title>Dual Length Codes for Lossless Compression of BFloat16</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Training and serving Large Language Models (LLMs) relies heavily on parallelization and collective operations, which are frequently bottlenecked by network bandwidth. Lossless compression using e.g., Huffman codes can alleviate the issue, however, Huffman codes suffer from slow, bit-sequential decoding and high hardware complexity due to deep tree traversals. Universal codes e.g., Exponential-Golomb codes are faster to decode but do not exploit the symbol frequency distributions. To address these limitations, this paper introduces Dual Length Codes, a hybrid approach designed to balance compression efficiency with decoding speed. Analyzing BFloat16 tensors from the Gemma model, we observed that the top 8 most frequent symbols account for approximately 50% of the cumulative probability. These 8 symbols are assigned a short 4 bit code. The remaining 248 symbols are assigned a longer 9 bit code. The coding scheme uses a single prefix bit to distinguish between the two code lengths. The scheme uses a small Look Up Table with only 8 entries for encoding and decoding. The scheme achieves a compressibility of 18.6% in comparison to 21.3% achieved by Huffman codes, but it significantly speeds up the decoding and simplifies the hardware complexity.</description>

      <title>Joint Multi-User Tracking and Signal Detection in Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface-Assisted Cell-Free ISAC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the cell-free multi-user integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system, where multiple base stations collaboratively track the users and detect their signals. Moreover, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) are deployed to serve as additional reference nodes to overcome the line-of-sight blockage issue of mobile users for accomplishing seamless sensing. Due to the high-speed user mobility, the multi-user tracking and signal detection performance can be significantly deteriorated without elaborated online user kinematic state updating principles. To tackle this challenge, we first manage to establish a probabilistic signal model to comprehensively characterize the interdependencies among user states, transmit signals, and received signals during the tracking procedure. Based on the Bayesian problem formulation, we further propose a novel hybrid variational message passing (HVMP) algorithm to realize computationally efficient joint estimation of user states and transmit signals in an online manner, which integrates VMP and standard MP to derive the posterior probabilities of estimated variables. Furthermore, the Bayesian Cramer-Rao bound is provided to characterize the performance limit of the multi-user tracking problem, which is also utilized to optimize RIS phase profiles for tracking performance enhancement. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can significantly improve both tracking and signal detection performance over the representative Bayesian estimation counterparts.</description>

      <title>Non-Contiguous Wi-Fi Spectrum for ISAC: Impact on Multipath Delay Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Leveraging channel state information from multiple Wi-Fi bands can improve delay resolution for ranging and sensing when a wide contiguous spectrum is unavailable. However, frequency gaps shape the delay response, introducing sidelobes and secondary peaks that can obscure closely spaced multipath components. This paper examines multipath delay estimation for Wi-Fi-compliant multiband configurations using channel state information (CSI). For a two-path model with unknown complex gains and delays, the Cram\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for delay separation is derived and analyzed, confirming the benefit of larger frequency aperture, while revealing pronounced, separation-dependent oscillations driven by gap geometry and inter-path coupling. Given the local nature of Cram\'er-Rao lower bound, the delay response is analyzed next. In the single-path case, the combined subband responses determine how delay-domain sidelobe levels are distributed. The dominant peak spacing is set primarily by the separation between subband center frequencies. In the two-path case, increased aperture sharpens the mainlobe but also intensifies sidelobes and leakage, yielding competing peaks and, in some regimes, a dominant peak shifted from the true delay. Finally, a normalized leakage metric is introduced to predict problematic separations and to identify regimes where local Cram\'er-Rao lower bound analysis does not capture practical peak-leakage behavior in delay estimation.</description>

Abstract: Hardware heterogeneity across diverse user devices poses new challenges for beam-based communication in 5G and beyond. This heterogeneity limits the applicability of machine learning (ML)-based algorithms. This article highlights the critical need to treat hardware heterogeneity as a first-class design concern in ML-aided beam management. We analyze key failure modes in the presence of heterogeneity and present case studies demonstrating their performance impact. Finally, we discuss potential strategies to improve generalization in beam management.</description>

      <title>m^3TrackFormer: Transformer-based mmWave Multi-Target Tracking with Lost Target Re-Acquisition Capability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper considers a millimeter wave (mmWave) integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system, where a base station (BS) equipped with a large number of antennas but a small number of radio-frequency (RF) chains emits pencillike narrow beams for persistent tracking of multiple moving targets. Under this model, the tracking lost issue arising from the misalignment between the pencil-like beams and the true target positions is inevitable, especially when the trajectories of the targets are complex, and the conventional Kalman filter-based scheme does not work well. To deal with this issue, we propose a Transformer-based mmWave multi-target tracking framework, namely m3TrackFormer, with a novel re-acquisition mechanism, such that even if the echo signals from some targets are too weak to extract sensing information, we are able to re-acquire their locations quickly with small beam sweeping overhead. Specifically, the proposed framework can operate in two modes of normal tracking and target re-acquisition during the tracking procedure, depending on whether the tracking lost occurs. When all targets are hit by the swept beams, the framework works in the Normal Tracking Mode (N-Mode) with a Transformer encoder-based Normal Tracking Network (N-Net) to accurately estimate the positions of these targets and predict the swept beams in the next time block. While the tracking lost happens, the framework will switch to the Re-Acquisition Mode (R-Mode) with a Transformer decoder-based Re-Acquisition Network (RNet) to adjust the beam sweeping strategy for getting back the lost targets and maintaining the tracking of the remaining targets. Thanks to the ability of global trajectory feature extraction, the m3TrackFormer can achieve high beam prediction accuracy and quickly re-acquire the lost targets, compared with other tracking methods.</description>

      <title>Channel Estimation for Double-BD-RIS-Assisted Multi-User MIMO Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deploying multiple beyond diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (BD-RISs) can potentially improve the communication performance thanks to inter-element connections of each BD-RIS and inter-surface cooperative beamforming gain among BD-RISs. However, a major issue for multi-BD-RISassisted communication lies in the channel estimation overhead - the channel coefficients associated with the off-diagonal elements in each BD-RIS's scattering matrix as well as those associated with the reflection links among BD-RISs have to be estimated. In this paper, we propose an efficient channel estimation framework for double-BD-RIS-assisted multi-user multipleinput multiple-output (MIMO) systems. Specifically, we reveal that high-dimensional cascaded channels are characterized by five low-dimensional matrices by exploiting channel correlation properties. Based on this novel observation, in the ideal noiseless case, we develop a channel estimation scheme to recover these matrices sequentially and characterize the closed-form overhead required for perfect estimation as a function of the numbers of users and each BD-RIS's elements and channel ranks, which is with the same order as that in double-diagonal-RIS-aided communication systems. This exciting result implies the superiority of cooperative BD-RIS-aided communication over the diagonal- RIS counterpart even when channel estimation overhead is considered. We further extend the proposed scheme to practical noisy scenarios and provide extensive numerical simulations to validate its effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Analyzing and Improving Chain-of-Thought Monitorability Through Information Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) monitors are LLM-based systems that analyze reasoning traces to detect when outputs may exhibit attributes of interest, such as test-hacking behavior during code generation. In this paper, we use information-theoretic analysis to show that non-zero mutual information between CoT and output is a necessary but not sufficient condition for CoT monitorability. We identify two sources of approximation error that may undermine the performance of CoT monitors in practice: information gap, which measures the extent to which the monitor can extract the information available in CoT, and elicitation error, which measures the extent to which the monitor approximates the optimal monitoring function. We further demonstrate that CoT monitorability can be systematically improved through targeted training objectives. To this end, we propose two complementary approaches: (a) an oracle-based method that directly rewards the monitored model for producing CoTs that maximize monitor accuracy, and (b) a more practical, label-free approach that maximizes conditional mutual information between outputs and CoTs. Across multiple different environments, we show both methods significantly improve monitor accuracy while preventing CoT degeneration even when training against a monitor, thereby mitigating reward hacking when the task reward is imperfectly specified.</description>

      <title>Recoverable systems and the maximal hard-core model on the triangular lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a previous paper (arXiv:2510.19746), we have studied the maximal hard-code model on the square lattice ${\mathbb Z}^2$ from the perspective of recoverable systems. Here we extend this study to the case of the triangular lattice ${\mathbb A}$. The following results are obtained:
  (1) We derive bounds on the capacity of the associated recoverable system on ${\mathbb A}$;
  (2) We show non-uniqueness of Gibbs measures in the high-activity regime;
  (3) We characterize extremal periodic Gibbs measures for sufficiently low values of activity.</description>

      <title>Decoding convolutional codes over finite rings. A linear dynamical systems approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18316v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Observable convolutional codes defined over Zpr with the Predictable Degree Property admit minimal input/state/output representations that preserve structural properties under scalar restriction. We make use of this fact to present Rosenthal's decoding algorithm for these convolutional codes. When combined with the Greferath-Vellbinger algorithm and a modified version of the Torrecillas-Lobillo-Navarro algorithm, the decoding problem of convolutional codes over Zpr reduces to selecting two decoding algorithms for linear block codes over a field. Finally, we analyze both the theoretical and practical error-correction capabilities of the combined algorithm as well as its time complexity.</description>

      <title>MIMO FSO Systems in Hybrid Quantum Noise Environments: SKR Analysis with One- and Two-way CV-QKD Protocols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07408v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) free-space optical (FSO) communication system employing continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD), with the goal to support secret key transmission between two legitimate users, Alice and Bob. All involved wireless channels are subjected to atmospheric turbulence leading to beam spreading, pointing error, and turbulence-induced fading, which along with the presence of hybrid quantum noise negatively impact secret key exchange. Furthermore, the legitimate MIMO FSO system faces the threat of compromise from an eavesdropper, Eve, employing a collective Gaussian attack to intercept the secret key exchange. Novel one- and two-way protocols for enhancing the security of the transmitted keys are proposed. To this end, the transmissivity of the FSO channels is mathematically formulated and bounds on the mutual information between the transmitted and received coherent states are obtained, which are then used for deriving novel expressions for the secret key rates (SKRs) for both one- and two-way protocols. The presented numerical results corroborate the proposed analytical secrecy framework, quantifying the SKR gains obtained by employing MIMO and the two-way protocol for FSO CV-QKD systems.</description>

      <title>Majority-Logic Decoding of Binary Locally Recoverable Codes: A Probabilistic Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08765v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Locally repairable codes (LRCs) were originally introduced to enable efficient recovery from erasures in distributed storage systems by accessing only a small number of other symbols. While their structural properties-such as bounds and constructions-have been extensively studied, the performance of LRCs under random erasures and errors has remained largely unexplored. In this work, we study the error- and erasure-correction performance of binary linear LRCs under majority-logic decoding (MLD). Focusing on LRCs with fixed locality and varying availability, we derive explicit upper bounds on the probability of decoding failure over the memoryless Binary Erasure Channel (BEC) and Binary Symmetric Channel (BSC). Our analysis characterizes the behavior of the bit-error rate (BER) and block-error rate (BLER) as functions of the locality and availability parameters. We show that, under mild growth conditions on the availability, the block decoding failure probability vanishes asymptotically, and that majority-logic decoding can successfully correct virtually all of error and erasure patterns of weight linear in the blocklength. The results reveal a substantial gap between worst-case guarantees and typical performance under stochastic channel models.</description>

      <title>A measurement noise scaling law for cellular representation learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02726v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large genomic and imaging datasets can be used to train models that learn meaningful representations of cellular systems. Across domains, model performance improves predictably with dataset size and compute budget, providing a basis for allocating data and computation. Scientific data, however, is also limited by noise arising from factors such as molecular undersampling, sequencing errors, and image resolution. By fitting 1,670 representation learning models across three data modalities (gene expression, sequence, and image data), we show that noise defines a distinct axis along which performance improves. Noise scaling follows a logarithmic law. We derive the law from a model of noise propagation, and use it to define noise sensitivity and model capacity as benchmarking metrics. We show that protein sequence representations are noise-robust while single cell transcriptomics models are not, with a Transformer-based model showing greater noise robustness but lower saturating performance than a variational autoencoder model. Noise scaling metrics may support future model evaluation and experimental design.</description>

      <title>Burau representation, Squier's form, and non-Abelian anyons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18186v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a frequency-tunable, two-dimensional non-Abelian control of operation order constructed from the reduced Burau representation of the braid group $B_3$, specialised at $t=e^{i\omega}$ and unitarized by Squier's Hermitian form. Coupled to two non-commuting qubit unitaries $A$, $B$, the resulting switch admits a closed expression for the single-shot Helstrom success probability and a fixed-order ceiling $p_{\mathrm{fixed}}$, defining the fixed-order ceiling $p_{\mathrm{fixed}}^*$ and the witness gaps $\Delta_{\rm sw}(\omega)=p_{\mathrm{switch}}(\omega)-p_{\mathrm{fixed}}^*$ and $\Delta_{\rm test}(\omega)=p_{\mathrm{test}}(\omega)-p_{\mathrm{fixed}}^*$.
  The non-Abelian mixers can either enhance or suppress the bare switch advantage, which we quantify by the interference contrast $\Delta_{\rm int}(\omega):=\Delta_{\rm test}(\omega)-\Delta_{\rm sw}(\omega)=p_{\rm test}(\omega)-p_{\rm switch}(\omega)$. Across the Squier positivity region, $\Delta_{\rm int}(\omega)$ takes both positive (constructive) and negative (destructive) values, a hallmark of matrix-valued (non-Abelian) order control, while $\Delta_{\rm sw}(\omega)&gt;0$ certifies algebraic causal non-separability.
  Numerical simulations confirm both enhancement and suppression regimes, establishing a minimal $B_3$ braid control that reproduces the characteristic interference pattern expected from a \emph{Gedankenexperiment} in anyonic statistics.</description>

      <title>MIST: Mutual Information Estimation Via Supervised Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18945v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a fully data-driven approach to designing mutual information (MI) estimators. Since any MI estimator is a function of the observed sample from two random variables, we parameterize this function with a neural network (MIST) and train it end-to-end to predict MI values. Training is performed on a large meta-dataset of 625,000 synthetic joint distributions with known ground-truth MI. To handle variable sample sizes and dimensions, we employ a two-dimensional attention scheme ensuring permutation invariance across input samples. To quantify uncertainty, we optimize a quantile regression loss, enabling the estimator to approximate the sampling distribution of MI rather than return a single point estimate. This research program departs from prior work by taking a fully empirical route, trading universal theoretical guarantees for flexibility and efficiency. Empirically, the learned estimators largely outperform classical baselines across sample sizes and dimensions, including on joint distributions unseen during training. The resulting quantile-based intervals are well-calibrated and more reliable than bootstrap-based confidence intervals, while inference is orders of magnitude faster than existing neural baselines. Beyond immediate empirical gains, this framework yields trainable, fully differentiable estimators that can be embedded into larger learning pipelines. Moreover, exploiting MI's invariance to invertible transformations, meta-datasets can be adapted to arbitrary data modalities via normalizing flows, enabling flexible training for diverse target meta-distributions.</description>
