      <title>The Building Blocks of Consciousness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consciousness is presented not as a unified and uniquely human characteristic, but rather as an emergent property of several building blocks, most of which are demonstrably present in other species. Each block has its own rationale under natural selection and could have arisen independently, and the jumps between blocks -- which culminate in consciousness -- are small enough to be evolutionarily plausible. One underappreciated block involves unconscious engram playback and discrimination, and plays a major role in brain storage optimization. This function is present in birds and nearly all mammals and is recognized by its side-effect: dreams.</description>

      <title>A cellular automata approach for modelling pedestrian-vehicle mixed traffic flow in urban city</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In urban streets, the intrusion of pedestrians presents significant safety challenges. Modelling mixed pedestrian-vehicle traffic is complex due to the distinct motion characteristics and spatial dimensions of pedestrians and vehicles, making unified modelling difficult, with few studies addressing these issues. This paper employs a multi-grid cellular automata model to bridge the gap between vehicle and pedestrian models. An Improved Kerner-Klenov-Wolf (IKKW) model and a pedestrian motion model that incorporates Time-To-Collision (TTC) are introduced. Both models update the spatial motions of vehicles and pedestrians uniformly. Empirical analysis indicates that the model achieves high simulation accuracy. This model effectively illustrates the impact of pedestrian intrusion within mixed traffic scenario. The fundamental diagram of heterogeneous traffic reveals substantial differences, highlighting the effects of pedestrian intrusion on traffic flow states and identifying six phase regions in mixed traffic. Additionally, this paper examines conflicts between pedestrians and vehicles under varying speed limits and sidewalk widths, demonstrating that lower speeds and broader sidewalks significantly reduce the frequency of pedestrian-vehicle conflicts. Notably, the frequency of peak conflicts at a vehicle speed limit of 60.48 km/h is more than three times higher than at 30.24 km/h. This model offers a potential approach to studying mixed traffic flows and exhibits substantial scalability.</description>

      <title>Pedestrian Crossing Discrepancy Within Static and Dynamic Crowds: An Experimental Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims to investigate the disparities in pedestrian crossing behaviors within static and dynamic crowds through experimental analysis. First, the crossing trajectories of pedestrians in various crowd environments were qualitatively observed. These trajectories have shown significant discrepancies and the phenomenon of cross-channel formation within static crowds was observed, a phenomenon similar to the evolution of human trails. To quantitatively assess these discrepancies, metrics of behavior patterns and swarm factor were introduced. Different behavioral patterns, including anticipation and reaction behaviors in pedestrian motion, were observed. Finally, through orthogonal velocity analysis, the variation trends of crossing motions within static and dynamic contexts were revealed.</description>

      <title>Fitness-Based Growth of Directed Networks with Hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Growing attention has been brought to the fact that many real directed networks exhibit hierarchy and directionality as measured through techniques like Trophic Analysis and non-normality. We propose a simple growing network model where the probability of connecting to a node is defined by a preferential attachment mechanism based on degree and the difference in fitness between nodes. In particular, we show how mechanisms such as degree-based preferential attachment and node fitness interactions can lead to the emergence of the spectrum of hierarchy and directionality observed in real networks. In this work, we study various features of this model relating to network hierarchy, as measured by Trophic Analysis. This includes (I) how preferential attachment can lead to network hierarchy, (II) how scale-free degree distributions and network hierarchy can coexist, (III) the correlation between node fitness and trophic level, (IV) how the fitness parameters can predict trophic incoherence and how the trophic level difference distribution compares to the fitness difference distribution, (V) the relationship between trophic level and degree imbalance and the unique role of nodes at the ends of the fitness hierarchy and (VI) how fitness interactions and degree-based preferential attachment can interplay to generate networks of varying coherence and degree distribution. We also provide an example of the intuition this work enables in the analysis of a real historical network. This work provides insight into simple mechanisms which can give rise to hierarchy in directed networks and quantifies the usefulness and limitations of using Trophic Analysis as an analysis tool for real networks.</description>

      <title>Simple crowd dynamics to generate complex temporal contact networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Empirical contact networks or interaction networks demonstrate peculiar characteristics stemming from the fundamental social, psychological, physical mechanisms governing human interactions. Although these mechanisms are complex, we test whether we are able to reproduce some dynamical properties of these empirical networks from relatively simple models. In this study, we perform simulations for a range of 2D models of particle dynamics, namely the Random Walk, Active Brownian Particles, and Vicsek models, to generate artificial contact networks. We investigate temporal properties of these contact networks: the distributions of contact durations, inter-contact durations and number of contact per pair of particle. We demonstrate that the distribution of inter-contact durations can be recovered by the dynamics of these simple crowd particle models, and show that it is simply related to the well-know first-return process, which explains the -3/2 exponent that is found in both the numerical models and empirical contact networks.</description>

      <title>CosIn: A Statistical-Based Algorithm for Computation of Speed-Space Time Delay in Pedestrian Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03656v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The precise assessment of speed-space time delay (TD) facilitates the differentiation between pedestrian anticipation behavior and reaction behavior. Importantly, the TD scale is instrumental in the evaluation of potential collision risks inherent in the crowd, thereby offering crucial quantitative metrics for crowd risk. This article introduces the CosIn algorithm for evaluate TD during pedestrian motion, comprising the CosIn-1 and CosIn-2 algorithms. The CosIn-1 algorithm specifically addresses the precise computation issue associated with the TD of individual pedestrians, while the CosIn-2 algorithm is employed for assessing TD at a crowd scale, concurrently addressing the imperative of real-time computation. Efficacy analyses of the CosIn-1 and CosIn-2 algorithms are conducted using the data from single-file pedestrian experiments and crowd cross experiments, respectively. The results obtained demonstrate commendable precision in the algorithmic solutions. This algorithm contributes to the precise assessment of behavior patterns and collision risk within crowd dynamics.</description>

      <title>Network analysis using Krylov subspace trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01269v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe a set of network analysis methods based on the rows of the Krylov subspace matrix computed from a network adjacency matrix via power iteration using a non-random initial vector. We refer to these node-specific row vectors as Krylov subspace trajectories. While power iteration using a random initial starting vector is commonly applied to the network adjacency matrix to compute eigenvector centrality values, this application only uses the final vector generated after numerical convergence. Importantly, use of a random initial vector means that the intermediate results of power iteration are also random and lack a clear interpretation. To the best of our knowledge, use of intermediate power iteration results for network analysis has been limited to techniques that leverage just a single pre-convergence solution, e.g., Power Iteration Clustering. In this paper, we explore methods that apply power iteration with a non-random inital vector to the network adjacency matrix to generate Krylov subspace trajectories for each node. These non-random trajectories provide important information regarding network structure, node importance, and response to perturbations. We have created this short preprint in part to generate feedback from others in the network analysis community who might be aware of similar existing work.</description>

      <title>Balancing Specialization and Adaptation in a Transforming Scientific Landscape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14040v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How do scientists navigate between the need to capitalize on their prior knowledge through specialization, and the urge to adapt to evolving research opportunities? Drawing from diverse perspectives on adaptation, including cultural evolution, this paper proposes an unsupervised Bayesian approach motivated by Optimal Transport of the evolution of scientists' research portfolios in response to transformations in their field. The model relies on $186,162$ scientific abstracts and authorship data to evaluate the influence of intellectual, social, and institutional resources on scientists' trajectories within a cohort of $2\,195$ high-energy physicists between 2000 and 2019. Using Inverse Optimal Transport, the reallocation of research efforts is shown to be shaped by learning costs, thus enhancing the utility of the scientific capital disseminated among scientists. Two dimensions of social capital, namely "diversity" and "power", have opposite associations with the magnitude of change in scientists' research interests: while "diversity" disrupts and expands research interests, "power" is associated with more stable research agendas. Social capital plays a more crucial role in shifts between cognitively distant research areas. More generally, this work suggests new approaches for understanding, measuring and modeling collective adaptation using Optimal Transport.</description>
