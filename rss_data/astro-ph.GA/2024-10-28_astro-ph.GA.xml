      <title>Boosting the evolutionary picture of Cl 0024+17 and MS 0451-03: A case study at intermediate-redshift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we improve the dynamic-evolutionary framework of two massive clusters at intermediate redshifts: Cl 0024+17 at $z \sim 0.4$ and MS 0451-03 at $z \sim 0.5$. The spectroscopic galaxy members were selected from Moran et al. (2007a), which combine optical and UV imaging with spectroscopy. Using a set of dynamic estimators with different approaches, our results show that both Cl 0024+17 and MS 0451-03 are non-relaxed systems with distinct dynamical configurations. Cl 0024+17 exhibits a disturbed kinematics, displaying significant gaps and a velocity dispersion profile suggesting a merger. This is confirmed by the presence of previously reported substructures and new ones identified in this study. MS 0451-03 appears less disturbed than Cl 0024+17, indicating by the significant segregation between late and early-type galaxies, with the latter occupying more central regions of the projected phase-space. However, five previously unobserved substructures and non-Gaussianity in the velocity distribution indicate that MS 0451-03 is also out of equilibrium. In both clusters, there are substructures infalling onto the systems, indicating key moments in their assembly histories and potential effects on the pre-processing of galaxies within these subgroups. This is suggested by the high percentage of early-type galaxies outside $R_{200}$ (approximately $83\%$) in the case of CL 0024+17. This work reinforces the importance of more detailed dynamical analysis of clusters to better characterize their evolutionary picture.</description>

      <title>Blue Monsters at $z&gt;10$. Where has all their dust gone?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The properties of luminous, blue (a.k.a. Blue Monsters), super-early galaxies at redshift $z&gt;10$ have been successfully explained by the attenuation-free model (AFM) in which dust is pushed to kpc-scales by radiation-driven outflows. As an alternative to AFM, here we assess whether *attenuation-free* conditions can be replaced by a *dust-free* scenario in which dust is produced in very limited amounts and/or later destroyed in the interstellar medium. To this aim we compare the predicted values of the dust-to-stellar mass ratio, $\xi_d$, with those measured in 15 galaxies at $z&gt;10$ from JWST spectra, when outflows are not included. Our model constrains $\xi_d$ as a function of several parameters by allowing wide variations in the IMF, dust/metal production, and dust destruction for a set of SN progenitor models and explosion energies. We find $\log \xi_d \approx -2.2$ for all systems, indicative of the dominant role of SN dust production over destruction in these early galaxies. Such value is strikingly different from the data, which instead indicate $\log \xi_d &lt; -4$. We conclude that dust destruction alone can hardly explain the transparency of Blue Monsters. Other mechanisms, such as outflows, might be required.</description>

      <title>The impact of cosmic ray heating on the cooling of the low-metallicity interstellar medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-metallicity environments are subject to inefficient cooling. They also have low dust-to-gas ratios and therefore less efficient photoelectric (PE) heating than in solar-neighbourhood conditions, where PE heating is one of the most important heating processes in the warm neutral interstellar medium (ISM). We perform magneto-hydrodynamic simulations of stratified ISM patches with a gas metallicity of 0.02 Z$_\odot$ as part of the SILCC project. The simulations include non-equilibrium chemistry, heating, and cooling of the low-temperature ISM as well as anisotropic cosmic ray (CR) transport, and stellar tracks. We include stellar feedback in the form of far-UV and ionising (FUV and EUV) radiation, massive star winds, supernovae, and CR injection. From the local CR energy density, we compute a CR heating rate that is variable in space and time. In this way, we can compare the relative impact of PE and CR heating on the metal-poor ISM and find that CR heating can dominate over PE heating. Models with a uniform CR ionisation rate suppress or severely delay star formation, since they provide a larger amount of energy to the ISM due to CR heating. Models with a variable CR ionisation rate form stars predominantly in pristine regions with low PE heating and CR ionisation rates where the metal-poor gas is able to cool efficiently. Because of the low metallicity, the amount of formed stars in all runs is not enough to trigger outflows of gas from the mid-plane.</description>

      <title>Chemical enrichment by collapsars as the origin of the unusually high [Ba/Fe] in a massive star cluster of the dwarf galaxy NGC 1569</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The super star cluster NGC1569-B has recently been observed to have an extremely high [Ba/Fe]. We consider that the observed high [Ba/Fe] ($\sim$ 1.3) is due to the chemical enrichment of giant molecular clouds by either collapsars, neutron star mergers, or magneto-rotational supernovae, and thereby investigate which of the three polluters can best reproduce the observed [Ba/Fe]. Since it is found that collapsars can best reproduce such an extremely high Ba abundance, we numerically investigate the star cluster formation in NGC1569 using chemodynamical simulations of merging dwarf galaxies with chemical enrichment by collapsars. The principal results are as follows. First, a cluster of the same scale as NGC1569-B was found to match both the observed [Ba/Fe] and [Fe/H] values, the best cluster having [Ba/Fe]= 1.3 $\pm$ 0.2 and [Fe/H] = $-$0.7 $\pm$ 0.2. This simulation used a core-collapse supernova per collapsar rate of 70, a standard initial mass function and an initial metallicity of [Fe/H]=-1.5. Second, a prediction of the Eu abundance of NGC1569-B is made: [Eu/Fe]= 1.9 $\pm$ 0.2. These results are shown to be invariant under a change in the orbit parameters used for the merger. The need for a merger to promote the star formation that leads to the synthesis of the Ba and the star cluster formation is confirmed. Collapsars can not only better explain [Ba/Fe] but also be consistent with the observed star formation rate and stellar mass of the dwarf galaxy.</description>

      <title>Stellar stripping efficiencies of satellites in numerical simulations: the effect of resolution, satellite properties and numerical disruption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stellar stripping of satellites in cluster haloes is understood to play an important role in the production of intracluster light. Increasingly, cosmological simulations have been utilised to investigate its origin and assembly. However, such simulations typically model individual galaxies at relatively coarse resolutions, raising concerns about their accuracy. Although there is a growing literature on the importance of numerical resolution for the accurate recovery of the mass loss rates of dark matter (DM) haloes, there has been no comparable investigation into the numerical resolution required to accurately recover stellar mass loss rates in galaxy clusters.
  Using N-body simulations of satellite galaxies orbiting in a cluster halo represented by a static external potential, we conduct a set of convergence tests in order to explore the role of numerical resolution and force softening length on stellar stripping efficiency. We consider a number of orbital configurations, satellite masses and satellite morphologies. We find that stellar mass resolution is of minor importance relative to DM resolution. Resolving the central regions of satellite DM halos is critical to accurately recover stellar mass loss rates. Poorly resolved DM haloes develop cored inner profiles and, if this core is of comparable size to the stellar component of the satellite galaxy, this leads to significant over-stripping. To prevent this, relatively high DM mass resolutions of around $m_{\rm DM}\sim10^{6}$ M$_{\odot}$, better than those achieved by many contemporary cosmological simulations, are necessary.</description>

      <title>Testing the Bullet Dwarf Collision Scenario in the NGC 1052 Group Through Morphologies and Stellar Populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: NGC 1052-DF2 and -DF4 are two ultra-diffuse galaxies that have been reported as deficient in dark matter and associated with the same galaxy group. Recent findings suggest that DF2 and DF4 are part of a large linear substructure of dwarf galaxies that could have been formed from a high-velocity head-on encounter of two gas-rich galaxies, known as a bullet dwarf collision. Based on new observations from the Hubble Space Telescope, combined with existing imaging from the u band to mid-infrared, we test the bullet dwarf scenario by studying the morphologies and stellar populations of the trail dwarfs. We find no significant morphological differences between the trail dwarfs and other dwarfs in the group, while for both populations, their photometric major axes unexpectedly align parallel with the trail. We find that the trail dwarfs have significantly older ages and higher metallicities than the comparison sample, supporting the distinctiveness of the trail. These observations provide key constraints for any formation model, and we argue that they are currently best explained by the bullet dwarf collision scenario, with additional strong tests anticipated with future observations.</description>

      <title>NeutralUniverseMachine: Predictions of HI gas in Different Theoretical Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the distribution and evolution of HI gas in different theoretical models, including hydro-dynamical simulations (Illustris-TNG and SIMBA), semi-analytic models (GAEA), and the empirical models ( NeutralUniverseMachine; NUM). By comparing model predictions for the HI mass function (HIMF), HI-halo and HI-stellar mass relations, conditional HI mass function (CHIMF) and the halo occupation distribution (HOD) of HI-selected galaxies, we find that all models show reasonable agreement with the observed HIMF at $z\sim0$, but the differences become much larger at higher redshifts of $z=1$ and $z=2$. The HIMF of NUM shows remarkable agreement with the observation at $z=1$, whereas other models predict much lower amplitudes of HIMF at the high-mass end. Comparisons of CHIMF distributions indicate that the HIMF is dominated by halos of $10&lt; \log(M_{\rm vir}/M_\odot) &lt;11$ and $11&lt; \log(M_{\rm vir}/M_\odot)&lt;12$ at the low- and high-mass ends, respectively. From the HI HODs of central galaxies, we find that TNG100 overpredicts the number of central galaxies with high $M_{\rm HI}$ in massive halos and GAEA shows a very strong depletion of HI gas in quenched centrals of massive halos. The main cause of the differences is the AGN feedback mechanisms implemented in different models.</description>

      <title>Assessing the Association between the Globular Cluster NGC 4147 and the Sagittarius Dwarf Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The potential association of the globular cluster (GC) NGC 4147 with the Sagittarius (Sgr) dwarf spheroidal galaxy has been proposed due to their comparable locations and radial velocities. However, there are still debates about this connection. In this study, we use data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Legacy Imaging Surveys to assess their association. We redetermine thefundamental parameters of NGC 4147 and find that the cluster is 11.0 Gyr old, has a metallicity of Z=0.0006, and is located 18.5 kpc from the Sun. We utilize the matched filter algorithm to identify extratidal structures in the surrounding sky of NGC 4147. The multiarmed tidal structures we find align more closely with the result of internal two-body relaxation processes within the cluster itself. The orientations of the dispersed tidal structures, the orbital direction of the cluster, and the mean orbital direction of Sgr do not show any apparent connection to each other. It seems to challenge the hypothesis of a common origin between the cluster and Sgr. To further investigate the association, we study the kinematics of NGC 4147 with the newly determined fundamental parameters. We find that the orbit, orbital energy, and angular momentum of NGC 4147 are not compatible with those of Sgr or its streams. This suggests that the cluster is not dynamically associated with Sgr. The morphology and dynamics of NGC 4147 are more consistent with it being a GC that formed with other origin rather than being accreted from the Sgr dwarf galaxy.</description>

      <title>Signal-to-noise Ratio Analytic Formulae of the Inspiral Massive Black Hole Binaries in TianQin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive black hole binaries are one of the important sources for the TianQin project. Our research has revealed that, for TianQin, the signal-to-noise ratio squared during the inspiral phase of massive black hole binaries exhibits a direct proportionality to the ratio of the observation duration to the time remaining until coalescence. This finding is expected to greatly simplify the estimation of detection capabilities for massive black hole binaries. In this paper, we demonstrated this relationship under both all-sky average and non-average conditions. The latter introduces only an additional term, which we refer to as the response factor. Although this term is not easily calculated analytically, we provide a simple estimation method with an error margin of within 2%.</description>

      <title>Photometric Redshift Estimation for CSST Survey with LSTM Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate estimation of photometric redshifts (photo-$z$s) is crucial for cosmological surveys. Various methods have been developed for this purpose, such as template fitting methods and machine learning techniques, each with its own applications, advantages, and limitations. In this study, we propose a new approach that utilizes a deep learning model based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to predict photo-$z$. Unlike many existing machine learning models, our method requires only flux measurements from different observed filters as input. The model can automatically learn the complex relationships between the flux data across different wavelengths, eliminating the need for manually extracted or derived input features, thereby providing precise photo-$z$ estimates. The effectiveness of our proposed model is evaluated using simulated data from the Chinese Space Station Telescope (CSST) sourced from the Hubble Space Telescope Advanced Camera for Surveys (HST-ACS) and the COSMOS catalog, considering anticipated instrument effects of the future CSST. Results from experiments demonstrate that our LSTM model, compared to commonly used template fitting and machine learning approaches, requires minimal input parameters and achieves high precision in photo-$z$ estimation. For instance, when trained on the same dataset and provided only with photometric fluxes as input features, the proposed LSTM model yields one-third of the outliers $f_{out}$ observed with a Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Network (MLP) model, while the normalized median absolute deviation $\rm \sigma_{NMAD}$ is only two-thirds that of the MLP model. This study presents a novel approach to accurately estimate photo-$z$s of galaxies using photometric data from large-scale survey projects.</description>

      <title>The LAMOST Spectroscopic Survey of Supergiants in M31 and M33</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present systematic identifications of supergiants of M31/M33 based on massive LAMOST spectroscopic survey. Radial velocities of nearly 5000 photometrically selected M31/M33 supergiant candidates have been properly derived from the qualified spectra released in LAMOST DR10. By comparing their radial velocities with those predicted from the rotation curves of M31, as well as utilizing {\it Gaia} astrometric measurements to exclude foreground contaminations, 199 supergiant members in M31, including 168 `Rank1' and 31 `Rank2', have been successfully identified. This sample contains 62 blue supergiants (BSGs, all `Rank1'), 134 yellow supergiants (YSGs, 103 `Rank1' and 31 `Rank2') and 3 red supergiants (RSGs, all `Rank1'). For M33, we identify 84 supergiant members (56 `Rank1' and 28 `Rank2'), which includes 28 BSGs (all `Rank1'), 53 YSGs (25 `Rank1' and 28 `Rank2') and 3 RSGs (all `Rank1'). So far, this is one of the largest supergiant sample of M31/M33 with full optical wavelength coverage (3700 \textless $\lambda$ \textless 9100 \AA). This sample is valuable for understanding the star formation and stellar evolution under different environments.</description>

      <title>The unabridged satellite luminosity function of Milky Way-like galaxies in $\Lambda$CDM: the contribution of "orphan" satellites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the abundance, radial distribution, and orbits of luminous satellites in simulations of Milky Way-mass dark halos in the $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. We follow the evolution of a halo from the Aquarius project and the formation of satellites with the GALFORM semi-analytic model of galaxy formation, in which gas cools radiatively into halos before reionization and in halos that exceed a redshift-dependent ``critical'' virial mass after that. Subhalos are prone to disruption in the tidal field of the main halo, with the number of surviving self-bound subhalos increasing with resolution. Even in the highest resolution simulation (Aq-L1, with particle mass $m_{\rm p}\sim10^3\, M_\odot$), a substantial number of subhalos are disrupted but their galaxies may survive as ``orphans''. Whether or not a satellite becomes an orphan depends primarily on its time of infall. When orphans are included, the simulations yield a converged satellite stellar mass function across different resolution levels. The total number of luminous satellites is sensitive to the assumed redshift of reionization, but the shape of the satellite stellar mass function is robust, peaking at the stellar mass ($\sim 10^3\, M_\odot$) of a halo just above the critical threshold. Most orphans are found in the central regions of the main halo and make up roughly half of all satellites in Aq-L1. When orphans are taken into account there is no need to populate subhalos below the critical mass with satellites to fit the radial distribution of Milky Way satellites, as had been argued in recent work. Our model predicts that orphans dominate the ultra-faint population and that many more satellites with small apocentric radii should be detected in upcoming deep wide-field surveys.</description>

      <title>Amoeba: An AGN Model of Optical Emissions Beyond steady-state Accretion discs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are objects located in the heart of galaxies which emit powerful and complex radiation across the electromagnetic spectrum. Understanding AGN has become a topic of interest due to their importance in galactic evolution and their ability to act as a probe to the distant Universe. Within the next few years, wide-field surveys such as the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) at the Rubin Vera Observatory are expected to increase the number of known AGN to $\mathcal{O} (10^{7})$ and the number of strongly lensed AGN to $\mathcal{O} (10^{4})$. In this paper we introduce \texttt{Amoeba}: an AGN Model of Optical Emission Beyond steady-state Accretion discs. The goal of \texttt{Amoeba} is to provide a modular and flexible modelling environment for AGN, in which all components can interact with each other. Through this work we describe the framework for major AGN components to vary self-consistently and keep flux distributions to connect these components to spatial dependent processes. We model properties beyond traditional single-component models, such as the reverberation of the corona's bending power law power spectrum through the accretion disc and broad line region (BLR). We simulate obscuration by the dusty torus and differential magnification of the disc and BLR due to microlensing. These features are joined together to create some of the most realistic light curve simulations to date. \texttt{Amoeba} takes a step forward in AGN modelling by joining the accretion disc, BLR, torus, intrinsic signal, and microlensing into a coherent model.</description>

      <title>Estimating the Masses of Supercluster-Scale Filaments from Redshift Dispersions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a strategy for estimating the mass per unit length along supercluster-scale filaments that are oriented across the sky, based on mock redshift surveys of 264 filaments from the Millennium simulation. In our fiducial scenario, we place each simulated filament at a distance of 300 Mpc, perpendicular to the line of sight, and calculate the redshift dispersion using galaxies with magnitudes r&lt;19.5. Some regions are dynamically complicated in ways that interfere with finding a simple relationship between dispersion sigma and linear mass density mu. However, by examining individual overlapping segments along the filaments, we find a relationship that allows us to successfully predict log(mu) from log(sigma) with a scatter of about +/- 0.20 dex, for ~ 70% of the regions along filaments. This relationship is robust to changes in the distance to the filament if the physical segment length and the absolute magnitude for galaxy selection are held constant. The relationship between redshift dispersion and mass is similar to that obtained for a simple analytical model where filaments are dynamically relaxed, and we examine the possibility that the galaxies are indeed relaxed within the gravitational potential of the filament. We find that this is not the case; galaxy dynamics are strongly effected by infall to the filament and by orbits within groups and clusters</description>

      <title>The influence of spin in black hole triplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.04985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.04985v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spin can influence the dynamics of the already chaotic black hole triplet system. We follow this problem in two sets of simulations: first, the Agekian-Anosova region (or region D), and second, using Pythagorean triangles. We use ARCcode, an N-body code that performs numerical integration of orbits. This code includes post-Newtonian corrections, which we include up to the 2.5th order. In set one of our simulations, we fix the masses of the black holes at 10$^{6}$ M$_{\odot}$. Then we run the simulations first without any spin added and after by initialising spin on one of the black holes. We find that after including spin into the system, 12.9% of the simulations changed outcomes. Either the systems went from having all black holes merging to having a black hole escaping the system, or vice versa. In the second set of simulations, we expanded into Pythagorean triangles as initial positions of black holes, stemming from Burrau's three-body problem. We varied the masses of the black holes from 10$^{0}$ M$_{\odot}$ to 10$^{12}$ M$_{\odot}$. Black holes in these systems were given spin in normalised units ranging from 0 to 0.95. We find that intermediate mass black holes in the range of 10$^{4}$ M$_{\odot}$-10$^{5}$ M$_{\odot}$, were influenced the most by spin, particularly in their lifetimes. We also find that simulations, initialised as 2D, become 3D.</description>

      <title>On the origin of star formation quenching in massive galaxies at $z \gtrsim 3$ in the cosmological simulations IllustrisTNG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03083v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the cosmological simulations IllustrisTNG, we perform a comprehensive analysis of quiescent, massive galaxies at $z \gtrsim 3$. The goal is to understand what suppresses their star formation so early in cosmic time, and how other similar mass galaxies remain highly star-forming. As a first-order result, the simulations are able to produce massive, quiescent galaxies in this high-redshift regime. We find that active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback is the primary cause of halting star formation in early, massive galaxies. Not only do the central, supermassive black holes (SMBHs) of the quenched galaxies have earlier seed times, but they also grow faster than in star-forming galaxies. As a result, the quenched galaxies are exposed to AGN feedback for longer, and experience the kinetic, jet-mode of the AGN feedback earlier than the star-forming galaxies. The release of kinetic energy reduces inflows of gas while likely maintaining outflows, which keeps a low cold gas fraction and decreases the star formation of the galaxies down to a state of quiescence. In addition to AGN feedback, we also investigate the influence of the large-scale environment. While mergers do not play a significant role in the quenching process, the quenched galaxies tend to reside in more massive halos and denser regions during their evolution. As this provides a greater initial amount of infalling gas to the galaxies, the large-scale environment can mildly affect the fate of the central SMBH growth and, via AGN feedback, contribute to star formation quenching.</description>

      <title>Sub-Alfvenic Turbulence: Magnetic to Kinetic Energy Ratio, Modification of Weak Cascade and Implications for Magnetic Field Strength Measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05399v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the properties of sub-Alfvenic magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence, i.e., turbulence with Alfven Mach number $M_A=V_L/V_A&lt;1$, where $V_L$ is the velocity at the injection scale and $V_A$ is the Alfven velocity. We demonstrate that weak turbulence can have different regimes depending on whether it is driven by velocity or magnetic fluctuations. If the turbulence is driven by isotropic bulk forces, i.e. velocity-driven, in an incompressible conducting fluid, we predict that the kinetic energy is $M_A^{-2}$ times larger than the energy of magnetic fluctuations. This effect arises from the long parallel wavelength tail of the forcing, which excites modes with $k_\|/k_\perp &lt; M_A$. We also predict that as the turbulent cascade reaches the strong regime the energy of slow modes exceeds the energy of Alfven modes by a factor $M_A^{-1}$. These effects are absent if the turbulence is magnetically driven at the injection scale. We confirm these predictions with numerical simulations. As the assumption of magnetic and kinetic energy equipartition is at the core of the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi (DCF) approach to measuring magnetic field strength in sub-Alfvenic turbulence, we conclude that the DCF technique is not universally applicable. In particular, we suggest that the dynamical excitation of long azimuthal wavelength modes in the galactic disk may compromise the use of the DCF technique. We discuss alternative expressions that can be used to obtain magnetic field strength from observations.</description>

      <title>The Star-Forming Main Sequence in JADES and CEERS at $z&gt;1.4$: Investigating the Burstiness of Star Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05178v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have used public JWST/NIRSpec and JWST/NIRCam observations from the CEERS and JADES surveys in order to analyze the star-forming main sequence (SFMS) over the redshift range $1.4 \leq z &lt; 7$. We calculate the star-formation rates (SFRs) of the galaxy sample using three approaches: Balmer line luminosity, spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting, and UV luminosity. We find a larger degree of scatter about the SFMS using the Balmer-based SFRs compared to the UV-based SFRs. Because these SFR indicators are sensitive to star formation on different time scales, the difference in scatter may be evidence of bursty star-formation histories in the early universe. We additionally compare the H$\alpha$-to-UV luminosity ratio (L(H$\alpha$)/$\nu$L$_{\nu,1600}$) for individual galaxies in the sample and find that 29\%$-$52\% of the ratios across the sample are poorly described by predictions from a smooth star-formation history. Measuring the burstiness of star formation in the early universe has multiple significant implications, such as deriving accurate physical parameters from SED fitting, explaining the evolution of the UV luminosity function, and providing constraints for sub-grid models of feedback in simulations of galaxy formation and evolution.</description>

      <title>Using dust to constrain dark matter models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14780v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we use hydrodynamic zoom-in simulations of Milky Way-type haloes to explore using dust as an observational tracer to discriminate between cold and warm dark matter (WDM) universes. Comparing a cold and 3.5 keV WDM particle model, we tune the efficiency of galaxy formation in our simulations using a variable supernova rate to create Milky Way systems with similar satellite galaxy populations while keeping all other simulation parameters the same. Cold dark matter (CDM), having more substructure, requires a higher supernova efficiency than WDM to achieve the same satellite galaxy number. These different supernova efficiencies create different dust distributions around their host galaxies, which we generate by post-processing the simulation output with the \powderday{} codebase. Analysing the resulting dust in each simulation, we find $\sim$4.5 times more dust in our CDM Milky Way haloes compared with WDM. The distribution of dust out to $R_{200\text{c}}$ is then explored, revealing that the WDM simulations are noticeably less concentrated than their CDM counterparts, although differences in substructure complicate the comparison. Our results indicate that dust is a possible unique probe to test theories of dark matter.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate that non-gravitational interactions between dark matter and baryonic matter can affect structural properties of galaxies. Detailed galaxy simulations and analytic estimates demonstrate that dark matter which collects inside white dwarf stars and ignites Type Ia supernovae can substantially alter star formation, stellar feedback, and the halo density profile through a dark matter-induced baryonic feedback process, distinct from usual supernova feedback in galaxies.</description>

      <title>On joint analysing XMM-NuSTAR spectra of active galactic nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15499v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A recently released XMM-Newton technical note has revealed a significant calibration issue between NuSTAR and XMM-Newton EPIC, and provided an empirical correction to EPIC effective area. To quantify the bias caused by the calibration issue to joint analysis of XMM-NuSTAR spectra and verify the effectiveness of the correction, in this work we perform joint-fitting of NuSTAR and EPIC-pn spectra for a large sample of 104 observation pairs of 44 X-ray bright AGN. The spectra were extracted after requiring perfect simultaneity between XMM-Newton and NuSTAR exposures (merging GTIs from two missions) to avoid bias due to rapid spectral variability of AGN. Before the correction, the EPIC-pn spectra are systematically harder than corresponding NuSTAR spectra by $\Delta \Gamma \sim 0.1$, subsequently yielding significantly underestimated cutoff energy $E_{\rm cut} $ and the strength of reflection component R when performing joint-fitting. We confirm the correction is highly effective and can commendably erase the discrepancy in best-fit $\Gamma$, $E_{\rm cut} $ and R, and thus we urge the community to apply the correction when joint-fitting XMM-NuSTAR spectra. Besides, we show that as merging GTIs from two missions would cause severe loss of NuSTAR net exposure time, in many cases joint-fitting yields no advantage compared with utilizing NuSTAR data alone. We finally present a technical note on filtering periods of high background flares for XMM-Newton EPIC-pn exposures in the Small Window mode.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Reflection Modeling in AGN and Related Variability from PCA: A Brief Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01852v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: X-ray observations of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) reveal relativistic reflections from the innermost regions of accretion disks, which contain general-relativistic footprints caused by spinning supermassive black holes (SMBH). We anticipate the spin of a SMBH to be stable over the human timeframe, so brightness changes in the high-energy corona above the SMBH should slightly alter relativistic reflection. In this brief review, we discuss the latest developments in modeling relativistic reflection, as well as the rapid small variation in relativistic emission disclosed by the principal component analysis (PCA) of X-ray variability in AGN. PCA studies of X-ray spectra from AGNs have shown that relativistically blurred reflection has negligible fluctuations over the course of observations, which could originate from rapid (intrahour) intrinsic variations in near-horizon accretion flows and photon rings. The PCA technique is an effective way to disclose relativistic reflection from X-ray observations of AGNs, simplifying the complexity of largely variable X-ray data for automated spectral analysis with machine learning algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10314v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Blue straggler stars are unique main-sequence stars that appear more luminous, hotter, and therefore younger, than their coeval counterparts. In star clusters, these stars are located above the cluster turn-off in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram or color-magnitude diagram. First identified in the 1950s, these stars are found across diverse environments, from sparse galactic fields to dense star clusters. They are crucial for understanding stellar and binary evolution and star cluster dynamics. Despite extensive research, many challenges concerning their properties and origin mechanisms remain unresolved. This chapter delves into the properties and origins of blue stragglers, examining how theoretical tools are employed to study them and the implications of each proposed formation mechanism. We assess how contemporary observational data either support or challenge these theoretical predictions. Continued theoretical and observational efforts are essential for advancing our understanding of these enigmatic stars.</description>
