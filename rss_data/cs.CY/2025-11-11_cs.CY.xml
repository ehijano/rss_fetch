      <title>Emergency Response Measures for Catastrophic AI Risk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chinese authorities are extending the country's four-phase emergency response framework (prevent, warn, respond, and recover) to address risks from advanced artificial intelligence (AI). Concrete mechanisms for the proactive prevention and warning phases, however, remain under development. This paper analyzes an implementation model inspired by international AI safety practices: frontier safety policies (FSPs). These policies feature pre-deployment evaluations for dangerous capabilities and tiered, pre-planned safety measures. We observe close alignment between FSPs and the proactive phases of China's emergency response framework, suggesting that the FSP model could help operationalize AI emergency preparedness in a manner consistent with China's established governance principles.</description>

      <title>Using LLMs to support assessment of student work in higher education: a viva voce simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the emergent challenges of student work submitted for assessment is the widespread use of large language models (LLMs) to support and even produce written work. This particularly affects subjects where long-form written work is a key part of assessment. We propose a novel approach to addressing this challenge, using LLMs themselves to support the assessment process. We have developed a proof-of-concept viva voce examination simulator, which accepts the student's written submission as input, generates an interactive series of questions from the LLM and answers from the student. The viva voce simulator is an interactive tool which asks questions which a human examiner might plausibly ask, and uses the student's answers to form a judgment about whether the submitted piece of work is likely to be the student's own work. The interaction transcript is provided to the human examiner to support their final judgment. We suggest theoretical and practical points which are critical to real-world deployment of such a tool.</description>

      <title>Revenge Porn: A Peep into its Awareness among the Youth of Tamilnadu, India</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The act of posting a person's private photos or videos without their consent is known as revenge porn, and it is usually done to extort money or seek revenge. According to a 2010 cybercrime survey, about 18.3% of women were unaware that they were victims of revenge porn. In densely populated countries like India, such incidents are more likely, yet there is no specific law addressing revenge porn. This study used purposive sampling with a sample size of 200 unmarried women from Tamil Nadu aged 18 to 30. The survey results show that more than 50% had never heard the term "revenge porn," and only about 5% had personally experienced it. About 40% believed the victim was at fault, while 43.5% were unsure whether pornographic websites should be banned. Around 11% admitted that they might upload explicit content as revenge, and 8.5% felt that due to cultural taboos around sex, society tends to blame the victim. Police officers should be trained in techniques for psychologically supporting victims. India, which ranks third globally in cybercrime, must adopt better preventive measures. Public awareness and targeted legal reforms could play a major role in reducing such crimes.</description>

      <title>Deception Decoder: Proposing a Human-Focused Framework for Identifying AI-Generated Content on Social Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) poses a substantial threat to the integrity of information within the contemporary public sphere, which increasingly relies on social media platforms as intermediaries for news consumption. At present, most research efforts are directed toward automated and machine learning-based detection methods, despite growing concerns regarding false positives, social and political biases, and susceptibility to circumvention. This dissertation instead adopts a human-centred approach. It proposes the Deception Decoder; a multimodal, systematic, and topological framework designed to support general users in identifying AI-generated misinformation and disinformation across text, image, and video. The framework was developed through a comparative synthesis of existing models, supplemented by a content analysis of GenAI-video, and refined through a small-scale focus group session. While initial testing indicates promising improvements, further research is required to confirm its generalisability across user groups, and sustained effectiveness over time.</description>

      <title>AgriTrust: a Federated Semantic Governance Framework for Trusted Agricultural Data Sharing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The potential of agricultural data (AgData) to drive efficiency and sustainability is stifled by the "AgData Paradox": a pervasive lack of trust and interoperability that locks data in silos, despite its recognized value. This paper introduces AgriTrust, a federated semantic governance framework designed to resolve this paradox. AgriTrust integrates a multi-stakeholder governance model, built on pillars of Data Sovereignty, Transparent Data Contracts, Equitable Value Sharing, and Regulatory Compliance, with a semantic digital layer. This layer is realized through the AgriTrust Core Ontology, a formal OWL ontology that provides a shared vocabulary for tokenization, traceability, and certification, enabling true semantic interoperability across independent platforms. A key innovation is a blockchain-agnostic, multi-provider architecture that prevents vendor lock-in. The framework's viability is demonstrated through case studies across three critical Brazilian supply chains: coffee (for EUDR compliance), soy (for mass balance), and beef (for animal tracking). The results show that AgriTrust successfully enables verifiable provenance, automates compliance, and creates new revenue streams for data producers, thereby transforming data sharing from a trust-based dilemma into a governed, automated operation. This work provides a foundational blueprint for a more transparent, efficient, and equitable agricultural data economy.</description>

      <title>Who Evaluates AI's Social Impacts? Mapping Coverage and Gaps in First and Third Party Evaluations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundation models are increasingly central to high-stakes AI systems, and governance frameworks now depend on evaluations to assess their risks and capabilities. Although general capability evaluations are widespread, social impact assessments covering bias, fairness, privacy, environmental costs, and labor practices remain uneven across the AI ecosystem. To characterize this landscape, we conduct the first comprehensive analysis of both first-party and third-party social impact evaluation reporting across a wide range of model developers. Our study examines 186 first-party release reports and 183 post-release evaluation sources, and complements this quantitative analysis with interviews of model developers. We find a clear division of evaluation labor: first-party reporting is sparse, often superficial, and has declined over time in key areas such as environmental impact and bias, while third-party evaluators including academic researchers, nonprofits, and independent organizations provide broader and more rigorous coverage of bias, harmful content, and performance disparities. However, this complementarity has limits. Only model developers can authoritatively report on data provenance, content moderation labor, financial costs, and training infrastructure, yet interviews reveal that these disclosures are often deprioritized unless tied to product adoption or regulatory compliance. Our findings indicate that current evaluation practices leave major gaps in assessing AI's societal impacts, highlighting the urgent need for policies that promote developer transparency, strengthen independent evaluation ecosystems, and create shared infrastructure to aggregate and compare third-party evaluations in a consistent and accessible way.</description>

      <title>Report from Workshop on Dialogue alongside Artificial Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05625v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Educational dialogue -the collaborative exchange of ideas through talk- is widely recognized as a catalyst for deeper learning and critical thinking in and across contexts. At the same time, artificial intelligence (AI) has rapidly emerged as a powerful force in education, with the potential to address major challenges, personalize learning, and innovate teaching practices. However, these advances come with significant risks: rapid AI development can undermine human agency, exacerbate inequities, and outpace our capacity to guide its use with sound policy. Human learning presupposes cognitive efforts and social interaction (dialogues). In response to this evolving landscape, an international workshop titled "Educational Dialogue: Moving Thinking Forward" convened 19 leading researchers from 11 countries in Cambridge (September 1-3, 2025) to examine the intersection of AI and educational dialogue. This AI-focused strand of the workshop centered on three critical questions: (1) When is AI truly useful in education, and when might it merely replace human effort at the expense of learning? (2) Under what conditions can AI use lead to better dialogic teaching and learning? (3) Does the AI-human partnership risk outpacing and displacing human educational work, and what are the implications? These questions framed two days of presentations and structured dialogue among participants.</description>

      <title>Assessing the Reliability of Large Language Models in the Bengali Legal Context: A Comparative Evaluation Using LLM-as-Judge and Legal Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accessing legal help in Bangladesh is hard. People face high fees, complex legal language, a shortage of lawyers, and millions of unresolved court cases. Generative AI models like OpenAI GPT-4.1 Mini, Gemini 2.0 Flash, Meta Llama 3 70B, and DeepSeek R1 could potentially democratize legal assistance by providing quick and affordable legal advice. In this study, we collected 250 authentic legal questions from the Facebook group "Know Your Rights," where verified legal experts regularly provide authoritative answers. These questions were subsequently submitted to four four advanced AI models and responses were generated using a consistent, standardized prompt. A comprehensive dual evaluation framework was employed, in which a state-of-the-art LLM model served as a judge, assessing each AI-generated response across four critical dimensions: factual accuracy, legal appropriateness, completeness, and clarity. Following this, the same set of questions was evaluated by three licensed Bangladeshi legal professionals according to the same criteria. In addition, automated evaluation metrics, including BLEU scores, were applied to assess response similarity. Our findings reveal a complex landscape where AI models frequently generate high-quality, well-structured legal responses but also produce dangerous misinformation, including fabricated case citations, incorrect legal procedures, and potentially harmful advice. These results underscore the critical need for rigorous expert validation and comprehensive safeguards before AI systems can be safely deployed for legal consultation in Bangladesh.</description>

      <title>Who shapes Web standards? Uncovering the main topics of interest in the W3C</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper identifies the primary topics of interest of organizations participating in the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), the leading standards body for the Web. Using publicly available data from the W3C website, we analyze the participation of member organizations in W3C groups, treating the number of representatives allocated to each group as a proxy for their interests. By applying topic modeling and similarity analysis to these participation patterns, we uncover clusters of related groups and shared priorities among organizations. The results reveal five prominent areas of focus -- Web, Ads &amp; Privacy; High Performance; Credentials &amp; Web of Things; Accessibility; and Payments -- and show that large enterprises, particularly those based in the United States, dominate participation in core Web development and advertising-related topics, while Japanese organizations are more active in the Web of Things. These findings offer insights into how various stakeholders influence the standardization process and how the Web may evolve in the coming years.</description>

Abstract: Advances in AI threaten to invalidate assumptions underpinning today's defense architecture. We argue that the current U.S. defense program of record, designed in an era before capable machine intelligence, cannot by itself preserve national security against rapidly emerging AI enabled threats. Instead, shoring up legacy systems must be coupled with entirely new elements of a defense architecture. We outline immediate steps to adapt the Department of Energy National Nuclear Security Administration National Laboratories to ensure agility and resilience in an era of powerful AI.</description>

      <title>Assessing Problem Decomposition in CS1 for the GenAI Era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Problem decomposition--the ability to break down a large task into smaller, well-defined components--is a critical skill for effectively designing and creating large programs, but it is often not included in introductory computer science curricula. With the rise of generative AI (GenAI), students even at the introductory level are able to generate large quantities of code, and it is becoming increasingly important to equip them with the ability to decompose problems. There is not yet a consensus among educators on how to best teach and assess the skill of decomposition, particularly in introductory computing. This practitioner paper details the development of questions to assess the skill of problem decomposition, and impressions about how these questions were received by students. A challenge unique to problem decomposition questions is their necessarily lengthy context, and we detail our approach to addressing this problem using Question Suites: scaffolded sequences of questions that help students understand a question's context before attempting to decompose it. We then describe the use of open-ended drawing of decomposition diagrams as another form of assessment. We outline the learning objectives used to design our questions and describe how we addressed challenges encountered in early iterations. We present our decomposition assessment materials and reflections on them for educators who wish to teach problem decomposition to beginner programmers.</description>

      <title>(Working Paper) Good Faith Design: Religion as a Resource for Technologists</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous work has found a lack of research in HCI on religion, partly driven by misunderstandings of values and practices between religious and technical communities. To bridge this divide in an empirically rigorous way, we conducted an interview study with 48 religious people and/or experts from 11 faiths, and we document how religious people experience, understand, and imagine technologies. We show that religious stakeholders find non-neutral secular embeddings in technologies and the firms and people that design them, and how these manifest in unintended harms for religious and nonreligious users. Our findings reveal how users navigate technoreligious practices with religiously informed mental models and what they desire from technologies. Informed by this, we distill six design values -- wonder, humility, space, embodiedness, community, and eternity -- to guide technologists in considering and leveraging religion as an additional, valid sociocultural resource when designing for a holistic user. We further spell out directions for future research.</description>

      <title>The Imperfect Learner: Incorporating Developmental Trajectories in Memory-based Student Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: User simulation is important for developing and evaluating human-centered AI, yet current student simulation in educational applications has significant limitations. Existing approaches focus on single learning experiences and do not account for students' gradual knowledge construction and evolving skill sets. Moreover, large language models are optimized to produce direct and accurate responses, making it challenging to represent the incomplete understanding and developmental constraints that characterize real learners. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for memory-based student simulation that incorporates developmental trajectories through a hierarchical memory mechanism with structured knowledge representation. The framework also integrates metacognitive processes and personality traits to enrich the individual learner profiling, through dynamical consolidation of both cognitive development and personal learning characteristics. In practice, we implement a curriculum-aligned simulator grounded on the Next Generation Science Standards. Experimental results show that our approach can effectively reflect the gradual nature of knowledge development and the characteristic difficulties students face, providing a more accurate representation of learning processes.</description>

      <title>Designing Incident Reporting Systems for Harms from General-Purpose AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a conceptual framework and provide considerations for the institutional design of AI incident reporting systems, i.e., processes for collecting information about safety- and rights-related events caused by general-purpose AI. As general-purpose AI systems are increasingly adopted, they are causing more real-world harms and displaying the potential to cause significantly more dangerous incidents - events that did or could have caused harm to individuals, property, or the environment. Through a literature review, we develop a framework for understanding the institutional design of AI incident reporting systems, which includes seven dimensions: policy goal, actors submitting and receiving reports, type of incidents reported, level of risk materialization, enforcement of reporting, anonymity of reporters, and post-reporting actions. We then examine nine case studies of incident reporting in safety-critical industries to extract design considerations for AI incident reporting in the United States. We discuss, among other factors, differences in systems operated by regulatory vs. non-regulatory government agencies, near miss reporting, the roles of mandatory reporting thresholds and voluntary reporting channels, how to enable safety learning after reporting, sharing incident information, and clarifying legal frameworks for reporting. Our aim is to inform researchers and policymakers about when particular design choices might be more or less appropriate for AI incident reporting.</description>

      <title>Artificial intelligence and the Gulf Cooperation Council workforce adapting to the future of work</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.05927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid expansion of artificial intelligence (AI) in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) raises a central question: are investments in compute infrastructure matched by an equally robust build-out of skills, incentives, and governance? Grounded in socio-technical systems (STS) theory, this mixed-methods study audits workforce preparedness across Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain, and Oman. We combine term frequency--inverse document frequency (TF--IDF) analysis of six national AI strategies (NASs), an inventory of 47 publicly disclosed AI initiatives (January 2017--April 2025), paired case studies, the Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI) and the Saudi Data &amp; Artificial Intelligence Authority (SDAIA) Academy, and a scenario matrix linking oil-revenue slack (technical capacity) to regulatory coherence (social alignment). Across the corpus, 34/47 initiatives (0.72; 95% Wilson CI 0.58--0.83) exhibit joint social--technical design; country-level indices span 0.57--0.90 (small n; intervals overlap). Scenario results suggest that, under our modeled conditions, regulatory convergence plausibly binds outcomes more than fiscal capacity: fragmented rules can offset high oil revenues, while harmonized standards help preserve progress under austerity. We also identify an emerging two-track talent system, research elites versus rapidly trained practitioners, that risks labor-market bifurcation without bridging mechanisms. By extending STS inquiry to oil-rich, state-led economies, the study refines theory and sets a research agenda focused on longitudinal coupling metrics, ethnographies of coordination, and outcome-based performance indicators.</description>

      <title>The Future of AI in the GCC Post-NPM Landscape: A Comparative Analysis of Kuwait and the UAE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Comparative evidence on how Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states turn artificial intelligence (AI) ambitions into post--New Public Management (post-NPM) outcomes is scarce because most studies examine Western democracies. We analyze constitutional, collective-choice, and operational rules shaping AI uptake in two contrasting GCC members, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Kuwait, and whether they foster citizen centricity, collaborative governance, and public value creation. Anchored in Ostrom's Institutional Analysis and Development framework, the study combines a most similar/most different systems design with multiple sources: 62 public documents from 2018--2025, embedded UAE cases (Smart Dubai and MBZUAI), and 39 interviews with officials conducted Aug 2024--May 2025. Dual coding and process tracing connect rule configurations to AI performance. Cross-case analysis identifies four reinforcing mechanisms behind divergent trajectories. In the UAE, concentrated authority, credible sanctions, pro-innovation narratives, and flexible reinvestment rules scale pilots into hundreds of services and sizable recycled savings. In Kuwait, dispersed veto points, exhortative sanctions, cautious discourse, and lapsed AI budgets confine initiatives to pilot mode despite equivalent fiscal resources. The findings refine institutional theory by showing that vertical rule coherence, not wealth, determines AI's public-value yield, and temper post-NPM optimism by revealing that efficiency metrics serve societal goals only when backed by enforceable safeguards. To curb ethics washing and test transferability beyond the GCC, future work should track rule diffusion over time, develop blended legitimacy--efficiency scorecards, and examine how narrative framing shapes citizen consent for data sharing.</description>

      <title>Who Gets Heard? Rethinking Fairness in AI for Music Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the music research community has examined risks of AI models for music, with generative AI models in particular, raised concerns about copyright, deepfakes, and transparency. In our work, we raise concerns about cultural and genre biases in AI for music systems (music-AI systems) which affect stakeholders including creators, distributors, and listeners shaping representation in AI for music. These biases can misrepresent marginalized traditions, especially from the Global South, producing inauthentic outputs (e.g., distorted ragas) that reduces creators' trust on these systems. Such harms risk reinforcing biases, limiting creativity, and contributing to cultural erasure. To address this, we offer recommendations at dataset, model and interface level in music-AI systems.</description>

      <title>Simulating Students with Large Language Models: A Review of Architecture, Mechanisms, and Role Modelling in Education with Generative AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulated Students offer a valuable methodological framework for evaluating pedagogical approaches and modelling diverse learner profiles, tasks which are otherwise challenging to undertake systematically in real-world settings. Recent research has increasingly focused on developing such simulated agents to capture a range of learning styles, cognitive development pathways, and social behaviours. Among contemporary simulation techniques, the integration of large language models (LLMs) into educational research has emerged as a particularly versatile and scalable paradigm. LLMs afford a high degree of linguistic realism and behavioural adaptability, enabling agents to approximate cognitive processes and engage in contextually appropriate pedagogical dialogues. This paper presents a thematic review of empirical and methodological studies utilising LLMs to simulate student behaviour across educational environments. We synthesise current evidence on the capacity of LLM-based agents to emulate learner archetypes, respond to instructional inputs, and interact within multi-agent classroom scenarios. Furthermore, we examine the implications of such systems for curriculum development, instructional evaluation, and teacher training. While LLMs surpass rule-based systems in natural language generation and situational flexibility, ongoing concerns persist regarding algorithmic bias, evaluation reliability, and alignment with educational objectives. The review identifies existing technological and methodological gaps and proposes future research directions for integrating generative AI into adaptive learning systems and instructional design.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models Develop Novel Social Biases Through Adaptive Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are adopted into frameworks that grant them the capacity to make real decisions, it is increasingly important to ensure that they are unbiased. In this paper, we argue that the predominant approach of simply removing existing biases from models is not enough. Using a paradigm from the psychology literature, we demonstrate that LLMs can spontaneously develop novel social biases about artificial demographic groups even when no inherent differences exist. These biases result in highly stratified task allocations, which are less fair than assignments by human participants and are exacerbated by newer and larger models. In social science, emergent biases like these have been shown to result from exploration-exploitation trade-offs, where the decision-maker explores too little, allowing early observations to strongly influence impressions about entire demographic groups. To alleviate this effect, we examine a series of interventions targeting model inputs, problem structure, and explicit steering. We find that explicitly incentivizing exploration most robustly reduces stratification, highlighting the need for better multifaceted objectives to mitigate bias. These results reveal that LLMs are not merely passive mirrors of human social biases, but can actively create new ones from experience, raising urgent questions about how these systems will shape societies over time.</description>

      <title>Prediction-based evaluation of back-four defense with spatial control in soccer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Defensive organization is critical in soccer, particularly during negative transitions when teams are most vulnerable. The back-four defensive line plays a decisive role in preventing goal-scoring opportunities, yet its collective coordination remains difficult to quantify. This study introduces interpretable spatio-temporal indicators namely, space control, stretch index, pressure index, and defensive line height (absolute and relative) to evaluate the effectiveness of the back-four during defensive transitions. Using synchronized tracking and event data from the 2023-24 LaLiga season, 2,413 defensive sequences were analyzed following possession losses by FC Barcelona and Real Madrid CF. Two-way ANOVA revealed significant effects of team, outcome, and their interaction for key indicators, with relative line height showing the strongest association with defensive success. Predictive modeling using XGBoost achieved the highest discriminative performance (ROC AUC: 0.724 for Barcelona, 0.698 for Real Madrid), identifying space score and relative line height as dominant predictors. Comparative analysis revealed distinct team-specific defensive behaviors: Barcelona's success was characterized by higher spatial control and compact line coordination, whereas Real Madrid exhibited more adaptive but less consistent defensive structures. These findings demonstrate the tactical and predictive value of interpretable spatial indicators for quantifying collective defensive performance.</description>

      <title>Simulated Affection, Engineered Trust: How Anthropomorphic AI Benefits Surveillance Capitalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we argue that anthropomorphized technology, designed to simulate emotional realism, are not neutral tools but cognitive infrastructures that manipulate user trust and behaviour. This reinforces the logic of surveillance capitalism, an under-regulated economic system that profits from behavioural manipulation and monitoring. Drawing on Nicholas Carr's theory of the intellectual ethic, we identify how technologies such as chatbots, virtual assistants, or generative models reshape not only what we think about ourselves and our world, but how we think at the cognitive level. We identify how the emerging intellectual ethic of AI benefits a system of surveillance capitalism, and discuss the potential ways of addressing this.</description>

      <title>From Catastrophic to Concrete: Reframing AI Risk Communication for Public Mobilization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective governance of artificial intelligence (AI) requires public engagement, yet communication strategies centered on existential risk have not produced sustained mobilization. In this paper, we examine the psychological and opinion barriers that limit engagement with extinction narratives, such as mortality avoidance, exponential growth bias, and the absence of self-referential anchors. We contrast them with evidence that public concern over AI rises when framed in terms of proximate harms such as employment disruption, relational instability, and mental health issues. We validate these findings through actual message testing with 1063 respondents, with the evidence showing that AI risks to Jobs and Children have the highest potential to mobilize people, while Existential Risk is the lowest-performing theme across all demographics. Using survey data from five countries, we identify two segments (Tech-Positive Urbanites and World Guardians) as particularly receptive to such framing and more likely to participate in civic action. Finally, we argue that mobilization around these everyday concerns can raise the political salience of AI, creating "policy demand" for structural measures to mitigate AI risks. We conclude that this strategy creates the conditions for successful regulatory change.</description>

      <title>Place Matters: Comparing LLM Hallucination Rates for Place-Based Legal Queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How do we make a meaningful comparison of a large language model's knowledge of the law in one place compared to another? Quantifying these differences is critical to understanding if the quality of the legal information obtained by users of LLM-based chatbots varies depending on their location. However, obtaining meaningful comparative metrics is challenging because legal institutions in different places are not themselves easily comparable. In this work we propose a methodology to obtain place-to-place metrics based on the comparative law concept of functionalism. We construct a dataset of factual scenarios drawn from Reddit posts by users seeking legal advice for family, housing, employment, crime and traffic issues. We use these to elicit a summary of a law from the LLM relevant to each scenario in Los Angeles, London and Sydney. These summaries, typically of a legislative provision, are manually evaluated for hallucinations. We show that the rate of hallucination of legal information by leading closed-source LLMs is significantly associated with place. This suggests that the quality of legal solutions provided by these models is not evenly distributed across geography. Additionally, we show a strong negative correlation between hallucination rate and the frequency of the majority response when the LLM is sampled multiple times, suggesting a measure of uncertainty of model predictions of legal facts.</description>

      <title>Het 'right to be forgotten' en bijzondere persoonsgegevens: geen ruimte meer voor een belangenafweging? [The 'Right to Be Forgotten' and Sensitive Personal Data: No Room for Balancing?]</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An attorney submitted a 'right to be forgotten' delisting request to Google, regarding a blog post about a criminal conviction of the attorney in another country. The Rotterdam District Court ruled that Google may no longer link to the blog post when people search for the attorney's name. The court granted the attorney's request because the blog post concerns a criminal conviction. Personal data regarding criminal convictions are, under Dutch law, special categories of data (sometimes called sensitive data). The reasoning of the court on special categories of data creates problems for freedom of expression. This paper, in Dutch, explores how these problems can be reduced. Google has appealed the decision; the judgment of the Court of Appeals is expected in March 2017.</description>

      <title>Singling out people without knowing their names -- Behavioural targeting, pseudonymous data, and the New Data Protection Regulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Information about millions of people is collected for behavioural targeting, a type of marketing that involves tracking people's online behaviour for targeted advertising. It is hotly debated whether data protection law applies to behavioural targeting. Many behavioural targeting companies say that, as long as they do not tie names to data they hold about individuals, they do not process any personal data, and that, therefore, data protection law does not apply to them. European Data Protection Authorities, however, take the view that a company processes personal data if it uses data to single out a person, even if it cannot tie a name to these data. This paper argues that data protection law should indeed apply to behavioural targeting. Companies can often tie a name to nameless data about individuals. Furthermore, behavioural targeting relies on collecting information about individuals, singling out individuals, and targeting ads to individuals. Many privacy risks remain, regardless of whether companies tie a name to the information they hold about a person. A name is merely one of the identifiers that can be tied to data about a person, and it is not even the most practical identifier for behavioural targeting. Seeing data used to single out a person as personal data fits the rationale for data protection law: protecting fairness and privacy.</description>

      <title>Do Street View Imagery and Public Participation GIS align: Comparative Analysis of Urban Attractiveness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As digital tools increasingly shape spatial planning practices, understanding how different data sources reflect human experiences of urban environments is essential. Street View Imagery (SVI) and Public Participation GIS (PPGIS) represent two prominent approaches for capturing place-based perceptions that can support urban planning decisions, yet their comparability remains underexplored. This study investigates the alignment between SVI-based perceived attractiveness and residents' reported experiences gathered via a city-wide PPGIS survey in Helsinki, Finland. Using participant-rated SVI data and semantic image segmentation, we trained a machine learning model to predict perceived attractiveness based on visual features. We compared these predictions to PPGIS-identified locations marked as attractive or unattractive, calculating agreement using two sets of strict and moderate criteria. Our findings reveal only partial alignment between the two datasets. While agreement (with a moderate threshold) reached 67% for attractive and 77% for unattractive places, agreement (with a strict threshold) dropped to 27% and 29%, respectively. By analysing a range of contextual variables, including noise, traffic, population presence, and land use, we found that non-visual cues significantly contributed to mismatches. The model failed to account for experiential dimensions such as activity levels and environmental stressors that shape perceptions but are not visible in images. These results suggest that while SVI offers a scalable and visual proxy for urban perception, it cannot fully substitute the experiential richness captured through PPGIS. We argue that both methods are valuable but serve different purposes; therefore, a more integrated approach is needed to holistically capture how people perceive urban environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.05580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The complexity of human cognition has meant that psychology makes more use of theory and conceptual models than perhaps any other biomedical field. To enable precise quantitative study of the full breadth of phenomena in psychological and psychiatric medicine as well as cognitive aspects of AI safety, there is a need for a mathematical formulation which is both mathematically precise and equally accessible to experts from numerous fields. In this paper we formalize human psychodynamics via the diagrammatic framework of process theory, describe its key properties, and explain the links between a diagrammatic representation and central concepts in analysis of cognitive processes in contexts such as psychotherapy, neurotechnology, AI alignment, AI agent representation of individuals in autonomous negotiations, developing human-like AI systems, and other aspects of AI safety.</description>

Abstract: We propose a new approach to multi-factor classification of natural language texts based on weighted structured patterns such as N-grams, taking into account the heterarchical relationships between them, applied to solve such a socially impactful problem as the automation of detection of specific cognitive distortions in psychological care, relying on an interpretable, robust and transparent artificial intelligence model. The proposed recognition and learning algorithms improve the current state of the art in this field. The improvement is tested on two publicly available datasets, with significant improvements over literature-known F1 scores for the task, with optimal hyper-parameters determined, having code and models available for future use by the community.</description>

      <title>Assessing On-Demand Mobility Services and Policy Impacts: A Case Study from Chengdu, China</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid expansion of ride-hailing services has significantly reshaped urban on-demand mobility patterns, but it still remains unclear how they perform relative to traditional street-hailing services and how effective are related policy interventions. This study presents a simulation framework integrating a graph theory-based trip-vehicle matching mechanism with real cruising taxi operations data to simulate ride-hailing services in Chengdu, China. The performances of the two on-demand mobility service modes (i.e., ride-hailing and street-hailing) are evaluated in terms of three key performance indicators: average passenger waiting time (APWT), average deadheading miles (ADM), and average deadheading energy consumption (ADEC). We further examine the impacts of spatiotemporal characteristics and three types of policies: fleet size management, geofencing, and demand management, on the performance of ride-hailing services. Results show that under the same fleet size and trip demand as street-hailing taxis, ride-hailing services without cruising achieve substantial improvements, reducing APWT, ADM, and ADEC by 81\%, 75\%, and 72.1\%, respectively. These improvements are most pronounced during midnight low-demand hours and in remote areas such as airports. Our analysis also reveals that for ride-hailing service, (1) expanding fleet size yields diminishing marginal benefits; (2) geofencing worsens overall performance while it improves the performance of serving all trips within the city center; and (3) demand-side management targeting trips to high-attraction and low-demand areas can effectively reduce passenger waiting time without increasing deadheading costs.</description>

      <title>An Artificial Intelligence-based Assistant for the Visually Impaired</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06080v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper describes an artificial intelligence-based assistant application, AIDEN, developed during 2023 and 2024, aimed at improving the quality of life for visually impaired individuals. Visually impaired individuals face challenges in identifying objects, reading text, and navigating unfamiliar environments, which can limit their independence and reduce their quality of life. Although solutions such as Braille, audio books, and screen readers exist, they may not be effective in all situations. This application leverages state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms to identify and describe objects, read text, and answer questions about the environment. Specifically, it uses You Only Look Once architectures and a Large Language and Vision Assistant. The system incorporates several methods to facilitate the user's interaction with the system and access to textual and visual information in an appropriate manner. AIDEN aims to enhance user autonomy and access to information, contributing to an improved perception of daily usability, as supported by user feedback.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Implicit Biases in LLM Reasoning through Logic Grid Puzzles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While recent safety guardrails effectively suppress overtly biased outputs, subtler forms of social bias emerge during complex logical reasoning tasks that evade current evaluation benchmarks. To fill this gap, we introduce a new evaluation framework, PRIME (Puzzle Reasoning for Implicit Biases in Model Evaluation), that uses logic grid puzzles to systematically probe the influence of social stereotypes on logical reasoning and decision making in LLMs. Our use of logic puzzles enables automatic generation and verification, as well as variability in complexity and biased settings. PRIME includes stereotypical, anti-stereotypical, and neutral puzzle variants generated from a shared puzzle structure, allowing for controlled and fine-grained comparisons. We evaluate multiple model families across puzzle sizes and test the effectiveness of prompt-based mitigation strategies. Focusing our experiments on gender stereotypes, our findings highlight that models consistently reason more accurately when solutions align with stereotypical associations. This demonstrates the significance of PRIME for diagnosing and quantifying social biases perpetuated in the deductive reasoning of LLMs, where fairness is critical.</description>

      <title>SPA: Achieving Consensus in LLM Alignment via Self-Priority Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In high-stakes scenarios-such as self-harm, legal, or medical queries-LLMs must be both trustworthy and helpful. However, these goals often conflict. We propose priority alignment, a new alignment paradigm that enforces a strict "trustworthy-before-helpful" ordering: optimization of helpfulness is conditioned on first meeting trustworthy thresholds (e.g., harmlessness or honesty). To realize this, we introduce Self-Priority Alignment (SPA)-a fully unsupervised framework that generates diverse responses, self-evaluates them and refines them by the model itself, and applies dual-criterion denoising to remove inconsistency and control variance. From this, SPA constructs lexicographically ordered preference pairs and fine-tunes the model using an uncertainty-weighted alignment loss that emphasizes high-confidence, high-gap decisions. Experiments across multiple benchmarks show that SPA improves helpfulness without compromising safety, outperforming strong baselines while preserving general capabilities. Our results demonstrate that SPA provides a scalable and interpretable alignment strategy for critical LLM applications.</description>

      <title>GAIA: A General Agency Interaction Architecture for LLM-Human B2B Negotiation &amp; Screening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Organizations are increasingly exploring delegation of screening and negotiation tasks to AI systems, yet deployment in high-stakes B2B settings is constrained by governance: preventing unauthorized commitments, ensuring sufficient information before bargaining, and maintaining effective human oversight and auditability. Prior work on large language model negotiation largely emphasizes autonomous bargaining between agents and omits practical needs such as staged information gathering, explicit authorization boundaries, and systematic feedback integration. We propose GAIA, a governance-first framework for LLM-human agency in B2B negotiation and screening. GAIA defines three essential roles - Principal (human), Delegate (LLM agent), and Counterparty - with an optional Critic to enhance performance, and organizes interactions through three mechanisms: information-gated progression that separates screening from negotiation; dual feedback integration that combines AI critique with lightweight human corrections; and authorization boundaries with explicit escalation paths. Our contributions are fourfold: (1) a formal governance framework with three coordinated mechanisms and four safety invariants for delegation with bounded authorization; (2) information-gated progression via task-completeness tracking (TCI) and explicit state transitions that separate screening from commitment; (3) dual feedback integration that blends Critic suggestions with human oversight through parallel learning channels; and (4) a hybrid validation blueprint that combines automated protocol metrics with human judgment of outcomes and safety. By bridging theory and practice, GAIA offers a reproducible specification for safe, efficient, and accountable AI delegation that can be instantiated across procurement, real estate, and staffing workflows.</description>

      <title>LLM-Driven Completeness and Consistency Evaluation for Cultural Heritage Data Augmentation in Cross-Modal Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cross-modal retrieval is essential for interpreting cultural heritage data, but its effectiveness is often limited by incomplete or inconsistent textual descriptions, caused by historical data loss and the high cost of expert annotation. While large language models (LLMs) offer a promising solution by enriching textual descriptions, their outputs frequently suffer from hallucinations or miss visually grounded details. To address these challenges, we propose $C^3$, a data augmentation framework that enhances cross-modal retrieval performance by improving the completeness and consistency of LLM-generated descriptions. $C^3$ introduces a completeness evaluation module to assess semantic coverage using both visual cues and language-model outputs. Furthermore, to mitigate factual inconsistencies, we formulate a Markov Decision Process to supervise Chain-of-Thought reasoning, guiding consistency evaluation through adaptive query control. Experiments on the cultural heritage datasets CulTi and TimeTravel, as well as on general benchmarks MSCOCO and Flickr30K, demonstrate that $C^3$ achieves state-of-the-art performance in both fine-tuned and zero-shot settings.</description>

      <title>CINEMAE: Leveraging Frozen Masked Autoencoders for Cross-Generator AI Image Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While context-based detectors have achieved strong generalization for AI-generated text by measuring distributional inconsistencies, image-based detectors still struggle with overfitting to generator-specific artifacts. We introduce CINEMAE, a novel paradigm for AIGC image detection that adapts the core principles of text detection methods to the visual domain. Our key insight is that Masked AutoEncoder (MAE), trained to reconstruct masked patches conditioned on visible context, naturally encodes semantic consistency expectations. We formalize this reconstruction process probabilistically, computing conditional Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL, p(masked | visible)) to quantify local semantic anomalies. By aggregating these patch-level statistics with global MAE features through learned fusion, CINEMAE achieves strong cross-generator generalization. Trained exclusively on Stable Diffusion v1.4, our method achieves over 95% accuracy on all eight unseen generators in the GenImage benchmark, substantially outperforming state-of-the-art detectors. This demonstrates that context-conditional reconstruction uncertainty provides a robust, transferable signal for AIGC detection.</description>

      <title>Understanding Student Interaction with AI-Powered Next-Step Hints: Strategies and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automated feedback generation plays a crucial role in enhancing personalized learning experiences in computer science education. Among different types of feedback, next-step hint feedback is particularly important, as it provides students with actionable steps to progress towards solving programming tasks. This study investigates how students interact with an AI-driven next-step hint system in an in-IDE learning environment. We gathered and analyzed a dataset from 34 students solving Kotlin tasks, containing detailed hint interaction logs. We applied process mining techniques and identified 16 common interaction scenarios. Semi-structured interviews with 6 students revealed strategies for managing unhelpful hints, such as adapting partial hints or modifying code to generate variations of the same hint. These findings, combined with our publicly available dataset, offer valuable opportunities for future research and provide key insights into student behavior, helping improve hint design for enhanced learning support.</description>

      <title>SugarTextNet: A Transformer-Based Framework for Detecting Sugar Dating-Related Content on Social Media with Context-Aware Focal Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06402v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sugar dating-related content has rapidly proliferated on mainstream social media platforms, giving rise to serious societal and regulatory concerns, including commercialization of intimate relationships and the normalization of transactional relationships.~Detecting such content is highly challenging due to the prevalence of subtle euphemisms, ambiguous linguistic cues, and extreme class imbalance in real-world data.~In this work, we present SugarTextNet, a novel transformer-based framework specifically designed to identify sugar dating-related posts on social media.~SugarTextNet integrates a pretrained transformer encoder, an attention-based cue extractor, and a contextual phrase encoder to capture both salient and nuanced features in user-generated text.~To address class imbalance and enhance minority-class detection, we introduce Context-Aware Focal Loss, a tailored loss function that combines focal loss scaling with contextual weighting.~We evaluate SugarTextNet on a newly curated, manually annotated dataset of 3,067 Chinese social media posts from Sina Weibo, demonstrating that our approach substantially outperforms traditional machine learning models, deep learning baselines, and large language models across multiple metrics.~Comprehensive ablation studies confirm the indispensable role of each component.~Our findings highlight the importance of domain-specific, context-aware modeling for sensitive content detection, and provide a robust solution for content moderation in complex, real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>Dutch Metaphor Extraction from Cancer Patients' Interviews and Forum Data using LLMs and Human in the Loop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metaphors and metaphorical language (MLs) play an important role in healthcare communication between clinicians, patients, and patients' family members. In this work, we focus on Dutch language data from cancer patients. We extract metaphors used by patients using two data sources: (1) cancer patient storytelling interview data and (2) online forum data, including patients' posts, comments, and questions to professionals. We investigate how current state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) perform on this task by exploring different prompting strategies such as chain of thought reasoning, few-shot learning, and self-prompting. With a human-in-the-loop setup, we verify the extracted metaphors and compile the outputs into a corpus named HealthQuote.NL. We believe the extracted metaphors can support better patient care, for example shared decision making, improved communication between patients and clinicians, and enhanced patient health literacy. They can also inform the design of personalized care pathways. We share prompts and related resources at https://github.com/aaronlifenghan/HealthQuote.NL</description>

      <title>How Founder Expertise Shapes the Impact of Generative Artificial Intelligence on Digital Ventures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid diffusion of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) has substantially lowered the costs of launching and developing digital ventures. GenAI can potentially both enable previously unviable entrepreneurial ideas by lowering resource needs and improve the performance of existing ventures. We explore how founders' technical and managerial expertise shapes GenAI's impact on digital ventures along these dimensions. Exploiting exogenous variation in GenAI usage across venture categories and the timing of its broad availability for software tasks (e.g., GitHub Copilot's public release and subsequent GenAI tools), we find that the number of new venture launches increased and the median time to launch decreased significantly more in categories with relatively high GenAI usage. GenAI's effect on new launches is larger for founders without managerial experience or education, while its effect on venture capital (VC) funding likelihood is stronger for founders with technical experience or education. Overall, our results suggest that GenAI expands access to digital entrepreneurship for founders lacking managerial expertise and enhances venture performance among technical founders.</description>

      <title>How AI Fails: An Interactive Pedagogical Tool for Demonstrating Dialectal Bias in Automated Toxicity Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Now that AI-driven moderation has become pervasive in everyday life, we often hear claims that "the AI is biased". While this is often said jokingly, the light-hearted remark reflects a deeper concern. How can we be certain that an online post flagged as "inappropriate" was not simply the victim of a biased algorithm? This paper investigates this problem using a dual approach. First, I conduct a quantitative benchmark of a widely used toxicity model (unitary/toxic-bert) to measure performance disparity between text in African-American English (AAE) and Standard American English (SAE). The benchmark reveals a clear, systematic bias: on average, the model scores AAE text as 1.8 times more toxic and 8.8 times higher for "identity hate". Second, I introduce an interactive pedagogical tool that makes these abstract biases tangible. The tool's core mechanic, a user-controlled "sensitivity threshold," demonstrates that the biased score itself is not the only harm; instead, the more-concerning harm is the human-set, seemingly neutral policy that ultimately operationalises discrimination. This work provides both statistical evidence of disparate impact and a public-facing tool designed to foster critical AI literacy.</description>

      <title>Accessibility Gaps in U.S. Government Dashboards for Blind and Low-Vision Residents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Public dashboards are now a common way for US government agencies to share high stakes information with residents. We audited six live systems at federal, state, and city levels: CDC respiratory illness, HUD homelessness PIT and HIC, California HCD Annual Progress Report, New York City Mayor's Management Report, Houston Permitting, and Chicago public health and budget dashboards. Using a rubric based on screen reader needs and WCAG, we checked five items: (1) discoverability of key metrics by assistive tech, (2) keyboard access without mouse hover, (3) clear semantic labels for axes, series, and categories, (4) short plain language status and trend notes, and (5) machine readable tables or CSVs that mirror what sighted users see. Findings are mixed. Many charts fail basic discoverability or depend on hover, which blocks keyboard and screen reader use. Plain language summaries are common in CDC and Chicago, but rare in HUD and Houston. Machine readable data is strong for NYC, California, and HUD; it is weaker or unclear for Houston. Several sites promise service for the public or for customers yet do not name accessibility in their descriptions. Across systems we also observe urgency inversion: faster, operational dashboards tend to provide fewer accessible affordances than slower accountability dashboards. These patterns matter for equal participation and for ADA Title II compliance that references WCAG 2.1 AA. We propose three steps for any public dashboard: add a brief status and trend text at the same update cadence, publish a matching table or CSV of the visual metrics, and state an explicit accessibility commitment.</description>

      <title>Beyond Centrality: Understanding Urban Street Network Typologies Through Intersection Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The structure of road networks plays a pivotal role in shaping transportation dynamics. It also provides insights into how drivers experience city streets and helps uncover each urban environment's unique characteristics and challenges. Consequently, characterizing cities based on their road network patterns can facilitate the identification of similarities and differences, informing collaborative traffic management strategies, particularly at a regional scale. While previous studies have investigated global network patterns for cities, they have often overlooked detailed characterizations within a single large urban region. Additionally, most existing research uses metrics like degree, centrality, orientation, etc., and misses the nuances of street networks at the intersection level, specifically the geometric angles formed by links at intersections, which could offer a more refined feature for characterization. To address these gaps, this study examines over 100 cities in the San Francisco Bay Area. We introduce a novel metric for classifying intersections, distinguishing between different types of 3-way and 4-way intersections based on the angles formed at the intersections. Through the application of clustering algorithms in machine learning, we have identified three distinct typologies - grid, orthogonal, and organic cities - within the San Francisco Bay Area. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the metric in capturing the differences between cities based on street and intersection patterns. The typologies generated in this study could offer valuable support for city planners and policymakers in crafting a range of practical strategies tailored to the complexities of each city's road network, covering aspects such as evacuation plans, traffic signage placements, and traffic signal control.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06804</link>

Abstract: The growing complexity of urban mobility systems has made traffic simulation indispensable for evidence-based transportation planning and policy evaluation. However, despite the analytical capabilities of platforms such as the Simulation of Urban MObility (SUMO), their application remains largely confined to domain experts. Developing realistic simulation scenarios requires expertise in network construction, origin-destination modeling, and parameter configuration for policy experimentation, creating substantial barriers for non-expert users such as policymakers, urban planners, and city officials. Moreover, the requests expressed by these users are often incomplete and abstract-typically articulated as high-level objectives, which are not well aligned with the imperative, sequential workflows employed in existing language-model-based simulation frameworks. To address these challenges, this study proposes AgentSUMO, an agentic framework for interactive simulation scenario generation via large language models. AgentSUMO departs from imperative, command-driven execution by introducing an adaptive reasoning layer that interprets user intents, assesses task complexity, infers missing parameters, and formulates executable simulation plans. The framework is structured around two complementary components, the Interactive Planning Protocol, which governs reasoning and user interaction, and the Model Context Protocol, which manages standardized communication and orchestration among simulation tools. Through this design, AgentSUMO converts abstract policy objectives into executable simulation scenarios. Experiments on urban networks in Seoul and Manhattan demonstrate that the agentic workflow achieves substantial improvements in traffic flow metrics while maintaining accessibility for non-expert users, successfully bridging the gap between policy goals and executable simulation workflows.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Online Moderation Via LLM-Powered Counterfactual Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Online Social Networks (OSNs) widely adopt content moderation to mitigate the spread of abusive and toxic discourse. Nonetheless, the real effectiveness of moderation interventions remains unclear due to the high cost of data collection and limited experimental control. The latest developments in Natural Language Processing pave the way for a new evaluation approach. Large Language Models (LLMs) can be successfully leveraged to enhance Agent-Based Modeling and simulate human-like social behavior with unprecedented degree of believability. Yet, existing tools do not support simulation-based evaluation of moderation strategies. We fill this gap by designing a LLM-powered simulator of OSN conversations enabling a parallel, counterfactual simulation where toxic behavior is influenced by moderation interventions, keeping all else equal. We conduct extensive experiments, unveiling the psychological realism of OSN agents, the emergence of social contagion phenomena and the superior effectiveness of personalized moderation strategies.</description>

      <title>Designing Beyond Language: Sociotechnical Barriers in AI Health Technologies for Limited English Proficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Limited English proficiency (LEP) patients in the U.S. face systemic barriers to healthcare beyond language and interpreter access, encompassing procedural and institutional constraints. AI advances may support communication and care through on-demand translation and visit preparation, but also risk exacerbating existing inequalities. We conducted storyboard-driven interviews with 14 patient navigators to explore how AI could shape care experiences for Spanish-speaking LEP individuals. We identified tensions around linguistic and cultural misunderstandings, privacy concerns, and opportunities and risks for AI to augment care workflows. Participants highlighted structural factors that can undermine trust in AI systems, including sensitive information disclosure, unstable technology access, and low digital literacy. While AI tools can potentially alleviate social barriers and institutional constraints, there are risks of misinformation and uprooting human camaraderie. Our findings contribute design considerations for AI that support LEP patients and care teams via rapport-building, education, and language support, and minimizing disruptions to existing practices.</description>

      <title>SPOT: An Annotated French Corpus and Benchmark for Detecting Critical Interventions in Online Conversations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce SPOT (Stopping Points in Online Threads), the first annotated corpus translating the sociological concept of stopping point into a reproducible NLP task. Stopping points are ordinary critical interventions that pause or redirect online discussions through a range of forms (irony, subtle doubt or fragmentary arguments) that frameworks like counterspeech or social correction often overlook. We operationalize this concept as a binary classification task and provide reliable annotation guidelines. The corpus contains 43,305 manually annotated French Facebook comments linked to URLs flagged as false information by social media users, enriched with contextual metadata (article, post, parent comment, page or group, and source). We benchmark fine-tuned encoder models (CamemBERT) and instruction-tuned LLMs under various prompting strategies. Results show that fine-tuned encoders outperform prompted LLMs in F1 score by more than 10 percentage points, confirming the importance of supervised learning for emerging non-English social media tasks. Incorporating contextual metadata further improves encoder models F1 scores from 0.75 to 0.78. We release the anonymized dataset, along with the annotation guidelines and code in our code repository, to foster transparency and reproducible research.</description>

      <title>Prompt Injection Vulnerability of Consensus Generating Applications in Digital Democracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04281v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are gaining traction as a method to generate consensus statements and aggregate preferences in digital democracy experiments. Yet, LLMs could introduce critical vulnerabilities in these systems. Here, we explore the vulnerability of some off-the-shelf LLMs to prompt-injection attacks in consensus generating systems using a four-dimensional taxonomy of attacks. In LLaMA 3.1 8B and Chat GPT 4.1 Nano, we find LLMs to be more vulnerable to attacks using disagreeable prompts and when targeting situations with unclear consensus. We also find evidence of more effective manipulation when using explicit imperatives and rational-sounding arguments compared to emotional language or fabricated statistics. To mitigate these vulnerabilities, we apply Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), an alignment method that fine-tunes LLMs to prefer unperturbed consensus statements. While DPO and additional layered defenses significantly improve robustness, it still offers limited protection against attacks targeting ambiguous consensus. These results advance our understanding of the vulnerability and robustness of consensus generating LLMs in digital democracy applications.</description>

      <title>Assisting the Grading of a Handwritten General Chemistry Exam with Artificial Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10591v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the effectiveness and reliability of an artificial intelligence (AI)-based grading system for a handwritten general chemistry exam, comparing AI-assigned scores to human grading across various types of questions. Exam pages and grading rubrics were uploaded as images to account for chemical reaction equations, short and long open-ended answers, numerical and symbolic answer derivations, drawing, and sketching in pencil-and-paper format. Using linear regression analyses and psychometric evaluations, the investigation reveals high agreement between AI and human graders for textual and chemical reaction questions, while highlighting lower reliability for numerical and graphical tasks. The findings emphasize the necessity for human oversight to ensure grading accuracy, based on selective filtering. The results indicate promising applications for AI in routine assessment tasks, though careful consideration must be given to student perceptions of fairness and trust in integrating AI-based grading into educational practice.</description>

      <title>Qualitative Research in an Era of AI: A Pragmatic Approach to Data Analysis, Workflow, and Computation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12503v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computational developments--particularly artificial intelligence--are reshaping social scientific research and raise new questions for in-depth methods such as ethnography and qualitative interviewing. Building on classic debates about computers in qualitative data analysis (QDA), we revisit possibilities and dangers in an era of automation, Large Language Model (LLM) chatbots, and 'big data.' We introduce a typology of contemporary approaches to using computers in qualitative research: streamlining workflows, scaling up projects, hybrid analytical methods, the sociology of computation, and technological rejection. Drawing from scaled team ethnographies and solo research integrating computational social science (CSS), we describe methodological choices across study lifecycles, from literature reviews through data collection, coding, text retrieval, and representation. We argue that new technologies hold potential to address longstanding methodological challenges when deployed with knowledge, purpose, and ethical commitment. Yet a pragmatic approach--moving beyond technological optimism and dismissal--is essential given rapidly changing tools that are both generative and dangerous. Computation now saturates research infrastructure, from algorithmic literature searches to scholarly metrics, making computational literacy a core methodological competence in and beyond sociology. We conclude that when used carefully and transparently, contemporary computational tools can meaningfully expand--rather than displace--the irreducible insights of qualitative research.</description>

      <title>Sustainable and Adaptive Growth in Computing Education</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.16858v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computing Education faces significant challenges in equipping graduates with the resilience necessary to remain relevant amid rapid technological change. While existing curricula cultivate computing competencies, they often fail to integrate strategies for sustaining and adapting these skills, leading to reduced career resilience and recurrent industry layoffs. The lack of educational emphasis on sustainability and adaptability amid industry changes perpetuates a vicious cycle: As industries shift, skill fragmentation and decay lead to displacement, which in turn causes further skill degradation. The ongoing deficiency in adaptability and sustainability among learners is reflected in the frequent and intense shifts across the industry. This issue is particularly evident in domains marked by high technological volatility such as computer graphics and game development, where computing concepts, including computational thinking and performance optimization, are uniquely and continuously challenged. To foster sustainable and adaptive growth, this paper introduces, a new framework which addresses the question: How can computing education and professional development be connected to in these volatile sectors? It integrates two iterative, interconnected cycles, an educational and a professional, by linking education with profession to establish a lifelong, renewable practice. This approach allows computing professionals to excel and maintain relevance amid constant changes across their industry.</description>

      <title>What is the Return on Investment of Digital Engineering for Complex Systems Development? Findings from a Mixed-Methods Study on the Post-production Design Change Process of Navy Assets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00077v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Complex engineered systems routinely face schedule and cost overruns, along with poor post-deployment performance. Championed by both INCOSE and the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), the systems engineering (SE) community has increasingly looked to Digital Engineering (DE) as a potential remedy. Despite this growing advocacy, most of DE's purported benefits remain anecdotal, and its return on investment (ROI) remains poorly understood. This research presents findings from a case study on a Navy SE team responsible for the preliminary design phase of post-production design change projects for Navy assets. Using a mixed-methods approach, we document why complex system sustainment projects are routinely late, where and to what extent schedule slips arise, and how a DE transformation could improve schedule adherence. This study makes three contributions. First, it identifies four archetypical inefficiency modes that drive schedule overruns and explains how these mechanisms unfold in their organizational context. Second, it quantifies the magnitude and variation of schedule slips. Third, it creates a hypothetical digitally transformed version of the current process, aligned with DoD DE policy, and compares it to the current state to estimate potential schedule gains. Our findings suggest that a DE transformation could reduce the median project duration by 50.1% and reduce the standard deviation by 41.5%, leading to faster and more predictable timelines. However, the observed gains are not uniform across task categories. Overall, this study provides initial quantitative evidence of DE's potential ROI and its value in improving the efficiency and predictability of complex system sustainment projects.</description>

      <title>Addressing Polarization and Unfairness in Performative Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16756v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In many real-world applications of machine learning such as recommendations, hiring, and lending, deployed models influence the data they are trained on, leading to feedback loops between predictions and data distribution. The performative prediction (PP) framework captures this phenomenon by modeling the data distribution as a function of the deployed model. While prior work has focused on finding performative stable (PS) solutions for robustness, their societal impacts, particularly regarding fairness, remain underexplored. We show that PS solutions can lead to severe polarization and prediction performance disparities, and that conventional fairness interventions in previous works often fail under model-dependent distribution shifts due to failing the PS criteria. To address these challenges in PP, we introduce novel fairness mechanisms that provably ensure both stability and fairness, validated by theoretical analysis and empirical results.</description>

      <title>Multi-turn Evaluation of Anthropomorphic Behaviours in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07077v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The tendency of users to anthropomorphise large language models (LLMs) is of growing interest to AI developers, researchers, and policy-makers. Here, we present a novel method for empirically evaluating anthropomorphic LLM behaviours in realistic and varied settings. Going beyond single-turn static benchmarks, we contribute three methodological advances in state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLM evaluation. First, we develop a multi-turn evaluation of 14 anthropomorphic behaviours. Second, we present a scalable, automated approach by employing simulations of user interactions. Third, we conduct an interactive, large-scale human subject study (N=1101) to validate that the model behaviours we measure predict real users' anthropomorphic perceptions. We find that all SOTA LLMs evaluated exhibit similar behaviours, characterised by relationship-building (e.g., empathy and validation) and first-person pronoun use, and that the majority of behaviours only first occur after multiple turns. Our work lays an empirical foundation for investigating how design choices influence anthropomorphic model behaviours and for progressing the ethical debate on the desirability of these behaviours. It also showcases the necessity of multi-turn evaluations for complex social phenomena in human-AI interaction.</description>

      <title>Data Leakage and Deceptive Performance: A Critical Examination of Credit Card Fraud Detection Methodologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02703v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study critically examines the methodological rigor in credit card fraud detection research, revealing how fundamental evaluation flaws can overshadow algorithmic sophistication. Through deliberate experimentation with improper evaluation protocols, we demonstrate that even simple models can achieve deceptively impressive results when basic methodological principles are violated. Our analysis identifies four critical issues plaguing current approaches: (1) pervasive data leakage from improper preprocessing sequences, (2) intentional vagueness in methodological reporting, (3) inadequate temporal validation for transaction data, and (4) metric manipulation through recall optimization at precision's expense. We present a case study showing how a minimal neural network architecture with data leakage outperforms many sophisticated methods reported in literature, achieving 99.9\% recall despite fundamental evaluation flaws. These findings underscore that proper evaluation methodology matters more than model complexity in fraud detection research. The study serves as a cautionary example of how methodological rigor must precede architectural sophistication, with implications for improving research practices across machine learning applications.</description>

      <title>Inequality in the Age of Pseudonymity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04668v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inequality measures such as the Gini coefficient are used to inform and motivate policymaking, and are increasingly applied to digital platforms. We analyze how measures fare in pseudonymous settings that are common in the digital age. One key challenge of such environments is the ability of actors to create fake identities under fictitious false names, also known as ``Sybils.'' While some actors may do so to preserve their privacy, we show that this can inadvertently hamper inequality measurements. As we prove, it is impossible for measures satisfying the literature's canonical set of desired properties to assess the inequality of an economy that may harbor Sybils. We characterize the class of all Sybil-proof measures, and prove that they must satisfy relaxed version of the aforementioned properties. Furthermore, we show that the structure imposed restricts the ability to assess inequality at a fine-grained level. By applying our results, we prove that large classes of popular measures are not Sybil-proof, with the famous Gini coefficient being but one example out of many. Finally, we examine the dynamics leading to the creation of Sybils in digital and traditional settings.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Preserving Personalization in Education: A Federated Recommender System for Student Performance Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10516v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The increasing digitalization of education presents unprecedented opportunities for data-driven personalization, but it also introduces significant challenges to student data privacy. Conventional recommender systems rely on centralized data, a paradigm often incompatible with modern data protection regulations. A novel privacy-preserving recommender system is proposed and evaluated to address this critical issue using Federated Learning (FL). The approach utilizes a Deep Neural Network (DNN) with rich, engineered features from the large-scale ASSISTments educational dataset. A rigorous comparative analysis of federated aggregation strategies was conducted, identifying FedProx as a significantly more stable and effective method for handling heterogeneous student data than the standard FedAvg baseline. The optimized federated model achieves a high-performance F1-Score of 76.28%, corresponding to 92% of the performance of a powerful, centralized XGBoost model. These findings validate that a federated approach can provide highly effective content recommendations without centralizing sensitive student data. Consequently, our work presents a viable and robust solution to the personalization-privacy dilemma in modern educational platforms.</description>

      <title>The Evolving Nature of Latent Spaces: From GANs to Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17383v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper examines the evolving nature of internal representations in generative visual models, focusing on the conceptual and technical shift from GANs and VAEs to diffusion-based architectures. Drawing on Beatrice Fazi's account of synthesis as the amalgamation of distributed representations, we propose a distinction between "synthesis in a strict sense", where a compact latent space wholly determines the generative process, and "synthesis in a broad sense," which characterizes models whose representational labor is distributed across layers. Through close readings of model architectures and a targeted experimental setup that intervenes in layerwise representations, we show how diffusion models fragment the burden of representation and thereby challenge assumptions of unified internal space. By situating these findings within media theoretical frameworks and critically engaging with metaphors such as the latent space and the Platonic Representation Hypothesis, we argue for a reorientation of how generative AI is understood: not as a direct synthesis of content, but as an emergent configuration of specialized processes.</description>

      <title>Matchings Under Biased and Correlated Evaluations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23628v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a two-institution stable matching model in which candidates from two distinct groups are evaluated using partially correlated signals that are group-biased. This extends prior work (which assumes institutions evaluate candidates in an identical manner) to a more realistic setting in which institutions rely on overlapping, but independently processed, criteria. These evaluations could consist of a variety of informative tools such as standardized tests, shared recommendation systems, or AI-based assessments with local noise. Two key parameters govern evaluations: the bias parameter $\beta \in (0,1]$, which models systematic disadvantage faced by one group, and the correlation parameter $\gamma \in [0,1]$, which captures the alignment between institutional rankings. We study the representation ratio, i.e., the ratio of disadvantaged to advantaged candidates selected by the matching process in this setting. Focusing on a regime in which all candidates prefer the same institution, we characterize the large-market equilibrium and derive a closed-form expression for the resulting representation ratio. Prior work shows that when $\gamma = 1$, this ratio scales linearly with $\beta$. In contrast, we show that the representation ratio increases nonlinearly with $\gamma$ and even modest losses in correlation can cause sharp drops in the representation ratio. Our analysis identifies critical $\gamma$-thresholds where institutional selection behavior undergoes discrete transitions, and reveals structural conditions under which evaluator alignment or bias mitigation are most effective. Finally, we show how this framework and results enable interventions for fairness-aware design in decentralized selection systems.</description>

      <title>Leveraging LLM-based agents for social science research: insights from citation network simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03758v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrates their potential to encapsulate the logic and patterns inherent in human behavior simulation by leveraging extensive web data pre-training. However, the boundaries of LLM capabilities in social simulation remain unclear. To further explore the social attributes of LLMs, we introduce the CiteAgent framework, designed to generate citation networks based on human-behavior simulation with LLM-based agents. CiteAgent successfully captures predominant phenomena in real-world citation networks, including power-law distribution, citational distortion, and shrinking diameter. Building on this realistic simulation, we establish two LLM-based research paradigms in social science: LLM-SE (LLM-based Survey Experiment) and LLM-LE (LLM-based Laboratory Experiment). These paradigms facilitate rigorous analyses of citation network phenomena, allowing us to validate and challenge existing theories. Additionally, we extend the research scope of traditional science of science studies through idealized social experiments, with the simulation experiment results providing valuable insights for real-world academic environments. Our work demonstrates the potential of LLMs for advancing science of science research in social science.</description>

      <title>Sub-exponential Growth of New Words and Names Online: A Piecewise Power-Law Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04106v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The diffusion of ideas and language in society has conventionally been described by S-shaped models, such as the logistic curve. However, the role of sub-exponential growth -- a slower-than-exponential pattern known in epidemiology -- has been largely overlooked in broader social phenomena. Here, we present a piecewise power-law model to characterize complex growth curves with a few parameters. We systematically analyzed a large-scale dataset of approximately one billion Japanese blog articles linked to Wikipedia vocabulary, and observed consistent patterns in web search trend data (English, Spanish, and Japanese). Our analysis of 2,963 items, selected for reliable estimation (e.g., sufficient duration/peak, monotonic growth), reveals that 1,625 (55%) diffusion patterns without abrupt level shifts were adequately described by one or two segments. For single-segment curves, we found that (i) the mode of the shape parameter $\alpha$ was near 0.5, indicating prevalent sub-exponential growth; (ii) the peak diffusion scale is primarily determined by the growth rate $R$, with minor contributions from $\alpha$ or the duration $T$; and (iii) $\alpha$ showed a tendency to vary with the nature of the topic, being smaller for niche/local topics and larger for widely shared ones. Furthermore, a micro-behavioral model of outward (stranger) vs. inward (community) contact suggests that $\alpha$ can be interpreted as an index of the preference for outward-oriented communication. These findings suggest that sub-exponential growth is a common pattern of social diffusion, and our model provides a practical framework for consistently describing, comparing, and interpreting complex and diverse growth curves.</description>

      <title>Alternative Fairness and Accuracy Optimization in Criminal Justice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04505v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Algorithmic fairness has grown rapidly as a research area, yet key concepts remain unsettled, especially in criminal justice. We review group, individual, and process fairness and map the conditions under which they conflict. We then develop a simple modification to standard group fairness. Rather than exact parity across protected groups, we minimize a weighted error loss while keeping differences in false negative rates within a small tolerance. This makes solutions easier to find, can raise predictive accuracy, and surfaces the ethical choice of error costs. We situate this proposal within three classes of critique: biased and incomplete data, latent affirmative action, and the explosion of subgroup constraints. Finally, we offer a practical framework for deployment in public decision systems built on three pillars: need-based decisions, Transparency and accountability, and narrowly tailored definitions and solutions. Together, these elements link technical design to legitimacy and provide actionable guidance for agencies that use risk assessment and related tools.</description>
