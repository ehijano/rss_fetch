      <title>Automated Market Making for Energy Sharing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop an axiomatic theory for Automated Market Makers (AMMs) in local energy sharing markets and analyze the Markov Perfect Equilibrium of the resulting economy with a Mean-Field Game. In this game, heterogeneous prosumers solve a Bellman equation to optimize energy consumption, storage, and exchanges. Our axioms identify a class of mechanisms with linear, Lipschitz continuous payment functions, where prices decrease with the aggregate supply-to-demand ratio of energy. We prove that implementing batch execution and concentrated liquidity allows standard design conditions from decentralized finance-quasi-concavity, monotonicity, and homotheticity-to construct AMMs that satisfy our axioms. The resulting AMMs are budget-balanced and achieve ex-ante efficiency, contrasting with the strategy-proof, expost optimal VCG mechanism. Since the AMM implements a Potential Game, we solve its equilibrium by first computing the social planner's optimum and then decentralizing the allocation. Numerical experiments using data from the Paris administrative region suggest that the prosumer community can achieve gains from trade up to 40% relative to the grid-only benchmark.</description>

      <title>Structured Production Systems: Viability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework for analysing equilibrium in structured production systems incorporating a static social division of labour by distinguishing between consumption goods traded in competitive markets and intermediate goods exchanged through bilateral relationships. We develop the concept of viability -- the requirement that all producers earn positive incomes -- as a foundational equilibrium prerequisite.
  Our main theoretical contribution establishes that acyclic production systems -- those without circular conversion processes among goods -- are always viable, a condition that implies coherence. We characterise completely viable systems through input restrictions demonstrating that prohibiting consumption goods as inputs for other consumption goods is necessary for ensuring viable prices exist for all consumption good price vectors. The analysis reveals fundamental relationships between production system architectural design and economic sustainability.
  The introduced framework bridges Leontief-Sraffa production theory with modern network economics while capturing institutional realities of contemporary production systems. This also results in a contribution of the literature on the existence of a positive output price system and the Hawkins-Simon condition.</description>

      <title>Advances in Agentic AI: Back to the Future</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In light of the recent convergence between Agentic AI and our field of Algorithmization, this paper seeks to restore conceptual clarity and provide a structured analytical framework for an increasingly fragmented discourse. First, (a) it examines the contemporary landscape and proposes precise definitions for the key notions involved, ranging from intelligence to Agentic AI. Second, (b) it reviews our prior body of work to contextualize the evolution of methodologies and technological advances developed over the past decade, highlighting their interdependencies and cumulative trajectory. Third, (c) by distinguishing Machine and Learning efforts within the field of Machine Learning (d) it introduces the first Machine in Machine Learning (M1) as the underlying platform enabling today's LLM-based Agentic AI, conceptualized as an extension of B2C information-retrieval user experiences now being repurposed for B2B transformation. Building on this distinction, (e) the white paper develops the notion of the second Machine in Machine Learning (M2) as the architectural prerequisite for holistic, production-grade B2B transformation, characterizing it as Strategies-based Agentic AI and grounding its definition in the structural barriers-to-entry that such systems must overcome to be operationally viable. Further, (f) it offers conceptual and technical insight into what appears to be the first fully realized implementation of an M2. Finally, drawing on the demonstrated accuracy of the two previous decades of professional and academic experience in developing the foundational architectures of Algorithmization, (g) it outlines a forward-looking research and transformation agenda for the coming two decades.</description>

      <title>Recent Contributions to Theories of Discrimination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.05994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.05994v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper surveys the literature on theories of discrimination, focusing mainly on new contributions. Recent theories expand on the traditional taste-based and statistical discrimination frameworks by considering specific features of learning and signaling environments, often using novel information- and mechanism-design language; analyzing learning and decision making by algorithms; and introducing agents with behavioral biases and misspecified beliefs. An online appendix attempts to narrow the gap between the economic perspective on ``theories of discrimination'' and the broader study of discrimination in the social science literature by identifying a class of models of discriminatory institutions, made up of theories of discriminatory social norms and discriminatory institutional design.</description>

      <title>Degree-Weighted Social Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07010v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study social learning in which agents weight neighbors' opinions differently based on their degrees, capturing situations in which agents place more trust in well-connected individuals or, conversely, discount their influence. We derive asymptotic properties of learning outcomes in large stochastic networks and analyze how the weighting rule affects societal wisdom and convergence speed. We find that assigning greater weight to higher-degree neighbors harms wisdom but has a non-monotonic effect on convergence speed, depending on the diversity of views within high- and low-degree groups, highlighting a potential trade-off between convergence speed and wisdom.</description>

      <title>Shill-Proof Auctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00475v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We characterize single-item auction formats that are shill-proof in the sense that a profit-maximizing seller has no incentive to submit shill bids. We distinguish between strong shill-proofness, in which a seller with full knowledge of bidders' valuations can never profit from shilling, and weak shill-proofness, which requires only that the expected equilibrium profit from shilling is non-positive. The Dutch auction (with a suitable reserve) is the unique (revenue-)optimal and strongly shill-proof auction. Any deterministic auction can satisfy only two properties in the set {static, strategy-proof, weakly shill-proof}. Our main results extend to settings with affiliated and interdependent values.</description>

      <title>Lattice operations for the stable set in many-to-many markets via re-equilibration dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21198v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the lattice operations for the (pairwise) stable set in many-to-many matching markets where only path-independence on agents' choice functions is imposed. To do this, we construct Tarski operators defined on the lattices of worker-quasi-stable and firm-quasi-stable matchings. These operators resemble lay-off and vacancy chain dynamics, respectively.</description>

      <title>Targeted Advertising in Elections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10422v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: How does targeted advertising influence electoral outcomes? This paper presents a one-dimensional spatial model of voting in which a privately informed challenger persuades voters to support him over the status quo. I show that targeted advertising enables the challenger to persuade voters with opposing preferences and swing elections decided by such voters; under simple majority, the challenger can defeat the status quo even when it is located at the median voter's bliss point. Ex-ante commitment power is unnecessary -- the challenger succeeds by strategically revealing different pieces of verifiable information to different voters. Publicizing all political ads would mitigate the negative effects of targeted advertising and help voters collectively make the right choice.</description>

      <title>A Characterization of Egalitarian and Proportional Sharing Principles: An Efficient Extension Operator Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24388v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Some well-known solutions for cooperative games with transferable utility (TU-games), such as the Banzhaf value, the Myerson value, and the Aumann-Dreze value, fail to satisfy efficiency. Despite their desirable normative properties, this inefficiency motivates the search for a systematic method to restore efficiency while preserving their underlying normative structure. This paper proposes an efficient extension operator as a general approach to restore efficiency by extending any underlying solution to an efficient one. We consider novel axioms for those operators and characterize the egalitarian surplus sharing method and the proportional sharing method in a unified manner. As applications, we demonstrate the generality of our method by developing an efficient-fair extension of solutions for TU games with communication networks, as well as a variant for TU games with coalition structures.</description>
