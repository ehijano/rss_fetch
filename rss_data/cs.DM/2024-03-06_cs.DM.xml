      <title>Face-hitting Dominating Sets in Planar Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A dominating set of a graph $G$ is a subset $S$ of its vertices such that each vertex of $G$ not in $S$ has a neighbor in $S$. A face-hitting set of a plane graph $G$ is a set $T$ of vertices in $G$ such that every face of $G$ contains at least one vertex of $T$. We show that the vertex-set of every plane (multi-)graph without isolated vertices, self-loops or $2$-faces can be partitioned into two disjoint sets so that both the sets are dominating and face-hitting. We also show that all the three assumptions above are necessary for the conclusion.
  As a corollary, we show that every $n$-vertex simple plane triangulation has a dominating set of size at most $(1 - \alpha)n/2$, where $\alpha n$ is the maximum size of an independent set in the triangulation. Matheson and Tarjan [European J. Combin., 1996] conjectured that every plane triangulation with a sufficiently large number of vertices $n$ has a dominating set of size at most $n / 4$. Currently, the best known general bound for this is by Christiansen, Rotenberg and Rutschmann [SODA, 2024] who showed that every plane triangulation on $n &gt; 10$ vertices has a dominating set of size at most $2n/7$. Our corollary improves their bound for $n$-vertex plane triangulations which contain a maximal independent set of size either less than $2n/7$ or more than $3n/7$.</description>

      <title>The clique chromatic number of sparse random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The clique chromatic number of a graph is the smallest number of colors in a vertex coloring so that no maximal clique is monochromatic. In this paper, we determine the order of magnitude of the clique chromatic number of the random graph G_{n,p} for most edge-probabilities p in the range n^{-2/5} \ll p \ll 1. This resolves open problems and questions of Lichev, Mitsche and Warnke as well as Alon and Krievelevich.
  One major proof difficulty stems from high-degree vertices, which prevent maximal cliques in their neighborhoods: we deal with these vertices by an intricate union bound argument, that combines the probabilistic method with new degree counting arguments in order to enable Janson's inequality. This way we determine the asymptotics of the clique chromatic number of G_{n,p} in some ranges, and discover a surprising new phenomenon that contradicts earlier predictions for edge-probabilities p close to n^{-2/5}.</description>

      <title>Reducing Linear Hadwiger's Conjecture to Coloring Small Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.01633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.01633v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1943, Hadwiger conjectured that every graph with no $K_t$ minor is $(t-1)$-colorable for every $t\ge 1$. In the 1980s, Kostochka and Thomason independently proved that every graph with no $K_t$ minor has average degree $O(t\sqrt{\log t})$ and hence is $O(t\sqrt{\log t})$-colorable. Recently, Norin, Song and the second author showed that every graph with no $K_t$ minor is $O(t(\log t)^{\beta})$-colorable for every $\beta &gt; 1/4$, making the first improvement on the order of magnitude of the $O(t\sqrt{\log t})$ bound. The first main result of this paper is that every graph with no $K_t$ minor is $O(t\log\log t)$-colorable.
  This is a corollary of our main technical result that the chromatic number of a $K_t$-minor-free graph is bounded by $O(t(1+f(G,t)))$ where $f(G,t)$ is the maximum of $\frac{\chi(H)}{a}$ over all $a\ge \frac{t}{\sqrt{\log t}}$ and $K_a$-minor-free subgraphs $H$ of $G$ that are small (i.e. $O(a\log^4 a)$ vertices). This has a number of interesting corollaries. First as mentioned, using the current best-known bounds on coloring small $K_t$-minor-free graphs, we show that $K_t$-minor-free graphs are $O(t\log\log t)$-colorable. Second, it shows that proving Linear Hadwiger's Conjecture (that $K_t$-minor-free graphs are $O(t)$-colorable) reduces to proving it for small graphs. Third, we prove that $K_t$-minor-free graphs with clique number at most $\sqrt{\log t}/ (\log \log t)^2$ are $O(t)$-colorable. This implies our final corollary that Linear Hadwiger's Conjecture holds for $K_r$-free graphs for every fixed $r$.
  One key to proving the main theorem is a new standalone result that every $K_t$-minor-free graph of average degree $d=\Omega(t)$ has a subgraph on $O(t \log^3 t)$ vertices with average degree $\Omega(d)$.</description>
