      <title>MolCRAFT: Structure-Based Drug Design in Continuous Parameter Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative models for structure-based drug design (SBDD) have shown promising results in recent years. Existing works mainly focus on how to generate molecules with higher binding affinity, ignoring the feasibility prerequisites for generated 3D poses and resulting in false positives. We conduct thorough studies on key factors of ill-conformational problems when applying autoregressive methods and diffusion to SBDD, including mode collapse and hybrid continuous-discrete space. In this paper, we introduce \ours, the first SBDD model that operates in the continuous parameter space, together with a novel noise reduced sampling strategy. Empirical results show that our model consistently achieves superior performance in binding affinity with more stable 3D structure, demonstrating our ability to accurately model interatomic interactions. To our best knowledge, MolCRAFT is the first to achieve reference-level Vina Scores (-6.59 kcal/mol), outperforming other strong baselines by a wide margin (-0.84 kcal/mol).

      <title>AAVDiff: Experimental Validation of Enhanced Viability and Diversity in Recombinant Adeno-Associated Virus (AAV) Capsids through Diffusion Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10573v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) vectors have revolutionized gene therapy, but their broad tropism and suboptimal transduction efficiency limit their clinical applications. To overcome these limitations, researchers have focused on designing and screening capsid libraries to identify improved vectors. However, the large sequence space and limited resources present challenges in identifying viable capsid variants. In this study, we propose an end-to-end diffusion model to generate capsid sequences with enhanced viability. Using publicly available AAV2 data, we generated 38,000 diverse AAV2 viral protein (VP) sequences, and evaluated 8,000 for viral selection. The results attested the superiority of our model compared to traditional methods. Additionally, in the absence of AAV9 capsid data, apart from one wild-type sequence, we used the same model to directly generate a number of viable sequences with up to 9 mutations. we transferred the remaining 30,000 samples to the AAV9 domain. Furthermore, we conducted mutagenesis on AAV9 VP hypervariable regions VI and V, contributing to the continuous improvement of the AAV9 VP sequence. This research represents a significant advancement in the design and functional validation of rAAV vectors, offering innovative solutions to enhance specificity and transduction efficiency in gene therapy applications.</description>

      <title>KnotResolver: Tracking self-intersecting filaments in microscopy using directed graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantification of microscopy time-series of in vitro reconstituted motor driven microtubule (MT) transport in 'gliding assays' is typically performed using computational object tracking tools. However, these are limited to non-intersecting and rod-like filaments. Here, we describe a novel computational image-analysis pipeline, KnotResolver, to track image time-series of highly curved self-intersecting looped filaments (knots) by resolving cross-overs. The code integrates filament segmentation and cross-over or 'knot' identification based on directed graph representation, where nodes represent cross-overs and edges represent the path connecting them. The graphs are mapped back to contours and the distance to a reference minimized. We demonstrate the utility of the tool by segmentation and tracking MTs from experiments with dynein-driven wave like filament looping. The accuracy of contour detection is sub-pixel accuracy, and Dice scores indicate a robustness to noise, better than currently used tools. Thus KnotResolver overcomes multiple limitations of widely used tools in microscopy of cytoskeletal filament-like structures.</description>
