      <title>Statistical stability for systems semi-conjugate to pre-piecewise convex or expanding maps with countably many branches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the statistical stability of a class of dynamical systems that are semi-conjugate to pre-piecewise convex or expanding maps with countably many branches. These systems may exhibit complex features such as unbounded derivatives, discontinuities, or infinite Markov partitions, which pose significant challenges for stability analysis. Considering one-parameter families of transformations $\{F_\delta\}_{\delta \in [0,1)}$ with corresponding invariant measures $\{\mu_\delta\}_{\delta \in [0,1)}$, we provide conditions ensuring that $\mu_0$ is statistically stable, i.e., that the map $\delta \mapsto \mu_\delta$ is continuous at $\delta = 0$ in an appropriate topology. Moreover, we establish explicit quantitative estimates for the modulus of continuity of $\mu_\delta$ in terms of the perturbation parameter $\delta$.</description>

      <title>Sofic conditional mean dimension, relative sofic mean dimension and their localizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\pi:(X,G)\to (Y,G) $ be a factor map between continuous actions of a sofic group $G$, we study sofic conditional mean dimension and relative sofic mean dimension introduced in \cite{LBB2} and \cite{LB}, respectively. We obtain that if $\pi$ has non-negative sofic conditional mean dimension (resp. relative sofic mean dimension), then $\pi$ has the maximal zero sofic conditional mean dimension factor (resp. maximal relative zero sofic mean dimension factor).
  Additionally, the local properties of sofic conditional mean dimension and relative sofic mean dimension are studied. We introduce the sofic conditional mean dimension tuples and relative sofic mean dimension tuples, and show that $\pi$ has positive sofic conditional mean dimension (resp. relative sofic mean dimension) if and only if the set of sofic conditional mean dimension tuples (resp. relative sofic mean dimension tuples) is nonempty.</description>

      <title>Dynamics on Bi-Lagrangian Structures and Cherry maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a bi-Lagrangian structure $(\omega,\mathcal{F}_{1},\mathcal{F}_{2})$ on a manifold $M$, that is, $(M,\omega,\mathcal{F}_{1},\mathcal{F}_{2})$ is a bi-Lagrangian manifold. We prolong bi-Lagrangian structures on $M$, and lift a dynamic on its tangent and cotangent bundles in different ways. In some cases, we show that the lifted structures are affine. In the case of the 2-dimensional torus, we find that an extension of the same dynamic on pairs of so-called Cherry vector fields induces a conjugation action on a subset of Cherry maps (circle maps with a flat). Additionally, we define the linear connections for certain Cherry maps.</description>

      <title>False Data-Injection Attack Detection in Cyber-Physical Systems: A Wasserstein Distributionally Robust Reachability Optimization Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cyber-physical system (CPS) is the foundational backbone of modern critical infrastructures, so ensuring its security and resilience against cyber-attacks is of pivotal importance. This paper addresses the challenge of designing anomaly detectors for CPS under false-data injection (FDI) attacks and stochastic disturbances governed by unknown probability distribution. By using the Wasserstein ambiguity set, a prevalent data-driven tool in distributionally robust optimization (DRO), we first propose a new security metric to deal with the absence of disturbance distribution. This metric is designed by asymptotic reachability analysis of state deviations caused by stealthy FDI attacks and disturbance in a distributionally robust confidence set. We then formulate the detector design as a DRO problem that optimizes this security metric while controlling the false alarm rate robustly under a set of distributions. This yields a trade-off between robustness to disturbance and performance degradation under stealthy attacks. The resulting design problem turns out to be a challenging semi-infinite program due to the existence of distributionally robust chance constraints. We derive its exact albeit non-convex reformulation and develop an effective solution algorithm based on sequential optimization. Finally, a case study on a simulated three-tank is illustrated to demonstrate the efficiency of our design in robustifying against unknown disturbance distribution.</description>

      <title>Generalized Quasispecies Model with Time Delays and Periodic Fluctuations in Replication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this research, we present a generalized quasispecies model in which population growth is governed by an arbitrary nonlinear function incorporating time delays. We begin by demonstrating that, under the constant population constraint, the dynamics of the system with time delays remain confined to the invariant manifold for both forward and backward time evolution. Furthermore, we establish that in this modified quasispecies model, defined on a single-peak fitness landscape, in the presence of backward mutation and periodic fluctuations in replication rates and in replication probabilities, the concentration of the $i$th replicating species exhibits a periodic behavior in time independent of the magnitude of the time delays. Specifically, this concentration oscillates between the minimum and maximum values of the probabilities $Q_{ji}$ associated with erroneous replication; that is, the probability that a mutated replicator of type $j$ produces an offspring of type $i$. Moreover, under the presence of time delays and non-constant periodic fluctuations in replication rates, we show that if the probability that a mutated replicator of type $j$ produces an offspring of type $i$ remains constant across all replicators, then the unique positive periodic solution is necessarily a constant solution.</description>

      <title>Manhattan curves in complex dynamics and asymptotic correlation of multiplier spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Manhattan curve for a pair of hyperbolic structures (possibly with cusps) on a given surface is a geometric object that encodes the growth rate of lengths of closed geodesics with respect to the two different hyperbolic metrics. It has been extensively studied as a way to understand geodesics on surfaces, the thermodynamic formalism of the geodesic flows and comparison of hyperbolic metrics.
  Via Sullivan's dictionary, in this paper, we define and study the Manhattan curve for a pair of hyperbolic rational maps on $\mathbb C\mathbb P^1$, and more generally of holomorphic endomorphisms of $\mathbb{C}\mathbb{P}^k$. We discuss several counting results for the multiplier spectrum and show that the Manhattan curve for two holomorphic endomorphisms is related to the correlation number of their multiplier spectra.</description>

      <title>Analyticity of the Hausdorff dimension and metric structures on Misiurewicz families of polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a holomorphic family $(f_\lambda)_{\lambda \in \Lambda}$ of polynomial maps on $\mathbb C$ with the property that a critical point of $f_\lambda$ is persistently preperiodic to a repelling periodic point of $f_\lambda$. Let $\Omega$ be a bounded stable component of $\Lambda$ with the property that, for all $\lambda \in \Omega$, all the other critical points of $f_\lambda$ belong to attracting basins. In this paper, we introduce a dynamically meaningful geometry on $\Omega$ by constructing a natural path metric on $\Omega$ coming from a 2-form $\langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle_G$. Our construction uses thermodynamic formalism. A key ingredient is the spectral gap of adapted transfer operators on suitable Banach spaces, which also implies the analyticity of $\langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle_G$ on the unit tangent bundle of $\Omega$. As part of our construction, we recover a result of Skorulski and Urba\'nski stating that the Hausdorff dimension of the Julia set of $f_\lambda$ varies analytically over $\Omega$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that for a dynamical system on an algebraic variety over $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$ generated by finitely many unramified endomorphisms, it is decidable whether a given point has a finite orbit. This is achieved by establishing an effective upper bound for the size of finite orbits in integral algebraic dynamical systems with unramified morphisms.</description>

      <title>Metric Theory for Continued Fractions with Multiple Large Partial Quotients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The presence of large partial quotients can invalidate many classical limit theorems in the metric theory of continued fractions. A commonly employed strategy to overcome this problem is to discard the largest partial quotient when formulating variant forms of such theorems. However, this method will fail when dealing with at least two large partial quotients. Motivated by recent work of Tan, Tian, and Wang [Sci. China Math., 2023], we investigate the metric theory of real numbers that contain at least $r$ large partial quotients among the first $n$ terms of their continued fraction expansions. Specifically, let $[a_1(x), a_2(x), \ldots ]$ be the continued fraction expansion of a real number $x \in [0, 1)$. We determine the Lebesgue measure and Hausdorff dimension of the following set: \[ F(r, \psi)=\Big\{ x \in [0,1): \exists 1 \leq k_1&lt; \cdots &lt; k_r \leq n, a_{k_i} (x) \geq \psi(n)~(i=1, \ldots, r)\ \text{for i.m.}~n \in \mathbb{N} \Big\}, \] where `i.m.' stands for `infinitely many', $r \geq 1$ and $\psi$ is a positive function defined on $\mathbb{N}$.</description>

      <title>Ergodicity bounds in the Sliced Wasserstein distance for Schur stable autoregressive processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Explicit calculations in dimension one show for Schur stable autoregressive processes with standard Gaussian noise that the ergodic convergence in the Wasserstein-$2$ distance is essentially given by the sum of the mean, which decays exponentially, and the standard deviation, which decays with twice the speed.This paper starts by showing new upper and lower multivariate affine transport bounds for the Wasserstein-$r$ distance for $r$ greater and equal to $1$. These bounds allow to formulate a sufficient (non-Gaussian) affine-ergodic-interpolation condition for the mentioned mean-variance behavior to take place in case of more general Schur stable multivariate autoregressive processes. All ergodic estimates are non-asymptotic with completely explicit constants. The main applications are precise thermalization bounds for Schur stable $\textsf{AR}(p)$ and $\textsf{ARMA}(p,q)$ models in Wasserstein and Sliced Wasserstein distance. In the sequel we establish with the help of coupling techniques explicit upper and lower exponential bounds for more general multivariate Schur stable autoregressive processes. This includes parallel sampling and the convergence of the empiricial means.</description>

      <title>Time-Scale Coupling Between States and Parameters in Recurrent Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study how gating mechanisms in recurrent neural networks (RNNs) implicitly induce adaptive learning-rate behavior, even when training is carried out with a fixed, global learning rate. This effect arises from the coupling between state-space time scales--parametrized by the gates--and parameter-space dynamics during gradient descent. By deriving exact Jacobians for leaky-integrator and gated RNNs, we obtain a first-order expansion that makes explicit how constant, scalar, and multi-dimensional gates reshape gradient propagation, modulate effective step sizes, and introduce anisotropy in parameter updates. These findings reveal that gates not only control memory retention in the hidden states, but also act as data-driven preconditioners that adapt optimization trajectories in parameter space. We further draw formal analogies with learning-rate schedules, momentum, and adaptive methods such as Adam, showing that these optimization behaviors emerge naturally from gating. Numerical experiments confirm the validity of our perturbative analysis, supporting the view that gate-induced corrections remain small while exerting systematic effects on training dynamics. Overall, this work provides a unified dynamical-systems perspective on how gating couples state evolution with parameter updates, explaining why gated architectures achieve robust trainability and stability in practice.</description>

      <title>A Systematic Particle Filter for Estimating Time-Varying Parameters in Advection-Diffusion Equations with Source Terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many real-world systems modeled using partial differential equations (PDEs) involve unknown parameters that must be estimated from limited, noisy system observations. While typically assumed to be constants, some of these unobserved parameters may vary with time. This work proposes a two-phase, offline-online numerical procedure for systematically estimating and quantifying uncertainty in time-varying parameters (TVPs) in time-dependent PDEs, specifically focusing on advection-diffusion models with TVPs involved in the source terms. Numerical results on a set of one-dimensional test problems demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed estimation procedure in tracking unknown TVPs of different forms, while simultaneously estimating variance parameters affecting the TVP evolution model, from partial, noisy observations of the solution at discrete spatial locations and times.</description>

      <title>The Mathematical Theory of Behavioural Swarms: Towards Modelling the Collective Dynamics of Living Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical swarm models, exemplified by the Cucker--Smale framework, provide foundational insights into collective alignment but exhibit fundamental limitations in capturing the adaptive, heterogeneous behaviours intrinsic to living systems. This paper formalises the mathematical theory of \textit{Behavioural Swarms}, a comprehensive framework where each particle's state incorporates a dynamic internal variable, the \textit{activity} that co-evolves with position and velocity through nonlocal interactions. We demonstrate how this approach transcends prior models by integrating adaptive decision-making mechanisms and heterogeneous behavioural states into rigorous differential systems. Through applications in behavioural economics and crowd dynamics, we establish the theory's capacity to predict emergent macroscopic patterns from individual behavioural states. Our critical analysis positions this framework against kinetic theories of active particles and agent-based approaches, revealing distinct advantages for modelling systems where individual agency drives collective outcomes.</description>

      <title>On localization for the alloy-type Anderson-Bernoulli model with long-range hopping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the Anderson localization near the spectral edge for some alloy-type Anderson-Bernoulli model on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ with exponential long-range hopping. This extends the work of Bourgain [Geometric Aspects of Functional Analysis, LNM 1850: 77--99, 2004], in which he pioneered a novel multi-scale analysis to treat Bernoulli random variables. Our proof is mainly based on Bourgain's method. However, to establish the initial scales Green's function estimates, we adapt the approach of Klopp [Comm. Math. Phys, Vol. 232, 125--155, 2002], which is based on the Floquet-Bloch theory and a certain quantitative uncertainty principle. Our proof also applies to an analogues model on $\mathbb{R}^d.$</description>

      <title>A class of generalized Nesterov's accelerated gradient method from dynamical perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a class of \textit{Euler-Lagrange} equations indexed by a pair of parameters ($\alpha,r$) that generalizes Nesterov's accelerated gradient methods for convex ($\alpha=1$) and strongly convex ($\alpha=0$) functions from a continuous-time perspective. This class of equations also serves as an interpolation between the two Nesterov's schemes. The corresponding \textit{Hamiltonian} systems can be integrated via the symplectic Euler scheme with a fixed step-size. Furthermore, we can obtain the convergence rates for these equations ($0&lt;\alpha&lt;1$) that outperform Nesterov's when time is sufficiently large for $\mu$-strongly convex functions, without requiring a priori knowledge of $\mu$. We demonstrate this by constructing a class of Lyapunov functions that also provide a unified framework for Nesterov's schemes for convex and strongly convex functions.</description>

      <title>Necklaces, permutations, and periodic critical orbits for quadratic polynomials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G_n$ denote the $n^{\rm th}$ Gleason polynomial, whose roots correspond to parameters $c$ such that the critical point $0$ is periodic of exact period $n$ under iteration of $z^2 + c$, and let $\bar{G}_n$ denote the reduction of $G_n$ modulo $2$. Buff, Floyd, Koch, and Parry made the surprising observation that the number of real roots of $G_n$ is equal to the number of irreducible factors of $\bar{G}_n$ for all $n$. We provide a bijective proof for this result by first providing explicit bijections between (a) the set of real roots of $G_n$ and the set $\bar{N}(n)$ of equivalence classes of primitive binary necklaces of length $n$ under the inversion map swapping $0$ and $1$; and (b) the set of irreducible factors of $G_n$ modulo 2 and the set $\tilde{N}^+(n)$ of binary necklaces which are either primitive of length $n$ with an even number of $1$'s or primitive of length $n/2$ with an odd number of $1$'s. We then provide an explicit bijection, closely related to Milnor and Thurston's kneading theory, between $\bar{N}(n)$ and $\tilde{N}^+(n)$. In addition, we provide explicit bijections between $\bar{N}(n)$, the set ${\rm CUP}(n)$ of cyclic unimodal permutations of $\{ 1,\ldots,n \}$, and the set $N^-(n)$ of primitive binary necklaces of length $n$ with an odd number of $1$'s.</description>

      <title>On limit sets for geodesics of meromorphic connections</title>

      <description>arXiv:2012.14222v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Meromorphic connections on Riemann surfaces originate and are closely related to the classical theory of linear ordinary differential equations with meromorphic coefficients. Limiting behaviour of geodesics of such connections has been studied by e.g. Abate, Bianchi and Tovena in relation with generalized Poincar\'{e}-Bendixson theorems. At present, it seems still to be unknown whether some of the theoretically possible asymptotic behaviours of such geodesics really exist. In order to fill the gap, we use the branched affine structure induced by a Fuchsian meromorphic connection to present several examples with geodesics having infinitely many self-intersections and quite peculiar omega-limit sets.</description>

      <title>Metallic mean Wang tiles II: the dynamics of an aperiodic computer chip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03197v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a new family $(\mathcal{T}_n)_{n\geq1}$ of aperiodic sets of Wang tiles and we describe the dynamical properties of the set $\Omega_n$ of valid configurations $\mathbb{Z}^2\to\mathcal{T}_n$. The tiles can be defined as the different instances of a square-shaped computer chip whose inputs and outputs are 3-dimensional integer vectors. The family include the Ammann aperiodic set of 16 Wang tiles and gathers the hallmarks of other small aperiodic sets of Wang tiles. Notably, the tiles satisfy additive versions of equations verified by the Kari--Culik aperiodic sets of 14 and 13 Wang tiles. Also configurations in $\Omega_n$ are the codings of a $\mathbb{Z}^2$-action on a 2-dimensional torus like the Jeandel--Rao aperiodic set of 11 Wang tiles. The family broadens the relation between quadratic integers and aperiodic tilings beyond the omnipresent golden ratio as the dynamics of $\Omega_n$ involves the positive root $\beta$ of the polynomial $x^2-nx-1$, also known as the $n$-th metallic mean. We show the existence of an almost one-to-one factor map $\Omega_n\to\mathbb{T}^2$ which commutes with the shift action on $\Omega_n$ with horizontal and vertical translations by $\beta$ on $\mathbb{T}^2$. The factor map can be explicitly defined by the average of the top labels from the same row of tiles as in Kari and Culik examples. The proofs are based on the minimality of $\Omega_n$ (proved in a previous article) and a polygonal partition of $\mathbb{T}^2$ which we show is a Markov partition for the toral $\mathbb{Z}^2$-action. The partition and the sets of Wang tiles are symmetric which makes them, like Penrose tilings, worthy of investigation.</description>

      <title>On the convergence of flow map parameterization methods for whiskered tori in quasi-periodic Hamiltonian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11772v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we obtain an a-posteriori theorem for the existence of partly hyperbolic invariant tori in analytic Hamiltonian systems: autonomous, periodic, and quasi-periodic. The method of proof is based on the convergence of a KAM iterative scheme to solve the invariance equations of tori and their invariant bundles under the framework of the parameterization method. Starting from parameterizations analytic in a complex strip and satisfying their invariance equations approximatly, we derive conditions for the existence of analytic parameterizations in a smaller strip satisfying the invariance equations exactly. The proof relies on the careful treatment of the analyticity loss with each iterative step and on the control of geometric properties of symplectic flavour. We also provide all the necessary explicit constants to perform computer assisted proofs.</description>

Abstract: We study a family of Bowen-Series-like maps associated to any finitely generated Fuchsian group of the first kind with at least one cusp. These maps act on the boundary of the hyperbolic plane in a piecewise manner by generators of the group. We show that the two-dimensional natural extension (reduction map) of the boundary map has a domain of bijectivity and global attractor with a finite rectangular structure, confirming a conjecture of Don Zagier. Our work is based on the construction of a special fundamental polygon, related to the free product structure of the group, whose marking is preserved by "Teichm\"uller deformation."</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.03118v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study homological invariants of \'etale groupoids arising from Smale spaces, continuing on our previous work, but going beyond the stably disconnected case by incorporating resolutions in the space direction. We show that the homology groups defined by Putnam are isomorphic to the Crainic-Moerdijk groupoid homology with integer coefficients. We also show that the K-groups of C*-algebras of stable and unstable equivalence relations have finite rank. For unstably disconnected Smale spaces, we provide a cohomological spectral sequence whose second page is the (stable) homology groups, and converges to the K-groups of the unstable C*-algebra.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.09928v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the homology theory of \'etale groupoids introduced by Crainic and Moerdijk, with particular interest to groupoids arising from topological dynamical systems. We prove a K\"unneth formula for products of groupoids and a Poincar\'e-duality type result for groupoids which are principal with orbits homeomorphic to a Euclidean space. We conclude with a few example computations for systems associated to nilpotent groups such as self-similar actions, and we generalize previous homological calculations by Burke and Putnam for systems which are analogues of solenoids arising from algebraic numbers. For the latter systems, we prove the HK conjecture, even when the resulting groupoid is not ample.</description>

      <title>Conformal measure rigidity and ergodicity of horospherical foliations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13727v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove two main theorems: conformal measure rigidity and ergodicity of horospherical foliations, especially in higher rank. Both theorems are new even for relatively Anosov groups.
  First, we establish a higher rank extension of rigidity theorems of Sullivan, Tukia, Yue, and Kim-Oh for representations of rank one discrete subgroups of divergence type, in terms of the push-forwards of conformal measures via boundary maps. We consider a certain class of higher rank discrete subgroups, which we call hypertransverse subgroups. It includes all rank one discrete subgroups, Anosov subgroups, relatively Anosov subgroups, and their subgroups. Our proof of the rigidity theorem generalizes the idea of Kim-Oh to self-joinings of higher rank hypertransverse subgroups, overcoming the lack of $\mathrm{CAT}(-1)$ geometry on symmetric spaces. In contrast to the work of Sullivan, Tukia, and Yue, our argument is closely related to the study of horospherical foliations.
  We also show the ergodicity of horospherical foliations with respect to Burger-Roblin measures. This generalizes the classical work of Hedlund, Burger, and Roblin in rank one and of Lee-Oh for Borel Ansov subgroups in higher rank. Moreover, we describe the ergodic decomposition of Burger-Roblin measures and Bowen-Margulis-Sullivan measures when a given parabolic subgroup is minimal.</description>

Abstract: We analyse the geometry of the rubber-rolling distribution on the special orthogonal group and show that almost all the normal geodesics of any right-invariant sub-Riemannian metric defined on this distribution are completely integrable. Our argument is an adaptation of the method used to establish integrability of the Riemannian metric arising from the $n$-dimensional rigid body: namely, by exhibiting a Lax pair and bi-Hamiltonian structure for the reduced equations of motion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05941v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of determining self-sustained oscillations in discrete-time linear time-invariant relay feedback systems. Concretely, we are interested in predicting when such a system admits unimodal oscillations, i.e., when the output has a single-peaked period. Under the assumption that the linear system is stable and has an impulse response that is strictly monotonically decreasing on its infinite support, we take a novel approach in using the framework of total positivity to address our main question. It is shown that unimodal self-oscillations can only exist if the number of positive and negative elements in a period coincides. Based on this result, we derive conditions for the existence of such oscillations, determine bounds on their periods, and address the question of uniqueness.</description>

      <title>Effective permeability conditions for diffusive transport through impermeable membranes with gaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10694v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Membranes regulate transport in a wide variety of industrial and biological applications. The microscale geometry of the membrane can significantly affect overall transport through the membrane, but the precise nature of this multiscale coupling is not well characterised in general. Motivated by the application of transport across a bacterial membrane, in this paper we use formal multiscale analysis to derive explicit effective coupling conditions for macroscale transport across a two-dimensional impermeable membrane with periodically spaced gaps, and validate these with numerical simulations. We derive analytic expressions for effective macroscale quantities associated with the membrane, such as the permeability, in terms of the microscale geometry. Our results generalise the classic constitutive membrane coupling conditions to a wider range of membrane geometries and time-varying scenarios. Specifically, we demonstrate that if the exterior concentration varies in time, for membranes with long channels, the transport gains a memory property where the coupling conditions depend on the system history. By applying our effective conditions in the context of small molecule transport through gaps in bacterial membranes called porins, we predict that bacterial membrane permeability is primarily dominated by the thickness of the membrane. Furthermore, we predict how alterations to membrane microstructure, for example via changes to porin expression, might affect overall transport, including when external concentrations vary in time. These results will apply to a broad range of physical applications with similar membrane structures, from medical and industrial filtration to carbon capture.</description>
