      <title>Bounding the Treewidth of Outer $k$-Planar Graphs via Triangulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The treewidth is a structural parameter that measures the tree-likeness of a graph. Many algorithmic and combinatorial results are expressed in terms of the treewidth. In this paper, we study the treewidth of outer $k$-planar graphs, that is, graphs that admit a straight-line drawing where all the vertices lie on a circle, and every edge is crossed by at most $k$ other edges.
  Wood and Telle [New York J. Math., 2007] showed that every outer $k$-planar graph has treewidth at most $3k + 11$ using so-called planar decompositions, and later, Auer et al. [Algorithmica, 2016] proved that the treewidth of outer $1$-planar graphs is at most $3$, which is tight.
  In this paper, we improve the general upper bound to $1.5k + 2$ and give a tight bound of $4$ for $k = 2$. We also establish a lower bound: we show that, for every even $k$, there is an outer $k$-planar graph with treewidth $k+2$. Our new bound immediately implies a better bound on the cop number, which answers an open question of Durocher et al. [GD 2023] in the affirmative.
  Our treewidth bound relies on a new and simple triangulation method for outer $k$-planar graphs that yields few crossings with graph edges per edge of the triangulation. Our method also enables us to obtain a tight upper bound of $k + 2$ for the separation number of outer $k$-planar graphs, improving an upper bound of $2k + 3$ by Chaplick et al. [GD 2017]. We also consider outer min-$k$-planar graphs, a generalization of outer $k$-planar graphs, where we achieve smaller improvements.</description>

      <title>On some randomized algorithms and their evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper considers implementations of some randomized algorithms in connection with obtaining a random $n^2 \times n^2$ Sudoku matrix with programming language C++. For this purpose we describes the set $\Pi_n$ of all $(2n) \times n$ matrices, consisting of elements of the set $\mathbb{Z}_n =\{ 1,2,\ldots ,n\}$, such that every row is a permutation. We emphasize the relationship between these matrices and the $n^2 \times n^2$ Sudoku matrices. An algorithm to obtain random $\Pi_n$ matrices is presented in this paper. Several auxiliary algorithms that are related to the underlying problem have been described. We evaluated all algorithms according to two criteria - probability evaluation, and time for generation of random objects and checking of belonging to a specific set. This evaluations are interesting from both theoretical and practical point of view because they are particularly useful in the analysis of computer programs.</description>

Abstract: We present a deterministic way of finding contraction maps for candidate holographic entanglement entropy inequalities modulo choices due to actual degeneracy. We characterize its complexity and give an argument for the completeness of the contraction map proof method as a necessary and sufficient condition for the validity of an entropy inequality for holographic entanglement.</description>

      <title>Reducing Matroid Optimization to Basis Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In combinatorial optimization, matroids provide one of the most elegant structures for algorithm design. This is perhaps best identified by the Edmonds-Rado theorem relating the success of the simple greedy algorithm to the anatomy of the optimal basis of a matroid [Edm71; Rad57]. As a response, much energy has been devoted to understanding a matroid's favorable computational properties. Yet surprisingly, not much is understood where parallel algorithm design is concerned. Specifically, while prior work has investigated the task of finding an arbitrary basis in parallel computing settings [KUW88], the more complex task of finding the optimal basis remains unexplored. We initiate this study by reexamining Bor\r{u}vka's minimum weight spanning tree algorithm in the language of matroid theory, identifying a new characterization of the optimal basis by way of a matroid's cocircuits as a result. Furthermore, we then combine such insights with special properties of binary matroids to reduce optimization in a binary matroid to the simpler task of search for an arbitrary basis, with only logarithmic asymptotic overhead. Consequentially, we are able to compose our reduction with a known basis search method of [KUW88] to obtain a novel algorithm for finding the optimal basis of a binary matroid with only sublinearly many adaptive rounds of queries to an independence oracle. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first parallel algorithm for matroid optimization to outperform the greedy algorithm in terms of adaptive complexity, for any class of matroid not represented by a graph.</description>

      <title>Sunflowers in set systems with small VC-dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A family of $r$ distinct sets $\{A_1,\ldots, A_r\}$ is an $r$-sunflower if for all $1 \leqslant i &lt; j \leqslant r$ and $1 \leqslant i' &lt; j' \leqslant r$, we have $A_i \cap A_j = A_{i'} \cap A_{j'}$. Erd\H{o}s and Rado conjectured in 1960 that every family $\mathcal{H}$ of $\ell$-element sets of size at least $K(r)^\ell$ contains an $r$-sunflower, where $K(r)$ is some function that depends only on $r$. We prove that if $\mathcal{H}$ is a family of $\ell$-element sets of VC-dimension at most $d$ and $|\mathcal{H}| &gt; (C r (\log d+\log^\ast \ell))^\ell$ for some absolute constant $C &gt; 0$, then $\mathcal{H}$ contains an $r$-sunflower. This improves a recent result of Fox, Pach, and Suk. When $d=1$, we obtain a sharp bound, namely that $|\mathcal{H}| &gt; (r-1)^\ell$ is sufficient. Along the way, we establish a strengthening of the Kahn-Kalai conjecture for set families of bounded VC-dimension, which is of independent interest.</description>

      <title>SSD Set System, Graph Decomposition and Hamiltonian Cycle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we first study what we call Superset-Subset-Disjoint (SSD) set system. Based on properties of SSD set system, we derive the following (I) to (IV):
  (I) For a nonnegative integer $k$ and a graph $G=(V,E)$ with $|V|\ge2$, let $X_1,X_2,\dots,X_q\subsetneq V$ denote all maximal proper subsets of $V$ that induce $k$-edge-connected subgraphs. Then at least one of (a) and (b) holds: (a) $\{X_1,X_2,\dots,X_q\}$ is a partition of $V$; and (b) $V\setminus X_1, V\setminus X_2,\dots,V\setminus X_q$ are pairwise disjoint.
  (II) For a strongly-connected (i.e., $k=1$) digraph $G$, we show that whether $V$ is in (a) and/or (b) can be decided in $O(n+m)$ time and that we can generate all such $X_1,X_2,\dots,X_q$ in $O(n+m+|X_1|+|X_2|+\dots+|X_q|)$ time, where $n=|V|$ and $m=|E|$.
  (III) For a digraph $G$, we can enumerate in linear delay all vertex subsets of $V$ that induce strongly-connected subgraphs.
  (IV) A digraph is Hamiltonian if there is a spanning subgraph that is strongly-connected and in the case (a).</description>

      <title>Longest cycles in vertex-transitive and highly connected graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present progress on two old conjectures about longest cycles in graphs. The first conjecture, due to Thomassen from 1978, states that apart from a finite number of exceptions, all connected vertex-transitive graphs contain a Hamiltonian cycle. The second conjecture, due to Smith from 1984, states that for $r\ge 2$ in every $r$-connected graph any two longest cycles intersect in at least $r$ vertices. In this paper, we prove a new lemma about the intersection of longest cycles in a graph which can be used to improve the best known bounds towards both of the aforementioned conjectures: First, we show that every connected vertex-transitive graph on $n\geq 3$ vertices contains a cycle of length at least $\Omega(n^{13/21})$, improving on $\Omega(n^{3/5})$ from [De Vos, arXiv:2302:04255, 2023]. Second, we show that in every $r$-connected graph with $r\geq 2$, any two longest cycles meet in at least $\Omega(r^{5/8})$ vertices, improving on $\Omega(r^{3/5})$ from [Chen, Faudree and Gould, J. Combin. Theory, Ser.~ B, 1998]. Our proof combines combinatorial arguments, computer-search and linear programming.</description>

Abstract: We consider a graph coloring algorithm that processes vertices in order taken uniformly at random and assigns colors to them using First-Fit strategy. We show that this algorithm uses, in expectation, at most $(1 + o(1))\cdot \ln n \,/\, \ln\ln n$ different colors to color any forest with $n$ vertices. We also construct a family of forests that shows that this bound is best possible.</description>

      <title>Progress towards the two-thirds conjecture on locating-total dominating sets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.14178v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study upper bounds on the size of optimum locating-total dominating sets in graphs. A set $S$ of vertices of a graph $G$ is a locating-total dominating set if every vertex of $G$ has a neighbor in $S$, and if any two vertices outside $S$ have distinct neighborhoods within $S$. The smallest size of such a set is denoted by $\gamma^L_t(G)$. It has been conjectured that $\gamma^L_t(G)\leq\frac{2n}{3}$ holds for every twin-free graph $G$ of order $n$ without isolated vertices. We prove that the conjecture holds for cobipartite graphs, split graphs, block graphs and subcubic graphs.</description>

      <title>A Diffusion Model Framework for Unsupervised Neural Combinatorial Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01661v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning to sample from intractable distributions over discrete sets without relying on corresponding training data is a central problem in a wide range of fields, including Combinatorial Optimization. Currently, popular deep learning-based approaches rely primarily on generative models that yield exact sample likelihoods. This work introduces a method that lifts this restriction and opens the possibility to employ highly expressive latent variable models like diffusion models. Our approach is conceptually based on a loss that upper bounds the reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence and evades the requirement of exact sample likelihoods. We experimentally validate our approach in data-free Combinatorial Optimization and demonstrate that our method achieves a new state-of-the-art on a wide range of benchmark problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12961v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A strict lower bound for the diameter of a symmetric graph is proposed, which is calculable with the order ($n$) and other local parameters of the graph such as the degree, even girth $g$ ($\geq 4$), and number of $g$-cycles traversing a vertex, which are easily determined by inspecting a small portion of the graph (unless the girth is large). It is applied to the symmetric Cayley graphs of the Rubik's Cube groups of various sizes and metrics, yielding slightly tighter lower bounds than those of random $k$-regular graphs proposed by Bollob\'{a}s and de la Vega, which range from 60% to 77% of the correct diameters of large-$n$ graphs.</description>

      <title>The Bidirected Cut Relaxation for Steiner Tree has Integrality Gap Smaller than 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19905v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Steiner tree problem is one of the most prominent problems in network design. Given an edge-weighted undirected graph and a subset of the vertices, called terminals, the task is to compute a minimum-weight tree containing all terminals (and possibly further vertices). The best-known approximation algorithms for Steiner tree involve enumeration of a (polynomial but) very large number of candidate components and are therefore slow in practice.
  A promising ingredient for the design of fast and accurate approximation algorithms for Steiner tree is the bidirected cut relaxation (BCR): bidirect all edges, choose an arbitrary terminal as a root, and enforce that each cut containing some terminal but not the root has one unit of fractional edges leaving it. BCR is known to be integral in the spanning tree case [Edmonds'67], i.e., when all the vertices are terminals. For general instances, however, it was not even known whether the integrality gap of BCR is better than the integrality gap of the natural undirected relaxation, which is exactly 2. We resolve this question by proving an upper bound of 1.9988 on the integrality gap of BCR.</description>
