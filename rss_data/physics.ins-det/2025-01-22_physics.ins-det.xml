      <title>Automated DC Voltage and DC Resistance Real-time Multiple Standard for Artifact Calibration of Calibrators and multimeters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An automated temperature-controlled electrical DC voltage and DC resistance multiple reference standard (MRS) has been developed by Measurements International (MI) with the scientific support from the Istituto Nazionale di Ricerca Metrologica (INRIM). The MRS includes a 10 V, a 1 {\Omega}, and a 10 k{\Omega} standards selectable via a switch unit. This setup allows the artifact calibration of high-end calibrators and multimeters used in low-frequency electrical measurements. The two resistors are high-stability standards from MI, while the 10 V standard is based on a low-noise circuit developed by INRIM in collaboration with MI. A key innovation is the internal real-time clock calendar, which displays the calibration values of the MRS standards and their updated values internally calculated. This ensures reliable use of the MRS standards over extended periods between calibrations, effectively minimizing uncertainties due to their drift. The standards are housed in a thermal box, minimizing temperature variations. The MRS standards meet the uncertainty requirements defined by calibrators and multimeters manufacturers for artifact calibration and can also serve as laboratory references or travelling standards for interlaboratory comparisons (ILCs). MI is currently commercializing the MRS.</description>

      <title>THz Metal-Mesh Bandpass Filters with Diamond-shaped Apertures for Sensitive THz Receivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present high-performance terahertz (THz) metal-mesh bandpass filters developed to mitigate direct detection effects in sensitive THz receivers based on superconducting hot-electron bolometer (HEB) mixers. These metal-mesh filters are free-standing 5-micron thick sheets of copper perforated with a periodic array of diamond-shaped apertures. The simple aperture design minimizes the effect of fabrication (rounding) errors on filter performance, allowing precise engineering of the center frequency (1.5-5.5 THz) while maintaining high (&gt;90 %) peak power transmission at normal incidence and a relatively narrow bandwidth of 5-15 %. Based on finite-element method (FEM) simulation results, we provide simple design equations that can be used for rapid design with high accuracy. The measured transmission profiles of 1.9-THz, 2.5-THz, and 4.7-THz filters show excellent agreement with the simulation results. These filters are compatible with cryogenic operation and can substantially reduce the direct detection effects in HEB mixers.</description>

      <title>The energy dependence of cluster size and its physical processes in the proton measurement with TimePix3 silicon detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated the energy dependence of the number of triggered pixels, or cluster size, when charged particles are detected using the TimePix3 detector with a silicon sensor. We measured protons in the range of 1.5~3.3 MeV from a Pelletron accelerator at RIKEN using a TimePix3 detector with a 500 um-thick silicon sensor. We determined from the experimental results a cluster size comprised between 30 and 80 pixels. To understand the physical process that produces large cluster images and its energy dependence, we simulated the charge carrier drifts in the sensor, assuming the incidence of a proton in the detector. The cluster sizes estimated in the simulation were smaller than those observed in the experiment, and remained constant across the entire energy range, when thermal diffusion and charge carriers self-repulsion were considered as the factors of the cluster image formation. In addition, we discovered that the size of the cluster image and its energy dependence observed in the experiment could be well explained when considering that the TimePix3 detector is sensitive to the transient induced charges, allowing even pixels that do not collect the charge carriers to trigger. We conclude that the cluster size measurement is a promising method for evaluating the energy deposited by a charged particle in the TimePix3 detector.</description>

      <title>Improved and automated krypton assay for low-background xenon detectors with Auto-RGMS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-sensitive quantification of trace radioactive krypton-85 is essential for low-background experiments, particularly for next-generation searches of galactic dark matter and neutrino physics using xenon-based time projection chambers (TPCs). While the rare gas mass spectrometer (RGMS) represents the current state-of-the-art for krypton detection in the field, we are developing a fully automated system (Auto-RGMS) to overcome the limitations of its manual operation. Auto-RGMS incorporates a robust control system for rapid measurements and minimized systematic uncertainties. A primary goal is to reach detection limits in the low parts-per-quadrillion (ppq) range for natural krypton by improving the chromatography stage to enhance the separation of krypton from xenon. Investigations into various adsorbent materials identified two candidates. HayeSep Q offers a 12-fold improvement in chromatographic resolution for xenon/krypton separation compared to the previously used adsorbent. Alternatively, HayeSep D provides a more limited improvement in resolution while allowing a higher measurement frequency because of its moderate retention-induced contamination after each measurement. By automating krypton assays and achieving ppq sensitivity, Auto-RGMS will be an indispensable tool for next-generation detectors, maximizing their scientific potential.</description>

      <title>Pontecorvo Reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pontecorvo reactions are rare antinucleon annihilation processes that are forbidden on free nucleons but allowed on nucleons bound within nuclei. The interest in studying this phenomenon lies in its potential to provide insights into the annihilation mechanism and, particularly, the short-distance dynamics between nucleons within the nucleus. Some measurements were performed in the past at CERN's Low Energy Antiproton Ring (LEAR) using antiprotons annihilating on a deuterium target. However, no data exist for targets consisting of three nucleons, such as $^3\text{He}$ or $^3\text{H}$. The measurement of the rate of the process $\overline{p} \, ^3\text{He} \rightarrow p + n$ would allow for distinguishing between different theoretical models whose predictions vary by 1-2 orders of magnitude. The ASACUSA collaboration is studying the feasibility of performing this measurement at CERN's ELENA-AD. A preliminary design of a simple measurement apparatus, utilizing plastic scintillators and degrader layers, is presented, together with Monte Carlo simulations assessing its efficiency in measuring the branching ratios of the aforementioned reaction and rejecting background from more probable typical antiproton annihilations in the target.</description>

      <title>Broadband, Dead-Time-Free Spectrometer Using RFSoC for WISP Dark Matter Searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-light dark matter candidates, such as axions and dark photons, particularly within the mass range of $\mu$eV to meV, have garnered significant research interest. However, the effectiveness of existing experiments is often hindered by the narrow bandwidths of conventional spectrometers. This study presents a novel spectrometer solution based on a RFSoC, which integrates a high-speed data converter, field programmable gate array (FPGA), and a CPU within a single chip. The spectrometer's programmable logic implements an optimized fast Fourier transform (FFT) that minimizes memory usage, enabling an instantaneous bandwidth of 4 GHz with a frequency resolution of 16 kHz. This configuration achieves more than 99.6% time efficiency, effectively doubling search efficiency, compared with traditional approaches. This paper provides a comprehensive description of the hardware architecture, FPGA firmware, and software implementation, with a focus on the resource-efficient pipelined FFT algorithm. Performance validation results are also presented, demonstrating the accuracy and time efficiency of the developed spectrometer, highlighting its potential for advancing dark matter search.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Microscopy Experiments through Large Language Model Agents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has accelerated the development of self-driving laboratories (SDLs) for materials research. Despite their transformative potential, current SDL implementations rely on rigid, predefined protocols that limit their adaptability to dynamic experimental scenarios across different labs. A significant challenge persists in measuring how effectively AI agents can replicate the adaptive decision-making and experimental intuition of expert scientists. Here, we introduce AILA (Artificially Intelligent Lab Assistant), a framework that automates atomic force microscopy (AFM) through LLM-driven agents. Using AFM as an experimental testbed, we develop AFMBench-a comprehensive evaluation suite that challenges AI agents based on language models like GPT-4o and GPT-3.5 to perform tasks spanning the scientific workflow: from experimental design to results analysis. Our systematic assessment shows that state-of-the-art language models struggle even with basic tasks such as documentation retrieval, leading to a significant decline in performance in multi-agent coordination scenarios. Further, we observe that LLMs exhibit a tendency to not adhere to instructions or even divagate to additional tasks beyond the original request, raising serious concerns regarding safety alignment aspects of AI agents for SDLs. Finally, we demonstrate the application of AILA on increasingly complex experiments open-ended experiments: automated AFM calibration, high-resolution feature detection, and mechanical property measurement. Our findings emphasize the necessity for stringent benchmarking protocols before deploying AI agents as laboratory assistants across scientific disciplines.</description>

      <title>Stochastic resonance in Schmitt trigger and its application towards weak signal detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores stochastic resonance (SR) in a Schmitt trigger circuit and its application to weak signal detection. SR, a phenomenon where noise synchronizes with weak signals to enhance detectability, was demonstrated using a custom-designed bi-stable Schmitt trigger system. The circuit's bi-stability was validated through hysteresis curve analysis, confirming its suitability for SR studies. Experimental results revealed SR behavior by analyzing signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) responses to noise amplitude variations. Detection experiments were conducted to determine frequency and amplitude of damping sinusoidal pulses. Frequency detection proved effective, albeit with limitations at low frequencies, while amplitude detection faced challenges due to mathematical complexities. Nonetheless, the study highlights SR's potential for weak signal detection, with proposed enhancements to improve detection accuracy. This work underscores the adaptability of classical SR principles to practical detection systems and suggests future applications in advanced detection technologies, including quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Status of the Short-Baseline Near Detector at Fermilab</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Short-Baseline Near Detector (SBND) is one of three Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LArTPC) neutrino detectors positioned along the axis of the Booster Neutrino Beam (BNB) at Fermilab, as part of the Short-Baseline Neutrino (SBN) Program. The detector is currently being commissioned and is expected to take neutrino data this year. SBND is characterized by superb imaging capabilities and will record over a million neutrino interactions per year. Thanks to its unique combination of measurement resolution and statistics, SBND will carry out a rich program of neutrino interaction measurements and novel searches for physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM). It will enable the potential of the overall SBN sterile neutrino program by performing a precise characterization of the unoscillated event rate, and constraining BNB flux and neutrino-argon cross-section systematic uncertainties. In this proceedings, the physics reach, current status, and future prospects of SBND are discussed and early data is presented.</description>

      <title>Tunable coherence laser interferometry: demonstrating 40dB of straylight suppression and compatibility with resonant optical cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A major limitation of laser interferometers using continuous wave lasers are parasitic light fields, such as ghost beams, scattered or stray light, which can cause non-linear noise. This is especially relevant for laser interferometric ground-based gravitational wave detectors. Increasing their sensitivity, particularly at frequencies below 10 Hz, is threatened by the influence of parasitic photons. These can up-convert low-frequency disturbances into phase and amplitude noise inside the relevant measurement band. By artificially tuning the coherence of the lasers, using pseudo-random-noise (PRN) phase modulations, this influence of parasitic fields can be suppressed. As it relies on these fields traveling different paths, it does not sacrifice the coherence for the intentional interference. We demonstrate the feasibility of this technique experimentally, achieving noise suppression levels of 40 dB in a Michelson interferometer with an artificial coherence length below 30 cm. We probe how the suppression depends on the delay mismatch and length of the PRN sequence. We also prove that optical resonators can be operated in the presence of PRN modulation by measuring the behavior of a linear cavity with and without such a modulation. By matching the resonators round-trip length and the PRN sequence repetition length, the classic response is recovered.</description>

      <title>Mechanical strength investigations of the APPLE-X undulator using Fiber Bragg Grating strain measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The SPARC_LAB facility at the INFN LNF is being upgraded to accommodate a new user facility as part of the SABINA project. It was set up to investigate the feasibility of an ultra-brilliant photoinjector and to perform FEL experiments. The new beamline is equipped with three APPLE-X undulators acting as amplifiers to deliver IR/THz radiation with photon pulses in the ps range, with energy of tens of uJ, and with linear, circular, or elliptical polarization. The APPLE-X guarantees to vary the gap amplitude between the magnets arrays and their relative phase. The entire system has been designed from scratch, and a structural analysis has been carried out. Once they were in Frascati, in collaboration with ENEA, a further investigation campaign was launched on the mechanical, using strain measurements based on optical methods. FBG sensors were suitable for these tests due to their immunity to electromagnetic noise. They consist of a phase grating inscribed in the core of a single-mode fiber, whose Bragg-diffracted light propagates back along the fiber. If bonded to the mechanical structure, they can be used as strain sensors. By following the variations in the scattered spectrum, it is possible to perform strain measurements. Using multiple FBGs applied at selected locations on the undulator, several measurements were while opening and closing the gap or changing the phase, but also by studying the quiescent response as a function of the ambient temperature. The results of these tests show that there is a clear deformation of the structure related to the temperature changes and magnetic forces, but the magnitude of this deformation is well within the tolerances required for the functionality of the undulator since they are compatible or lower with respect to the one calculated with the finite elements methods. The tests confirm the reliability of the mechanical structure.</description>

      <title>AstroPix: A Pixelated HVCMOS Sensor for Space-Based Gamma-Ray Measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A next-generation medium-energy gamma-ray telescope targeting the MeV range would address open questions in astrophysics regarding how extreme conditions accelerate cosmic-ray particles, produce relativistic jet outflows, and more. One concept, AMEGO-X, relies upon the mission-enabling CMOS Monolithic Active Pixel Sensor silicon chip AstroPix. AstroPix is designed for space-based use, featuring low noise, low power consumption, and high scalability. Desired performance of the device include an energy resolution of 5 keV (or 10% FWHM) at 122 keV and a dynamic range per-pixel of 25-700 keV, enabled by the addition of a high-voltage bias to each pixel which supports a depletion depth of 500 um. This work reports on the status of the AstroPix development process with emphasis on the current version under test, version three (v3), and highlights of version two (v2). Version 3 achieves energy resolution of 10.4 +\- 3.2 % at 59.5 keV and 94 +\- 6 um depletion in a low-resistivity test silicon substrate.</description>

      <title>Self-aligned multilayered nitrogen vacancy diamond nanoparticles for high spatial resolution magnetometry of microelectronic currents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nitrogen Vacancy diamond nanoparticles (NVNPs) are increasingly integrated with methods for optical detection of magnetic resonance (ODMR), providing new opportunities in magnetic characterization that span the visualization of magnetic fields in microelectronic circuits, environmental sensing and biology. However, only a small number of studies utilize aggregates of NVNPs for surface-wide magnetometry being that spin orientations in aggregate NVNPs are inherently misaligned, precluding their use for proper magnetic field detection compared with expensive monocrystalline diamonds. A postprocessing method for layering NVNPs with aligned NV center orientations can potentially facilitate superior NV magnetometry by allowing sensitive detection combined with simplified probe preparation. We present a novel technology for creating densely stacked monolayers of NVNP with inherent interlayer alignment for sensitive measurement of local magnetic field perturbations in microelectronic traces. We establish spatial characteristics of deposited aggregates and demonstrate their ability to capture magnetic dipoles from conducting microwires via ODMR. Our approach forms a novel accessible protocol that can be used for broad applications in micromagnetometry.</description>

      <title>Flavor-Dependent Long-Range Neutrino Interactions in DUNE and T2HK: Synergy Breeds Power</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discovering new neutrino interactions would provide evidence of physics beyond the Standard Model. We focus on flavor-dependent long-range neutrino interactions mediated by ultra-light mediators (masses below $10^{-10}$ eV) from lepton-number gauge symmetries $L_e-L_\mu$, $L_e-L_\tau$, and $L_\mu-L_\tau$. These interactions, sourced by electrons and neutrons in the Earth, Moon, Sun, Milky Way, and the local Universe, could modify neutrino oscillation probabilities. The upcoming long-baseline experiments, DUNE and T2HK, with their large statistics, reduced systematic uncertainties, and well-characterized neutrino beams, will probe these interactions. We forecast that, while individually DUNE and T2HK could constrain these long-range neutrino interactions, their combination lifts parameter degeneracies that weaken individual sensitivity and provides stronger constraints.</description>

      <title>A look-up table algorithm to model radiation damage effects in Monte Carlo events for HL-LHC experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radiation damage significantly impacts the performance of silicon tracking detectors in Large Hadron Collider (LHC) experiments such as ATLAS and CMS, with signal reduction being the most critical effect. Adjusting sensor bias voltage and detection thresholds can help mitigate these effects, but generating simulated data that accurately mirror the performance evolution with the accumulation of luminosity, hence fluence, is crucial. The ATLAS collaboration has developed and implemented algorithms to correct simulated Monte Carlo (MC) events for radiation damage effects, achieving impressive agreement between collision data and simulated events. In preparation for the high-luminosity phase (HL-LHC), the demand for a faster ATLAS MC production algorithm becomes imperative due to escalating collision, events, tracks, and particle hit rates, imposing stringent constraints on available computing resources. This article outlines the philosophy behind the new algorithm, its implementation strategy, and the essential components involved. The results from closure tests indicate that the events simulated using the new algorithm agree with fully simulated events at the level of few \%. The first tests on computing performance show that the new algorithm is as fast as it is when no radiation damage corrections are applied.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: ESSnuSB (the European Spallation neutrino Super Beam) is a design study for a long-baseline neutrino experiment to precisely measure the CP violation in the leptonic sector, at the second neutrino oscillation maximum, using a beam driven by the uniquely powerful ESS linear accelerator. The ESSnuSB CDR showed that after 10 years, about 72% of the possible CP violating phase range will be covered with 5 sigma C.L. to reject the no CP violation hypothesis. The expected precision for the CP violating phase is better than 8 degrees for all allowed values, making it the most precise proposed experiment in the field. The extension project, ESSnuSB+, aims in designing two new facilities, a Low Energy nuSTORM and a Low Energy Monitored Neutrino Beam to use them to precisely measure the neutrino-nucleus cross-section in the energy range of 0.2 to 0.6 GeV. A new water Cherenkov detector will also be designed to measure cross sections and serve to explore the sterile neutrino case.</description>

      <title>Characterization of silicon photomultipliers for their application in muon scattering tomography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.05727v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Muon scattering tomography is a non-destructive technique used to image different materials by utilizing natural cosmic ray muons. Typically it requires position-sensitive detectors with a sub-millimeter resolution to effectively distinguish high-$Z$ materials in a compact system. The plastic scintillating fiber detector is a feasible candidate and is currently being designed with one-dimensional silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) readout. In this work, we constructed experimental setups to characterize three different SiPMs from the NDL, SensL, and HPK manufacturers for optimal performance of the scintillating fiber detector. The breakdown voltage, temperature compensation factor, dark noise, and photodetection efficiency of each SiPM are evaluated and summarized. Among the SiPMs tested, the HPK SiPM demonstrated the lowest dark count rate and crosstalk probability while exhibiting the best photodetection efficiency response at the emission wavelengths of the scintillating fibers. This makes the HPK SiPM particularly well-suited to meet the requirements of the detector and serves as a reference for further customization of the one-dimensional SiPM array.</description>

      <title>Results for pixel and strip centimeter-scale AC-LGAD sensors with a 120 GeV proton beam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09928v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the results of an extensive evaluation of strip and pixel AC-LGAD sensors tested with a 120 GeV proton beam, focusing on the influence of design parameters on the sensor temporal and spatial resolutions. Results show that reducing the thickness of pixel sensors significantly enhances their time resolution, with 20 $\mu$m-thick sensors achieving around 20 ps. Uniform performance is attainable with optimized sheet resistance, making these sensors ideal for future timing detectors. Conversely, 20 $\mu$m-thick strip sensors exhibit higher jitter than similar pixel sensors, negatively impacting time resolution, despite reduced Landau fluctuations with respect to the 50 $\mu$m-thick versions. Additionally, it is observed that a low resistivity in strip sensors limits signal size and time resolution, whereas higher resistivity improves performance. This study highlights the importance of tuning the n$^{+}$ sheet resistance and suggests that further improvements should target specific applications like the Electron-Ion Collider or other future collider experiments. In addition, the detailed performance of four AC-LGADs sensor designs is reported as examples of possible candidates for specific detector applications. These advancements position AC-LGADs as promising candidates for future 4D tracking systems, pending the development of specialized readout electronics.</description>

      <title>Exploring Scintillators and Cherenkov Radiators for MIP Timing Detectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06977v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article presents the timing performance of materials with fast light emission, tested as Minimum Ionizing Particle detectors using 150 GeV hadron beams in Monte Carlo simulations and at the CERN SPS North Area. Pixels of cross-section 2 x 2 mm2 or 3 x 3 mm2 and length of 3 or 10 mm were coupled to Hamamatsu SiPM and read out by fast high-frequency electronics. Materials whose timing performance relies on Cherenkov emission, namely BGSO, PWO, and PbF2, achieved time resolutions in the range 24-36ps. Scintillators as L(Y)SO:Ce, GAGG, and BaF2 reached below 15 ps, the best topping at 12.1 +/- 0.4 ps. These fast materials are compared to LYSO and their additional benefit is discussed. Given the promising results of BaF2, the study is completed with measurements of the scintillation properties of a set doped with yttrium to quench the slow light emission.</description>

      <title>Non-magnetic glass-fiber cryostat for MADMAX prototype tests</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12818v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: MADMAX, an axion dark matter search experiment, is currently in the prototype testing phase. Its working principle is based on the conversion of axions in a magnetic field into photons. This signal is then enhanced by a booster made of dielectric disks placed in front of a mirror. In order to test MADMAX prototypes at cryogenic temperatures in a magnetic field parallel to the disks, a new G-10 glass-fiber cryostat of 0.25 m$^3$ inner volume was designed, tested and used in a CERN magnet. The design allows to minimise cost as well as cooling down and warming up times. Using continuous circulation flow of gaseous helium, the MADMAX prototype was cooled down reproducibly to temperatures below 10 K for more than 24 hours. This procedure allowed, for the first time, to perform a calibration of the booster response and to run a dark matter axion search in a magnetic field at low temperatures. This novel type of cryostat, with a low manufacturing cost, fast and easy to operate, could be used for other purposes beyond MADMAX.</description>

      <title>The Fast Stochastic Matching Pursuit for Neutrino and Dark Matter Experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03156v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Photomultiplier tubes (PMT) are widely deployed at neutrino and dark matter experiments for photon counting. When multiple photons hit a PMT consecutively, their photo-electron (PE) pulses pile up to hinder the precise measurements of the count and timings. We introduce Fast Stochastic Matching Pursuit (FSMP) to analyze the PMT signal waveforms into individual PEs with the strategy of reversible-jump Markov-chain Monte Carlo. We demonstrate that FSMP improves the energy and time resolution of PMT-based experiments, gains acceleration on GPUs and is extensible to microchannel-plate (MCP) PMTs with jumbo-charge outputs. In the condition of our laboratory characterization of 8-inch MCP-PMTs, FSMP improves the energy resolution by up to 10% from the long-serving method of waveform integration.</description>

Abstract: JSNS$^2$ searches for short baseline neutrino oscillations with a baseline of 24~meters and a target of 17~tonnes of the Gd-loaded liquid scintillator. The correct algorithm on the event reconstruction of events, which determines the position and energy of neutrino interactions in the detector, are essential for the physics analysis of the data from the experiment. Therefore, the performance of the event reconstruction is carefully checked with calibrations using $^{252}$Cf source. This manuscript describes the methodology and the performance of the event reconstruction.</description>

      <title>First Pilot Tests of Compton Imaging and Boron Concentration Measurements in BNCT Using i-TED</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05687v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dosimetry in BNCT poses significant challenges due to the indirect effect of neutrons interacting with elements within the body and uncertainties associated with the uptake of boron compounds used in clinical practice. Current treatment planning relies on unconventional estimates of boron tumor uptake derived from prior PET scans and thus, an online boron-uptake monitor would be highly convenient. This work presents the first pilot experiments carried out at ILL-Grenoble with the high-efficiency Compton camera i-TED, hereby aiming at demonstrating its applicability for BNCT dosimetry by introducing real-time measurement of the boron concentration and imaging capabilities of spatial dose distribution. In this experiment, we measured the $^{10}$B uptake of different cancer cells of tongue squamous cell carcinoma, malignant melanoma and glioblastoma treated with BPA (80~ppm of $^{10}$B). The samples were irradiated with the thermal neutron spectrum of ILL-Grenoble and the 478keV $\gamma$-rays from the $^{7}$Li de-excitation after the neutron-boron reaction were registered both with the Compton imager and the high-sensitivity FIPPS HPGe array. These series of measurements allowed us to demonstrate the imaging capabilities of the Compton imaging device for the 478 keV $\gamma$-rays of interest for dosimetry in BNCT, as well as to assess its sensitivity, which was found to be below 1 $\mu$g of $^{10}$B.</description>
