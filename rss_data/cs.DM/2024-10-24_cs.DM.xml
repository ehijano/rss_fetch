      <title>ELECTRE TRI-nB, pseudo-disjunctive: axiomatic and combinatorial results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ELECTRE TRI-nB is a method designed to sort alternatives evaluated on several attributes into ordered categories. It is an extension of ELECTRE TRI-B, using several limiting profiles, instead of just one, to delimit each category. ELECTRE TRI-nB comes in two flavours: pseudo-conjunctive and pseudo-disjunctive. In a previous paper we have characterized the ordered partitions that can be obtained with ELECTRE TRI-nB, pseudo-conjunctive, using a simple axiom called linearity. The present paper is dedicated to the axiomatic analysis of ELECTRE TRI-nB, pseudo-disjunctive. It also provides some combinatorial results.</description>

      <title>Locally seeded embeddings, and Ramsey numbers of bipartite graphs with sublinear bandwidth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A seminal result of Lee asserts that the Ramsey number of any bipartite $d$-degenerate graph $H$ satisfies $\log r(H) = \log n + O(d)$. In particular, this bound applies to every bipartite graph of maximal degree $\Delta$. It remains a compelling challenge to identify conditions that guarantee that an $n$-vertex graph $H$ has Ramsey number linear in $n$, independently of $\Delta$. Our contribution is a characterization of bipartite graphs with linear-size Ramsey numbers in terms of graph bandwidth, a notion of local connectivity. We prove that for any $n$-vertex bipartite graph $H$ with maximal degree at most $\Delta$ and bandwidth $b(H)$ at most $\exp(-C\Delta\log\Delta)\,n$, we have $\log r(H) = \log n + O(1)$. This characterization is nearly optimal: for every $\Delta$ there exists an $n$-vertex bipartite graph $H$ of degree at most $\Delta$ and $b(H) \leq \exp(-c\Delta)\,n$, such that $\log r(H) = \log n + \Omega(\Delta)$. We also provide bounds interpolating between these two bandwidth regimes.</description>

      <title>Counting Locally Optimal Tours in the TSP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the problem of counting the number of 2-optimal tours in instances of the Travelling Salesperson Problem (TSP) on complete graphs is #P-complete. In addition, we show that the expected number of 2-optimal tours in random instances of the TSP on complete graphs is $O(1.2098^n \sqrt{n!})$. Based on numerical experiments, we conjecture that the true bound is at most $O(\sqrt{n!})$, which is approximately the square root of the total number of tours.</description>

      <title>Recognizing Sumsets is NP-Complete</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sumsets are central objects in additive combinatorics. In 2007, Granville asked whether one can efficiently recognize whether a given set $S$ is a sumset, i.e. whether there is a set $A$ such that $A+A=S$. Granville suggested an algorithm that takes exponential time in the size of the given set, but can we do polynomial or even linear time? This basic computational question is indirectly asking a fundamental structural question: do the special characteristics of sumsets allow them to be efficiently recognizable? In this paper, we answer this question negatively by proving that the problem is NP-complete. Specifically, our results hold for integer sets and over any finite field. Assuming the Exponential Time Hypothesis, our lower bound becomes $2^{\Omega(n^{1/4})}$.</description>

      <title>Maximizing a Submodular Function with Bounded Curvature under an Unknown Knapsack Constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.09668v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the problem of maximizing a monotone submodular function under an unknown knapsack constraint. A solution to this problem is a policy that decides which item to pack next based on the past packing history. The robustness factor of a policy is the worst case ratio of the solution obtained by following the policy and an optimal solution that knows the knapsack capacity. We develop a policy with a robustness factor that is decreasing in the curvature $c$ of the submodular function. For the extreme cases $c=0$ corresponding to an additive objective function, it matches a previously known and best possible robustness factor of $1/2$. For the other extreme case of $c=1$ it yields a robustness factor of $\approx 0.35$ improving over the best previously known robustness factor of $\approx 0.06$.
  The analysis of our policy relies on a greedy algorithm that is a slight modification of Wolsey's greedy algorithm for the submodular knapsack problem with a known knapsack constraint. We obtain tight approximation guarantees for both of these algorithms in the setting of a submodular objective function with curvature $c$.</description>

      <title>Multidimensional Electrical Networks and their Application to Exponential Speedups for Graph Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07372v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, Apers and Piddock [TQC '23] strengthened the connection between quantum walks and electrical networks via Kirchhoff's Law and Ohm's Law. In this work, we develop a new multidimensional electrical network by defining Alternative Kirchhoff's Law and Alternative Ohm's Law based on the multidimensional quantum walk framework by Jeffery and Zur [STOC '23]. In analogy to the connection between the incidence matrix of a graph and Kirchhoff's Law and Ohm's Law in an electrical network, we rebuild the connection between the alternative incidence matrix and Alternative Kirchhoff's Law and Alternative Ohm's Law. This new framework enables generating an alternative electrical flow over the edges on graphs, which has the potential to be applied to a broader range of graph problems, benefiting both quantum and classical algorithm design.
  We first use this framework to generate quantum alternative electrical flow states and use it to find a marked vertex in one-dimensional random hierarchical graphs as defined by Balasubramanian, Li, and Harrow [arXiv '23]. In this work, they generalised the exponential quantum-classical separation of the welded tree graph by Childs, Cleve, Deotto, Farhi, Gutmann, and Spielman [STOC '03] to random hierarchical graphs. Our result partially recovers their results with an arguably simpler analysis.
  Furthermore, this framework also allows us to demonstrate an exponential quantum speedup for the pathfinding problem in a type of regular graph, which we name the welded tree circuit graph. The exponential quantum advantage is obtained by efficiently generating quantum alternative electrical flow states and then sampling from them to find an s-t path in the welded tree circuit graph. By comparison, Li [arXiv '23] constructed a non-regular graph based on welded trees and used the degree information to achieve a similar speedup.</description>
