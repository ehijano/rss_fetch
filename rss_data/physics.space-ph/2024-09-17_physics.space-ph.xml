      <title>The Juno Mission as a Probe of Long-Range New Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Orbits of celestial objects, especially the geocentric and heliocentric ones, have been well explored to constrain new long-range forces beyond the Standard Model (SM), often referred to as fifth forces. In this paper, for the first time, we apply the motion of a spacecraft around Jupiter to probe fifth forces that don't violate the equivalence principle. The spacecraft is the Juno orbiter, and ten of its early orbits already allow a precise determination of the Jovian gravitational field. We use the shift in the precession angle as a proxy to test non-gravitational interactions between Juno and Jupiter. Requiring that the contribution from the fifth force does not exceed the uncertainty of the precession shift inferred from data, we find that a new parameter space with the mass of the fifth-force mediator around $10^{-14}$ eV is excluded at 95% C.L.</description>

      <title>Alpha-Proton Differential Flow of A Coronal Mass Ejection at 15 Solar Radii</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Alpha-proton differential flow ($V_{\alpha p}$) of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and solar wind from the Sun to 1 au and beyond could influence the instantaneous correspondence of absolute abundances of alpha particles (He$^{2+}$/H$^{+}$) between solar corona and interplanetary space as the abundance of a coronal source can vary with time. Previous studies based on Ulysses and Helios showed that $V_{\alpha p}$ is negligible within CMEs from 5 to 0.3 au, similar to slow solar wind ($&lt;$ 400 km s$^{-1}$). However, recent new observations using Parker Solar Probe (PSP) revealed that the $V_{\alpha p}$ of slow wind increases to $\sim$60 km s$^{-1}$ inside 0.1 au. It is significant to answer whether the $V_{\alpha p}$ of CMEs exhibits the similar behavior near the Sun. In this Letter, we report the $V_{\alpha p}$ of a CME measured by PSP at $\sim$15 $R_\odot$ for the first time, which demonstrates that the $V_{\alpha p}$ of CMEs is obvious and complex inside 0.1 au while keeps lower than the local Alfv\'{e}n speed. A very interesting point is that the same one CME duration can be divided into A and B intervals clearly with Coulomb number below and beyond 0.5, respectively. The means of $V_{\alpha p}$ and alpha-to-proton temperature ratios of interval A (B) is 96.52 (21.96) km s$^{-1}$ and 7.65 (2.23), respectively. This directly illustrates that Coulomb collisions play an important role in reducing the non-equilibrium features of CMEs. Our study indicates that the absolute elemental abundances of CMEs also might vary during their propagation.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Magnetized Asteroseismic Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01856v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We solve for waves in a polytropic, stratified plasmas with a spatially varying background magnetic field that points along a horizontal $x$-direction, and with gravity that is directed along the vertical $z$-direction. Force balance determines the magnitude of the background magnetic field, $B_0^2 \sim z^{n+1}$, where $n$ is the polytropic index. Using numerical and asymptotic methods, we deduce an explicit dispersion relation for fast pressure-driven waves: $\Omega^2 \sim K\left(2m+n\right) \left[1 + (1/M_\mathrm{A})^2 (4-2\gamma+\cos^2\theta-3\cos^4\theta)/4 \right]$. Here, $\Omega$ is the frequency, $K$ the wavenumber, $\theta$ the angle the wave-vector makes with the background magnetic field, $M_\mathrm{A}$ the Alfv\'enic Mach number, and $m$ an integer representing the eigenstate. We discuss roles of such an explicit formula in asteroseismology.</description>

      <title>Characteristics and Source Regions of Slow Alfvenic Solar Wind Observed by Parker Solar Probe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09684v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using a classification scheme for solar wind type based on the heliocentric distance of the observation, we look at near perihelion observations from Parker Solar Probe Encounters Four to Fourteen to study the sources of the slow Alfv$\'e$nic solar wind (SASW). Through Potential Field Source Surface (PFSS) modeling and ballistic mapping, we connect streams to their solar source and find that a primary population of SASW comes from low magnetic field strength regions (low-$B_0$), likely small coronal holes (CHs) and their over-expanded boundaries, while a second population of high field strength (high-$B_0$) seems to emerge from non-CH structures potentially through interchange reconnection with nearby open field lines. This low-$B_0$ SASW shows larger expansion than the fast solar wind (FSW) but similar mass flux, potentially indicating additional heating below the critical point, and emergence from a cooler structure, which could lead to slower wind emerging from CH-like structures. We show that this low-$B_0$ SASW shows stronger preferential acceleration of alpha particles (similar to the FSW) than the high-$B_0$ SASW, and that this is a velocity dependent phenomenon as found in previous studies. To have additional confidence in our mapping results, we quantify the error on both the PFSS model and ballistic mapping and discuss how additional multi-point observations of plasma parameters and composition would allow us to better constrain our models and connect the solar wind to its source.</description>
