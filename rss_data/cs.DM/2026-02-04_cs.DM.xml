      <title>A Parametrized Complexity View on Robust Scheduling with Budgeted Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate a robust single-machine scheduling problem under processing time uncertainty. The uncertainty is modeled using the budgeted approach, where each job has a nominal and deviation processing time, and the number of deviations is bounded by Gamma. The objective is to minimize the maximum number of tardy jobs over all possible scenarios. Since the problem is NP-hard in general, we focus on analyzing its tractability under the assumption that some natural parameter of the problem is bounded by a constant. We consider three parameters: the robustness parameter Gamma, the number of distinct due dates in the instance, and the number of jobs with nonzero deviations. Using parametrized-complexity theory, we prove that the problem is W[1]-hard with respect to Gamma, but can be solved in XP time with respect to the same parameter. With respect to the number of different due dates, we establish a stronger hardness result by showing that the problem remains NP-hard even when there are only two different due dates and is solvable in pseudo-polynomial time when the number of due dates is upper bounded by a constant. To complement these results, we show that the case of a common (single) due date, reduces to a robust binary knapsack problem with equal item profits, which we prove to be solvable in polynomial time. Finally, we prove that the problem is solvable in FPT time with respect to the number of nonzero deviations.</description>

      <title>An Algorithm for Monitoring Edge-geodetic Sets in Chordal Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A monitoring edge-geodetic set (or meg-set for short) of a graph is a set of vertices $M$ such that if any edge is removed, then the distance between some two vertices of $M$ increases. This notion was introduced by Foucaud et al. in 2023 as a way to monitor networks for communication failures. As computing a minimal meg-set is hard in general, recent works aimed to find polynomial-time algorithms to compute minimal meg-sets when the input belongs to a restricted class of graphs. Most of these results are based on the property of some classes of graphs to admit a unique minimum meg-set, which is then easy to compute. In this work, we prove that chordal graphs also admit a unique minimal meg-set, answering a standing open question of Foucaud et al.</description>

      <title>Vigemers: on the number of $k$-mers sharing the same XOR-based minimizer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In bioinformatics, minimizers have become an inescapable method for handling $k$-mers (words of fixed size $k$) extracted from DNA or RNA sequencing, whether for sampling, storage, querying or partitioning. According to some fixed order on $m$-mers ($m&lt;k$), the minimizer of a $k$-mer is defined as its smallest $m$-mer -- and acts as its fingerprint. Although minimizers are widely used for partitioning purposes, there is almost no theoretical work on the quality of the resulting partitions. For instance, it has been known for decades that the lexicographic order empirically leads to highly unbalanced partitions that are unusable in practice, but it was not until very recently that this observation was theoretically substantiated. The rejection of the lexicographic order has led the community to resort to (pseudo-)random orders using hash functions. In this work, we extend the theoretical results relating to the partitions obtained by the lexicographical order, departing from it to a (exponentially) large family of hash functions, namely where the $m$-mers are XORed against a fixed key. More precisely, provided a key $\gamma$ and a $m$-mer $w$, we investigate the function that counts how many $k$-mers admit $w$ as their minimizer (i.e. where $w\oplus\gamma$ is minimal among all $m$-mers of said $k$-mers). This number, denoted by $\pi_k^{\gamma}(w)$, represents the maximum size of the bucket associated with $w$, if all possible $k$-mers were to be seen and partitioned. We adapt the (lexicographical order) method of the literature to our framework and propose combinatorial equations that allow to compute, using dynamic programming, $\pi_k^{\gamma}(w)$ in $O(km^2)$ time and $O(km)$ space.</description>

      <title>A two-player version of the assignment problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the competitive assignment problem, a two-player version of the well-known assignment problem. Given a set of tasks and a set of agents with different efficiencies for different tasks, Alice and Bob take turns picking agents one by one. Once all agents have been picked, Alice and Bob compute the optimal values $s_A$ and $s_B$ for the assignment problem on their respective sets of agents, i.e. they assign their own agents to tasks (with at most one agent per task and at most one task per agent) so as to maximize the sum of the efficiencies. The score of the game is then defined as $s_A-s_B$. Alice aims at maximizing the score, while Bob aims at minimizing it. This problem can model drafts in sports and card games, or more generally situations where two entities fight for the same resources and then use them to compete against each other. We show that the problem is PSPACE-complete, even restricted to agents that have at most two nonzero efficiencies. On the other hand, in the case of agents having at most one nonzero efficiency, the problem lies in XP parameterized by the number of tasks, and the optimal score can be computed in linear time when there are only two tasks.</description>

      <title>Factor-balancedness, linear recurrence, and factor complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the study of infinite words, various notions of balancedness provide quantitative measures for how regularly letters or factors occur, and they find applications in several areas of mathematics and theoretical computer science. In this paper, we study factor-balancedness and uniform factor-balancedness, making two main contributions. First, we establish general sufficient conditions for an infinite word to be (uniformly) factor-balanced, applicable in particular to any given linearly recurrent word. These conditions are formulated in terms of $\mathcal{S}$-adic representations and generalize results of Adamczewski on primitive substitutive words, which show that balancedness of length-2 factors already implies uniform factor-balancedness. As an application of our criteria, we characterize the Sturmian words and ternary Arnoux--Rauzy words that are uniformly factor-balanced as precisely those with bounded weak partial quotients. Our second main contribution is a study of the relationship between factor-balancedness and factor complexity. In particular, we analyze the non-primitive substitutive case and construct an example of a factor-balanced word with exponential factor complexity, thereby making progress on a question raised in 2025 by Arnoux, Berth\'e, Minervino, Steiner, and Thuswaldner on the relation between balancedness and discrete spectrum.</description>

      <title>Excluding an apex-forest or a fan as quickly as possible</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that every graph $G$ excluding an apex-forest $H$ as a minor has layered pathwidth at most $|V(H)|-2$, and that every graph $G$ excluding an apex-linear forest (such as a fan) $H$ as a minor has layered treedepth at most $|V(H)|-2$. We further show that both bounds are optimal. These results improve on recent results of Hodor, La, Micek, and Rambaud (2025): The first result improves the previous best-known bound by a multiplicative factor of $2$, while the second strengthens a previous quadratic bound. In addition, we reduce from quadratic to linear the bound on the $S$-focused treedepth $\mathrm{td}(G,S)$ for graphs $G$ with a prescribed set of vertices $S$ excluding models of paths in which every branch set intersects~$S$.</description>

      <title>Inapproximability of the independent set polynomial in the complex plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00282</link>
      <description>arXiv:1711.00282v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the complexity of approximating the independent set polynomial $Z_G(\lambda)$ of a graph $G$ with maximum degree $\Delta$ when the activity $\lambda$ is a complex number. This problem is already well understood when $\lambda$ is real using connections to the $\Delta$-regular tree $T$. The key concept in that case is the "occupation ratio" of the tree $T$. This ratio is the contribution to $Z_T(\lambda)$ from independent sets containing the root of the tree, divided by $Z_T(\lambda)$ itself. If $\lambda$ is such that the occupation ratio converges to a limit, as the height of $T$ grows, then there is an FPTAS for approximating $Z_G(\lambda)$ on a graph $G$ with maximum degree $\Delta$. Otherwise, the approximation problem is NP-hard.
  Unsurprisingly, the case where $\lambda$ is complex is more challenging. Peters and Regts identified the complex values of $\lambda$ for which the occupation ratio of the $\Delta$-regular tree converges. These values carve a cardioid-shaped region $\Lambda_\Delta$ in the complex plane. Motivated by the picture in the real case, they asked whether $\Lambda_\Delta$ marks the true approximability threshold for general complex values $\lambda$.
  Our main result shows that for every $\lambda$ outside of $\Lambda_\Delta$, the problem of approximating $Z_G(\lambda)$ on graphs $G$ with maximum degree at most $\Delta$ is indeed NP-hard. In fact, when $\lambda$ is outside of $\Lambda_\Delta$ and is not a positive real number, we give the stronger result that approximating $Z_G(\lambda)$ is actually #P-hard. If $\lambda$ is a negative real number outside of $\Lambda_\Delta$, we show that it is #P-hard to even decide whether $Z_G(\lambda)&gt;0$, resolving in the affirmative a conjecture of Harvey, Srivastava and Vondrak. Our proof techniques are based around tools from complex analysis -- specifically the study of iterative multivariate rational maps.</description>

      <title>Causal Graph Dynamics and Kan Extensions</title>

Abstract: On the one side, the formalism of Global Transformations comes with the claim of capturing any transformation of space that is local, synchronous and deterministic. The claim has been proven for different classes of models such as mesh refinements from computer graphics, Lindenmayer systems from morphogenesis modeling and cellular automata from biological, physical and parallel computation modeling. The Global Transformation formalism achieves this by using category theory for its genericity, and more precisely the notion of Kan extension to determine the global behaviors based on the local ones. On the other side, Causal Graph Dynamics describe the transformation of port graphs in a synchronous and deterministic way and has not yet being tackled. In this paper, we show the precise sense in which the claim of Global Transformations holds for them as well. This is done by showing different ways in which they can be expressed as Kan extensions, each of them highlighting different features of Causal Graph Dynamics. Along the way, this work uncovers the interesting class of Monotonic Causal Graph Dynamics and their universality among General Causal Graph Dynamics.</description>

      <title>On multiplicities of interpoint distances</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04283v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a set $X\subseteq\mathbb{R}^2$ of $n$ points and a distance $d&gt;0$, the multiplicity of $d$ is the number of times the distance $d$ appears between points in $X$. Let $a_1(X) \geq a_2(X) \geq \cdots \geq a_m(X)$ denote the multiplicities of the $m$ distances determined by $X$ and let $a(X)=\left(a_1(X),\dots,a_m(X)\right)$. In this paper, we study several questions from Erd\H{o}s's time regarding distance multiplicities. Among other results, we show that:
  (1) If $X$ is convex or ``not too convex'', then there exists a distance other than the diameter that has multiplicity at most $n$.
  (2) There exists a set $X \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2$ of $n$ points, such that many distances occur with high multiplicity. In particular, at least $n^{\Omega(1/\log\log{n})}$ distances have superlinear multiplicity in $n$.
  (3) For any (not necessarily fixed) integer $1\leq k\leq\log{n}$, there exists $X\subseteq\mathbb{R}^2$ of $n$ points, such that the difference between the $k^{\text{th}}$ and $(k+1)^{\text{th}}$ largest multiplicities is at least $\Omega(\frac{n\log{n}}{k})$. Moreover, the distances in $X$ with the largest $k$ multiplicities can be prescribed.
  (4) For every $n\in\mathbb{N}$, there exists $X\subseteq\mathbb{R}^2$ of $n$ points, not all collinear or cocircular, such that $a(X)= (n-1,n-2,\ldots,1)$. There also exists $Y\subseteq\mathbb{R}^2$ of $n$ points with pairwise distinct distance multiplicities and $a(Y) \neq (n-1,n-2,\ldots,1)$.</description>

      <title>Designing ReLU Generative Networks to Enumerate Trees with a Given Tree Edit Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10706v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The generation of trees with a specified tree edit distance has significant applications across various fields, including computational biology, structured data analysis, and image processing. Recently, generative networks have been increasingly employed to synthesize new data that closely resembles the original datasets. However, the appropriate size and depth of generative networks required to generate data with a specified tree edit distance remain unclear. In this paper, we theoretically establish the existence and construction of generative networks capable of producing trees similar to a given tree with respect to the tree edit distance. Specifically, for a given rooted, ordered, and vertex-labeled tree T of size n + 1 with labels from an alphabet \Sigma, and a non-negative integer d, we prove that all rooted, ordered, and vertex-labeled trees over \Sigma with tree edit distance at most d from T can be generated using a ReLU-based generative network with size O(n^3 ) and constant depth. The proposed networks were implemented and evaluated for generating trees with up to 21 nodes. Due to their deterministic architecture, the networks successfully generated all valid trees within the specified tree edit distance. In contrast, state-of-the-art graph generative models GraphRNN and GraphGDP, which rely on non-deterministic mechanisms, produced significantly fewer valid trees, achieving validation rates of only up to 35% and 48%, respectively. These findings provide a theoretical foundation towards construction of compact generative models and open new directions for exact and valid tree-structured data generation. An implementation of the proposed networks is available at https://github.com/MGANN-KU/TreeGen_ReLUNetworks.</description>

      <title>The price of homogeneity is polynomial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01882v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide explicit and polynomial bounds for the Homogeneous Wall Lemma which occurred for the first time implicitly in the $13$th entry of Robertson and Seymour's Graph Minors Series [JCTB 1990] and has since become a cornerstone in the algorithmic theory of graph minors.
  A wall where each brick is assigned a set of colours is said to be homogeneous if each brick is assigned the same set of colours. The Homogeneous Wall Lemma says that there exists a function $h$ that, given non-negative integers $q$ and $k$ and an $h(q,k)$-wall $W$ where each brick is assigned a, possibly empty, subset of $\{ 1, \ldots , q \}$ contains a $k$-wall $W'$ as a subgraph such that, if one assigns to each brick $B$ of $W'$ the union of the sets assigned to the bricks of $W$ in its interior, then $W'$ is homogeneous. It is well-known that $h(q,k) \in k^{\mathcal{O}(q)}$. The Homogeneous Wall Lemma plays a key role in most applications of the Irrelevant Vertex Technique where an exponential dependency of $h$ on $q$ usually causes non-uniform dependencies on meta-parameters at best and additional exponential blow-ups at worst. By proving that $h(q,k) \in \mathcal{O}(q^4 \cdot k^6)$, we provide a positive answer to a problem raised by Sau, Stamoulis, and Thilikos [ICALP 2020].</description>
