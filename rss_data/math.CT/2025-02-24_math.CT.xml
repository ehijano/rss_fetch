      <title>Categorical algebra of conditional probability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the field of categorical probability, one uses concepts and techniques from category theory, such as monads and monoidal categories, to study the structures of probability and statistics. In this paper, we connect some ideas from categorical algebra, namely weakly cartesian functors and natural transformations, to the idea of conditioning in probability theory, using Markov categories and probability monads. First of all, we show that under some conditions, the monad associated to a Markov category with conditionals has a weakly cartesian functor and weakly cartesian multiplication (a condition known as Beck-Chevalley, or BC). In particular, we show that this is the case for the Giry monad on standard Borel spaces. We then connect this theory to existing results on statistical experiments. We show that for deterministic statistical experiments, the so-called standard measure construction (which can be seen as a generalization of the "hyper-normalizations" introduced by Jacobs) satisfies a universal property, allowing an equivalent definition which does not rely on the existence of conditionals.</description>

      <title>On Traces in Categories of Contractions (Extended Abstract)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traced monoidal categories are used to model processes that can feed their outputs back to their own inputs, abstracting iteration. The category of finite dimensional Hilbert spaces with the direct sum tensor is not traced. But surprisingly, in 2014, Bartha showed that the monoidal subcategory of isometries is traced. The same holds for coisometries, unitary maps, and contractions. This suggests the possibility of feeding outputs of quantum processes back to their own inputs, analogous to iteration. In this paper, we show that Bartha's result is not specifically tied to Hilbert spaces, but works in any dagger additive category with Moore-Penrose pseudoinverses (a natural dagger-categorical generalization of inverses).</description>

      <title>Categorical Lyapunov Theory I: Stability of Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lyapunov's theorem provides a fundamental characterization of the stability of dynamical systems. This paper presents a categorical framework for Lyapunov theory, generalizing stability analysis with Lyapunov functions categorically. Core to our approach is the set of axioms underlying a setting for stability, which give the necessary ingredients for ``doing Lyapunov theory'' in a category of interest. With these minimal assumptions, we define the stability of equilibria, formulate Lyapunov morphisms, and demonstrate that the existence of Lyapunov morphisms is necessary and sufficient for establishing the stability of flows. To illustrate these constructions, we show how classical notions of stability, e.g., for continuous and discrete time dynamical systems, are captured by this categorical framework for Lyapunov theory. Finally, to demonstrate the extensibility of our framework, we illustrate how enriched categories, e.g., Lawvere metric spaces, yield settings for stability enabling one to ``do Lyapunov theory'' in enriched categories.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop category theory of Markov kernels to study categorical aspects of Bayesian inversions. As a result, we present a unified model for Bayesian supervised learning, encompassing Bayesian density estimation. We illustrate this model with Gaussian process regressions.</description>

      <title>Polarizations on a triangulated category</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a recent collaboration, Hiroki Matsui and the author introduced a new proof of the reconstruction theorem of Bondal-Orlov and Ballard, using Matsui's construction of a ringed space associated to a triangulated category. This paper first shows that these ideas can be applied to reconstructions of more general varieties from their perfect derived categories. For further applications of these ideas, we introduce the framework of a polarized triangulated category, a pair $(\mathcal T,\tau)$ consisting of a triangulated category $\mathcal T$ and an autoequivalence $\tau$ (called a polarization), to which we can associate a ringed space called the pt-spectrum. As concrete applications, we observe that several reconstruction results of Favero naturally fit within this framework, leading to both generalizations and new proofs of these results. Furthermore, we explore broader implications of polarizations and pt-spectra in tensor triangular geometry, noncommutative projective geometry, birational geometry and homological mirror symmetry.</description>

      <title>Noncommutative Gelfand Duality: the algebraic case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11816v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to define a notion of non-commutative Gelfand duality. Using techniques from derived algebraic geometry, we show that the category of rings is anti-equivalent to a subcategory of pre-ringed sites, inspired by Grothendieck's work on commutative rings. Our notion of spectrum, although formally reminiscent of the Grothendieck spectrum, is new. Remarkably, an appropriately refined relative version of our spectrum agrees with the Grothendieck spectrum for finitely generated commutative algebras over the complex numbers, among others. This work aims to represent the starting point for a rigorous study of geometric properties of quantum spacetimes.</description>
