      <title>Ultrafast dynamics of the Rydberg states of CO$_{2}$: Autoionization and Dissociation lifetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the measurement of ultrafast relaxation dynamics of excited states of carbon dioxide molecule using time-resolved pump-probe photoelectron spectroscopy. Neutral ground state carbon dioxide is excited to $nd\sigma_g$ Henning sharp Rydberg states with an attosecond extreme ultraviolet pulse train. A time delayed near infrared probe pulse is used to photoionize these states to their corresponding ionization limit $B^2\Sigma_u^+$. We obtain differential kinetic energy spectrograms and angular distributions for photoionization and autoionization channels. We model the competition between predissociation and autoionization in the Rydberg state dynamics and analyze differential photoelectron yield as a function of the time delay to extract previously unknown autoionization and predissociation lifetimes for three Henning sharp states (n = 4, 5, 6).</description>

      <title>Zero-energy photoelectric effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We predict a near-threshold ("zero energy") peak in multi-photon ionization for a dynamical regime where the photon frequency is large compared to the binding energy of the electron. The peak position does not depend on the laser frequency, but on the binding energy and the pulse duration. The effect originates from the fact that bound-continuum dipole transitions are stronger than continuum-continuum ones. To clearly observe this zero-energy photoelectric effect, the spectral width of the laser pulse should be comparable to the binding energy of the ionized orbital, and the second ionization potential should be larger than the photon energy. This suggests negative ions as ideal candidates for corresponding experiments.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Resonance Linewidth of Alkali-Metal Vapor in Unresolved Zeeman Resonance Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of magnetic resonance linewidth is crucial in magnetic resonance physics and its applications. Previous studies focused on the linewidth of alkali metal atoms within the spin-exchange relaxation-free regime near zero magnetic field and in strong magnetic fields where Zeeman resonances are well resolved due to the quadratic Zeeman effect. However, the linewidth in the unresolved Zeeman resonance regime, which is prevalent in various magnetometer and comagnetometer applications, is not well understood. To address this, we developed a theoretical framework based on the master equation for alkali metal atoms and solved it under the rotating wave approximation and weak driving conditions. Our numerical calculations and analytical expressions reveal that the light-narrowing effect occurs only when the ratio of the spin exchange rate to the spin destruction rate exceeds a critical value. Additionally, we show that the linewidth in the unresolved Zeeman resonance regime is significantly influenced by the mutual coupling of quantum coherence between different Zeeman sublevels. These findings provide a theoretical tool for understanding spin relaxation in alkali-metal atoms and optimizing the performance of atomic magnetometers and comagnetometers operating in this regime.</description>

      <title>Atomic Transition Probabilities for UV and Optical Lines of Tm II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report new branching fraction measurements for 224 ultraviolet (UV) and optical transitions of Tm II. These transitions range in wavelength (wavenumber) from 2350 - 6417 Angstroms (42532 - 15579 cm-1) and originate in 13 odd-parity and 24 even-parity upper levels. Thirty-five of the 37 levels, accounting for 213 of the 224 transitions, are studied for the first time. Branching fractions are determined for two levels studied previously for comparison to earlier results. The levels studied for the first time are high-lying, ranging in energy from 35753 - 54989 cm-1. The branching fractions are determined from emission spectra from two different high-resolution spectrometers. These are combined with radiative lifetimes reported in an earlier study to produce a set of transition probabilities and log(gf) values with accuracy ranging from 5 - 30%. Comparison is made to experimental and theoretical transition probabilities from the literature where such data exist. These new log(gf) values are used to derive an abundance from one previously unused Tm II line in the UV spectrum of the r-process-enhanced metal-poor star HD 222925, and this abundance is consistent with previous determinations based on other Tm II lines.</description>

      <title>Implications of the laser excitation of the Th-229 nucleus for dark matter searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent laser excitation of the low-lying Th-229 isomer transition is starting a revolution in ultralight dark matter searches. The enhanced sensitivity of this transition to the large class of dark matter models dominantly coupling to quarks and gluons will ultimately allow us to probe coupling strengths eight orders of magnitude smaller than the current bounds from optical atomic clocks, which are mainly sensitive to dark matter couplings to electrons and photons. We argue that, with increasing precision, observations of the Th-229 excitation spectrum will soon give world-leading constraints. Using data from the pioneering laser excitation of Th-229 by Tiedau et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 132, 182501 (2024)], we present a first dark matter search in the excitation spectrum. While the exclusion limits of our detailed study of the lineshape are still below the sensitivity of currently operating clock experiments, we project the measurement of Zhang et al. [arXiv:2406.18719 [physics.atom-ph]] to surpass it.</description>

      <title>Ramsey interferometry of nuclear spins in diamond using stimulated Raman adiabatic passage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the first experimental demonstration of stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP) in nuclear-spin transitions of $^{14}$N within nitrogen-vacancy (NV) color centers in diamond. It is shown that the STIRAP technique suppresses the occupation of the intermediate state, which is a crucial factor for improvements in quantum sensing technology. Building on that advantage, we develop and implement a generalized version of the Ramsey interferometric scheme, employing half-STIRAP pulses to perform the necessary quantum-state manipulation with high fidelity. The enhanced robustness of the STIRAP-based Ramsey scheme to variations in the pulse parameters is experimentally demonstrated, showing good agreement with theoretical predictions. Our results pave the way for improving the long-term stability of diamond-based sensors, such as gyroscopes and frequency standards.</description>

      <title>Quantum estimation bound of Gaussian matrix permanent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.01328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.01328v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exact calculation and even multiplicative error estimation of matrix permanent are challenging for both classical and quantum computers. Regarding the permanents of random Gaussian matrices, the additive error estimation is closely linked to boson sampling, and achieving multiplicative error estimation requires exponentially many samplings. Our newly developed formula for matrix permanents and its corresponding quantum expression have enabled better estimation of the average additive error for random Gaussian matrices compared to Gurvits' classical sampling algorithm. The well-known Ryser formula has been converted into a quantum permanent estimator. When dealing with real random Gaussian square matrices of size $N$, the quantum estimator can approximate the matrix permanent with an additive error smaller than $\epsilon(\sqrt{\mathrm{e}N})^{N}$, where $\epsilon$ is the estimation precision. In contrast, Gurvits' classical sampling algorithm has an estimation error of $\epsilon(2\sqrt{N})^{N}$, which is exponentially larger ($1.2^{N}$) than the quantum method. As expected, the quantum additive error bound fails to reach the multiplicative error bound of $(2\pi N)^{1/4}\epsilon(\sqrt{N/\mathrm{e}})^{N}$. Additionally, the quantum permanent estimator can be up to quadratically faster than the classical estimator when using quantum phase estimation-based amplitude estimation.</description>

      <title>Integer Programming Using A Single Atom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16541v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Integer programming (IP), as the name suggests is an integer-variable-based approach commonly used to formulate real-world optimization problems with constraints. Currently, quantum algorithms reformulate the IP into an unconstrained form through the use of binary variables, which is an indirect and resource-consuming way of solving it. We develop an algorithm that maps and solves an IP problem in its original form to any quantum system possessing a large number of accessible internal degrees of freedom that are controlled with sufficient accuracy. This work leverages the principle of superposition to solve the optimization problem. Using a single Rydberg atom as an example, we associate the integer values to electronic states belonging to different manifolds and implement a selective superposition of different states to solve the full IP problem. The optimal solution is found within a few microseconds for prototypical IP problems with up to eight variables and four constraints. This also includes non-linear IP problems, which are usually harder to solve with classical algorithms when compared to their linear counterparts. Our algorithm for solving IP is benchmarked by a well-known classical algorithm (branch and bound) in terms of the number of steps needed for convergence to the solution. This approach carries the potential to improve the solutions obtained for larger-size problems using hybrid quantum-classical algorithms.</description>

      <title>Harmonic analysis of atomic vapor magnetization for in situ calibration of tri-axial time-dependent magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14574v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a methodology to calibrate in situ a set of coils generating bi- or tri-axial magnetic fields, at frequencies where a calibration performed under static conditions would be inaccurate. The coil constants are determined in a two-step procedure. Considering the presence of a static and a time-dependent field, firstly, the static one is oriented perpendicularly to the polarization plane of a time-dependent one; secondly, the polarization of the latter is made accurately circular. The methodology uses harmonic analysis of one component of the magnetization of an atomic sample whose spins adiabatically follow the time-dependent field.</description>
