      <title>A scalable adaptive deep Koopman predictive controller for real-time optimization of mixed traffic flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of connected automated vehicle (CAV) is advocated to mitigate traffic oscillations in mixed traffic flow consisting of CAVs and human driven vehicles (HDVs). This study proposes an adaptive deep Koopman predictive control framework (AdapKoopPC) for regulating mixed traffic flow. Firstly, a Koopman theory-based adaptive trajectory prediction deep network (AdapKoopnet) is designed for modeling HDVs car-following behavior. AdapKoopnet enables the representation of HDVs behavior by a linear model in a high-dimensional space. Secondly, the model predictive control is employed to smooth the mixed traffic flow, where the combination of the linear dynamic model of CAVs and linear prediction blocks from AdapKoopnet is embedded as the predictive model into the AdapKoopPC. Finally, the predictive performance of the prosed AdapKoopnet is verified using the HighD naturalistic driving dataset. Furthermore, the control performance of AdapKoopPC is validated by the numerical simulations. Results demonstrate that the AdapKoopnet provides more accuracy HDVs predicted trajectories than the baseline nonlinear models. Moreover, the proposed AdapKoopPC exhibits more effective control performance with less computation cost compared with baselines in mitigating traffic oscillations, especially at the low CAVs penetration rates. The code of proposed AdapKoopPC is open source.</description>

      <title>Differentiable Projection-based Learn to Optimize in Wireless Network-Part I: Convex Constrained (Non-)Convex Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses a class of (non-)convex optimization problems subject to general convex constraints, which pose significant challenges for traditional methods due to their inherent non-convexity and diversity. Conventional convex optimization-based solvers often struggle to efficiently handle these problems in their most general form. While neural network (NN)-based approaches offer a promising alternative, ensuring the feasibility of NN-generated solutions and effectively training the NN remain key hurdles, largely because finite-capacity networks can produce infeasible outputs. To overcome these issues, we propose a projection-based method that projects any infeasible NN output onto the feasible domain, thus guaranteeing strict adherence to the constraints without compromising the NN's optimization capability. Furthermore, we derive the objective function values for both the raw NN outputs and their projected counterparts, along with the gradients of these values with respect to the NN parameters. This derivation enables label-free (unsupervised) training, reducing reliance on labeled data and improving scalability. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed projection-based method consistently ensures feasibility.</description>

      <title>Optimal Coupled Sensor Placement and Path-Planning in Unknown Time-Varying Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address path-planning for a mobile agent to navigate in an unknown environment with minimum exposure to a spatially and temporally varying threat field. The threat field is estimated using pointwise noisy measurements from a mobile sensor network. For this problem, we present a new information gain measure for optimal sensor placement that quantifies reduction in uncertainty in the path cost rather than the environment state. This measure, which we call the context-relevant mutual information (CRMI), couples the sensor placement and path-planning problem. We propose an iterative coupled sensor configuration and path-planning (CSCP) algorithm. At each iteration, this algorithm places sensors to maximize CRMI, updates the threat estimate using new measurements, and recalculates the path with minimum expected exposure to the threat. The iterations converge when the path cost variance, which is an indicator of risk, reduces below a desired threshold. We show that CRMI is submodular, and therefore, greedy optimization provides near-optimal sensor placements while maintaining computational efficiency of the CSCP algorithm. Distance-based sensor reconfiguration costs are introduced in a modified CRMI measure, which we also show to be submodular. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the principal advantage of this algorithm is that near-optimal low-variance paths are achieved using far fewer sensor measurements as compared to a standard sensor placement method.</description>

      <title>Optimal Construction of Data Injection Attacks on Process Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An information-theoretic framework for constructing data injection attacks on process systems, from the attacker's standpoint, is studied. The attack construction aims to distract the stationary distributions of the process variables and stay stealthy, simultaneously. The problem is formulated as designing a multivariate Gaussian distribution to maximize the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the stationary distributions of states and state estimates under attacks and without attacks, while minimizing that between the distributions of sensor measurements. When the attacker has limited access to sensors, sparse attacks are proposed by incorporating a sparsity constraint on the attack. We conduct a theoretical analysis on the convexity of the attack construction problem and present a greedy algorithm, which allows for a systematic quantification of measurements' vulnerability of process systems. We numerically evaluate the performance of proposed constructions on a two-reactor process.</description>

      <title>Impulsive Relative Motion Control with Continuous-Time Constraint Satisfaction for Cislunar Space Missions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent investments in cislunar applications open new frontiers for space missions within highly nonlinear dynamical regimes. In this paper, we propose a method based on Sequential Convex Programming (SCP) to loiter around a given target with impulsive actuation while satisfying path constraints continuously over the finite time-horizon, i.e., independently of the number of nodes in which domain is discretized. Location, timing, magnitude, and direction of a fixed number of impulses are optimized in a model predictive framework, exploiting the exact nonlinear dynamics of non-stationary orbital regimes. The proposed approach is validated on a relative orbiting problem with respect to a selenocentric Near Rectilinear Halo Orbit.</description>

      <title>Secure Data Reconstruction: A Direct Data-Driven Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00436v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of secure data reconstruction for unknown systems, where data collected from the system are susceptible to malicious manipulation. We aim to recover the real trajectory without prior knowledge of the system model. To achieve this, a behavioral language is used to represent the system, describing it using input/output trajectories instead of state-space models. We consider two attack scenarios. In the first scenario, up to $k$ entries of the collected data are malicious. On the other hand, the second scenario assumes that at most $k$ channels from sensors or actuators can be compromised, implying that any data collected from these channels might be falsified. For both scenarios, we formulate the trajectory recovery problem as an optimization problem and introduce sufficient conditions to ensure successful recovery of the true data. Since finding exact solutions to these problems can be computationally inefficient, we further approximate them using an $\ell_1$-norm and group Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO). We demonstrate that under certain conditions, these approximation problems also find the true trajectory while maintaining low computation complexity. Finally, we extend the proposed algorithms to noisy data. By reconstructing the secure trajectory, this work serves as a safeguard mechanism for subsequent data-driven control methods.</description>

      <title>Model-Free Predictive Control: Introductory Algebraic Calculations, and a Comparison with HEOL and ANNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model predictive control (MPC) is a popular control engineering practice, but requires a sound knowledge of the model. Model-free predictive control (MFPC), a burning issue today, also related to reinforcement learning (RL) in AI, is reformulated here via a linear differential equation with constant coefficients, thanks to a new perspective on optimal control combined with recent advances in the field of model-free control. It is replacing Dynamic Programming, the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, and Pontryagin's Maximum Principle. The computing burden is low. The implementation is straightforward. Two nonlinear examples, a chemical reactor and a two tank system, are illustrating our approach. A comparison with the HEOL setting, where some expertise of the process model is needed, shows only a slight superiority of the later. A recent identification of the two tank system via a complex ANN architecture might indicate that a full modeling and the corresponding machine learning mechanism are not always necessary neither in control, nor, more generally, in AI.</description>

      <title>Covariance Analysis of Attitude and Angular Rate Estimation using Accelerometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work a method for using accelerometers for the determination of angular velocity and acceleration is presented. Minimum sensor requirements and insights into how an array of accelerometers can be configured to maximize estimator performance are considered. The framework presented utilizes linear least squares to estimate functions that are quadratic in angular velocity. Simple methods for determining the sign of the spin axis and the linearized covariance approximation are presented and found to perform quite effectively when compared to results obtained by Monte Carlo.</description>

      <title>An MDP Model for Censoring in Harvesting Sensors: Optimal and Approximated Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel censoring policy for energy-efficient transmissions in energy-harvesting sensors. The problem is formulated as an infinite-horizon Markov Decision Process (MDP). The objective to be optimized is the expected sum of the importance (utility) of all transmitted messages. Assuming that such importance can be evaluated at the transmitting node, we show that, under certain conditions on the battery model, the optimal censoring policy is a threshold function on the importance value. Specifically, messages are transmitted only if their importance is above a threshold whose value depends on the battery level. Exploiting this property, we propose a model-based stochastic scheme that approximates the optimal solution, with less computational complexity and faster convergence speed than a conventional Q-learning algorithm. Numerical experiments in single-hop and multi-hop networks confirm the analytical advantages of the proposed scheme.</description>

      <title>Learning the Integral Quadratic Constraints on Plant-Model Mismatch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While a characterization of plant-model mismatch is necessary for robust control, the mismatch usually can not be described accurately due to the lack of knowledge about the plant model or the complexity of nonlinear plants. Hence, this paper considers this problem in a data-driven way, where the mismatch is captured by parametric forms of integral quadratic constraints (IQCs) and the parameters contained in the IQC equalities are learned from sampled trajectories from the plant. To this end, a one-class support vector machine (OC-SVM) formulation is proposed, and its generalization performance is analyzed based on the statistical learning theory. The proposed approach is demonstrated by a single-input-single-output time delay mismatch and a nonlinear two-phase reactor with a linear nominal model, showing accurate recovery of frequency-domain uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear receding-horizon differential game for drone racing along a three-dimensional path</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Drone racing involves high-speed navigation of three-dimensional paths, posing a substantial challenge in control engineering. This study presents a game-theoretic control framework, the nonlinear receding-horizon differential game (NRHDG), designed for competitive drone racing. NRHDG enhances robustness in adversarial settings by predicting and countering an opponent's worst-case behavior in real time. It extends standard nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC), which otherwise assumes a fixed opponent model. First, we develop a novel path-following formulation based on projection point dynamics, eliminating the need for costly distance minimization. Second, we propose a potential function that allows each drone to switch between overtaking and obstructing maneuvers based on real-time race situations. Third, we establish a new performance metric to evaluate NRHDG with NMPC under race scenarios. Simulation results demonstrate that NRHDG outperforms NMPC in terms of both overtaking efficiency and obstructing capabilities.</description>

      <title>Model Order Reduction from Data with Certification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model order reduction (MOR) involves offering low-dimensional models that effectively approximate the behavior of complex high-order systems. Due to potential model complexities and computational costs, designing controllers for high-dimensional systems with complex behaviors can be challenging, rendering MOR a practical alternative to achieve results that closely resemble those of the original complex systems. To construct such effective reduced-order models (ROMs), existing literature generally necessitates precise knowledge of original systems, which is often unavailable in real-world scenarios. This paper introduces a data-driven scheme to construct ROMs of dynamical systems with unknown mathematical models. Our methodology leverages data and establishes similarity relations between output trajectories of unknown systems and their data-driven ROMs via the notion of simulation functions (SFs), capable of formally quantifying their closeness. To achieve this, under a rank condition readily fulfillable using data, we collect only two input-state trajectories from unknown systems to construct both ROMs and SFs, while offering correctness guarantees. We demonstrate that the proposed ROMs derived from data can be leveraged for controller synthesis endeavors while effectively ensuring high-level logic properties over unknown dynamical models. We showcase our data-driven findings across a range of benchmark scenarios involving various unknown physical systems, demonstrating the enforcement of diverse complex properties.</description>

      <title>C-code generation considered unnecessary: go directly to binary, do not pass C. Compilation of Julia code for deployment in model-based engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since time immemorial an old adage has always seemed to ring true: you cannot use a high-level productive programming language like Python or R for real-time control and embedded-systems programming, you must rewrite your program in C. We present a counterexample to this mantra by demonstrating how recent compiler developments in the Julia programming language allow users of Julia and the equation-based modeling language ModelingToolkit to compile and deploy binaries for real-time model-based estimation and control. Contrary to the approach taken by a majority of modeling and simulation tools, we do not generate C code, and instead demonstrate how we may use the native Julia code-generation pipeline through LLVM to compile architecture-specific binaries from high-level code. This approach avoids many of the restrictions typically placed on high-level languages to enable C-code generation. As case studies, we include a nonlinear state estimator derived from an equation-based model which is compiled into a program that performs state estimation for deployment onto a Raspberry Pi, as well as a PID controller library implemented in Julia and compiled into a shared library callable from a C program.</description>

      <title>Trajectory Map-Matching in Urban Road Networks Based on RSS Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes an RSS-based approach to reconstruct vehicle trajectories within a road network, enforcing signal propagation rules and vehicle mobility constraints to mitigate the impact of RSS noise and sparsity. The key challenge lies in leveraging latent spatiotemporal correlations within RSS data while navigating complex road networks. To address this, we develop a Hidden Markov Model (HMM)-based RSS embedding (HRE) technique that employs alternating optimization to infer vehicle trajectories from RSS measurements. This model captures spatiotemporal dependencies while a road graph ensures network compliance. Additionally, we introduce a maximum speed-constrained rough trajectory estimation (MSR) method to guide the optimization process, enabling rapid convergence to a favorable local solution.</description>

      <title>HingePlace: Harnessing the neural thresholding behavior to optimize Transcranial Electrical Stimulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transcranial Electrical Stimulation (tES) is a neuromodulation technique that utilizes electrodes on the scalp to stimulate target brain regions. tES has shown promise in treating many neurological conditions, such as stroke rehabilitation and chronic pain. Several electrode placement algorithms have been proposed to optimize tES-based therapies by designing multi-electrode montages that create focal neural responses. We first extend a well-known unification result by Fernandez-Corazza et al. to unify all major traditional electrode placement algorithms. We utilize this unification result to identify a common restriction among traditional electrode placement algorithms: they do not harness the thresholding behavior of neural response. Consequently, these algorithms only partially harness the properties of neural response to optimize tES, particularly increasing the focality of neural response. We propose a new electrode placement algorithm, HingePlace, that utilizes a symmetrized hinge loss to harness the thresholding behavior of neural response. We extensively compare the HingePlace algorithm with traditional electrode placement algorithms in two simulation platforms. Across both platforms, we find that HingePlace-designed montages consistently generate more focal neural responses -- by as much as 60% -- than the electrode montages designed by traditional electrode placement algorithms.</description>

      <title>Towards Data-Driven Multi-Stage OPF</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The operation of large-scale power systems is usually scheduled ahead via numerical optimization. However, this requires models of grid topology, line parameters, and bus specifications. Classic approaches first identify the network topology, i.e., the graph of interconnections and the associated impedances. The power generation schedules are then computed by solving a multi-stage optimal power flow (OPF) problem built around the model. In this paper, we explore the prospect of data-driven approaches to multi-stage optimal power flow. Specifically, we leverage recent findings from systems and control to bypass the identification step and to construct the optimization problem directly from data. We illustrate the performance of our method on a 118-bus system and compare it with the classical identification-based approach.</description>

      <title>Towards Efficient Multi-Objective Optimisation for Real-World Power Grid Topology Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Power grid operators face increasing difficulties in the control room as the increase in energy demand and the shift to renewable energy introduce new complexities in managing congestion and maintaining a stable supply. Effective grid topology control requires advanced tools capable of handling multi-objective trade-offs. While Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a promising framework for tackling such challenges, existing Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL) approaches fail to scale to the large state and action spaces inherent in real-world grid operations. Here we present a two-phase, efficient and scalable Multi-Objective Optimisation (MOO) method designed for grid topology control, combining an efficient RL learning phase with a rapid planning phase to generate day-ahead plans for unseen scenarios. We validate our approach using historical data from TenneT, a European Transmission System Operator (TSO), demonstrating minimal deployment time, generating day-ahead plans within 4-7 minutes with strong performance. These results underline the potential of our scalable method to support real-world power grid management, offering a practical, computationally efficient, and time-effective tool for operational planning. Based on current congestion costs and inefficiencies in grid operations, adopting our approach by TSOs could potentially save millions of euros annually, providing a compelling economic incentive for its integration in the control room.</description>

      <title>Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning for Power Grid Topology Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transmission grid congestion increases as the electrification of various sectors requires transmitting more power. Topology control, through substation reconfiguration, can reduce congestion but its potential remains under-exploited in operations. A challenge is modeling the topology control problem to align well with the objectives and constraints of operators. Addressing this challenge, this paper investigates the application of multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) to integrate multiple conflicting objectives for power grid topology control. We develop a MORL approach using deep optimistic linear support (DOL) and multi-objective proximal policy optimization (MOPPO) to generate a set of Pareto-optimal policies that balance objectives such as minimizing line loading, topological deviation, and switching frequency. Initial case studies show that the MORL approach can provide valuable insights into objective trade-offs and improve Pareto front approximation compared to a random search baseline. The generated multi-objective RL policies are 30% more successful in preventing grid failure under contingencies and 20% more effective when training budget is reduced - compared to the common single objective RL policy.</description>

      <title>Vision-Based Fuzzy Control System for Smart Walkers: Enhancing Usability for Stroke Survivors with Unilateral Upper Limb Impairments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mobility impairments, particularly those caused by stroke-induced hemiparesis, significantly impact independence and quality of life. Current smart walker controllers operate by using input forces from the user to control linear motion and input torques to dictate rotational movement; however, because they predominantly rely on user-applied torque exerted on the device handle as an indicator of user intent to turn, they fail to adequately accommodate users with unilateral upper limb impairments. This leads to increased physical strain and cognitive load. This paper introduces a novel smart walker equipped with a fuzzy control algorithm that leverages shoulder abduction angles to intuitively interpret user intentions using just one functional hand. By integrating a force sensor and stereo camera, the system enhances walker responsiveness and usability. Experimental evaluations with five participants showed that the fuzzy controller outperformed the traditional admittance controller, reducing wrist torque while using the right hand to operate the walker by 12.65% for left turns, 80.36% for straight paths, and 81.16% for right turns. Additionally, average user comfort ratings on a Likert scale increased from 1 to 4. Results confirmed a strong correlation between shoulder abduction angles and directional intent, with users reporting decreased effort and enhanced ease of use. This study contributes to assistive robotics by providing an adaptable control mechanism for smart walkers, suggesting a pathway towards enhancing mobility and independence for individuals with mobility impairments.</description>

      <title>Digital-Twin assisted Network Energy Optimization during Low Traffic Hours</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As wireless network technology advances towards the sixth generation (6G), increasing network energy consumption has become a critical concern due to the growing demand for diverse services, radio deployments at various frequencies, larger bandwidths, and more antennas. Network operators must manage energy usage not only to reduce operational cost and improve revenue but also to minimize environmental impact by reducing the carbon footprint. The 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) has introduced several network energy savings (NES) features. However, the implementation details and system-level aspects of these features have not been thoroughly investigated. In this paper, we explore system-level resource optimization for network energy savings in low-traffic scenarios. We introduce multiple NES optimization formulations and strategies, and further analyze their performance using a detailed network digital twin. Our results demonstrate promising NES gains of up to 44%. Additionally, we provide practical considerations for implementing the proposed schemes and examine their impacts on user equipment (UE) operation.</description>

      <title>Provably-Stable Neural Network-Based Control of Nonlinear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, Neural Networks (NNs) have been employed to control nonlinear systems due to their potential capability in dealing with situations that might be difficult for conventional nonlinear control schemes. However, to the best of our knowledge, the current literature on NN-based control lacks theoretical guarantees for stability and tracking performance. This precludes the application of NN-based control schemes to systems where stringent stability and performance guarantees are required. To address this gap, this paper proposes a systematic and comprehensive methodology to design provably-stable NN-based control schemes for affine nonlinear systems. Rigorous analysis is provided to show that the proposed approach guarantees stability of the closed-loop system with the NN in the loop. Also, it is shown that the resulting NN-based control scheme ensures that system states asymptotically converge to a neighborhood around the desired equilibrium point, with a tunable proximity threshold. The proposed methodology is validated and evaluated via simulation studies on an inverted pendulum and experimental studies on a Parrot Bebop 2 drone.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Field-Oriented Control of Electric Drives with Tiny Neural Network Optimized for Micro-controllers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The deployment of neural networks on resource-constrained micro-controllers has gained momentum, driving many advancements in Tiny Neural Networks. This paper introduces a tiny feed-forward neural network, TinyFC, integrated into the Field-Oriented Control (FOC) of Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors (PMSMs). Proportional-Integral (PI) controllers are widely used in FOC for their simplicity, although their limitations in handling nonlinear dynamics hinder precision. To address this issue, a lightweight 1,400 parameters TinyFC was devised to enhance the FOC performance while fitting into the computational and memory constraints of a micro-controller. Advanced optimization techniques, including pruning, hyperparameter tuning, and quantization to 8-bit integers, were applied to reduce the model's footprint while preserving the network effectiveness. Simulation results show the proposed approach significantly reduced overshoot by up to 87.5%, with the pruned model achieving complete overshoot elimination, highlighting the potential of tiny neural networks in real-time motor control applications.</description>

Abstract: Our work aims at simulating and predicting the temperature conditions inside a power transformer using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). The predictions obtained are then used to determine the optimal placement for temperature sensors inside the transformer under the constraint of a limited number of sensors, enabling efficient performance monitoring. The method consists of combining PINNs with Mixed Integer Optimization Programming to obtain the optimal temperature reconstruction inside the transformer. First, we extend our PINN model for the thermal modeling of power transformers to solve the heat diffusion equation from 1D to 2D space. Finally, we construct an optimal sensor placement model inside the transformer that can be applied to problems in 1D and 2D.</description>

      <title>DeepUKF-VIN: Adaptively-tuned Deep Unscented Kalman Filter for 3D Visual-Inertial Navigation based on IMU-Vision-Net</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of estimating the orientation, position, and velocity of a vehicle operating in three-dimensional (3D) space with six degrees of freedom (6-DoF). A Deep Learning-based Adaptation Mechanism (DLAM) is proposed to adaptively tune the noise covariance matrices of Kalman-type filters for the Visual-Inertial Navigation (VIN) problem, leveraging IMU-Vision-Net. Subsequently, an adaptively tuned Deep Learning Unscented Kalman Filter for 3D VIN (DeepUKF-VIN) is introduced to utilize the proposed DLAM, thereby robustly estimating key navigation components, including orientation, position, and linear velocity. The proposed DeepUKF-VIN integrates data from onboard sensors, specifically an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and visual feature points extracted from a camera, and is applicable for GPS-denied navigation. Its quaternion-based design effectively captures navigation nonlinearities and avoids the singularities commonly encountered with Euler-angle-based filters. Implemented in discrete space, the DeepUKF-VIN facilitates practical filter deployment. The filter's performance is evaluated using real-world data collected from an IMU and a stereo camera at low sampling rates. The results demonstrate filter stability and rapid attenuation of estimation errors, highlighting its high estimation accuracy. Furthermore, comparative testing against the standard Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) in two scenarios consistently shows superior performance across all navigation components, thereby validating the efficacy and robustness of the proposed DeepUKF-VIN. Keywords: Deep Learning, Unscented Kalman Filter, Adaptive tuning, Estimation, Navigation, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle, Sensor-fusion.</description>

      <title>A Flexible Precision Scaling Deep Neural Network Accelerator with Efficient Weight Combination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deploying mixed-precision neural networks on edge devices is friendly to hardware resources and power consumption. To support fully mixed-precision neural network inference, it is necessary to design flexible hardware accelerators for continuous varying precision operations. However, the previous works have issues on hardware utilization and overhead of reconfigurable logic. In this paper, we propose an efficient accelerator for 2~8-bit precision scaling with serial activation input and parallel weight preloaded. First, we set two loading modes for the weight operands and decompose the weight into the corresponding bitwidths, which extends the weight precision support efficiently. Then, to improve hardware utilization of low-precision operations, we design the architecture that performs bit-serial MAC operation with systolic dataflow, and the partial sums are combined spatially. Furthermore, we designed an efficient carry save adder tree supporting both signed and unsigned number summation across rows. The experiment result shows that the proposed accelerator, synthesized with TSMC 28nm CMOS technology, achieves peak throughput of 4.09TOPS and peak energy efficiency of 68.94TOPS/W at 2/2-bit operations.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a Newton-based stochastic extremum-seeking control method for real-time optimization in multi-input systems with distinct input delays. It combines predictor-based feedback and Hessian inverse estimation via stochastic perturbations to enable delay compensation with user-defined convergence rates. The method ensures exponential stability and convergence near the unknown extremum, even under long delays. It extends to multi-input, single-output systems with cross-coupled channels. Stability is analyzed using backstepping and infinite-dimensional averaging. Numerical simulations demonstrate its effectiveness in handling time-delayed channels, showcasing both the challenges and benefits of real-time optimization in distributed parameter settings.</description>

      <title>Event-Triggered Newton-Based Extremum Seeking Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes the incorporation of static event-triggered control in the actuation path of Newton-based extremum seeking and its comparison with the earlier gradient version. As in the continuous methods, the convergence rate of the gradient approach depends on the unknown Hessian of the nonlinear map to be optimized, whereas the proposed event-triggered Newton-based extremum seeking eliminates this dependence, becoming user-assignable. This is achieved by means of a dynamic estimator for the Hessian's inverse, implemented as a Riccati equation filter. Lyapunov stability and averaging theory for discontinuous systems are applied to analyze the closed-loop system. Local exponential practical stability is guaranteed to a small neighborhood of the extremum point of scalar and static maps. Numerical simulations illustrate the advantages of the proposed approach over the previous gradient method, including improved convergence speed, followed by a reduction in the amplitude and updating frequency of the control signals.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Feature Tracking Reliability for Visual Navigation using Real-Time Safety Filter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision sensors are extensively used for localizing a robot's pose, particularly in environments where global localization tools such as GPS or motion capture systems are unavailable. In many visual navigation systems, localization is achieved by detecting and tracking visual features or landmarks, which provide information about the sensor's relative pose. For reliable feature tracking and accurate pose estimation, it is crucial to maintain visibility of a sufficient number of features. This requirement can sometimes conflict with the robot's overall task objective. In this paper, we approach it as a constrained control problem. By leveraging the invariance properties of visibility constraints within the robot's kinematic model, we propose a real-time safety filter based on quadratic programming. This filter takes a reference velocity command as input and produces a modified velocity that minimally deviates from the reference while ensuring the information score from the currently visible features remains above a user-specified threshold. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed safety filter preserves the invariance condition and ensures the visibility of more features than the required minimum. We also validated its real-world performance by integrating it into a visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithm, where it maintained high estimation quality in challenging environments, outperforming a simple tracking controller.</description>

      <title>ASAP: Aligning Simulation and Real-World Physics for Learning Agile Humanoid Whole-Body Skills</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Humanoid robots hold the potential for unparalleled versatility in performing human-like, whole-body skills. However, achieving agile and coordinated whole-body motions remains a significant challenge due to the dynamics mismatch between simulation and the real world. Existing approaches, such as system identification (SysID) and domain randomization (DR) methods, often rely on labor-intensive parameter tuning or result in overly conservative policies that sacrifice agility. In this paper, we present ASAP (Aligning Simulation and Real-World Physics), a two-stage framework designed to tackle the dynamics mismatch and enable agile humanoid whole-body skills. In the first stage, we pre-train motion tracking policies in simulation using retargeted human motion data. In the second stage, we deploy the policies in the real world and collect real-world data to train a delta (residual) action model that compensates for the dynamics mismatch. Then, ASAP fine-tunes pre-trained policies with the delta action model integrated into the simulator to align effectively with real-world dynamics. We evaluate ASAP across three transfer scenarios: IsaacGym to IsaacSim, IsaacGym to Genesis, and IsaacGym to the real-world Unitree G1 humanoid robot. Our approach significantly improves agility and whole-body coordination across various dynamic motions, reducing tracking error compared to SysID, DR, and delta dynamics learning baselines. ASAP enables highly agile motions that were previously difficult to achieve, demonstrating the potential of delta action learning in bridging simulation and real-world dynamics. These results suggest a promising sim-to-real direction for developing more expressive and agile humanoids.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an explicit solution to the discrete-time Bellman equation for minimax optimal control of positive systems under unconstrained disturbances. The primary contribution of our result relies on deducing a bound for the disturbance penalty, which characterizes the existence of a finite solution to the problem class. Moreover, this constraint on the disturbance penalty reveals that, in scenarios where a solution is feasible, the problem converges to its equivalent minimization problem in the absence of disturbances.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous surface vessels are a promising building block of the future's transport sector and are investigated by research groups worldwide. This paper presents a comprehensive and systematic overview of the autonomous research vessel Solgenia including the latest investigations and recently presented methods that contributed to the fields of autonomous systems, applied numerical optimization, nonlinear model predictive control, multi-extended-object-tracking, computer vision, and collision avoidance. These are considered to be the main components of autonomous water taxi applications. Autonomous water taxis have the potential to transform the traffic in cities close to the water into a more efficient, sustainable, and flexible future state. Regarding this transformation, the test platform Solgenia offers an opportunity to gain new insights by investigating novel methods in real-world experiments. An established test platform will strongly reduce the effort required for real-world experiments in the future.</description>

      <title>Optimization-based Coordination of Traffic Lights and Automated Vehicles at Intersections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper tackles the challenge of coordinating traffic lights and automated vehicles at signalized intersections, formulated as a constrained finite-horizon optimal control problem. The problem falls into the category of mixed-integer nonlinear programming, posing challenges for solving large instances. To address this, we introduce a decomposition approach consisting of an upper-level problem for traffic light timing allocation and a set of lower-level problems that generate appropriate commands for automated vehicles in each intersection movement. By leveraging solutions from the lower-level problems and employing parametric optimization techniques, we solve the upper-level problem using a standard sequential quadratic programming approach. The paper concludes by presenting an illustrative numerical example that highlights the effectiveness of our algorithm compared to scenarios where no coordination between traffic lights and vehicles exists.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The coherent equalization problem consists in designing a quantum system acting as a mean-square near optimal filter for a given quantum communication channel. The paper develops an improved method for the synthesis of transfer functions for such equalizing filters, based on a linear quantum system model of the channel. The method draws on a connection with the two-disk problem of ${H}_{\infty}$ control for classical (i.e., nonquantum) linear uncertain systems. Compared with the previous methods, the proposed method applies to a broader class of linear quantum communication channels.</description>

      <title>Alternating direction method of multipliers for polynomial optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multivariate polynomial optimization is a prevalent model for a number of engineering problems. From a mathematical viewpoint, polynomial optimization is challenging because it is non-convex. The Lasserre's theory, based on semidefinite relaxations, provides an effective tool to overcome this issue and to achieve the global optimum. However, this approach can be computationally complex for medium and large scale problems. For this motivation, in this work, we investigate a local minimization approach, based on the alternating direction method of multipliers, which is low-complex, straightforward to implement, and prone to decentralization. The core of the work is the development of the algorithm tailored to polynomial optimization, along with the proof of its convergence. Through a numerical example we show a practical implementation and test the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm with respect to state-of-the-art methodologies.</description>

      <title>Embrace Collisions: Humanoid Shadowing for Deployable Contact-Agnostics Motions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Previous humanoid robot research works treat the robot as a bipedal mobile manipulation platform, where only the feet and hands contact the environment. However, we humans use all body parts to interact with the world, e.g., we sit in chairs, get up from the ground, or roll on the floor. Contacting the environment using body parts other than feet and hands brings significant challenges in both model-predictive control and reinforcement learning-based methods. An unpredictable contact sequence makes it almost impossible for model-predictive control to plan ahead in real time. The success of the zero-shot sim-to-real reinforcement learning method for humanoids heavily depends on the acceleration of GPU-based rigid-body physical simulator and simplification of the collision detection. Lacking extreme torso movement of the humanoid research makes all other components non-trivial to design, such as termination conditions, motion commands and reward designs. To address these potential challenges, we propose a general humanoid motion framework that takes discrete motion commands and controls the robot's motor action in real time. Using a GPU-accelerated rigid-body simulator, we train a humanoid whole-body control policy that follows the high-level motion command in the real world in real time, even with stochastic contacts and extremely large robot base rotation and not-so-feasible motion command.

      <title>Dynamic object goal pushing with mobile manipulators through model-free constrained reinforcement learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-prehensile pushing to move and reorient objects to a goal is a versatile loco-manipulation skill. In the real world, the object's physical properties and friction with the floor contain significant uncertainties, which makes the task challenging for a mobile manipulator. In this paper, we develop a learning-based controller for a mobile manipulator to move an unknown object to a desired position and yaw orientation through a sequence of pushing actions. The proposed controller for the robotic arm and the mobile base motion is trained using a constrained Reinforcement Learning (RL) formulation. We demonstrate its capability in experiments with a quadrupedal robot equipped with an arm. The learned policy achieves a success rate of 91.35% in simulation and at least 80% on hardware in challenging scenarios. Through our extensive hardware experiments, we show that the approach demonstrates high robustness against unknown objects of different masses, materials, sizes, and shapes. It reactively discovers the pushing location and direction, thus achieving contact-rich behavior while observing only the pose of the object. Additionally, we demonstrate the adaptive behavior of the learned policy towards preventing the object from toppling.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning with Model Predictive Control for Highway Ramp Metering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08820v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the backdrop of an increasingly pressing need for effective urban and highway transportation systems, this work explores the synergy between model-based and learning-based strategies to enhance traffic flow management by use of an innovative approach to the problem of ramp metering control that embeds Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques within the Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework. The control problem is formulated as an RL task by crafting a suitable stage cost function that is representative of the traffic conditions, variability in the control action, and violations of the constraint on the maximum number of vehicles in queue. An MPC-based RL approach, which leverages the MPC optimal problem as a function approximation for the RL algorithm, is proposed to learn to efficiently control an on-ramp and satisfy its constraints despite uncertainties in the system model and variable demands. Simulations are performed on a benchmark small-scale highway network to compare the proposed methodology against other state-of-the-art control approaches. Results show that, starting from an MPC controller that has an imprecise model and is poorly tuned, the proposed methodology is able to effectively learn to improve the control policy such that congestion in the network is reduced and constraints are satisfied, yielding an improved performance that is superior to the other controllers.</description>

      <title>The Fragile Nature of Road Transportation Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00924v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Major cities worldwide experience problems with the performance of their road transportation systems, and the continuous increase in traffic demand presents a substantial challenge to the optimal operation of urban road networks and the efficiency of traffic control strategies. The operation of transportation systems is widely considered to display fragile property, i.e., the loss in performance increases exponentially with the linearly increasing magnitude of disruptions. Meanwhile, the risk engineering community is embracing the novel concept of antifragility, enabling systems to learn from historical disruptions and exhibit improved performance under black swan events. In this study, based on established traffic models, namely fundamental diagrams and macroscopic fundamental diagrams, we first conducted a rigorous mathematical analysis to prove the fragile nature of the systems theoretically. Subsequently, we propose a skewness-based indicator that can be readily applied to cross-compare the degree of fragility for different networks solely dependent on the MFD-related parameters. At last, by taking real-world stochasticity into account, we implemented a numerical simulation with realistic network data to bridge the gap between the theoretical proof and the real-world operations, to reflect the potential impact of uncertainty on the fragility of the systems. This work aims to demonstrate the fragile nature of road transportation systems and help researchers better comprehend the necessity to consider explicitly antifragile design for future traffic control strategies.</description>

      <title>A Discrete-Time Least-Squares Adaptive State Tracking Control Scheme with A Mobile-Robot System Study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17235v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper develops an adaptive state tracking control scheme for discrete-time systems, using the least-squares algorithm, as the new solution to the long-standing discrete-time adaptive state tracking control problem to which the Lyapunov method (well-developed for the continuous-time adaptive state tracking problem) is not applicable. The new adaptive state tracking scheme is based on a recently-developed new discrete-time error model which has been used for gradient algorithm based state tracking control schemes, and uses the least-squares algorithm for parameter adaptation. The new least-squares algorithm is derived to minimize an accumulative estimation error, to ensure certain optimality for parameter estimation. The system stability and output tracking properties are studied. Technical results are presented in terms of plant-model matching, error model, adaptive law, optimality formulation, and stability and tracking analysis. The developed adaptive control scheme is applied to a discrete-time multiple mobile robot system to meet an adaptive state tracking objective. In addition, a collision avoidance mechanism is proposed to prevent collisions in the whole tracking process. Simulation results are presented, which verify the desired system state tracking properties under the developed least-squares algorithm based adaptive control scheme.</description>

      <title>Stability And Uncertainty Propagation In Power Networks: A Lyapunov-based Approach With Applications To Renewable Resources Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05028v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid increase in the integration of intermittent and stochastic renewable energy resources (RER) introduces challenging issues related to power system stability. Interestingly, identifying grid nodes that can best support stochastic loads from RER, has gained recent interest. Methods based on Lyapunov stability are commonly exploited to assess the stability of power networks. These strategies approach quantifying system stability while considering: (i) simplified reduced order power system models that do not model power flow constraints, or (ii) data-driven methods that are prone to measurement noise and hence can inaccurately depict stochastic loads as system instability. In this paper, while considering a nonlinear differential algebraic equation (NL-DAE) model, we introduce a new method for assessing the impact of uncertain renewable power injections on the stability of power system nodes/buses. The identification of stable nodes informs the operator/utility on how renewables injections affect the stability of the grid. The proposed method is based on optimizing metrics equivalent to the Lyapunov spectrum of exponents; its underlying properties result in a computationally efficient and scalable stable node identification algorithm for renewable energy resources allocation. The developed framework is studied on various standard power networks.</description>

Abstract: This paper focuses on describing the impact of policy actions on individuals' opinions in the presence of social and external influences toward proposing preliminary nudging strategies to achieve a cost-effectiveness trade-off. To this end, we extend the classical Friedkin and Johnsen model of opinion dynamics to incorporate random factors, such as variability in individual predispositions due to uncontrolled events (e.g., modeling the impact of the weather on daily mobility choices), and describe the impact of personalized policies. Furthermore, we formulate an optimal control problem aimed at fostering the social acceptance of particular actions/choices within the network. Through our analysis and numerical simulations, we illustrate the features of the proposed model in the absence of nudging and the effectiveness of the proposed (optimal) nudging strategies.</description>

      <title>Predict. Optimize. Revise. On Forecast and Policy Stability in Energy Management Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03368v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This research addresses the challenge of integrating forecasting and optimization in energy management systems, focusing on the impacts of switching costs, forecast accuracy, and stability. It proposes a novel framework for analyzing online optimization problems with switching costs and enabled by deterministic and probabilistic forecasts. Through empirical evaluation and theoretical analysis, the research reveals the balance between forecast accuracy, stability, and switching costs in shaping policy performance. Conducted in the context of battery scheduling within energy management applications, it introduces a metric for evaluating probabilistic forecast stability and examines the effects of forecast accuracy and stability on optimization outcomes using the real-world case of the Citylearn 2022 competition. Findings indicate that switching costs significantly influence the trade-off between forecast accuracy and stability, highlighting the importance of integrated systems that enable collaboration between forecasting and operational units for improved decision-making. The study shows that committing to a policy for longer periods can be advantageous over frequent updates. Results also show a correlation between forecast stability and policy performance, suggesting that stable forecasts can mitigate switching costs. The proposed framework provides valuable insights for energy sector decision-makers and forecast practitioners when designing the operation of an energy management system.</description>

      <title>Certifiable Reachability Learning Using a New Lipschitz Continuous Value Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07866v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new reachability learning framework for high-dimensional nonlinear systems, focusing on reach-avoid problems. These problems require computing the reach-avoid set, which ensures that all its elements can safely reach a target set despite disturbances within pre-specified bounds. Our framework has two main parts: offline learning of a newly designed reachavoid value function, and post-learning certification. Compared to prior work, our new value function is Lipschitz continuous and its associated Bellman operator is a contraction mapping, both of which improve the learning performance. To ensure deterministic guarantees of our learned reach-avoid set, we introduce two efficient post-learning certification methods. Both methods can be used online for real-time local certification or offline for comprehensive certification. We validate our framework in a 12-dimensional crazyflie drone racing hardware experiment and a simulated 10-dimensional highway take-over example.</description>

      <title>Satellite Safe Margin: Fast solutions for Conjunction Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24092v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The amount of debris in orbit has increased significantly over the years. With the recent growth of interest in space exploration, conjunction assessment has become a central issue. One important metric to evaluate conjunction risk is the miss distance. However, this metric does not intrinsically take into account uncertainty distributions. Some work has been developed to consider the uncertainty associated with the position of the orbiting objects, in particular, to know if these uncertainty distributions overlap (e.g., ellipsoids when considering Gaussian distributions). With this work, we present fast solutions to not only check if the ellipsoids overlap but to compute the distance between them, which we call margin. We present two fast solution methods for two different paradigms: when the best-known data from both objects can be centralized (e.g., debris-satellite conjunctions) and when the most precise covariances cannot be shared (conjunctions of satellites owned by different operators). Our methods are both accurate and fast, being able to process 15,000 conjunctions per minute with the centralized solution and approximately 490 conjunctions per minute with the distributed solution.</description>

      <title>Constraint-Driven Multi-USV Coverage Path Generation for Aquatic Environmental Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00579v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we address aquatic environmental monitoring using a fleet of unmanned surface vehicles (USVs). Specifically, we develop an online path generator that provides either of circular or elliptic paths based on the real-time feedback so that the USVs efficiently sample the sensor data over given aquatic environment. To this end, we begin by formulating a novel online path generation problem for a group of Dubins vehicles in the form of cost minimization based on the formulation of persistent coverage control. We then transform the cost minimization into a constraint-based specification so that a prescribed performance level is certified. An online coverage path generator is then designed based on the so-called constraint-based control in order to meet the performance certificate together with additional constraints inherent in the parameters that specify the paths. It is also shown there that the present constraint-based approach allows one to drastically reduce the computational complexity stemming from combinations of binary variables corresponding to the turning directions of the USVs. The present coverage path generator is finally demonstrated through simulations and experiments on an original testbed of multiple USVs.</description>

      <title>Weak synchronization in heterogeneous multi-agent systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13806v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new framework for synchronization of heterogeneous multi agent system which we refer to as weak synchronization. This new framework of synchronization is based on achieving the network stability in the absence of any information on communication network including the connectivity. Here by network stability, we mean that in the basic setup of a multi-agent system, we require that the signals exchanged over the network converge to zero. As such if the network happens to have a directed spanning tree then we obtain classical synchronization. Moreover, we design protocols which achieve weak synchronization for any network without making any kind of assumptions on communication network. If the network happens to have a directed spanning tree, then we obtain classical synchronization. However, if this is not the case then we describe in detail in this paper what kind of synchronization properties are preserved in the system and the output of the different agents can behave.</description>

      <title>Non-Asymptotic Analysis of Subspace Identification for Stochastic Systems Using Multiple Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18853v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the analysis of identification errors for $n$-dimensional discrete-time Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) systems with $m$ outputs and no external inputs, using Subspace Identification Methods (SIM) with finite sample data. We provide non-asymptotic high-probability upper bounds for matrices $A,C$, the Kalman filter gain $K$, and the closed loop matrix $A-KC $, based on multiple sample trajectories, and further give the first non-asymptotic high-probability upper bounds for the system poles, which cover both (marginally) stable systems and unstable systems. We show that, with high probability, the non-asymptotic estimation errors of these matrices decay at a rate of at least $ \mathcal{O}(\sqrt{1/N}) $, while the estimation error of the system poles decays at a rate of at least $ \mathcal{O}(N^{\frac{1}{2n}}) $, where $ N $ represents the number of sample trajectories. Furthermore, we prove that SIMs become ill-conditioned when the ratio $n/m$ is large, regardless of the system parameters. Numerical experiments are conducted to validate the non-asymptotic results and the ill-conditionedness of SIM.</description>

      <title>Near-Optimal Performance of Stochastic Model Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.08599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.08599v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article presents a dynamic regret analysis for stochastic model predictive control (SMPC) in linear systems with quadratic performance index and additive and multiplicative uncertainties. Under a finite support assumption, the problem can be cast as a finite-dimensional quadratic program, but the problem becomes quickly intractable as the problem size grows exponentially in the horizon length. SMPC aims to compute approximate solutions by solving a sequence of problems with truncated prediction horizons and committing the solution in a receding-horizon fashion. While this approach is widely used in practice, its performance relative to the optimal solution is not well understood. This article reports for the first time a rigorous near-optimal performance guarantee of SMPC: Under stabilizability and detectability conditions, the dynamic regret of SMPC is exponentially small in the prediction horizon length, allowing SMPC to achieve near-optimal performance at a substantially reduced computational expense.</description>

      <title>Distributional Soft Actor-Critic with Three Refinements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.05858v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown remarkable success in solving complex decision-making and control tasks. However, many model-free RL algorithms experience performance degradation due to inaccurate value estimation, particularly the overestimation of Q-values, which can lead to suboptimal policies. To address this issue, we previously proposed the Distributional Soft Actor-Critic (DSAC or DSACv1), an off-policy RL algorithm that enhances value estimation accuracy by learning a continuous Gaussian value distribution. Despite its effectiveness, DSACv1 faces challenges such as training instability and sensitivity to reward scaling, caused by high variance in critic gradients due to return randomness. In this paper, we introduce three key refinements to DSACv1 to overcome these limitations and further improve Q-value estimation accuracy: expected value substitution, twin value distribution learning, and variance-based critic gradient adjustment. The enhanced algorithm, termed DSAC with Three refinements (DSAC-T or DSACv2), is systematically evaluated across a diverse set of benchmark tasks. Without the need for task-specific hyperparameter tuning, DSAC-T consistently matches or outperforms leading model-free RL algorithms, including SAC, TD3, DDPG, TRPO, and PPO, in all tested environments. Additionally, DSAC-T ensures a stable learning process and maintains robust performance across varying reward scales. Its effectiveness is further demonstrated through real-world application in controlling a wheeled robot, highlighting its potential for deployment in practical robotic tasks.</description>

      <title>Predictable Reinforcement Learning Dynamics through Entropy Rate Minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18703v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In Reinforcement Learning (RL), agents have no incentive to exhibit predictable behaviors, and are often pushed (through e.g. policy entropy regularisation) to randomise their actions in favor of exploration. This often makes it challenging for other agents and humans to predict an agent's behavior, triggering unsafe scenarios (e.g. in human-robot interaction). We propose a novel method to induce predictable behavior in RL agents, termed Predictability-Aware RL (PARL), employing the agent's trajectory entropy rate to quantify predictability. Our method maximizes a linear combination of a standard discounted reward and the negative entropy rate, thus trading off optimality with predictability. We show how the entropy rate can be formally cast as an average reward, how entropy-rate value functions can be estimated from a learned model and incorporate this in policy-gradient algorithms, and demonstrate how this approach produces predictable (near-optimal) policies in tasks inspired by human-robot use-cases.</description>

      <title>Metareasoning in uncertain environments: a meta-BAMDP framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01253v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: \textit{Reasoning} may be viewed as an algorithm $P$ that makes a choice of an action $a^* \in \mathcal{A}$, aiming to optimize some outcome. However, executing $P$ itself bears costs (time, energy, limited capacity, etc.) and needs to be considered alongside explicit utility obtained by making the choice in the underlying decision problem. Finding the right $P$ can itself be framed as an optimization problem over the space of reasoning processes $P$, generally referred to as \textit{metareasoning}. Conventionally, human metareasoning models assume that the agent knows the transition and reward distributions of the underlying MDP. This paper generalizes such models by proposing a meta Bayes-Adaptive MDP (meta-BAMDP) framework to handle metareasoning in environments with unknown reward/transition distributions, which encompasses a far larger and more realistic set of planning problems that humans and AI systems face. As a first step, we apply the framework to Bernoulli bandit tasks. Owing to the meta problem's complexity, our solutions are necessarily approximate. However, we introduce two novel theorems that significantly enhance the tractability of the problem, enabling stronger approximations that are robust within a range of assumptions grounded in realistic human decision-making scenarios. These results offer a resource-rational perspective and a normative framework for understanding human exploration under cognitive constraints, as well as providing experimentally testable predictions about human behavior in Bernoulli Bandit tasks.</description>

      <title>GUIDEd Agents: Enhancing Navigation Policies through Task-Specific Uncertainty Abstraction in Localization-Limited Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15178v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autonomous vehicles performing navigation tasks in complex environments face significant challenges due to uncertainty in state estimation. In many scenarios, such as stealth operations or resource-constrained settings, accessing high-precision localization comes at a significant cost, forcing robots to rely primarily on less precise state estimates. Our key observation is that different tasks require varying levels of precision in different regions: a robot navigating a crowded space might need precise localization near obstacles but can operate effectively with less precision elsewhere. In this paper, we present a planning method for integrating task-specific uncertainty requirements directly into navigation policies. We introduce Task-Specific Uncertainty Maps (TSUMs), which abstract the acceptable levels of state estimation uncertainty across different regions. TSUMs align task requirements and environmental features using a shared representation space, generated via a domain-adapted encoder. Using TSUMs, we propose Generalized Uncertainty Integration for Decision-Making and Execution (GUIDE), a policy conditioning framework that incorporates these uncertainty requirements into robot decision-making. We find that TSUMs provide an effective way to abstract task-specific uncertainty requirements, and conditioning policies on TSUMs enables the robot to reason about the context-dependent value of certainty and adapt its behavior accordingly. We show how integrating GUIDE into reinforcement learning frameworks allows the agent to learn navigation policies that effectively balance task completion and uncertainty management without explicit reward engineering. We evaluate GUIDE on various real-world robotic navigation tasks and find that it demonstrates significant improvement in task completion rates compared to baseline methods that do not explicitly consider task-specific uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Learning Multiple Initial Solutions to Optimization Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02158v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sequentially solving similar optimization problems under strict runtime constraints is essential for many applications, such as robot control, autonomous driving, and portfolio management. The performance of local optimization methods in these settings is sensitive to the initial solution: poor initialization can lead to slow convergence or suboptimal solutions. To address this challenge, we propose learning to predict \emph{multiple} diverse initial solutions given parameters that define the problem instance. We introduce two strategies for utilizing multiple initial solutions: (i) a single-optimizer approach, where the most promising initial solution is chosen using a selection function, and (ii) a multiple-optimizers approach, where several optimizers, potentially run in parallel, are each initialized with a different solution, with the best solution chosen afterward. Notably, by including a default initialization among predicted ones, the cost of the final output is guaranteed to be equal or lower than with the default initialization. We validate our method on three optimal control benchmark tasks: cart-pole, reacher, and autonomous driving, using different optimizers: DDP, MPPI, and iLQR. We find significant and consistent improvement with our method across all evaluation settings and demonstrate that it efficiently scales with the number of initial solutions required. The code is available at MISO (https://github.com/EladSharony/miso).</description>

      <title>Learning and Reconstructing Conflicts in O-RAN: A Graph Neural Network Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14119v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) architecture enables the deployment of third-party applications on the RAN Intelligent Controllers (RICs). However, the operation of third-party applications in the Near Real-Time RIC (Near-RT RIC), known as xApps, may result in conflicting interactions. Each xApp can independently modify the same control parameters to achieve distinct outcomes, which has the potential to cause performance degradation and network instability. The current conflict detection and mitigation solutions in the literature assume that all conflicts are known a priori, which does not always hold due to complex and often hidden relationships between control parameters and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). In this paper, we introduce the first data-driven method for reconstructing and labeling conflict graphs in O-RAN. Specifically, we leverage GraphSAGE, an inductive learning framework, to dynamically learn the hidden relationships between xApps, parameters, and KPIs. Our numerical results, based on a conflict model used in the O-RAN conflict management literature, demonstrate that our proposed method can effectively reconstruct conflict graphs and identify the conflicts defined by the O-RAN Alliance.</description>
