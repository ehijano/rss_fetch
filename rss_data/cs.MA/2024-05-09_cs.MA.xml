      <title>Mitigating Negative Side Effects in Multi-Agent Systems Using Blame Assignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When agents that are independently trained (or designed) to complete their individual tasks are deployed in a shared environment, their joint actions may produce negative side effects (NSEs). As their training does not account for the behavior of other agents or their joint action effects on the environment, the agents have no prior knowledge of the NSEs of their actions. We model the problem of mitigating NSEs in a cooperative multi-agent system as a Lexicographic Decentralized Markov Decision Process with two objectives. The agents must optimize the completion of their assigned tasks while mitigating NSEs. We assume independence of transitions and rewards with respect to the agents' tasks but the joint NSE penalty creates a form of dependence in this setting. To improve scalability, the joint NSE penalty is decomposed into individual penalties for each agent using credit assignment, which facilitates decentralized policy computation. Our results in simulation on three domains demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of our approach in mitigating NSEs by updating the policies of a subset of agents in the system.</description>

      <title>Fair Voting Outcomes with Impact and Novelty Compromises? Unraveling Biases of Equal Shares in Participatory Budgeting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Participatory budgeting, as a paradigm for democratic innovations, engages citizens in the distribution of a public budget to projects, which they propose and vote for implementation. So far, voting algorithms have been devised and studied in social choice literature to elect projects that are popular, while others prioritize on a proportional representation of voters' preferences, for instance, equal shares. However, the anticipated impact and novelty in the broader society by the winning projects, as selected by different algorithms, remains totally under-explored, lacking both a universal theory of impact for voting and a rigorous framework for impact and novelty assessments. This papers tackles this grand challenge towards new axiomatic foundations for designing effective and fair voting methods. This is via new and striking insights derived from a large-scale analysis of biases over 345 real-world voting outcomes, characterized for the first time by a novel portfolio of impact and novelty metrics. We find strong causal evidence that equal shares comes with impact loss in several infrastructural projects of different cost levels that have been so far over-represented. However, it also comes with a novel, yet over-represented, impact gain in welfare, education and culture. We discuss broader implications of these results and how impact loss can be mitigated at the stage of campaign design and project ideation.</description>

      <title>Pipe Routing with Topology Control for UAV Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Routing protocols help in transmitting the sensed data from UAVs monitoring the targets (called target UAVs) to the BS. However, the highly dynamic nature of an autonomous, decentralized UAV network leads to frequent route breaks or traffic disruptions. Traditional routing schemes cannot quickly adapt to dynamic UAV networks and/or incur large control overhead and delays. To establish stable, high-quality routes from target UAVs to the BS, we design a hybrid reactive routing scheme called pipe routing that is mobility, congestion, and energy-aware. The pipe routing scheme discovers routes on-demand and proactively switches to alternate high-quality routes within a limited region around the active routes (called the pipe) when needed, reducing the number of route breaks and increasing data throughput. We then design a novel topology control-based pipe routing scheme to maintain robust connectivity in the pipe region around the active routes, leading to improved route stability and increased throughput with minimal impact on the coverage performance of the UAV network.</description>

      <title>Communication-Efficient Collaborative Perception via Information Filling with Codebook</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collaborative perception empowers each agent to improve its perceptual ability through the exchange of perceptual messages with other agents. It inherently results in a fundamental trade-off between perception ability and communication cost. To address this bottleneck issue, our core idea is to optimize the collaborative messages from two key aspects: representation and selection. The proposed codebook-based message representation enables the transmission of integer codes, rather than high-dimensional feature maps. The proposed information-filling-driven message selection optimizes local messages to collectively fill each agent's information demand, preventing information overflow among multiple agents. By integrating these two designs, we propose CodeFilling, a novel communication-efficient collaborative perception system, which significantly advances the perception-communication trade-off and is inclusive to both homogeneous and heterogeneous collaboration settings. We evaluate CodeFilling in both a real-world dataset, DAIR-V2X, and a new simulation dataset, OPV2VH+. Results show that CodeFilling outperforms previous SOTA Where2comm on DAIR-V2X/OPV2VH+ with 1,333/1,206 times lower communication volume. Our code is available at https://github.com/PhyllisH/CodeFilling.</description>

      <title>LLMs with Personalities in Multi-issue Negotiation Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Powered by large language models (LLMs), AI agents have become capable of many human tasks. Using the most canonical definitions of the Big Five personality, we measure the ability of LLMs to negotiate within a game-theoretical framework, as well as methodological challenges to measuring notions of fairness and risk. Simulations (n=1,500) for both single-issue and multi-issue negotiation reveal increase in domain complexity with asymmetric issue valuations improve agreement rates but decrease surplus from aggressive negotiation. Through gradient-boosted regression and Shapley explainers, we find high openness, conscientiousness, and neuroticism are associated with fair tendencies; low agreeableness and low openness are associated with rational tendencies. Low conscientiousness is associated with high toxicity. These results indicate that LLMs may have built-in guardrails that default to fair behavior, but can be "jail broken" to exploit agreeable opponents. We also offer pragmatic insight in how negotiation bots can be designed, and a framework of assessing negotiation behavior based on game theory and computational social science.</description>

      <title>Composite Distributed Learning and Synchronization of Nonlinear Multi-Agent Systems with Complete Uncertain Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00987v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of composite synchronization and learning control in a network of multi-agent robotic manipulator systems with heterogeneous nonlinear uncertainties under a leader-follower framework. A novel two-layer distributed adaptive learning control strategy is introduced, comprising a first-layer distributed cooperative estimator and a second-layer decentralized deterministic learning controller. The first layer is to facilitate each robotic agent's estimation of the leader's information. The second layer is responsible for both controlling individual robot agents to track desired reference trajectories and accurately identifying/learning their nonlinear uncertain dynamics. The proposed distributed learning control scheme represents an advancement in the existing literature due to its ability to manage robotic agents with completely uncertain dynamics including uncertain mass matrices. This allows the robotic control to be environment-independent which can be used in various settings, from underwater to space where identifying system dynamics parameters is challenging. The stability and parameter convergence of the closed-loop system are rigorously analyzed using the Lyapunov method. Numerical simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.</description>

      <title>Major-Minor Mean Field Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.10665v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) remains difficult to scale to many agents. Recent MARL using Mean Field Control (MFC) provides a tractable and rigorous approach to otherwise difficult cooperative MARL. However, the strict MFC assumption of many independent, weakly-interacting agents is too inflexible in practice. We generalize MFC to instead simultaneously model many similar and few complex agents -- as Major-Minor Mean Field Control (M3FC). Theoretically, we give approximation results for finite agent control, and verify the sufficiency of stationary policies for optimality together with a dynamic programming principle. Algorithmically, we propose Major-Minor Mean Field MARL (M3FMARL) for finite agent systems instead of the limiting system. The algorithm is shown to approximate the policy gradient of the underlying M3FC MDP. Finally, we demonstrate its capabilities experimentally in various scenarios. We observe a strong performance in comparison to state-of-the-art policy gradient MARL methods.</description>

      <title>Scalable Mechanism Design for Multi-Agent Path Finding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17044v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) involves determining paths for multiple agents to travel simultaneously and collision-free through a shared area toward given goal locations. This problem is computationally complex, especially when dealing with large numbers of agents, as is common in realistic applications like autonomous vehicle coordination. Finding an optimal solution is often computationally infeasible, making the use of approximate, suboptimal algorithms essential. Adding to the complexity, agents might act in a self-interested and strategic way, possibly misrepresenting their goals to the MAPF algorithm if it benefits them. Although the field of mechanism design offers tools to align incentives, using these tools without careful consideration can fail when only having access to approximately optimal outcomes. In this work, we introduce the problem of scalable mechanism design for MAPF and propose three strategyproof mechanisms, two of which even use approximate MAPF algorithms. We test our mechanisms on realistic MAPF domains with problem sizes ranging from dozens to hundreds of agents. We find that they improve welfare beyond a simple baseline.</description>

      <title>Unconstraining Multi-Robot Manipulation: Enabling Arbitrary Constraints in ECBS with Bounded Sub-Optimality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01772v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-Robot-Arm Motion Planning (M-RAMP) is a challenging problem featuring complex single-agent planning and multi-agent coordination. Recent advancements in extending the popular Conflict-Based Search (CBS) algorithm have made large strides in solving Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) problems. However, fundamental challenges remain in applying CBS to M-RAMP. A core challenge is the existing reliance of the CBS framework on conservative "complete" constraints. These constraints ensure solution guarantees but often result in slow pruning of the search space -- causing repeated expensive single-agent planning calls. Therefore, even though it is possible to leverage domain knowledge and design incomplete M-RAMP-specific CBS constraints to more efficiently prune the search, using these constraints would render the algorithm itself incomplete. This forces practitioners to choose between efficiency and completeness.
  In light of these challenges, we propose a novel algorithm, Generalized ECBS, aimed at removing the burden of choice between completeness and efficiency in MAPF algorithms. Our approach enables the use of arbitrary constraints in conflict-based algorithms while preserving completeness and bounding sub-optimality. This enables practitioners to capitalize on the benefits of arbitrary constraints and opens a new space for constraint design in MAPF that has not been explored. We provide a theoretical analysis of our algorithms, propose new "incomplete" constraints, and demonstrate their effectiveness through experiments in M-RAMP.</description>
