      <title>QSAFE-V: Quantum-Enhanced Lightweight Authentication Protocol Design for Vehicular Tactile Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of 6G technology, the Tactile Internet is emerging as a novel paradigm of interaction, particularly in intelligent transportation systems, where stringent demands for ultra-low latency and high reliability are prevalent. During the transmission and coordination of autonomous vehicles, malicious adversaries may attempt to compromise control commands or swarm behavior, posing severe threats to road safety and vehicular intelligence. Many existing authentication schemes claim to provide security against conventional attacks. However, recent developments in quantum computing have revealed critical vulnerabilities in these schemes, particularly under quantum-enabled adversarial models. In this context, the design of a quantum-secured, lightweight authentication scheme that is adaptable to vehicular mobility becomes essential. This paper proposes QSAFE-V, a quantum-secured authentication framework for edge-enabled vehicles that surpasses traditional security models. We conduct formal security proofs based on quantum key distribution and quantum adversary models, and also perform context-driven reauthentication analysis based on vehicular behavior. The output of quantum resilience evaluations indicates that QSAFE-V provides robust protection against quantum and contextual attacks. Furthermore, detailed performance analysis reveals that QSAFE-V achieves comparable communication and computation costs to classical schemes, while offering significantly stronger security guarantees under wireless Tactile Internet conditions.</description>

      <title>Cyclic brace relation and BV structure on open-closed Hochschild cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For an open-closed homotopy algebra (OCHA), the previous work indicates that there is an open-closed version of Hochschild cohomology with a canonical Gerstenhaber algebra structure. If this OCHA is further cyclic and unital in the sense of Kajiura and Stasheff, we produce a BV algebra structure on this cohomology via a cochain-level identity formulated with cyclic brace operations.</description>

      <title>Pivotal Brauer-Picard groupoids and graded extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop pivotal and spherical versions of graded extension theory. We define the corresponding analogues of Brauer-Picard $2$-categorical groups and realize them as fixed points of natural $\mathbb{Z}$ and $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$ $2$-categorical actions. We classify graded extensions of a pivotal tensor category by monoidal $2$-functors into the pivotal Brauer-Picard $2$-categorical group. A similar statement is proven for spherical (unimodular) tensor categories. We also develop an obstruction theory for determining when pivotal structures can be extended.</description>

      <title>Jacobi identities for Wronskian determinants over multidimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The generalised Wronskian of differential order $k\geqslant 1$ for $N$ functions $f_1$, $\ldots$, $f_N$ in $d\geqslant 1$ independent variables $x^1$, $\ldots$, $x^d$ is the determinant of the matrix with these functions' derivatives $\partial^{|\sigma_i|} f_j / \partial (x^1)^{\sigma_i^1}\cdots \partial (x^d)^{\sigma_i^d}$ (of orders $0 \leqslant |\sigma_i| \leqslant k$), where the multi-indices $\sigma_i$ mark (all or part of) fibre variables $u_{\sigma_i}$ in the $k$th jet space $J^k\bigl(\mathbb{R}^d\to\mathbb{R}\bigr)$. We prove that these (in)complete Wronskians -- provided that their lowest-order parts are complete at differential orders $\ell\leqslant 1$ -- over the $d$-dimensional base satisfy the table of bi-linear, Jacobi-type identities for Schlessinger--Stasheff's strongly homotopy Lie algebras.</description>

      <title>Quantum Entanglement as a Cohomological Obstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We recast quantum entanglement as a cohomological obstruction to reconstructing a global quantum state from locally compatible information. We address this by considering presheaf cohomologies of states and entanglement witnesses. Sheafification erases the global-from-local signature while leaving within-patch multipartite structure, captured by local entanglement groups introduced here. For smooth parameter families, the obstruction admits a differential-geometric representative obtained by pairing an appropriate witness field with the curvature of a natural unitary connection on the associated bundle of amplitudes. We also introduce a Quantum Entanglement Index (QEI) as an index-theoretic invariant of entangled states and explain its behavior. Finally, we outline a theoretical physics approach to probe these ideas in quantum many-body systems and suggest a possible entanglement-induced correction as an experimental target.</description>

      <title>On singular vectors of simply-laced universal affine vertex operator algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04445v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a finite-dimensional complex simple Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ and a complex number $\kappa$, let $V^{\kappa}(\mathfrak{g})$ be the associated universal affine vertex algebra. In [GK07], the authors gave a sufficient and necessary condition for $V^{\kappa}(\mathfrak{g})$ to be simple. In this paper, we determine the weights of singular vectors of $V^{\kappa}(\mathfrak{g})$ with minimal conformal weights, when $\mathfrak{g}$ is simply-laced and $V^{\kappa}(\mathfrak{g})$ is not simple.</description>

      <title>Cohomological Hall algebras, their categorification, and their representations via torsion pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.08926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.08926v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we provide a systematic way of producing representations of cohomological, K-theoretical and categorified Hall algebras, and study the output of our construction in several cases. We thus recover and categorify in a unified framework the action of the COHA of a quiver on the cohomology of Nakajima quiver variety, the action of the COHA of zero-dimensional sheaves on the the cohomology of Hilbert schemes of points and moduli spaces of Gieseker-stable sheaves on smooth surfaces, recovering the constructions of Negu\c{t} and DeHority. We also obtain new examples, associated to Pandharipande-Thomas stable pairs.
  Along the way, we explain carefully under which conditions one can associate to a pair $(\mathscr{C},\tau)$ consisting of a stable $\infty$-category with a t-structure a COHA. This requires a careful analysis and extension of Khan's theory of motivic Borel-Moore homology to the non quasi-compact setting, and it allows to produce new examples of COHAs arising from Bridgeland's stability conditions.
  The representations that we construct take an extra categorical input: that of a torsion pair $(\mathscr{T},\mathscr{F})$ on the heart $\mathscr{C}^\heartsuit$ of $\tau$. Under favorable conditions, the homology of the moduli stack associated to $\mathscr{T}$ acquires a Hall multiplication, that acts both on the left and on the right on the homology of the moduli stack associated to $\mathscr{F}$. The left action generalizes and categorifies Nakajima's positive operators, while the right action corresponds to negative operators.</description>

      <title>Twisted Knots and the Perturbed Alexander Invariant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03754v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The perturbed Alexander invariant $\rho_1$, defined by Bar-Natan and van der Veen, is a powerful, easily computable polynomial knot invariant with deep connections to the Alexander and colored Jones polynomials. We study the behavior of $\rho_1$ for families of knots $\{K_t\}$ given by performing $t$ full twists on a set of coherently oriented strands in a knot $K_0 \subset S^3$. We prove that as $t \to \infty$ the coefficients of $\rho_1$ grow asymptotically linearly, and we show how to compute this growth rate for any such family. As an application we give the first theorem on the ability of $\rho_1$ to distinguish knots in infinite families, and we conjecture that $\rho_1$ obstructs knot positivity via a "perturbed Conway invariant." Along the way we expand on a model of random walks on knot diagrams defined by Lin, Tian and Wang.</description>

      <title>Cluster Algebras and Dilogarithm Identities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06668v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This is a reasonably self-contained exposition of the fascinating interplay between cluster algebras and the dilogarithm in the past two decades. The dilogarithm has a long and rich history since it was studied by Euler. The most intriguing property of the function is that it satisfies various functional relations, which we call dilogarithm identities (DIs). In the 1990s, various DIs were conjectured in the study of integrable models, but most of them were left unsolved. On the other hand, cluster algebras are a class of commutative algebras introduced by Fomin and Zelevinsky around 2000. In this text, we explain how the above DIs are proved using the techniques and results of cluster algebras. Also, we employ the DI associated with each period in a cluster pattern of cluster algebra as the leitmotif and present several proofs, variations, and generalizations of them with various methods and techniques. The quantum DIs are also treated from a unified point of view compared to the classical ones.</description>
