      <title>An Energy-Adaptive Elastic Equivariant Transformer Framework for Protein Structure Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16996v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structure-informed protein representation learning is essential for effective protein function annotation and \textit{de novo} design. However, the presence of inherent noise in both crystal and AlphaFold-predicted structures poses significant challenges for existing methods in learning robust protein representations. To address these issues, we propose a novel equivariant Transformer-State Space Model(SSM) hybrid framework, termed $E^3$former, designed for efficient protein representation. Our approach uses energy function-based receptive fields to construct proximity graphs and incorporates an equivariant high-tensor-elastic selective SSM within the transformer architecture. These components enable the model to adapt to complex atom interactions and extract geometric features with higher signal-to-noise ratios. Empirical results demonstrate that our model outperforms existing methods in structure-intensive tasks, such as inverse folding and binding site prediction, particularly when using predicted structures, owing to its enhanced tolerance to data deviation and noise. Our approach offers a novel perspective for conducting biological function research and drug discovery using noisy protein structure data.</description>

      <title>RiboFlow: Conditional De Novo RNA Sequence-Structure Co-Design via Synergistic Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17007v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ribonucleic acid (RNA) binds to molecules to achieve specific biological functions. While generative models are advancing biomolecule design, existing methods for designing RNA that target specific ligands face limitations in capturing RNA's conformational flexibility, ensuring structural validity, and overcoming data scarcity. To address these challenges, we introduce RiboFlow, a synergistic flow matching model to co-design RNA structures and sequences based on target molecules. By integrating RNA backbone frames, torsion angles, and sequence features in an unified architecture, RiboFlow explicitly models RNA's dynamic conformations while enforcing sequence-structure consistency to improve validity. Additionally, we curate RiboBind, a large-scale dataset of RNA-molecule interactions, to resolve the scarcity of high-quality structural data. Extensive experiments reveal that RiboFlow not only outperforms state-of-the-art RNA design methods by a large margin but also showcases controllable capabilities for achieving high binding affinity to target ligands. Our work bridges critical gaps in controllable RNA design, offering a framework for structure-aware, data-efficient generation.</description>

      <title>Preferential Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization for Drug Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite decades of advancements in automated ligand screening, large-scale drug discovery remains resource-intensive and requires post-processing hit selection, a step where chemists manually select a few promising molecules based on their chemical intuition. This creates a major bottleneck in the virtual screening process for drug discovery, demanding experts to repeatedly balance complex trade-offs among drug properties across a vast pool of candidates. To improve the efficiency and reliability of this process, we propose a novel human-centered framework named CheapVS that allows chemists to guide the ligand selection process by providing preferences regarding the trade-offs between drug properties via pairwise comparison. Our framework combines preferential multi-objective Bayesian optimization with a docking model for measuring binding affinity to capture human chemical intuition for improving hit identification. Specifically, on a library of 100K chemical candidates targeting EGFR and DRD2, CheapVS outperforms state-of-the-art screening methods in identifying drugs within a limited computational budget. Notably, our method can recover up to 16/37 EGFR and 37/58 DRD2 known drugs while screening only 6% of the library, showcasing its potential to significantly advance drug discovery.</description>

      <title>Gumbel-Softmax Flow Matching with Straight-Through Guidance for Controllable Biological Sequence Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flow matching in the continuous simplex has emerged as a promising strategy for DNA sequence design, but struggles to scale to higher simplex dimensions required for peptide and protein generation. We introduce Gumbel-Softmax Flow and Score Matching, a generative framework on the simplex based on a novel Gumbel-Softmax interpolant with a time-dependent temperature. Using this interpolant, we introduce Gumbel-Softmax Flow Matching by deriving a parameterized velocity field that transports from smooth categorical distributions to distributions concentrated at a single vertex of the simplex. We alternatively present Gumbel-Softmax Score Matching which learns to regress the gradient of the probability density. Our framework enables high-quality, diverse generation and scales efficiently to higher-dimensional simplices. To enable training-free guidance, we propose Straight-Through Guided Flows (STGFlow), a classifier-based guidance method that leverages straight-through estimators to steer the unconditional velocity field toward optimal vertices of the simplex. STGFlow enables efficient inference-time guidance using classifiers pre-trained on clean sequences, and can be used with any discrete flow method. Together, these components form a robust framework for controllable de novo sequence generation. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in conditional DNA promoter design, sequence-only protein generation, and target-binding peptide design for rare disease treatment.</description>

      <title>Uni-3DAR: Unified 3D Generation and Understanding via Autoregression on Compressed Spatial Tokens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16278v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models and their multi-modal extensions have demonstrated the effectiveness of unifying generation and understanding through autoregressive next-token prediction. However, despite the critical role of 3D structural generation and understanding (3D GU) in AI for science, these tasks have largely evolved independently, with autoregressive methods remaining underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce Uni-3DAR, a unified framework that seamlessly integrates 3D GU tasks via autoregressive prediction. At its core, Uni-3DAR employs a novel hierarchical tokenization that compresses 3D space using an octree, leveraging the inherent sparsity of 3D structures. It then applies an additional tokenization for fine-grained structural details, capturing key attributes such as atom types and precise spatial coordinates in microscopic 3D structures. We further propose two optimizations to enhance efficiency and effectiveness. The first is a two-level subtree compression strategy, which reduces the octree token sequence by up to 8x. The second is a masked next-token prediction mechanism tailored for dynamically varying token positions, significantly boosting model performance. By combining these strategies, Uni-3DAR successfully unifies diverse 3D GU tasks within a single autoregressive framework. Extensive experiments across multiple microscopic 3D GU tasks, including molecules, proteins, polymers, and crystals, validate its effectiveness and versatility. Notably, Uni-3DAR surpasses previous state-of-the-art diffusion models by a substantial margin, achieving up to 256\% relative improvement while delivering inference speeds up to 21.8x faster. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/dptech-corp/Uni-3DAR.</description>
