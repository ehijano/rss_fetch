      <title>A simple construction of the sine-Gordon model via stochastic quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a simple PDE construction of the sine-Gordon measure below the first threshold ($\be^2 &lt; 4\pi$), in both the finite and infinite volume settings, by studying the corresponding parabolic sine-Gordon model. We also establish pathwise global well-posedness of the hyperbolic sine-Gordon model in finite volume for $\be^2 &lt; 2\pi$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove that hitting probability of Minkowski sum of fractal percolations can be characterized by capacity. Then we extend this result to Minkowski sum of general random sets in $\mathbb Z^d$, including ranges of random walks and critical branching random walks, whose hitting probabilities are described by Newtonian capacity individually.</description>

      <title>Path-dependent Fractional Volterra Equations and the Microstructure of Rough Volatility Models driven by Poisson Random Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a microstructure foundation for rough volatility models driven by Poisson random measures. In our model the volatility is driven by self-exciting arrivals of market orders as well as self-exciting arrivals of limit orders and cancellations. The impact of market order on future order arrivals is captured by a Hawkes kernel with power law decay, and is hence persistent. The impact of limit orders on future order arrivals is temporary, yet possibly long-lived. After suitable scaling the volatility process converges to a fractional Heston model driven by an additional Poisson random measure. The random measure generates occasional spikes and clusters of spikes in the volatility process. Our results are based on novel existence and uniqueness of solutions results for stochastic path-dependent Volterra equations driven by Poisson random measures.</description>

      <title>Central limit theorem for periodic solutions of stochastic differential equations driven by Levy noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Through certain appropriate constructions, we establish periodic solutions in distribution for some stochastic differential equations with infinite-dimensional Levy noise. Additionally, we obtain the corresponding periodic measures and periodic transition semigroup. Under suitable conditions, we also achieve a certain contractivity in the space of probability measures. By constructing an appropriate invariant measure, we standardize the observation functions. Utilizing the classical martingale approximation approach, we establish the law of large numbers and the central limit theorem.</description>

      <title>Rough differential equations and planarly branched universal limit theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The universal limit theorem is a central result in rough path theory, which has been proved for: (i) rough paths with roughness $\frac{1}{3}&lt; \alpha \leq \frac{1}{2}$; (ii) geometric rough paths with roughness $0&lt; \alpha \leq 1$; (iii) branched rough paths with roughness $0&lt; \alpha \leq 1$. Planarly branched rough paths are natural generalizations of both rough paths and branched rough paths, in the sense that post-Lie algebras are generalizations of both Lie algebras and pre-Lie algebras. Here the primitive elements of the graded dual Hopf algebra of the Hopf algebra corresponding to the planarly branched rough paths (resp. rough paths, resp. branched rough paths) form a post-Lie (resp. Lie, resp. pre-Lie algebra). In this paper, we prove the universal limit theorem for planarly branched rough paths with roughness $\frac{1}{4}&lt; \alpha \leq \frac{1}{3}$, via the method of Banach fixed point theorem.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Phenomena in Interacting Particle Systems: Phase Transitions and Equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This thesis investigates critical phenomena and equilibrium states in various stochastic models through three interconnected studies.
  In the first chapter, we analyze the Activated Random Walk model on a one-dimensional ring in the high-density regime. We introduce a toppling procedure that incrementally constructs an environment demonstrating the sustained activity over extended periods. This approach provides a concise and self-contained proof of the existence of a slow phase for arbitrarily large sleep rates.
  The second chapter focuses on a modified unidimensional contact process with varying infection rates. Specifically, infection spreads at rate $\lambda_e$ at the boundaries of the infected region and at rate $\lambda_i$ elsewhere. We establish the existence of an invariant measure for this process when $\lambda_i=\lambda_c$, $\lambda_e=\lambda_c+\varepsilon$ where $\lambda_c$ denotes the critical parameter for the standard contact process. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the process, when observed from the right edge, converges weakly to this invariant measure. We also show that infection dies almost surely along the critical curve within the attractive region of the phase space.
  In the final chapter, we explore quasi-stationary distributions (QSDs) for two subcritical population processes in continuous time: branching random walks and branching processes with genealogy. We prove the existence and uniqueness of QSDs for these processes by leveraging spatial aspects of their dynamics.</description>

      <title>Space-time divergence lemmas and optimal non-reversible lifts of diffusions on Riemannian manifolds with boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-reversible lifts reduce the relaxation time of reversible diffusions at most by a square root. For reversible diffusions on domains in Euclidean space, or, more generally, on a Riemannian manifold with boundary, non-reversible lifts are in particular given by the Hamiltonian flow on the tangent bundle, interspersed with random velocity refreshments, or perturbed by Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise, and reflected at the boundary. In order to prove that for certain choices of parameters, these lifts achieve the optimal square-root reduction up to a constant factor, precise upper bounds on relaxation times are required. A key tool for deriving such bounds by space-time Poincar\'e inequalities is a quantitative space-time divergence lemma. Extending previous work of Cao, Lu and Wang, we establish such a divergence lemma with explicit constants for general locally convex domains with smooth boundary in Riemannian manifolds satisfying a lower, not necessarily positive, curvature bound. As a consequence, we prove optimality of the lifts described above up to a constant factor, provided the deterministic transport part of the dynamics and the noise are adequately balanced. Our results show for example that an integrated Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process on a locally convex domain with diameter $d$ achieves a relaxation time of the order $d$, whereas, in general, the Poincar\'e constant of the domain is of the order $d^2$.</description>

      <title>A consistency-stability approach to scaling limits of zero-range processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a simple quantitative method for studying the hydrodynamic limit of interacting particle systems on lattices. It is applied to the diffusive scaling of the symmetric Zero-Range Process (in dimensions one and two). The rate of convergence is estimated in a Monge-Kantorovich distance asymptotic to the L^1 stability estimate of Kruzkhov, as well as in relative entropy; and it is uniform in time. The method avoids the use of the so-called ``block estimates''. It is based on a modulated Monge-Kantorovich distance estimate and microscopic stability properties.</description>

      <title>Renormalised Amperean Area of Brownian Motions and Symanzik Representation of the 2D Abelian Yang--Mills--Higgs Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct and study the renormalised Amperean area of a Brownian motion. First studied by W.Werner, the Amperean area is related to L\'evy area and stochastic integrals in a way akin to the relation between self-intersection measure and occupation measure. As we explain, it plays a central role in the Symanzik's polymer representation of the continuous Abelian Yang--Mills--Higgs field in 2 dimensions and allows to study this field using classical stochastic calculus and martingale theory.</description>

      <title>Mixing phases of the Glauber dynamics for the $p$-spin Curie-Weiss model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Glauber dynamics for the classical $2$-spin Curie-Weiss model on $N$ nodes with inverse temperature $\beta$ and zero external field is known to mix in time $\Theta(N\log N)$ for $\beta &lt; \frac{1}{2}$, in time $\Theta(N^{3/2})$ at $\beta = \frac{1}{2}$, and in time $\exp(\Omega(N))$ for $\beta &gt;\frac{1}{2}$. In this paper, we consider the $p$-spin generalization of the Curie-Weiss model with an external field $h$, and identify three disjoint regions almost exhausting the parameter space, with the corresponding Glauber dynamics exhibiting three different orders of mixing times in these regions. The construction of these disjoint regions depends on the number of local maximizers of a certain function $H_{\beta,h,p}$, and the behavior of the second derivative of $H_{\beta,h,p}$ at such a local maximizer. Specifically, we show that if $H_{\beta,h,p}$ has a unique local maximizer $m_*$ with $H_{\beta,h,p}''(m_*) &lt; 0$ and no other stationary point, then the Glauber dynamics mixes in time $\Theta(N\log N)$, and if $H_{\beta,h,p}$ has multiple local maximizers, then the mixing time is $\exp(\Omega(N))$. Finally, if $H_{\beta,h,p}$ has a unique local maximizer $m_*$ with $H_{\beta,h,p}''(m_*) = 0$, then the mixing time is $\Theta(N^{3/2})$. We provide an explicit description of the geometry of these three different phases in the parameter space, and observe that the only portion of the parameter plane that is left out by the union of these three regions, is a one-dimensional curve, on which the function $H_{\beta,h,p}$ has a stationary inflection point. Finding out the exact order of the mixing time on this curve remains an open question.</description>

      <title>Decoupled Functional Central Limit Theorems for Two-Time-Scale Stochastic Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In two-time-scale stochastic approximation (SA), two iterates are updated at different rates, governed by distinct step sizes, with each update influencing the other. Previous studies have demonstrated that the convergence rates of the error terms for these updates depend solely on their respective step sizes, a property known as decoupled convergence. However, a functional version of this decoupled convergence has not been explored. Our work fills this gap by establishing decoupled functional central limit theorems for two-time-scale SA, offering a more precise characterization of its asymptotic behavior. To achieve these results, we leverage the martingale problem approach and establish tightness as a crucial intermediate step. Furthermore, to address the interdependence between different time scales, we introduce an innovative auxiliary sequence to eliminate the primary influence of the fast-time-scale update on the slow-time-scale update.</description>

      <title>The smallest singular value of large random rectangular Toeplitz and circulant matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $x_i$, $i\in\mathbb{Z}$ be a sequence of i.i.d. standard normal random variables. Consider rectangular Toeplitz $\mathbf{X}=\left(x_{j-i}\right)_{1\leq i\leq p,1\leq j\leq n}$ and circulant $\mathbf{X}=\left(x_{(j-i)\mod n}\right)_{1\leq i\leq p,1\leq j\leq n}$ matrices. Let $p,n\rightarrow\infty$ so that $p/n\rightarrow c\in(0,1]$. We prove that the smallest eigenvalue of $\frac{1}{n}\mathbf{X}\mathbf{X}^\top$ converges to zero in probability and in expectation. We establish a lower bound on the rate of this convergence. The lower bound is faster than any poly-log but slower than any polynomial rate. For the ``rectangular circulant'' matrices, we also establish a polynomial upper bound on the convergence rate, which is a simple explicit function of $c$.</description>

      <title>Ergodic and mixing properties of the 2D Navier-Stokes equations with a degenerate multiplicative Gaussian noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish ergodic and mixing properties of stochastic 2D Navier-Stokes equations driven by a highly degenerate multiplicative Gaussian noise. The noise could appear in as few as four directions and the intensity of the noise depends on the solution. The case of additive Gaussian noise was treated in Hairer and Mattingly [\emph{Ann. of Math.}, 164(3):993--1032, 2006]. To obtain ergodic and mixing properties, we use Malliavin calculus to establish the asymptotically strong Feller property. The main difficulty lies in the proof of the "invertibility" of Malliavin matrix which is totally different from the additive case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we obtain sharp modulus of continuity estimates for $\beta$-Dyson Brownian motions with $\beta\geq 2$. Our approach is based on Caffarelli's contraction theorem in optimal transport. We develop the same estimates for a large class of line ensembles, which can be viewed as log-concave perturbations of Brownian motions, including $\beta$-Dyson Brownian motions, the Airy line ensemble, the KPZ line ensemble, and the O'Connell-Yor line ensemble. Our estimates are uniform for all curves, and this allows us to address a conjecture in [Wu23b].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the Lebesgue structure of the distribution of a random variable given in terms of a continued fraction with a two-symbol alphabet $\{\frac{1}{2}, 1\}$, also known as $A_2$-fractions. We establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the distribution to be discrete and provide some sufficient conditions for its singularity. We also explore non-trivial metric properties of the $A_2$-representation with the specified alphabet.</description>

      <title>Strange shadows of $\ell_p$-balls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a large deviations principle for orthogonal projections of the unit ball $\mathbb{B}_p^n$ of $\ell_p^n$ onto a random $k$-dimensional linear subspace of $\mathbb{R}^n$ as $n\to\infty$ in the case $2&lt;p\le \infty$ and for the intersection of $\mathbb{B}_p^n$ with a random $k$-dimensional subspace in the case $1\le p &lt;2$. The corresponding rate function is finite only on $L_q$-zonoids and their duals, respectively, and given in terms of the maximum entropy over suitable measures generating the $L_q$-zonoid, where $\frac{1}{p}+\frac{1}{q}=1$. In particular, we obtain that the renormalized projections/sections almost surely tend to a $k$-dimensional Euclidean ball of certain radius. Moreover, we identify the asymptotic probability that the random orthogonal projection remains within a ball of smaller radius. As a byproduct we obtain an interesting inequality for the Gamma function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In topological data analysis, the notions of persistent homology, birthtime, lifetime, and deathtime are used to assign and capture relevant cycles (i.e., topological features) of a point cloud, such as loops and cavities. In particular, cycles with a large lifetime are of special interest. In this paper, we study such large-lifetime cycles when the point cloud is modeled as a Poisson point process. First, we consider the case with no bound on the deathtime, where we establish Poisson convergence of the centers of large-lifetime features on the 2-dimensional flat torus. Afterwards, by imposing a bound on the deathtime, we enter a sparse connectivity regime, and we prove joint Poisson convergence of the centers, lifetimes, and deathtimes in dimensions $d \geq 2$ under suitable model conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study Poisson processes of so-called "fat" cylinders in hyperbolic space. As our main result we show that this model undergoes a percolation phase transition. We prove this by establishing a novel link between the fat Poisson cylinder process and semi-scale invariant random fractal models on the unit sphere and in $\mathbb{R}^d.$ As a secondary result, we show that the semi-scale invariant fractal ball model in $\mathbb{R}^d$ has a non-empty sheet phase.</description>

      <title>Critical level set percolation for the GFF in $d&gt;6$: comparison principles and some consequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the intrinsic geometry of the critical percolation cluster induced by the level set of the metric Gaussian free field on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ above the critical dimension of six. (Lupu, 2016) established that the critical percolation cluster has the same law as that in a Poisson loop soup where the intensity is dictated by the Green's function of the usual random walk. A sharp Euclidean one arm exponent was proven recently in (Cai and Ding, 2023), and subsequently in (Ganguly and Nam, 2024) other results about the chemical one arm exponent, volume growth and the Alexander-Orbach conjecture were established for all $d&gt;20.$
  In this paper, we introduce new methods to obtain several sharp estimates about the intrinsic geometry which hold for all $d&gt;6$. We develop two primary comparison methods. The first involves a comparison of the extrinsic (Euclidean) and intrinsic metrics allowing estimates about the former to be transferrable to the latter. The second compares intrinsic geodesics to a class of modified paths which are non-backtracking in a certain loop sense. The latter is amenable to analysis using methods of bond percolation. We finally prove that such non-backtracking paths are not much longer than geodesics allowing us to establish comparable estimates for the geodesic. As applications of such methods, we establish, for all $d&gt;6,$ the chemical one-arm exponent, as well as an averaged version of a conjecture from (Werner, 2021) which asserts that deletion of loops with diameter larger than $r^{6/d}$ do not affect the connection probabilities between points at Euclidean distance $r.$ An important ingredient of independent interest is a local connectivity estimate which asserts that the connection probability between two points at distance $r$ remains, up to constants, unchanged even if the connecting path is confined to a ball of diameter comparable to $r.$</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a connection between the quantum walk and the absolute mathematics. The quantum walk is a quantum counterpart of the classical random walk. We especially deal with the Grover walk on a graph. The Grover walk is a typical model of quantum walks. The time evolution of the Grover walk is obtained by a unitary matrix that is called the Grover matrix. We define the zeta function determined by the Grover matrix. First we prove that the zeta function of the Grover walk is the absolute automorphic form that constructs the absolute zeta function. Next we calculate the absolute zeta function defined by Grover walks on some graphs. The absolute zeta functions of the Grover walks are expressed by the multiple gamma function. Other types of absolute zeta functions are obtained as an analogue of the multiple gamma function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the qualitative behaviour of the solutions of a stochastic boundary value problem on the half-line for a nonlinear system of parabolic reaction-diffusion equations, from a numerical point of view. The model describes the chemical aggression of calcium carbonate stones under the attack of sulphur dioxide. The dynamical boundary condition is given by a Pearson diffusion, which is original in the context of the degradation of cultural heritage. We first discuss a scheme based on the Lamperti transformation for the stochastic differential equation to preserve the boundary and a splitting strategy for the partial differential equation based on recent theoretical results. Positiveness, boundedness, and stability are stated. The impact of boundary noise on the solution and its qualitative behaviour both in the slow and fast regimes is discussed in several numerical experiments.</description>

Abstract: If we treat the symmetric group $S_n$ as a probability measure space where each element has measure $1/n!$, then the number of cycles in a permutation becomes a random variable. The Cycle Length Lemma describes the expected values of products of these random variables. Here we categorify the Cycle Length Lemma by showing that it follows from an equivalence between groupoids.</description>

Abstract: We study a nonlinear, pseudomonotone, stochastic diffusion-convection evolution problem on a bounded spatial domain, in any space dimension, with homogeneous boundary conditions and reflection. The additive noise term is given by a stochastic It\^{o} integral with respect to a Hilbert space valued $Q$-Wiener process. We show existence of a solution to the pseudomonotone stochastic diffusion-convection equation with non-negative initial value as well as the existence of a reflection measure which prevents the solution from taking negative values. In order to show a minimality condition of the measure, we study the properties of quasi everywhere defined representatives of the solution with respect to parabolic capacity.</description>

      <title>Robust random graph matching in dense graphs via vector approximate message passing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on the matching recovery problem between a pair of correlated Gaussian Wigner matrices with a latent vertex correspondence. We are particularly interested in a robust version of this problem such that our observation is a perturbed input $(A+E,B+F)$ where $(A,B)$ is a pair of correlated Gaussian Wigner matrices and $E,F$ are adversarially chosen matrices supported on an unknown $\epsilon n * \epsilon n$ principle minor of $A,B$, respectively. We propose a vector-approximate message passing (vector-AMP) algorithm that succeeds in polynomial time as long as the correlation $\rho$ between $(A,B)$ is a non-vanishing constant and $\epsilon = o\big( \tfrac{1}{(\log n)^{20}} \big)$.
  The main methodological inputs for our result are the iterative random graph matching algorithm proposed in \cite{DL22+, DL23+} and the spectral cleaning procedure proposed in \cite{IS24+}. To the best of our knowledge, our algorithm is the first efficient random graph matching type algorithm that is robust under any adversarial perturbations of $n^{1-o(1)}$ size.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For the $3D$ fractional Navier--Stokes equations perturbed by transport noise, we prove the existence of infinitely many H\"older continuous analytically weak, probabilistically strong Leray--Hopf solutions starting from the same deterministic initial velocity field. Our solutions are global in time and satisfy the energy inequality pathwise on a non-empty random interval $[0,\tau]$. In contrast to recent related results, we do not consider an additional deterministic suitably chosen force $f$ in the equation. In this unforced regime, we prove the first result of Leray--Hopf nonuniqueness for fractional Navier--Stokes equations with any kind of stochastic perturbation. Our proof relies on convex integration techniques and a flow transformation by which we reformulate the SPDE as a PDE with random coefficients.</description>

Abstract: We consider a nonlinear pendulum whose suspension point undergoes stochastic vibrations in its plane of motion. Stochastic vibrations are constructed by stochastic differential equations with random periodic solutions. Averaging over these stochastic vibrations can be simplified with ergodicity. We give a complete description of the bifurcations of phase portraits of the averaged Hamiltonian system. The bifurcation curves of the stochastic perturbed Hamiltonian system are shown numerically. Estimations between the averaged system and the exact system are calculated. The correspondence of the averaged system to the exact system is explained through the Poincar\'e return map. Studying the averaged Hamiltonian system provided important information for the exact stochastic perturbed Hamiltonian system.</description>

      <title>Direct Inversion for the Squared Bessel Process and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we derive a new direct inversion method to simulate squared Bessel processes. Since the transition probability of these processes can be represented by a non-central chi-square distribution, we construct an efficient and accurate algorithm to simulate non-central chi-square variables. In this method, the dimension of the squared Bessel process, equivalently the degrees of freedom of the chi-square distribution, is treated as a variable. We therefore use a two-dimensional Chebyshev expansion to approximate the inverse function of the central chi-square distribution with one variable being the degrees of freedom. The method is accurate and efficient for any value of degrees of freedom including the computationally challenging case of small values. One advantage of the method is that noncentral chi-square samples can be generated for a whole range of values of degrees of freedom using the same Chebyshev coefficients. The squared Bessel process is a building block for the well-known Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR) processes, which can be generated from squared Bessel processes through time change and linear transformation. Our direct inversion method thus allows the efficient and accurate simulation of these processes, which are used as models in a wide variety of applications.</description>

      <title>A Limit Order Book Model for High Frequency Trading with Rough Volatility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a model for limit order book of a certain security with two main features: First, both the limit orders and market orders for the given asset are allowed to appear and interact with each other. Second, the high frequency trading activities are allowed and described by the scaling limit of nearly-unstable multi-dimensional Hawkes processes with power law decay. The model has been derived as a stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE, for short), under certain intuitive identifications. Its diffusion coefficient is determined by a Volterra integral equation driven by a Hawkes process, whose Hurst exponent is less than 1/2 (so that the relevant process is negatively correlated). As a result, the volatility path of the SPDE is rougher than that driven by a (standard) Brownian motion. The well-posedness follows from a result in literature. Hence, a foundation is laid down for further studies in this direction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we provide a combinatorial formalism for dealing with the cancellations that have appeared recently in the context of dispersive PDEs with random initial data. The main idea is to transform iterated integrals encoded by decorated trees into words via an arborification map. This provides a formalism alternative to the one of molecules introduced by Deng and Hani (2023). It allows us to compute the cancellations coming from Wave turbulence and the proof of the invariance of the Gibbs measure under the dynamics of the three-dimensional cubic wave equation.</description>

      <title>Stability and synchronisation in modelling an oscillatory stochastic reaction network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In many applied settings, the chemical Langevin equation and linear noise approximation are used in the simulation and data analysis of stochastic reaction networks. With the goal of exploring the sensitivities of reaction network paths to their initial conditions, we subject these modelling techniques to the analysis of random dynamical systems and stochastic flows of diffeomorphisms respectively. After introducing this perspective to stochastic reaction networks in general, we turn our attention to the Brusselator: a two dimensional stochastic reaction network whose paths, when noise is neglected, exhibits a Hopf bifurcation. Studying both Lyapunov exponents, as well as their finite time counterparts, provides two new insights. Firstly, the Brusselator, when modelled by the chemical Langevin equation, exhibits a global synchronisation property of paths of similar noise realisations; secondly, contrary to statistical accuracy in the distributions of concentrations of reactants, the linear noise approximation can fail to capture the finite time dynamical properties of paths of the chemical Langevin equation. In doing so, we explore the notions of dynamical bifurcation and quasi-ergodicity.</description>

Abstract: We prove that the uniform doubling property holds for every Lie group which can be written as a quotient group of $\operatorname{SU}(2) \times \mathbb{R}^n$ for some $n$. In particular, this class includes the four-dimensional unitary group $\operatorname{U}(2)$. As this class contain non-compact as well as compact Lie groups, we discuss a number of analytic and spectral consequences for the corresponding heat kernels.</description>

      <title>The Hydrodynamic Limit of Neural Networks with Balanced Excitation and Inhibition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The theory of `Balanced Neural Networks' is a very popular explanation for the high degree of variability and stochasticity in the brain's activity. We determine equations for the hydrodynamic limit of a balanced all-to-all network of 2n neurons for asymptotically large n. The neurons are divided into two classes (excitatory and inhibitory). Each excitatory neuron excites every other neuron, and each inhibitory neuron inhibits all of the other neurons. The model is of a stochastic hybrid nature, such that the synaptic response of each neuron is governed by an ordinary differential equation. The effect of neuron j on neuron k is dictated by a spiking Poisson Process, with intensity given by a sigmoidal function of the synaptic potentiation of neuron j. The interactions are scaled by n^{-1/2} , which is much stronger than the n^{-1} scaling of classical interacting particle systems. We demonstrate that, under suitable conditions, the system does not blow up as n asymptotes to infinity because the network activity is balanced between excitatory and inhibitory inputs. The limiting population dynamics is proved to be Gaussian: with the mean determined by the balanced between excitation and inhibition, and the variance determined by the Central Limit Theorem for inhomogeneous Poisson Processes. The limiting equations can thus be expressed as autonomous Ordinary Differential Equations for the means and variances.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17418v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the numerical simulation of the solution to the McKean-Vlasov equation with common noise. We begin by discretizing the solution in time using the Euler scheme, followed by spatial discretization through the particle method, inspired by the propagation of chaos property. Assuming H{\"o}lder continuity in time, as well as Lipschitz continuity in the state and measure arguments of the coefficient functions, we establish the convergence rate of the Euler scheme and the particle method. These results extend those for the standard McKean-Vlasov equation without common noise. Finally, we present two simulation examples : a modified conditional Ornstein Uhlenbeck process with common noise and an interbank market model.</description>

      <title>An extended variational setting for critical SPDEs with L{\'e}vy noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The critical variational setting was recently introduced and shown to be applicable to many important SPDEs not covered by the classical variational setting. In this paper, we extend the critical variational setting in several ways. We introduce a flexibility in the range space for the nonlinear drift term, due to which certain borderline cases can now also be included. An example of this is the Allen-Cahn equation in dimension two in the weak setting. In addition to this, we allow the drift to be singular in time, which is something that naturally arises in the study of the skeleton equations for large deviation principles for SPDEs. Last but not least, we present the theory in the case of L{\'e}vy noise for which the critical setting was not available yet.</description>

Abstract: We have investigated a weighted chi-square distribution of the variable $\xi$ which is a weighted sum of squared normally distributed independent variables whose weights are cosines of angles $\phi_k=2\pi k/N$, where $k \in \{0,1,...,N-1\}$ and $N$ is the number of the freedom degrees. We have found the exact expression for the density function of this distribution and its approximation for large $N$. The distribution is compared with the Gaussian distribution.</description>

      <title>Large scale regularity and correlation length for almost length-minimizing random curves in the plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a model of random curves in the plane related to the large-scale behavior of the Random Field Ising Model (RFIM) at temperature zero in two space dimensions. Our work is motivated by attempts to quantify the Imry--Ma phenomenon concerning the rounding of the phase transition by quenched disorder, and connects to recent advances regarding the decay of correlations in the RFIM.
  We study a continuum model of minimal surfaces in two space dimensions subject to an external, quenched random field, and restrict ourselves to isotropic surface integrands. The random fields we consider behave like white noise on large scales with an ultra-violet regularization reminiscent of the lattice structure of the RFIM.
  We give a finer description of the minimizer below the length scale starting from which the influence of boundary conditions is suppressed with a given probability, which has recently been shown to be of order $\exp(\varepsilon^{-\frac{4}{3}})$ in the amplitude $\varepsilon&gt;0$ of the noise. More precisely, we prove flatness of the phase boundaries on scales up to order $\exp(\varepsilon^{-\frac{4}{13}})$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study partial information Nash equilibrium between a broker and an informed trader. In this model, the informed trader, who possesses knowledge of a trading signal, trades multiple assets with the broker in a dealer market. Simultaneously, the broker trades these assets in a lit exchange where their actions impact the asset prices. The broker, however, only observes aggregate prices and cannot distinguish between underlying trends and volatility. Both the broker and the informed trader aim to maximize their penalized expected wealth. Using convex analysis, we characterize the Nash equilibrium and demonstrate its existence and uniqueness. Furthermore, we establish that this equilibrium corresponds to the solution of a nonstandard system of forward-backward stochastic differential equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1909.03427v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study first passage percolation (FPP) on a Gromov-hyperbolic group $G$ with boundary $\partial G$ equipped with the Patterson-Sullivan measure $\nu$. We associate an i.i.d.\ collection of random passage times to each edge of a Cayley graph of $G$, and investigate classical questions about the asymptotics of first passage time as well as the geometry of geodesics in the FPP metric. Under suitable conditions on the passage time distribution, we show that the `velocity' exists in $\nu$-almost every direction $\xi\in \partial G$, and is almost surely constant by ergodicity of the $G-$action on $\partial G$. For every $\xi\in \partial G$, we also show almost sure coalescence of any two geodesic rays directed towards $\xi$. Finally, we show that the variance of the first passage time grows linearly with word distance along word geodesic rays in every fixed boundary direction. This provides an affirmative answer to a conjecture of Benjamini, Tessera, and Zeitouni.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we introduce a variable order time fractional differential equation driven by pure jump L\'evy noise, which models the motion of a particle exhibiting memory effect. We prove the well-posedness of this equation without assuming any integrability condition on the initial condition and the large jump coefficient, by using a truncation argument. Under some extra conditions, we also derive some $L^p$ moment estimates on the solutions. As an application of moment estimates, we prove the H\"older regularity of the solutions.</description>

      <title>Spreading speed of locally regulated population models in macroscopically heterogeneous environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2105.06985v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a certain lattice branching random walk with on-site competition and in an environment which is heterogeneous at a macroscopic scale $1/\varepsilon$ in space and time. This can be seen as a model for the spatial dynamics of a biological population in a habitat which is heterogeneous at a large scale (mountains, temperature or precipitation gradient\ldots). The model incorporates another parameter, $K$, which is a measure of the local population density. We study the model in the limit when first $\varepsilon\to 0$ and then $K\to\infty$. In this asymptotic regime, we show that the rescaled position of the front as a function of time converges to the solution of an explicit ODE. We further discuss the relation with another popular model of population dynamics, the Fisher-KPP equation, which arises in the limit $K\to\infty$. Combined with known results on the Fisher-KPP equation, our results show in particular that the limits $\varepsilon\to0$ and $K\to\infty$ do not commute in general. We conjecture that an interpolating regime appears when $\log K$ and $1/\varepsilon$ are of the same order.</description>

      <title>Low-temperature Ising dynamics with random initializations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2106.11296v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well known that Glauber dynamics on spin systems typically suffer exponential slowdowns at low temperatures. This is due to the emergence of multiple metastable phases in the state space, separated by narrow bottlenecks that are hard for the dynamics to cross. It is a folklore belief that if the dynamics is initialized from an appropriate random mixture of ground states, one for each phase, then convergence to the Gibbs distribution should be much faster. However, such phenomena have largely evaded rigorous analysis, as most tools in the study of Markov chain mixing times are tailored to worst-case initializations.
  In this paper we develop a general framework towards establishing this conjectured behavior for the Ising model. In the classical setting of the Ising model on an $N$-vertex torus in $\mathbb Z^d$, our framework implies that the mixing time for the Glauber dynamics, initialized from a $\frac 12$-$\frac 12$ mixture of the all-plus and all-minus configurations, is $N^{1+o(1)}$ in dimension $d=2$, and at most quasi-polynomial in all dimensions $d\ge 3$, at all temperatures below the critical one. The key innovation in our analysis is the introduction of the notion of "weak spatial mixing within a phase", a low-temperature adaptation of the classical concept of weak spatial mixing. We show both that this new notion is strong enough to control the mixing time from the above random initialization (by relating it to the mixing time with plus boundary condition at $O(\log N)$ scales), and that it holds at all low temperatures in all dimensions.
  This framework naturally extends to much more general families of graphs. To illustrate this, we also use the same approach to establish optimal $O(N\log N)$ mixing for the Ising Glauber dynamics on random regular graphs at sufficiently low temperatures, when initialized from the same random mixture.</description>

In this paper, we establish sharp two-sided heat kernel estimates for $\mathcal{L}_{\alpha}^D-\kappa$, with $\kappa$ being a non-negative critical potential and $D$ being a $C^{1, \beta}$ open set, $\beta \in ((\alpha-1)_+,1]$. The potential $\kappa$ can exhibit multi-singularities and our regularity assumption on $D$ is weaker than the regularity assumed in earlier literature on heat kernel estimates of fractional Laplacians.</description>

Abstract: We study a nonlinear recombination model from population genetics as a combinatorial version of the Kac-Boltzmann equation from kinetic theory. Following Kac's approach, the nonlinear model is approximated by a mean field linear evolution with a large number of particles. In our setting, the latter takes the form of a generalized random transposition dynamics. Our main results establish a uniform in time propagation of chaos with quantitative bounds, and a tight entropy production estimate for the generalized random transpositions, which holds uniformly in the number of particles. As a byproduct of our analysis we obtain sharp estimates on the speed of convergence to stationarity for the nonlinear equation, both in terms of relative entropy and total variation norm.</description>

Abstract: Let $G=G(n,p_n)$ be a homogeneous Erd\"os-R\'enyi graph, and $A$ its adjacency matrix with eigenvalues $\lambda_1(A) \geq \lambda_2(A) \geq ... \geq \lambda_n(A).$ Local laws have been used to show that $lambda_2(A)$ can exhibit fundamentally different behaviors: Tracy-Widom ($p_n \gg n^{-2/3}$), normal ($n^{-7/9} \ll p_n \ll~n^{-2/3}$), and a mix of both ($p_n=cn^{-2/3}$). Additionally, this technique renders the largest eigenvalue $\lambda_1(A),$ separated from the rest of the spectrum for $p_n \gg n^{-1},$ has Gaussian fluctuations when $p_n \geq n^{-1}(\log{n})^{6+c}$ for some $c&gt;0.$ This paper shows this remains true in the range $Bn^{-1}(\log{n})^4 \leq p_n \leq 1-Bn^{-1}(\log{n})^4$ with $B&gt;0$ universal, the tool behind it being a central limit theorem for the eigenvalue statistics of $A$ that is justified via the method of moments.</description>

      <title>On the tractability of sampling from the Potts model at low temperatures via random-cluster dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.03182v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sampling from the $q$-state ferromagnetic Potts model is a fundamental question in statistical physics, probability theory, and theoretical computer science. On general graphs, this problem may be computationally hard, and this hardness holds at arbitrarily low temperatures. At the same time, in recent years, there has been significant progress showing the existence of low-temperature sampling algorithms in various specific families of graphs. Our aim in this paper is to understand the minimal structural properties of general graphs that enable polynomial-time sampling from the $q$-state ferromagnetic Potts model at low temperatures. We study this problem from the perspective of random-cluster dynamics. These are non-local Markov chains that have long been believed to converge rapidly to equilibrium at low temperatures in many graphs. However, the hardness of the sampling problem likely indicates that this is not even the case for all bounded degree graphs.
  Our results demonstrate that a key graph property behind fast or slow convergence time for these dynamics is whether the independent edge-percolation on the graph admits a strongly supercritical phase. By this, we mean that at large $p&lt;1$, it has a large linear-sized component, and the graph complement of that component is comprised of only small components. Specifically, we prove that such a condition implies fast mixing of the random-cluster Glauber and Swendsen--Wang dynamics on two general families of bounded-degree graphs: (a) graphs of at most stretched-exponential volume growth and (b) locally treelike graphs. In the other direction, we show that, even among graphs in those families, these Markov chains can converge exponentially slowly at arbitrarily low temperatures if the edge-percolation condition does not hold.</description>

Abstract: We give a stochastic comparison and ordering of the largest eigenvalues, with parameter $\beta$, for Hermite $\beta$-ensembles and Laguerre $\beta$-ensembles. Although stochastic comparison results are well known in Laguerre ensembles (for $\beta=1,2,4$) using the last passage percolation models, our results are novel even for $\beta=1,2,4$, in Hermite ensembles. Taking limit, we recover a stochastic domination result for Tracy-Widom distributions obtained in (Pedreira, 2022). Using this, we also obtain a result on the signs of means of Tracy-Widom distributions. Our methods also provide stochastic domination results for spiked beta ensembles as well. We compare ordering of all the eigenvalues collectively, with $\beta$ as a parameter, by proving ordering of the moments of Hermite and Laguerre $\beta$-ensembles.
  In order to generalize the stochastic domination results of (Pedreira, 2022) to higher order analogues of Tracy-Widom distributions, we study tail estimates of these distributions. We show that the description of these distributions as eigenvalues of a stochastic operator is inconsistent with the known tail estimates. As a result, we disprove a conjecture of Krishnapur, Rider and Vir\'ag (Comm. Pure Appl. Math., 2017) for $\beta=2$ and $k=1$.</description>

Abstract: We consider the motion of a particle under a continuum random environment whose distribution is given by the Howitt-Warren flow. In the moderate deviation regime, we establish that the quenched density of the motion of the particle (after appropriate centering and scaling) converges weakly to the $(1+1)$ dimensional stochastic heat equation driven by multiplicative space-time white noise. Our result confirms physics predictions and computations in [LDT17, BLD20] and is the first rigorous instance of such weak convergence in the moderate deviation regime. Our proof relies on a certain Girsanov transform and works for all Howitt-Warren flows with finite and nonzero characteristic measures. Our results capture universality in the sense that the limiting distribution depends on the flow only via the total mass of the characteristic measure. As a corollary of our results, we prove that the fluctuations of the maximum of an $N$-point sticky Brownian motion are given by the KPZ equation plus an independent Gumbel on timescales of order $(\log N)^2.$</description>

      <title>Universality for Random Matrices</title>

Abstract: Traces of large powers of real-valued Wigner matrices are known to have Gaussian fluctuations: for $A=\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}(a_{ij})_{1 \leq i,j \leq n}\in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}, A=A^T$ with $(a_{ij})_{1 \leq i \leq j \leq n}$ i.i.d., symmetric, subgaussian, $\mathbb{E}[a^{2}_{11}]=1,$ and $p=o(n^{2/3}),$ as $n,p \to \infty,$ $\frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2^{p}}(tr(A^p)-\mathbb{E}[tr(A^p)]) \Rightarrow N(0,1).$ This work shows the entries of $A^{2p},$ properly scaled, also have asymptotically normal laws when $n \to \infty, p=n^{o(1)}:$ the normalizations of the diagonal entries depend on $\mathbb{E}[a_{11}^4],$ contributions that become negligible as $p \to \infty,$ whereas their counterparts in $A^{2p+1}$ depend on all the moments of \(a_{11}\) when \(p\) is bounded or the moments grow fast relatively to $p.$ This result demonstrates large powers of Wigner matrices are roughly Wigner matrices with normal entries when $a_{11} \overset{d}{=} -a_{11},\mathbb{E}[a^{2}_{11}]=1, \mathbb{E}[|a_{11}|^{8+\epsilon_0}] \leq C(\epsilon_0),$ providing another perspective on eigenvector universality, which until now has been justified primarily via local laws. The last part of this paper finds the first-order terms of traces of Wishart matrices in the random matrix theory regime, rendering yet another connection between Wigner and Wishart ensembles, as well as an avenue to extend the results herein for the former to the latter. The primary tools employed %behind the entry CLTs are the method of moments and a simple identity the Catalan numbers satisfy.</description>

      <title>Negative moments of the CREM partition function in the high temperature regime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.04329v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The continuous random energy model (CREM) was introduced by Bovier and Kurkova in 2004 which can be viewed as a generalization of Derrida's generalized random energy model. Among other things, their work indicates that there exists a critical point $\beta_c$ such that the partition function exhibits a phase transition. The present work focuses on the high temperature regime where $\beta&lt;\beta_c$. We show that for all $\beta&lt;\beta_c$ and for all $s&gt;0$, the negative $s$ moment of the CREM partition function is comparable with the expectation of the CREM partition function to the power of $-s$, up to constants that are independent of $N$.</description>

      <title>Weighted solutions of random time horizon BSDEs with stochastic monotonicity and general growth generators and related PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14435v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study focuses on a multidimensional backward stochastic differential equation (BSDE) with a general random terminal time $\tau$ taking values in $[0,+\infty]$. The generator $g$ satisfies a stochastic monotonicity condition in the first unknown variable $y$ and a stochastic Lipschitz continuity condition in the second unknown variable $z$, and it can have a more general growth with respect to $y$ than the classical one stated in (H5) of \cite{Briand2003}. Without imposing any restriction of finite moment on the stochastic coefficients, we establish a general existence and uniqueness result for the weighted solution of such BSDE in a proper weighted $L^2$-space with a suitable weighted factor. This result is proved via some innovative ideas and delicate analytical techniques, and it unifies and strengthens some existing works on BSDEs with stochastic monotonicity generators, BSDEs with stochastic Lipschitz generators, and BSDEs with deterministic Lipschitz/monotonicity generators. Then, a continuous dependence property and a stability theorem for the weighted $L^2$-solutions are given. We also derive the nonlinear Feynman-Kac formulas for both parabolic and elliptic PDEs in our context.</description>

      <title>Gaussian universality for approximately polynomial functions of high-dimensional data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10711v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish an invariance principle for polynomial functions of $n$ independent, high-dimensional random vectors, and also show that the obtained rates are nearly optimal. Both the dimension of the vectors and the degree of the polynomial are permitted to grow with $n$. Specifically, we obtain a finite sample upper bound for the error of approximation by a polynomial of Gaussians, measured in Kolmogorov distance, and extend it to functions that are approximately polynomial in a mean squared error sense. We give a corresponding lower bound that shows the invariance principle holds up to polynomial degree $o(\log n)$. The proof is constructive and adapts an asymmetrisation argument due to V. V. Senatov. We also give a necessary and sufficient condition for asymptotic normality via the fourth moment phenomenon of Nualart and Peccati. As applications, we obtain a higher-order delta method with possibly non-Gaussian limits, and generalise a number of known results on high-dimensional and infinite-order U-statistics, and on fluctuations of subgraph counts.</description>

      <title>Onsager-Machlup functional for stochastic differential equations with time-varying noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04290v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to studying the Onsager-Machlup functional for stochastic differential equations with time-varying noise of the {\alpha}-H\"older, 0&lt;{\alpha}&lt;1/4, dXt =f(t,Xt)dt+g(t)dWt.
  Our study focuses on scenarios where the diffusion coefficient g(t) exhibits temporal variability, starkly contrasting the conventional assumption of a constant diffusion coefficient in the existing literature. This variance brings some complexity to the analysis. Through this investigation, we derive the Onsager-Machlup functional, which acts as the Lagrangian for mapping the most probable transition path between metastable states in stochastic processes affected by time-varying noise. This is done by introducing new measurable norms and applying an appropriate version of the Girsanov transformation. To illustrate our theoretical advancements, we provide numerical simulations, including cases of a one-dimensional SDE and a fast-slow SDE system, which demonstrate the application to multiscale stochastic volatility models, thereby highlighting the significant impact of time-varying diffusion coefficients.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16642v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the classic problem of aggregating binary advice from conditionally independent experts, also known as the Naive Bayes setting. Our quantity of interest is the error probability of the optimal decision rule. In the case of symmetric errors (sensitivity = specificity), reasonably tight bounds on the optimal error probability are known. In the general asymmetric case, we are not aware of any nontrivial estimates on this quantity. Our contribution consists of sharp upper and lower bounds on the optimal error probability in the general case, which recover and sharpen the best known results in the symmetric special case. Since this turns out to be equivalent to estimating the total variation distance between two product distributions, our results also have bearing on this important and challenging problem.</description>

      <title>On moments of the derivative of CUE characteristic polynomials and the Riemann zeta function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03687v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the derivative of the characteristic polynomial of $N \times N$ Haar distributed unitary matrices. We obtain the first explicit formulae for complex-valued moments when the spectral variable is inside the unit disc, in the limit $N \to \infty$. These formulae are expressed in terms of the confluent hypergeometric function of the first kind. As an application, we provide an alternative method to re-obtain Mezzadri's result [J. Phys. A, 36(12):2945-2962, 2003] on the asymptotic density of zeros of the derivative as $N \to \infty$. We explore the connection between these moments and those of the derivative of the Riemann zeta function away from the critical line. Under the Lindel\"of hypothesis, we prove that all positive integer moments agree with our random matrix results up to an arithmetic factor. Inspired by this finding, we propose a conjecture on the asymptotics of non-integer moments of the derivative of the Riemann zeta function off the critical line. Within random matrix theory, we also investigate the microscopic regime where the spectral variable $z$ satisfies $|z|^{2}=1-\frac{c}{N}$ for a fixed constant $c$. We obtain an asymptotic formula for the moments in this regime as a determinant involving the finite temperature Bessel kernel, which reduces to the Bessel kernel when $c=0$. For finite matrix size, we provide an exact formula for the moments of the derivative inside the unit disc, expressed as polynomials of the inverse of the distance from the circle, with coefficients given by combinatorial sums.</description>

Abstract: We consider optimal graphons associated with extreme and near-extreme constraints on the densities of edges and triangles. We prove that the optimizers for near-extreme constraints are unique and multipodal and are perturbations of the previously known unique optimzers for extreme constraints. This proves the existence of infinitely many phases. We determine the podal structures in these phases and prove the existence of phase transitions between them.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15179v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A casino offers the following game. There are three cups each containing a die. You are being told that the dice in the cups are all the same, but possibly nonstandard. For a bet of \$1, the game master shakes all three cups and lets you choose one of them. You win \$2 if the die in your cup displays at least the average of the other two, and you lose otherwise. Is this game fair? If not, how should the casino design the dice to maximize their profit?
  This problem is a special case of the following more general question: given a measurable space $X$ and a bounded measurable function $f : X^n \to \mathbb{R}$, how large can the expectation of $f$ under probability measures of the form $\mu^{\otimes n}$ be? We develop a general method to answer this kind of question. As an example application that is harder than the casino problem, we show that the maximal probability of the event $X_1 + X_2 + X_3 &lt; 2 X_4$ for nonnegative iid random variables lies between $0.4$ and $0.422$, where the upper bound is obtained by mixed integer linear programming. We conjecture the lower bound to be the exact value.</description>

      <title>Motif Estimation via Subgraph Sampling: The Fourth Moment Phenomenon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2011.03026v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Network sampling is an indispensable tool for understanding features of large complex networks where it is practically impossible to search over the entire graph. In this paper, we develop a framework for statistical inference for counting network motifs, such as edges, triangles, and wedges, in the widely used subgraph sampling model, where each vertex is sampled independently, and the subgraph induced by the sampled vertices is observed. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the consistency and the asymptotic normality of the natural Horvitz-Thompson (HT) estimator, which can be used for constructing confidence intervals and hypothesis testing for the motif counts based on the sampled graph. In particular, we show that the asymptotic normality of the HT estimator exhibits an interesting fourth-moment phenomenon, which asserts that the HT estimator (appropriately centered and rescaled) converges in distribution to the standard normal whenever its fourth-moment converges to 3 (the fourth-moment of the standard normal distribution). As a consequence, we derive the exact thresholds for consistency and asymptotic normality of the HT estimator in various natural graph ensembles, such as sparse graphs with bounded degree, Erdos-Renyi random graphs, random regular graphs, and dense graphons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2105.12695v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An involution is a bijection that is its own inverse. Given a permutation $\sigma$ of $[n],$ let $\mathsf{invol}(\sigma)$ denote the number of ways $\sigma$ can be expressed as a composition of two involutions of $[n].$ We prove that the statistic $\mathsf{invol}$ is asymptotically lognormal when the symmetric groups $\mathfrak{S}_n$ are each equipped with Ewens Sampling Formula probability measures of some fixed positive parameter $\theta.$ This paper strengthens and generalizes previously determined results about the limiting distribution of $\log(\mathsf{invol})$ for uniform random permutations, i.e. the specific case of $\theta = 1$. We also investigate the first two moments of $\mathsf{invol}$ itself, detailing the phase transition in asymptotic behavior at $\theta = 1,$ and provide a functional refinement and a convergence rate for the Gaussian limit law which is demonstrably optimal when $\theta = 1.$</description>

      <title>Optimal control of stochastic delay differential equations: Optimal feedback controls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.05029v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we study optimal control problems for stochastic delay differential equations using the dynamic programming approach in Hilbert spaces via viscosity solutions of the associated Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations. We show how to use the partial $C^{1,\alpha}$-regularity of the value function established in \cite{defeo_federico_swiech} to obtain optimal feedback controls. The main result of the paper is a verification theorem which provides a sufficient condition for optimality using the value function. We then discuss its applicability to the construction of optimal feedback controls. We provide an application to stochastic optimal advertising problems.</description>

      <title>Branching process representation for nonlinear first-order conservation PDEs in 1D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11338v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that a large class of 1D first-order conservation PDEs can be probabilistically represented using multi-type branching processes. The representation holds when the initial conditions are linear combinations of negative exponentials. We also show that in some cases, the time of gradient blow up can be identified by studying criticality conditions of the corresponding branching processes.</description>

      <title>MCGAN: Enhancing GAN Training with Regression-Based Generator Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17191v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have emerged as a powerful tool for generating high-fidelity data. However, the main bottleneck of existing approaches is the lack of supervision on the generator training, which often results in undamped oscillation and unsatisfactory performance. To address this issue, we propose an algorithm called Monte Carlo GAN (MCGAN). This approach, utilizing an innovative generative loss function, termly the regression loss, reformulates the generator training as a regression task and enables the generator training by minimizing the mean squared error between the discriminator's output of real data and the expected discriminator of fake data. We demonstrate the desirable analytic properties of the regression loss, including discriminability and optimality, and show that our method requires a weaker condition on the discriminator for effective generator training. These properties justify the strength of this approach to improve the training stability while retaining the optimality of GAN by leveraging strong supervision of the regression loss. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets, including image data (CIFAR-10/100, FFHQ256, ImageNet, and LSUN Bedroom), time series data (VAR and stock data) and video data, are conducted to demonstrate the flexibility and effectiveness of our proposed MCGAN. Numerical results show that the proposed MCGAN is versatile in enhancing a variety of backbone GAN models and achieves consistent and significant improvement in terms of quality, accuracy, training stability, and learned latent space.</description>

      <title>On the impossibility of detecting a late change-point in the preferential attachment random graph model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18685v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of late change-point detection under the preferential attachment random graph model with time dependent attachment function. This can be formulated as a hypothesis testing problem where the null hypothesis corresponds to a preferential attachment model with a constant affine attachment parameter $\delta_0$ and the alternative corresponds to a preferential attachment model where the affine attachment parameter changes from $\delta_0$ to $\delta_1$ at a time $\tau_n = n - \Delta_n$ where $0\leq \Delta_n \leq n$ and $n$ is the size of the graph. It was conjectured in Bet et al. that when observing only the unlabeled graph, detection of the change is not possible for $\Delta_n = o(n^{1/2})$. In this work, we make a step towards proving the conjecture by proving the impossibility of detecting the change when $\Delta_n = o(n^{1/3})$. We also study change-point detection in the case where the labeled graph is observed and show that change-point detection is possible if and only if $\Delta_n \to \infty$, thereby exhibiting a strong difference between the two settings.</description>

      <title>Detecting random bifurcations via rigorous enclosures of large deviations rate functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12556v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The main goal of this work is to provide a description of transitions from uniform to non-uniform snychronization in diffusions based on large deviation estimates for finite time Lyapunov exponents. These can be characterized in terms of moment Lyapunov exponents which are principal eigenvalues of the generator of the tilted (Feynman-Kac) semigroup. Using a computer assisted proof, we demonstrate how to determine these eigenvalues and investigate the rate function which is the Legendre-Fenichel transform of the moment Lyapunov function. We apply our results to two case studies: the pitchfork bifurcation and a two-dimensional toy model, also considering the transition to a positive asymptotic Lyapunov exponent.</description>

      <title>A mean field Jacobi process for modeling sustainable tourism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20347v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A mean field Jacobi process governing the dynamics of the travel demand of agents is formulated and its application to sustainable tourism is investigated both mathematically and computationally. The bounded nature of the Jacobi diffusion process enables the categorization of tourism state with sustainable tourism state corresponding to an internal solution and overtourism state to a boundary solution. A stochastic control framework is introduced to design sustainable tourism under uncertainty, incorporating model distortion conditions owing to misspecification. The control problem is reduced to solving the optimality system of a stationary mean field game whose closed-form solution is derived under certain conditions. The optimality system can be computed numerically using the finite difference method under more general conditions. We present demonstrative examples of the mean field Jacobi process for different parameter values, illustrating both sustainable tourism and overtourism cases. Our findings suggest that the sustainable tourism state cannot be realized if the fluctuation or model misspecification is large.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Analysis and White Noise Calculus of Nonlinear Wave Equations with Application to Laser Propagation and Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16013v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study a large class of nonlinear stochastic wave equations that arise in laser generation models and models for propagation in random media in a unified mathematical framework. Continuous and pulse-wave propagation models, free electron laser generation models, as well as laser-plasma interaction models have been cast in a convenient and unified abstract framework as semilinear evolution equations in a Hilbert space to enable stochastic analysis. We formulate Ito calculus and white noise calculus methods of treating stochastic terms and prove existence and uniqueness of mild solutions.</description>

      <title>Probability-Informed Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11526v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool for tackling complex regression and classification tasks, yet its success often hinges on the quality of training data. This study introduces an ML paradigm inspired by domain knowledge of the structure of output function, akin to physics-informed ML, but rooted in probabilistic principles rather than physical laws. The proposed approach integrates the probabilistic structure of the target variable-such as its cumulative distribution function-into the training process. This probabilistic information is obtained from historical data or estimated using structural reliability methods during experimental design. By embedding domain-specific probabilistic insights into the learning process, the technique enhances model accuracy and mitigates risks of overfitting and underfitting. Applications in regression, image denoising, and classification demonstrate the approach's effectiveness in addressing real-world problems.</description>

      <title>Narayana numbers in "explicit sufficient invariants for an interacting particle system ( by Itoh, Mallows, and Shepp)"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14777v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider an interacting particle system on star graphs. As in the case of the Kdv equation, we have infinitely many invariants ( here, martingale invariants). It enables us to obtain the limiting distribution of the Markov chain. Each of the martingale invariants is a homogeneous polynomial with coefficients of Narayana numbers.The identity for the enumeration of plane unlabeled trees, which gives Narayana numbers, becomes the key identity to obtain the probability of death states by a change of variables.</description>
