      <title>Two Decades of Research at the University of Lagos (2004-2023): A Scientometric Analysis of Productivity, Collaboration, and Impact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a scientometric analysis of research output from the University of Lagos, focusing on the two decades spanning 2004 to 2023. Using bibliometric data retrieved from the Web of Science, we examine trends in publication volume, collaboration patterns, citation impact, and the most prolific authors, departments, and research domains at the university. The study reveals a consistent increase in research productivity, with the highest publication output recorded in 2023. Health Sciences, Engineering, and Social Sciences are identified as dominant fields, reflecting the university's interdisciplinary research strengths. Collaborative efforts, both locally and internationally, show a positive correlation with higher citation impact, with the United States and the United Kingdom being the leading international collaborators. Notably, open-access publications account for a significant portion of the university's research output, enhancing visibility and citation rates. The findings offer valuable insights into the university's research performance over the past two decades, providing a foundation for strategic planning and policy formulation to foster research excellence and global impact.</description>

      <title>Publication Trend in DESIDOC Journal of Library and Information Technology during 2013-2017: A Scientometric Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: DESIDOC Journal of Library &amp; Information Technology (DJLIT) formerly known as DESIDOC Bulletin of Information Technology is a peer-reviewed, open access, bimonthly journal. This paper presents a Scientometric analysis of the DESIDOC Journal. The paper analyses the pattern of growth of the research output published in the journal, pattern of authorship, author productivity, and, subjects covered to the papers over the period (2013-2017). It is found that 227 papers were published during the period of study (2001-2012). The maximum numbers of articles were collaborative in nature. The subject concentration of the journal noted is Scientometrics. The maximum numbers of articles (65%) have ranged their thought contents between 6 and 10 pages. The study applied standard formula and statistical tools to bring out the factual result.</description>

      <title>Awakening Sleeping Beauties from articles on mRNA vaccines against COVID-19</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The COVID-19 outbreak rapidly became a pandemic in the first quarter of 2020, posing an unprecedented threat and challenge to healthcare systems and the public. Governments in nearly every country focused on immunization programs for the general population using mRNA vaccines against this disease, marking the first large-scale use of this technology. Previously overlooked research papers on mRNA vaccine preparation or administration gained prominence. The impact was documented bibliographically through a surge in citations these papers received. These reports exemplify the Sleeping Beauty bibliometric phenomenon, while the articles that triggered this awakening act as the Sweet Prince, leading to the resurgence of the previous papers' bibliometric impact. Here, a backward reference search was performed in the Scopus bibliographic database to identify Sleeping Beauties by applying the Beauty Coefficient metric. A total of 915 original research articles were published in 2020, citing 21,979 referenced papers, including 1,181 focused on mRNA vaccines, with 671 of these being original research reports. By setting a threshold of at least 30 citations received before 2020, 272 papers published between 2005 and 2022 were examined. The finding that nearly half of the papers included were published in scientific journals between 2020 and 2022 is explained by the fact that these works received a significant number of citations as preprints or prepublications. We found that 28 papers from this bibliographic portfolio exhibited a Beauty Coefficient following the Sleeping Beauty bibliometric phenomenon. Our findings reveal that disruptive technological innovations may be built upon previously neglected reports that experienced sharp citation increases, driven by their crucial applicability to worldwide distresses.</description>

      <title>From data to corpus: semiotic and documentary issues in audiovisual archives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The article examines the theoretical, methodological, and technical foundations of research on audiovisual corpora within the field of digital humanities. It outlines the main transversal issues underlying the processes of constructing, exploiting, and interpreting such corpora, which are conceived as specific forms of textual data in the broad sense - that is, as sets of semiotic traces (written, visual, sound, or multimodal) that make it possible to document, analyze, and transmit domains of knowledge. The analysis is organized around five complementary themes. The first concerns the status and structure of textual data lato sensu: any data, regardless of its medium, participates in a meaningful representation of a domain and therefore requires a unified theoretical and methodological framework based on a transdisciplinary semiotic approach. The second theme addresses the documentary value of data and corpora, understood as the relevance of materials for documenting a research object in relation to the goals and perspectives of the projects in which they are used. This value depends both on provenance and reasoned selection, and on the pragmatic context of their use. The third theme distinguishes between data collections, corpora, and archives. A data collection constitutes a potential reservoir of materials, whereas a corpus results from a reasoned and contextualized selection from this collection, elaborated in relation to a specific project. Archives, in turn, refer both to open data repositories and to research resources that support experimentation, editorialization, and valorization. This distinction highlights the dynamic nature of the processes of constituting and reusing digital resources. The fourth theme explores the semantic enrichment of data, understood as the set of semiotic and technical operations that give meaning to data, establish relationships among them, and make them usable by social actors. This approach raises issues related to the description, classification, and interconnection of data, notably through the use of ontologies, metadata, and models for knowledge representation. Semantic enrichment thus forms part of a broader reflection on value creation and data reuse in diverse contexts. Finally, the fifth theme addresses the instrumentation of research, that is, the digital environments, tools, and infrastructures that support the production, management, and dissemination of corpora. These technical systems - collaborative platforms, annotation, analysis, and publication tools - form an essential component of the digital humanities ecosystem and condition new forms of archiving, circulation, and knowledge transmission. In conclusion, the article emphasizes three central questions: how to construct meaning from data; how to model strategies of appropriation, reuse, and re-publication; and how to organize new semiotic and cultural ecosystems of research. The overall challenge lies in understanding how audiovisual data can be transformed into genuine objects of knowledge and value within contemporary scientific, technical, and cultural frameworks.</description>
