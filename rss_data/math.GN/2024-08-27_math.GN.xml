      <title>Statistical and rough statistical convergence in an S-metric space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, using the concept of natural density, we have introduced the ideas of statistical and rough statistical convergence in an $S$-metric space. We have investigated some of their basic properties. We have defined statistical Cauchyness and statistical boundedness of sequences and then some results related these ideas have been studied. We have defined the set of rough statistical limit points of a sequence in an $S$-metric space and have proved some relevant results associated with such type of convergence</description>

      <title>Generic Compacta from Relations between Finite Graphs: Theory Building and Examples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent work, the authors developed a simple method of constructing topological spaces from certain well-behaved partially ordered sets -- those coming from sequences of relations between finite sets. This method associates a given poset with its spectrum, which is a compact T_1 topological space.
  In this paper, we focus on the case where such finite sets have a graph structure and the relations belong to a given graph category. We relate topological properties of the spectrum to combinatorial properties of the graph categories involved. We then utilise this to exhibit elementary combinatorial constructions of well-known continua as Fra\"iss\'e limits of finite graphs in categories with relational morphisms.</description>

      <title>A note about dual representations of group actions on Lipschitz-free spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{F}(M)$ be the Lipschitz-free space of a pointed metric space $M$. For every isometric continuous group action of $G$ we have an induced continuous dual action on the weak-star compact unit ball $B_{\mathcal{F}(M)^*}$ of the dual space $\mathrm{Lip_0} (M)=\mathcal{F}(M)^*$. We pose the question when a given abstract continuous action of $G$ on a topological space $X$ can be represented through a $G$-subspace of $B_{\mathcal{F}(M)^*}$. One of such natural examples is the so-called metric compactification (of isometric $G$-spaces) for a pointed metric space. As well as the Gromov $G$-compactification of a bounded metric $G$-space. Note that there are sufficiently many representations of compact $G$-spaces on Lipschitz-free spaces.</description>

      <title>Remarks on SHD spaces and more divergence properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16558v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The class of SHD spaces was recently introduced in [12]. The first part of this paper focuses on answering most of the questions presented in that article. For instance, we exhibit an example of a non-SHD Tychonoff space $X$ such that $\mathscr{F}[X]$, the Pixley-Roy hyperspace of $X$, $\beta X$, the Stone-\v{C}ech compactification of $X$, and $C_p(X)$, the ring of continuous functions over $X$ equipped with the topology of pointwise convergence, are SHD.
  In the second part of this work we will present some variations of the SHD notion, namely, the WSHD property and the OHD property. Furthermore, we will pay special attention to the relationships between $X$ and $\mathscr{F}[X]$ regarding these new concepts.</description>
