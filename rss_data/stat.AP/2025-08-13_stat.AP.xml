      <title>Evaluating Imputation Techniques for Short-Term Gaps in Heart Rate Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in wearable technology have enabled the continuous monitoring of vital physiological signals, essential for predictive modeling and early detection of extreme physiological events. Among these physiological signals, heart rate (HR) plays a central role, as it is widely used in monitoring and managing cardiovascular conditions and detecting extreme physiological events such as hypoglycemia. However, data from wearable devices often suffer from missing values. To address this issue, recent studies have employed various imputation techniques. Traditionally, the effectiveness of these methods has been evaluated using predictive accuracy metrics such as RMSE, MAPE, and MAE, which assess numerical proximity to the original data. While informative, these metrics fail to capture the complex statistical structure inherent in physiological signals. This study bridges this gap by presenting a comprehensive evaluation of four statistical imputation methods, linear interpolation, K Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Piecewise Cubic Hermite Interpolating Polynomial (PCHIP), and B splines, for short term HR data gaps. We assess their performance using both predictive accuracy metrics and statistical distance measures, including the Cohen Distance Test (CDT) and Jensen Shannon Distance (JS Distance), applied to HR data from the D1NAMO dataset and the BIG IDEAs Lab Glycemic Variability and Wearable Device dataset. The analysis reveals limitations in existing imputation approaches and the absence of a robust framework for evaluating imputation quality in physiological signals. Finally, this study proposes a foundational framework to develop a composite evaluation metric to assess imputation performance.</description>

      <title>A hierarchical modelling approach for Bayesian Causal Forests on longitudinal data: A Case Study in Multiple Sclerosis Clinical Trials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-running clinical trials offer a unique opportunity to study disease progression and treatment response over time, enabling questions about how and when interventions alter patient trajectories. However, drawing causal conclusions in this setting is challenging due to irregular follow-up, individual-level heterogeneity, and time-varying confounding. Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART) and their extension, Bayesian Causal Forests (BCF), have proven powerful for flexible causal inference in observational data, especially for heterogeneous treatment effects and non-linear outcome surfaces. Yet, both models assume independence across observations and are fundamentally limited in their ability to model within-individual correlation over time. This limits their use in real-world longitudinal settings where repeated measures are the norm. Motivated by the NO.MS dataset, the largest and most comprehensive clinical trial dataset in Multiple Sclerosis (MS), with more than 35,000 patients and up to 15 years follow-up, we develop BCFLong, a hierarchical model that preserves BART's strengths while extending it for longitudinal analysis. Inspired by BCF, we decompose the mean into prognostic and treatment effects, modelling the former on Image Quality Metrics (IQMs) to account for scanner effects, and introduce individual-specific random effects, including intercepts and slope, with a sparsity-inducing horseshoe prior. Simulations confirm BCFLong's superior performance and robustness to sparsity, significantly improving outcome and treatment effect estimation. On NO.MS, BCFLong captures clinically meaningful longitudinal patterns in brain volume change, which would have otherwise remained undetected. These findings highlight the importance of adaptively accounting for within-individual correlations and position BCFLong as a flexible framework for causal inference in longitudinal data.</description>

      <title>Network Dynamics in the Colombian Armed Conflict: Armed Structures and Municipalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we explore how the escalating victimization of civilians during civil wars is mirrored in the fragmented distribution of territorial control, focusing on the Colombian armed conflict. Through an exhaustive characterization of the topology of bipartite and projected networks of both armed groups and municipalities, we are able to describe changes in territorial configurations across different periods between 1980 and 2007. Our findings show that during periods dominated by a small set of actors, networks adopt a centralized node-periphery structure, while during times of widespread conflict, areas of influence of armed groups overlap in complex ways. Also, by employing stochastic block models for count data, we identify cohesive municipal communities during 2000-2001, shaped by both geographic proximity and affinities between armed structures, as well as the existence of internally dispersed groups with a high likelihood of interaction.</description>

      <title>Flow Battery Manifold Design with Heterogeneous Inputs Through Generative Adversarial Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative machine learning has emerged as a powerful tool for design representation and exploration. However, its application is often constrained by the need for large datasets of existing designs and the lack of interpretability about what features drive optimality. To address these challenges, we introduce a systematic framework for constructing training datasets tailored to generative models and demonstrate how these models can be leveraged for interpretable design. The novelty of this work is twofold: (i) we present a systematic framework for generating archetypes with internally homogeneous but mutually heterogeneous inputs that can be used to generate a training dataset, and (ii) we show how integrating generative models with Bayesian optimization can enhance the interpretability of the latent space of admissible designs. These findings are validated by using the framework to design a flow battery manifold, demonstrating that it effectively captures the space of feasible designs, including novel configurations while enabling efficient exploration. This work broadens the applicability of generative machine-learning models in system designs by enhancing quality and reliability.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric Bayesian Multi-Treatment Mixture Cure Survival Model with Application in Pediatric Oncology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08975v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heterogeneous treatment effect estimation is critical in oncology, particularly in multi-arm trials with overlapping therapeutic components and long-term survivors. These shared mechanisms pose a central challenge to identifying causal effects in precision medicine. We propose a novel covariate-dependent nonparametric Bayesian multi-treatment cure survival model that jointly accounts for common structures among treatments and cure fractions. Through latent link functions, our model leverages sharing among treatments through a flexible modeling approach, enabling individualized survival inference. We adopt a Bayesian route for inference and implement an efficient MCMC algorithm for approximating the posterior. Simulation studies demonstrate the method's robustness and superiority in various specification scenarios. Finally, application to the AALL0434 trial reveals clinically meaningful differences in survival across methotrexate-based regimens and their associations with different covariates, underscoring its practical utility for learning treatment effects in real-world pediatric oncology data.</description>

      <title>Tracing the impacts of Mount Pinatubo eruption on regional climate using spatially-varying changepoint detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08908v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Significant events, such as volcanic eruptions, can have global and long-lasting impacts on climate. These global impacts, however, are not uniform across space and time. Understanding how the Mt. Pinatubo eruption affects global and regional climate is of great interest for predicting the impact on climate due to similar events as well as understanding the possible effect of the stratospheric aerosol injections proposed to combat climate change. While many studies illustrated the impact of the Pinatubo eruption on a global scale, studies at a fine regional scale are scarce. We propose a Bayesian spatially-varying changepoint detection and estimation method to trace the impact of Mt. Pinatubo eruption on regional climate. Our approach takes into account the diffusing nature and spatial correlation of the climate changes attributed to the volcanic eruption. We illustrate our method and demonstrate its advantages over an existing changepoint detection method through simulations. Finally, we apply our method to monthly stratospheric aerosol optical depth and surface temperature data from 1985 to 1995 to detect and estimate changepoints following the 1991 Mt. Pinatubo eruption. Our results quantitatively characterize the spatial pattern of the eruption's impact on regional climate, complementing the previous studies on the global impact of the Pinatubo eruption.</description>

      <title>Utilizing Multiple Testing for Grouping in Singular Spectrum Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01665v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A key step in separating signal from noise in time series by means of singular spectrum analysis (SSA) is grouping. We present a multiple testing method for the grouping step in SSA. As separability criterion, we utilize the weighted correlation between the signal and the noise component of the (reconstructed) time series, and we test whether this weighted correlation is equal to zero. This test has to be performed for several possible groupings, resulting in a multiple test problem. The null distributions of the corresponding test statistics are approximated by a wild bootstrap procedure. The performance of our proposed method is assessed in a simulation study, and we illustrate its practical application with an analysis of real world data.</description>

      <title>Risk Estimate under a Time-Varying Autoregressive Model for Data-Driven Reproduction Number Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14937v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: COVID-19 pandemic has brought to the fore epidemiological models which, though describing a wealth of behaviors, have previously received little attention in signal processing literature. In this work, a generalized time-varying autoregressive model is considered, encompassing, but not reducing to, a state-of-the-art model of viral epidemics propagation. The time-varying parameter of this model is estimated via the minimization of a penalized likelihood estimator. A major challenge is that the estimation accuracy strongly depends on hyperparameters fine-tuning. Without available ground truth, hyperparameters are selected by minimizing specifically designed data-driven oracles, used as proxy for the estimation error. Focusing on the time-varying autoregressive Poisson model, Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimate formalism is generalized to construct asymptotically unbiased risk estimators based on the derivation of an original autoregressive counterpart of Stein's lemma. The accuracy of these oracles and of the resulting estimates are assessed through intensive Monte Carlo simulations on synthetic data. Then, elaborating on recent epidemiological models, a novel weekly scaled Poisson model is proposed, better accounting for intrinsic variability of the contaminations while being robust to reporting errors. Finally, the data-driven procedure is particularized to the estimation of COVID-19 reproduction number from weekly infection counts demonstrating its ability to tackle real-world applications.</description>
