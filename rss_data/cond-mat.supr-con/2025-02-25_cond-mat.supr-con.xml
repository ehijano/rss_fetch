      <title>Geometric origin of supercurrents in Berry phase: Formula for computing currents from wavefunctions with correlation and particle number variation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The complexity of itinerant and many-body nature in Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) wavefunctions has traditionally led to the use of coarse-grained order parameters for describing currents in superconductors (SC), rather than directly utilizing wavefunctions. In this work, we introduce a phase-based formula that enables the direct computation of currents from microscopic wavefunctions, accounting for correlation and particle number variations. Interestingly, the formulation draws parallels with insulators, suggesting a unified framework for understanding (intra-band) charge transport across two extremes of conductivity. A group velocity current $J_{band}{\propto}\frac{1}{\hbar}{\partial}_kE(k)$ is derived from Berry phase, independent of wave package dynamics, robust against correlation. Additionally, we identify a correlation-driven contribution, $J_{corr}$, which reveals that the pairing correlations ${\langle}c_kc_{-k}{\rangle}$ among dancing partners provide a current component beyond the velocity operator.</description>

      <title>Perfect spin-triplet pairing in two-dimensional Ising superconductors purified by indirect excitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Much research effort has been devoted to interfacial or two-dimensional (2D) superconductors, but the underlying pairing mechanisms and pairing symmetries are highly controversial in most cases. Here we propose an innovative approach to probe the pairing symmetry of 2D superconductors, based on a van der Waals heterostructure consisting of a prototypical 2D Ising superconductor coupled with a 2D hole gas through an insulating spacer. We first show that, by tuning the Coulomb attraction between the superconducting and hole layers, the gap of the corresponding indirect exciton insulators is tuned as well, resulting in contrasting manifestations of the distinct superconducting channels with spin-singlet (s-, extended s-, and d-wave) and spin-triplet (p- and f-wave) pairings. Strikingly, we find that the application of in-plane magnetic fields can suppress all other channels while selecting the spin-triplet p-wave channel to be the pure superconducting state, thus providing an ideal and practical platform for realizing highly desirable topological superconductivity. Such an approach can also be readily extended to other types of superconducting systems, offering unprecedented opportunities to probe the microscopic mechanisms of unconventional superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Discovery of High-Temperature Superconducting Ternary Hydrides via Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of novel high-temperature superconductor materials holds transformative potential for a wide array of technological applications. However, the combinatorially vast chemical and configurational search space poses a significant bottleneck for both experimental and theoretical investigations. In this study, we employ the design of high-temperature ternary superhydride superconductors as a representative case to demonstrate how this challenge can be well addressed through a deep-learning-driven theoretical framework. This framework integrates high-throughput crystal structure exploration, physics-informed screening, and accurate prediction of superconducting critical temperatures. Our approach enabled the exploration of approximately 36 million ternary hydride structures across a chemical space of 29 elements, leading to the identification of 144 potential high-Tc superconductors with predicted Tc &gt; 200 K and superior thermodynamic stability at 200 GPa. Among these, 129 compounds spanning 27 novel structural prototypes are reported for the first time, representing a significant expansion of the known structural landscape for hydride superconductors. This work not only greatly expands the known repertoire of high-Tc hydride superconductors but also establishes a scalable and efficient methodology for navigating the complex landscape of multinary hydrides.</description>

      <title>Unraveling Enhanced Superconductivity in Single-layer FeSe through Substrate Surface Terminations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-layer FeSe films grown on (001) SrTiO3 substrates have shown a significant increase in superconducting transition temperature compared to bulk FeSe. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain such enhancement, including electron doping, interfacial electron-phonon coupling, and strong electron correlations. To pinpoint the primary driver, we grew FeSe films on SrTiO3 substrates with coexisting TiO2 and SrO surface terminations. Scanning tunneling spectroscopy revealed a larger superconducting gap of 17 meV for FeSe on TiO2 compared to 11 meV on SrO. Tunneling spectroscopy also showed a larger work function on SrO, leading to reduced charge transfer, as confirmed by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. Scanning transmission electron microscopy revealed distinctive interfacial atomic-scale structures, with the Se-Fe-Se tetrahedral angle changing from 109.9{\deg} on SrO to 105.1{\deg} on TiO2. Compared to dynamical mean field theory calculations, these results suggest optimal electron correlations in FeSe/TiO2 for enhancing high-temperature superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Phase coherence of charge-$6e$ superconductors via a frustrated Kagome XY antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experimental evidence for the charge-$6e$ condensed phase in kagome superconductors has generated significant interest. We investigate the unconventional superconductivity in the kagome superconductor $\mathrm{CsV_3Sb_5}$, focusing on the emergence of charge-$6e$ superconductivity (SC) at temperatures higher than the conventional charge-$2e$ SC state. By modeling the phase coherence of the SC order parameter using a frustrated antiferromagnetic XY model on an emergent kagome lattice, we show that the condensation of fractional vortices with $1/3$ vorticity stabilizes phase coherence in $\exp(i3\theta)$, giving rise to the charge-$6e$ SC state. Using a tensor network approach tailored for frustrated spin systems, we identify a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition at $T_c/J \simeq 0.075$, where the unbinding of $1/3$ fractional vortex-antivortex pairs transforms the system from the charge-$6e$ SC phase to the normal phase. Below $T_c$, the $1/3$ fractional vortex correlations exhibit power-law decay, while the integer vortex correlations decay exponentially, reflecting the dominance of charge-$6e$ SC in the absence of charge-$2e$ SC. Our results provide a theoretical understanding of the charge-$6e$ SC in two-dimensional kagome superconductors, emphasizing the interplay between fractional vortices, frustration, and topology in stabilizing this exotic SC phase.</description>

      <title>Status of Iron Based Superconductors: characteristics and relevant properties for applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the discovery of iron-based superconductors (IBSs) on LaFePO in 2006, many types of IBSs have been fabricated. IBSs have usually been compared to cuprates and MgB2, and the methodology of research developed by them have been implemented to IBSs. As a result, many similarities between IBSs and cuprates have been revealed, e.g., the parent compounds being antiferromagnets and grain boundaries being weak-links to some extent. On the other hands, the distinct features of IBSs are highlighted as multiband superconductors (i.e., the 5 bands of Fe 3d orbital crossing Fermi level) and extended s-wave symmetry. Additionally, some of the IBSs are topological superconductors that can be possible platforms for quantum computing. In this paper, an overview of IBS research and development in the last 18 years will be reported, involving characteristics of IBSs as well as strategies of increasing the superconducting transition temperature and critical current density.</description>

      <title>Josephson vortex system in a flux-flow regime in electron doped high-Tc superconductor Nd(2-x)CexCuO4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For an epitaxial film of an electron-doped superconductor Nd(2-x)CexCuO4 (x=0.145), in a mixed state, a well-defined step structure is observed on the dependence of the c-axis flux-flow resistance on the magnetic field parralel to CuO2 layers. It is shown that in the region of a free flow of Josephson vortices, the structure is periodic with a period of deltaB~Phi0/(lambdaablambdac). It is essential that the magnetic penetration depths in the ab-plane (lambdaab) and along the c-axis (lambdac) determine the sizes of the Josephson vortices in the Lawrence-Doniach model for an anisotropic layered superconductor.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The high-density region of the QCD phase diagram displays an intricate competition between color superconductivity and the QCD Kondo effect due to color exchange in quark matter containing a single heavy quark impurity. We explore the characteristic impurity-induced superconducting subgap states arising in such systems by generalizing the surrogate model solver, recently considered in the context of condensed matter physics [Phys. Rev. B 108, L220506 (2023)]. The method consists of approximating the full superconducting bulk by only a small number of effective levels whose parameters are chosen so as to best reproduce the Matsubara frequency dependence of the impurity-bulk hybridization function. We numerically solve a surrogate QCD Kondo model describing a quantum impurity color-exchange coupled to a two-color two-flavor superconducting bulk. The results directly indicate the presence of multiple phase transitions as the coupling of the impurity to the bulk is increased, due to the interplay between various overscreened states. The methods introduced here are straightforward enough to be extended to more realistic QCD scenarios.</description>

      <title>Proximity-Induced Nodal Metal in an Extremely Underdoped CuO$_2$ Plane in Triple-Layer Cuprates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: ARPES studies have established that the high-$T_c$ cuprates with single and double CuO$_2$ layers evolve from the Mott insulator to the pseudogap state with a Fermi arc, on which the superconducting (SC) gap opens. In four- to six-layer cuprates, on the other hand, small hole Fermi pockets are formed in the innermost CuO$_2$ planes, indicating antiferromagnetism. Here, we performed ARPES studies on the triple-layer Bi$_2$Sr$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{10+\delta}$ over a wide doping range, and found that, although the doping level of the inner CuO$_2$ plane was extremely low in underdoped samples, the $d$-wave SC gap was enhanced to the unprecedentedly large value of $\Delta_0\sim$100 meV at the antinode and persisted well above $T_{{c}}$ without the appearance of a Fermi arc, indicating a robust ``nodal metal''. We attribute the nodal metallic behavior to the unique local environment of the inner clean CuO$_2$ plane in the triple-layer cuprates, sandwiched by nearly optimally-doped two outer CuO$_2$ planes and hence subject to strong proximity effect from both sides. In the nodal metal, quasiparticle peaks showed electron-hole symmetry, suggesting $d$-wave pairing fluctuations. Thus the proximity effect on the innermost CuO${_2}$ plane is the strongest in the triple-layer cuprates, which explains why the $T_c$ reaches the maximum at the layer number of three in every multi-layer cuprate family.</description>

      <title>Loop-current order through the kagome looking glass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In loop-current states, interacting electronic degrees of freedom collectively establish interatomic currents, in a rare example of magnetism in which spin degrees of freedom do not play the primary role. The main impact of such states on the electronic spectrum is not via the standard Zeeman term, but via the kinetic energy, in which hopping parameters develop non-trivial phases that break time-reversal symmetry. The recent proposal of loop-current states in kagome superconductors has stimulated renewed interest in this exotic type of magnetism. In this perspective, we use kagome materials as a scaffolding to frame the basic phenomenology of loop-current states. We provide an overview of the group-theoretical properties of loop currents, as well as of relevant microscopic models and ab initio methods. Particular emphasis is given to the comparison with spin-density waves in the presence of spin-orbit coupling, as well as to the anharmonic coupling with charge-density waves, which is present in systems with threefold rotational symmetry. We also provide a brief overview of the current status of loop-current order in kagome metals and discuss open challenges including their experimental detection and interplay with other orders.</description>

      <title>Callan-Rubakov effects in topological insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Callan-Rubakov effect describes monopole-catalyzed proton decay. While this effect is fundamental for quantum field theories, its experimental observation has remained far from reality. Here, we reveal a similar, but experimentally reachable, defect-catalysis of the quantum anomaly in topological materials. In particular, surface Dirac fermions on topological insulators develop a distinct localized state at the position of dislocations or $\pi$-fluxes, which mediates spin-flip time-reversal breaking scattering or absorption of electrons. Despite the Hermiticity of topological insulators, a non-Hermitian topological number guarantees the robust existence of the localized state. Our finding implies that non-magnetic defects may behave like magnetic impurities on surfaces of topological insulators. Using the K-theory classification, we generalize this condensed-matter version of the Callan-Rubakov effect to other classes of topological materials.</description>

      <title>High quality superconducting tantalum resonators with beta phase defects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For practical superconducting quantum processors, orders of magnitude improvement in coherence is required, motivating efforts to optimize hardware design and explore new materials. Among the latter, the coherence of superconducting transmon qubits has been shown to improve by forming the qubit capacitor pads from $\alpha$-tantalum, avoiding the meta-stable $\beta$-phase that forms when depositing tantalum at room temperature, and has been previously identified to be a source of microwave losses. In this work, we show lumped element resonators containing $\beta$-phase tantalum in the form of inclusions near the metal-substrate interface with internal quality factors ($Q_\text{i}$) up to $(5.0 \pm 2.5) \times 10^6$ in the single photon regime. They outperform resonators with no sign of the $\beta$-phase in x-ray diffraction and thermal quasi-particle loss. Our results indicate that small concentrations of $\beta$-phase can be beneficial, enhancing critical magnetic fields and potentially, for improving coherence in tantalum based superconducting circuits.</description>

      <title>Majorana edge and end states in planar Josephson junctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19086v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the localization properties of Majorana states (MSs) in proximitized, planar Josephson Junctions (JJs) oriented along different crystallographic orientations and in the presence of an in-plane magnetic field and Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit couplings. We show that two types of MSs may emerge when the junction transits into the topological superconducting state. In one case, referred to as end-like MSs, the Majorana quasiparticles are mainly localized inside the normal region at the opposite ends of the junction. In contrast, edge-like MSs extend along the opposite edges of the system, perpendicular to the junction channel. We show how the MSs can transit from end-like to edge-like and vice versa by tuning the magnetic field strength and/or the superconducting phase difference across the junction. In the case of phase-unbiased JJs the transition may occur as the ground state phase difference self-adjusts its value when the Zeeman field is varied.</description>

Using the intralayer BCS-like pairing interaction and employing the Gor'kov formalism, we obtain analytical expressions for the temperature Green's functions and determine the gap function $\Delta$ which becomes complex in the presence of SOIs. In the absence of SOIs, $\Delta$ is isotropic at both zero and finite temperatures, but it becomes anisotropic even in the presence of a single SOI. This anisotropy is related to the extra $\cos{k_z}$ factors in which the $k_z$ momentum along the $z$ direction contributes to the magnitude of the gap function. It is also found that SOIs suppress $\Delta$ at both zero and finite temperatures, and for certain critical values of SOIs and beyond $\Delta$ vanishes. Analytical expressions for the critical values of SOIs at zero temperature are obtained. Additionally, how the BCS equation for layered superconductors changes in the presence of SOIs is determined.</description>

      <title>Comparison of NiFeCr and NiFe in ferromagnetic Josephson junctions</title>

Abstract: Josephson junctions containing ferromagnetic materials are under consideration for applications in digital superconducting logic and memory. Some memory applications rely on the ability to reverse the magnetization direction of a "soft" magnetic layer within the junction using a small local magnetic field generated on the chip. It is crucial, therefore, to find a suitable soft magnetic material with a low switching field and low switching energy. A popular magnetic material for such applications is Ni$_{80}$Fe$_{20}$, also known as Permalloy, however Permalloy has a rather large magnetization, leading to large magnetic switching energies. In this work we explore Cr-doped Permalloy, specifically Ni$_{73}$Fe$_{18}$Cr$_{9}$, which has a saturation magnetization just under two-thirds that of Permalloy. Josephson junctions containing this NiFeCr alloy undergo a 0-$\pi$ transition at a NiFeCr thickness of 2.3 nm, and the critical supercurrent decays in the alloy over a short characteristic length of 0.36 nm. Switching fields of a few millitesla are promising, but the short decay length and overall small values of the critical current in the Josephson junctions may preclude the use of NiFeCr in current cryogenic memory technologies.</description>

      <title>Apparent nonreciprocal transport in FeSe bulk crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08928v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We performed low-frequency ac first- and second-harmonic resistance measurements and dc $I-V$ measurements on bulk FeSe crystals in a temperature range between 1.8 and 150 K and in magnetic field up to 14 T. We observed considerable second-harmonic resistance, indicative of nonreciprocal charge transport, in some samples. By examining correlation between contact resistances and second-harmonic signals, we concluded that the second-harmonic resistance was not due to the genuine nonreciprocal transport effect but was caused by joule heating at a current contact through the thermoelectric effect. Our conclusion is consistent with a recent preprint (Nagata \textit{et al.}, arXiv:2409.01715), in which the authors reported a zero-field superconducting diode effect in devices fabricated with FeSe flakes and attributed it to the thermoelectric effect.</description>

      <title>Strong-coupling high-$T_{\rm c}$ superconductivity in doped correlated band insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14601v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the superconducting properties of the bilayer Hubbard model, which exhibits a high transition temperature ($T_{\rm c}$) for an $s_{\pm}$ pairing, using a cluster extension of the dynamical mean-field theory. Unlike the single-layer Hubbard model, where the $d$-wave superconductivity emerges by doping the Mott insulator, the parent state of the bilayer system is a correlated band insulator. Above $T_{\rm c}$, slight hole (electron) doping introduces a striking dichotomy between electron and hole pockets: the electron (hole) pocket develops a pseudogap while the other becomes a nearly incipient band. We reveal that the superconductivity is driven by kinetic (potential) energy gain in the underdoped (overdoped) region. We also find a very short coherence length, for which we argue the relevance to multi-orbital physics. Our study offers crucial insights into the superconductivity in the bilayer Hubbard model potentially relevant to La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12392v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Instability of the charged pion vacuum resulting in the pion condensation is studied within the $\lambda|\phi|^4$ model at the rapid rotation of the system in presence of external fields. Case of the static external scalar and electric square potential wells and the uniform magnetic field is studied in detail. The Meissner and Aharonov-Bohm effects and the London moment are taken into account. Analogies and differences with the behavior of metallic superconductors under the action of the rotation and the external magnetic field are analysed.</description>

      <title>Theory of charge dynamics in bilayer electron system with long-range Coulomb interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13650v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform a comprehensive study of charge excitations in a bilayer electron system in the presence of the long-range Coulomb interaction (LRC). Our major point is to derive formulae of the LRC that fully respect the bilayer lattice structure. This is an extension of the LRC obtained by Fetter in the electron-gas model 50 years ago and can now be applicable to any electron density. We then provide general formulae of the charge susceptibility in the random phase approximation and study them numerically. The charge ordering tendency is not found and instead we find two plasmon modes, w_{+} and w_{-} modes. Our second major point is to elucidate their spectral weight distribution and the effect of electron tunneling between the layers. The spectral weight of the w_{+-} modes does not have 2pi periodicity along the q_{z}c direction. The w_{+} mode loses spectral weight at inplane momentum q_{||}=(0,0) at q_{z}c=2n pi with n being integer whereas the w_{-} mode has no spectral weight at q_{z}c=0 for any q_{||} but acquires sizable spectral weight at q_{z}c=2n pi with n \ne 0. Both w_{+-} modes are gapped at q_{||}=(0,0). When q_{z}c is away from 2n pi, the w_{+-} modes show striking behavior. When the intrabilayer hopping t_z is relatively small (large), the w_{-} (w_{+}) mode becomes gapless at q_{||}=(0,0) whereas the w_{+} (w_{-}) mode retains the gap. However, when the interbilayer hopping integral t_{z}' is taken into account, the gapless mode acquires a gap at q_{||}=(0,0) and both w_{+-} modes are gapped at any q_{z}c. To highlight the special feature of the LRC, we also clarify a difference to the case of a short-range interaction. While the strong electron correlation effects are not included, the present theory captures available data of the charge excitations observed by resonant inelastic x-ray scattering for Y-based cuprate superconductors.</description>
