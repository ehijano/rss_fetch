      <title>AI Spillover is Different: Flat and Lean Firms as Engines of AI Diffusion and Productivity Gain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Labor mobility is a critical source of technology acquisition for firms. This paper examines how artificial intelligence (AI) knowledge is disseminated across firms through labor mobility and identifies the organizational conditions that facilitate productive spillovers. Using a comprehensive dataset of over 460 million job records from Revelio Labs (2010 to 2023), we construct an inter-firm mobility network of AI workers among over 16,000 U.S. companies. Estimating a Cobb Douglas production function, we find that firms benefit substantially from the AI investments of other firms from which they hire AI talents, with productivity spillovers two to three times larger than those associated with traditional IT after accounting for labor scale. Importantly, these spillovers are contingent on organizational context: hiring from flatter and more lean startup method intensive firms generates significant productivity gains, whereas hiring from firms lacking these traits yields little benefit. Mechanism tests indicate that "flat and lean" organizations cultivate more versatile AI generalists who transfer richer knowledge across firms. These findings reveal that AI spillovers differ fundamentally from traditional IT spillovers: while IT spillovers primarily arise from scale and process standardization, AI spillovers critically depend on the experimental and integrative environments in which AI knowledge is produced. Together, these results underscore the importance of considering both labor mobility and organizational context in understanding the full impact of AI-driven productivity spillovers.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Factor Contributions for Sold Homes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We evaluate the contributions of ten intrinsic and extrinsic factors, including ESG (environmental, social, and governance) factors readily available from website data to individual home sale prices using a P-spline generalized additive model (GAM). We identify the relative significance of each factor by evaluating the change in adjusted R^2 value resulting from its removal from the model. We combine this with information from correlation matrices to identify the added predictive value of a factor. Based on data from 2022 through 2024 for three major U.S. cities, the GAM consistently achieved higher adjusted R^2 values across all cities (compared to a benchmark generalized linear model) and identified all factors as statistically significant at the 0.5% level. The tests revealed that living area and location (latitude, longitude) were the most significant factors; each independently adds predictive value. The ESG-related factors exhibited limited significance; two of them each adding independent predictive value. The elderly/disabled accessibility factor was much more significant in one retirement-oriented city. In all cities, the accessibility factor showed moderate correlation with one intrinsic factor. Despite the granularity of the ESG data, this study also represents a pivotal step toward integrating sustainability-related factors into predictive models for real estate valuation.</description>

      <title>Overprocurement of balancing capacity may increase the welfare in the cross-zonal energy-reserve coallocation problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When the traded energy and reserve products between zones are co-allocated to optimize the infrastructure usage, both deterministic and stochastic flows have to be accounted for on interconnector lines. We focus on allocation models, which guarantee deliverability in the context of the portfolio bidding European day-ahead market framework, assuming a flow-based description of network constraints. In such models, as each unit of allocated reserve supply implies additional cost, it is straightforward to assume that the amount of allocated reserve is equal to the accepted reserve demand quantity. However, as it is illustrated by the proposed work, overprocurement of reserves may imply counterintuitive benefits. Reserve supplies not used for balancing may be used for congestion management, thus allowing valuable additional flows in the network.</description>

      <title>When Assurance Undermines Intelligence: The Efficiency Costs of Data Governance in AI-Enabled Labor Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) like Large Language Model (LLM) is increasingly integrated into digital platforms to enhance information access, deliver personalized experiences, and improve matching efficiency. However, these algorithmic advancements rely heavily on large-scale user data, creating a fundamental tension between information assurance-the protection, integrity, and responsible use of privacy data-and artificial intelligence-the learning capacity and predictive accuracy of models. We examine this assurance-intelligence trade-off in the context of LinkedIn, leveraging a regulatory intervention that suspended the use of user data for model training in Hong Kong. Using large-scale employment and job posting data from Revelio Labs and a Difference-in-Differences design, we show that restricting data use significantly reduced GenAI efficiency, leading to lower matching rates, higher employee turnover, and heightened labor market frictions. These effects were especially pronounced for small and fast-growing firms that rely heavily on AI for talent acquisition. Our findings reveal the unintended efficiency costs of well-intentioned data governance and highlight that information assurance, while essential for trust, can undermine intelligence-driven efficiency when misaligned with AI system design. This study contributes to emerging research on AI governance and digital platform by theorizing data assurance as an institutional complement-and potential constraint-to GenAI efficacy in data-intensive environments.</description>

      <title>Prompting for Policy: Forecasting Macroeconomic Scenarios with Synthetic LLM Personas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We evaluate whether persona-based prompting improves Large Language Model (LLM) performance on macroeconomic forecasting tasks. Using 2,368 economics-related personas from the PersonaHub corpus, we prompt GPT-4o to replicate the ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters across 50 quarterly rounds (2013-2025). We compare the persona-prompted forecasts against the human experts panel, across four target variables (HICP, core HICP, GDP growth, unemployment) and four forecast horizons. We also compare the results against 100 baseline forecasts without persona descriptions to isolate its effect. We report two main findings. Firstly, GPT-4o and human forecasters achieve remarkably similar accuracy levels, with differences that are statistically significant yet practically modest. Our out-of-sample evaluation on 2024-2025 data demonstrates that GPT-4o can maintain competitive forecasting performance on unseen events, though with notable differences compared to the in-sample period. Secondly, our ablation experiment reveals no measurable forecasting advantage from persona descriptions, suggesting these prompt components can be omitted to reduce computational costs without sacrificing accuracy. Our results provide evidence that GPT-4o can achieve competitive forecasting accuracy even on out-of-sample macroeconomic events, if provided with relevant context data, while revealing that diverse prompts produce remarkably homogeneous forecasts compared to human panels.</description>

      <title>Natural-gas storage modelling by deep reinforcement learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce GasRL, a simulator that couples a calibrated representation of the natural gas market with a model of storage-operator policies trained with deep reinforcement learning (RL). We use it to analyse how optimal stockpile management affects equilibrium prices and the dynamics of demand and supply. We test various RL algorithms and find that Soft Actor Critic (SAC) exhibits superior performance in the GasRL environment: multiple objectives of storage operators - including profitability, robust market clearing and price stabilisation - are successfully achieved. Moreover, the equilibrium price dynamics induced by SAC-derived optimal policies have characteristics, such as volatility and seasonality, that closely match those of real-world prices. Remarkably, this adherence to the historical distribution of prices is obtained without explicitly calibrating the model to price data. We show how the simulator can be used to assess the effects of EU-mandated minimum storage thresholds. We find that such thresholds have a positive effect on market resilience against unanticipated shifts in the distribution of supply shocks. For example, with unusually large shocks, market disruptions are averted more often if a threshold is in place.</description>

      <title>The economics of global personality diversity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19388v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study explores the relationship between personality diversity and national economic performance, introducing the Global Personality Diversity Index (${\Psi}$-GPDI) as a novel metric. Leveraging a dataset of 760,242 individuals across 135 countries, we quantify within-country diversity based on the Big Five personality traits. Our findings reveal that personality diversity accounts for 19.9% of the variance in GDP per capita and provides an additional 2.8% explanatory power beyond institutional quality and immigration, underscoring its unique contribution to economic vitality. Through multi-factor analysis, we demonstrate how personality diversity complements existing economic frameworks, offering actionable insights for policymakers seeking to enhance innovation, productivity, and resilience. This research positions psychological diversity as a critical yet under explored factor in driving economic growth, bridging the fields of psychology and economics.</description>

      <title>Measuring Domestic Violence. Individual Attitudes and Time Use Within the Household</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01473v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel empirical strategy to measure cultural justifications of domestic violence within households, with direct implications for demographic behavior and gender inequality. Leveraging survey data on individual attitudes and high-frequency time-use diaries from Italian couples with children, I construct a composite index that integrates stated beliefs with observed household practices. Using structural equation modeling, I disentangle latent tolerance of domestic violence from reported attitudes and validate the index against both individual and partner characteristics, as well as time allocation patterns. Results reveal systematic heterogeneity by gender, education, and normative environments. Conservative gender and parenthood norms are strong predictors of tolerance, while higher male education reduces it. Tolerance of violence is also positively associated with reported leisure time with partners and children, suggesting that co-presence does not necessarily reflect egalitarian interaction but may coexist with unequal bargaining structures. Beyond advancing measurement, the findings highlight how cultural tolerance of domestic violence is embedded in household arrangements that influence fertility, labor supply, and the intergenerational transmission of norms. The proposed framework offers a scalable tool for economists and policymakers to monitor hidden inequalities and design interventions targeting family stability, gender equity, and child well-being.</description>
