      <title>Spectral structure of infinite size squared distances matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let a finite set of points $\{\xi_1,...,\xi_k\}$ be chosen in a metric space $(X,\mathfrak{D})$, and let the squared distance matrix $\mathfrak{D}=(\mathfrak{D}(\xi_i,\xi_j)^2)_{i,j=1}^{k}$ be constructed from them. We propose a geometric approach to studying the spectral properties of squared distance matrices of infinite size, constructed from a countable set of points $\{\xi_k\}_{k\in \mathbb{Z}}$ on Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$. We move from the discrete problem to a continuous one using walk matrices. We describe the structure of the spectrum and study the properties of spectral flows.</description>

      <title>On generalized disc-polygons in plane convex bodies with a higher degree of smoothness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove power series expansions for the expectations of the number of vertices and missed area of random $L$-convex polygons in planar convex bodies with sufficiently smooth boundaries. Random $L$-convex polygons arise as the intersection of all translates of a fixed convex set $L$ that contain i.i.d. uniform random points from a suitable plane convex body $K$. Our results extend the asymptotic formulas proved in Fodor, Papv\'ari and V\'igh (2020) and Fodor and Montenegro (2024), and have consequences about $L$-convex floating bodies and relative affine surface area that were investigated by Sch\"utt, Werner and Yalikun (2025).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.10460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of $P_{\lambda}$ points, which canonically parametrize points on the Euler line. This allows us to show that the Euler line of any inscribed $n$-polytope in $d$-dimensional Euclidean space arises from the Euler lines of its facets, beginning from the Euler line of a point in the plane. Furthermore, we situate $P_{\lambda}$ points in the literature of modern triangle centers.</description>

      <title>Maximum diversity, weighting and invariants of time series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnitude, obtained as a special case of Euler characteristic of enriched category, represents a sense of the size of metric spaces and is related to classical notions such as cardinality, dimension, and volume. While the studies have explained the meaning of magnitude from various perspectives, continuity also gives a valuable view of magnitude. Based on established results about continuity of magnitude and maximum diversity, this article focuses on continuity of weighting, a distribution whose totality is magnitude, and its variation corresponding to maximum diversity. Meanwhile, recent studies also illuminated the connection between magnitude and data analysis by applying magnitude theory to point clouds representing the data or the set of model parameters. This article will also provide an application for time series analysis by introducing a new kind of invariants of periodic time series, where the invariance follows directly from the continuity results. As a use-case, a simple machine learning experiment is conducted with real-world data, in which the suggested invariants improved the performance.</description>

      <title>Chabauty limits of fixed point groups of $p$-adic involutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Chabauty limits of the fixed-point group of $k$-points $H_k$ associated with an involutive $k$-automorphism $\theta$ of a connected linear reductive group $G$ defined over a non-Archimedean local field $k$ of characteristic zero. Leveraging the geometry of the Bruhat--Tits building, the structure of $(\theta,k)$-split tori, and the $K\mathcal{B}_kH_k$ decomposition of $G_k$, we establish that any nontrivial Chabauty limit $L$ of $H_k$ is $G_k$-conjugate to a subgroup of $$U_{\sigma_+}(k) \rtimes (Ker(\alpha)^0 \cdot (H_k \cap M_{\sigma_{\pm}})) \leq P_{\sigma_+}(k),$$ where $\alpha$ is a projection map arising from a Levi factor $M_{\sigma_{\pm}}$ of a parabolic subgroup $P_{\sigma_+} \subset G$, and $Ker(\alpha)^0$ denotes the subgroup of elliptic elements in the kernel of $\alpha$. Our analysis distinguishes between elliptic and hyperbolic elements and constructs explicit unipotent elements in the limit group $L$ using the Moufang property of $G_k$. Furthermore, we show that $L$ acts transitively on the set of ideal simplices opposite to $\sigma_+$. These results yield a detailed description of the Chabauty compactification of $H_k$, and provide new insights into its interaction with the non-Archimedean geometry of $G_k$.</description>

      <title>Closed curve covering and multiagent TSP ratios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16675v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: How efficiently can a closed curve of unit length in $\mathbb{R}^d$ be covered by $k$ closed curves so as to minimize the maximum length of the $k$ curves? We show that the maximum length is at most $2k^{-1} - \frac{1}{4} k^{-4}$ for all $k\geq 2$ and $d \geq 2$. As a first byproduct, we show that $k$ agents can traverse a Euclidean TSP instance significantly faster than a single agent. We thereby sharpen recent planar results by Berendsohn, Kim, and Kozma (2025) and extend these improvements to all dimensions. As a second byproduct, we obtain a linear time approximation algorithm with ratio $2 - \frac{1}{4} k^{-3}$ for covering any closed polygonal curve in $\mathbb{R}^d$ by $k$ closed curves so that the maximum length of an individual curve is minimized.</description>

      <title>Gromov hyperbolicity I: the dimension-free Gehring-Hayman inequality for quasigeodesics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02930v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This is the first article of a series of our recent works, addressing an open question of Bonk-Heinonen-Koskela [5], to study the relationship between (inner) uniformality and Gromov hyperbolicity in infinite dimensional spaces. Our main focus of this paper is to establish a dimension-free Gehring-Hayman inequality for quasigeodesics.
  A well-known theorem of J. Heinonen and S. Rohde in 1993 states that if $D\subset \mathbb{R}^n$ is quasiconformally equivalently to an uniform domain, then the Gehring-Hayman inequality holds in $D$: quasihyperbolic geodesics in $D$ minimizes the Euclidean length among all curves in $D$ with the same end points, up to a universal dimension-dependent multiplicative constant. 
  In this paper, we develop a new approach to strengthen the above result in the following three aspects: 1) obtain a dimension-free multiplicative constant in the Gehring-Hayman inequality; 2) relax the class of quasihyperbolic geodesics to more general quasigeodesics; 3) relax the quasiconformal equivalence to more general coarsely quasihyperbolic equivalence.
  As a byproduct of our general approach, we are able to prove that the above improved Gehring-Hayman inequality indeed holds in Banach spaces. This answers affirmatively an open problem raised by J. Heinonen and S. Rohde in 1993 and reformulated by J. V\"{a}is\"{a}l\"{a} in 2005.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic structure. III. Excluding a fat tree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09035v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Robertson and Seymour proved that for every finite tree $H$, there exists $k$ such that every finite graph $G$ with no $H$ minor has path-width at most $k$; and conversely, for every integer $k$, there is a finite tree $H$ such that every finite graph $G$ with an $H$ minor has path-width more than $k$. If we (twice) replace ``path-width'' by ``line-width'', the same is true for infinite graphs $G$.
  We prove a ``coarse graph theory'' analogue, as follows. For every finite tree $H$ and every $c$, there exist $k,L,C$ such that every graph that does not contain $H$ as a $c$-fat minor admits an $(L,C)$-quasi-isonetry to a graph with line-width at most $k$; and conversely, for all $k,L,C$ there exist $c$ and a finite tree $H$ such that every graph that contains $H$ as a $c$-fat minor admits no $(L,C)$-quasi-isometry to a graph with line-width at most $k$.</description>
