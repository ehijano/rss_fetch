      <title>Graph classes through the lens of logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph transformations definable in logic can be described using the notion of transductions. By understanding transductions as a basic embedding mechanism, which captures the possibility of encoding one graph in another graph by means of logical formulas, we obtain a new perspective on the landscape of graph classes and of their properties. The aim of this survey is to give a comprehensive presentation of this angle on structural graph theory.
  We first give a logic-focused overview of classic graph-theoretic concepts, such as treedepth, shrubdepth, treewidth, cliquewidth, twin-width, bounded expansion, and nowhere denseness. Then, we present recent developments related to notions defined purely through transductions, such as monadic stability, monadic dependence, and classes of structurally sparse graphs.</description>

      <title>On the constant partial-dual polynomials of hypermaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the partial-dual polynomial for hypermaps, extending the concept from ribbon graphs. We discuss the basic properties of this polynomial and characterize it for hypermaps with exactly one hypervertex containing a non-zero constant term. Additionally, we show that the partial-dual polynomial of a prime connected hypermap $H$ is constant if and only if $H$ is a plane hypermap with a single hyperedge.</description>

      <title>Partial Petrial polynomials for complete graphs and paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Gross, Mansour, and Tucker introduced the partial Petrial polynomial, which enumerates all partial Petrials of a ribbon graph by Euler genus. They provided formulas or recursions for various families of ribbon graphs, including ladder ribbon graphs. In this paper, we focus on the partial Petrial polynomial of bouquets, which are ribbon graphs with exactly one vertex. We prove that the partial Petrial polynomial of a bouquet primarily depends on its intersection graph, meaning that two bouquets with identical intersection graphs will have the same partial Petrial polynomial. Additionally, we introduce the concept of the partial Petrial polynomial for circle graphs and prove that for a connected graph with $n$ vertices ($n\geq 2$), the polynomial has non-zero coefficients for all terms of degrees from 1 to $n$ if and only if the graph is complete. Finally, we present the partial Petrial polynomials for paths.</description>

      <title>Efficient Weighted Counting of Multiset Derangements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the Almkvist-Zeilberger algorithm, combined with a weighted version of the Even-Gillis Laguerre integral due to Foata and Zeilberger, in order to efficiently compute weight enumerators of multiset derangements according to the number of cycles. The present paper is inspired by important previous work by Mourad Ismail and his collaborators, done in the late 1970s, but still useful after all these years.</description>

      <title>IDP for 2-Partition Maximal Symmetric Polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a framework for which one can approach showing the integer decomposition property for symmetric polytopes. We utilize this framework to prove a special case which we refer to as $2$-partition maximal polytopes in the case where it lies in a hyperplane of $\mathbb{R}^3$. Our method involves proving a special collection of polynomials have saturated Newton polytope.</description>

Abstract: For closed $k$-Schur Katalan functions $\fg{\lambda}{k}$ with $k$ a positive integer and $\lambda$ a $k$-bounded partition, Blasiak, Morse and Seelinger proposed the alternating dual Pieri rule conjecture and the $k$-branching conjecture. In the present paper, we positively prove the first one for large enough $k$ and for strictly decreasing partitions $\lambda$ respectively, as well as the second one for strictly decreasing partitions $\lambda$.</description>

      <title>A symmetric function approach to log-concavity of independence polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As introduced by Gutman and Harary, the independence polynomial of a graph serves as the generating polynomial of its independent sets. In 1987, Alavi, Malde, Schwenk and Erd\H{o}s conjectured that the independence polynomials of all trees are unimodal. In this paper we come up with a new way for proving log-concavity of independence polynomials of graphs by means of their chromatic symmetric functions, which is inspired by a result of Stanley connecting properties of polynomials to positivity of symmetric functions. This method turns out to be more suitable for treating trees with irregular structures, and as a simple application we show that all spiders have log-concave independence polynomials, which provides more evidence for the above conjecture. Moreover, we present two symmetric function analogues of a basic recurrence formula for independence polynomials, and show that all pineapple graphs also have log-concave independence polynomials.</description>

      <title>A method to optimize antipodal coloring span of graphs and its application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study radio \(k\)-colorings of simple connected graphs \(G\) with diameter \(d\), where a radio \(k\)-coloring \(g\) assigns non-negative integers to \(V(G)\) (vertices of \(G\)) such that \(|g(u) - g(v)| \geq 1 + k - d(u, v)\) for any two vertices \(u, v\) with \(1 \leq k \leq d\). The span of a radio \(k\)-coloring \(g\), expressed by \(rc_k(g)\), is the maximum integer assigned by \(g\), and the radio \(k\)-chromatic number \(rc_k(G)\) is the minimum span among all radio \(k\)-colorings of \(G\). A coloring \(g\) is minimal if \(rc_k(g) = rc_k(G)\). When \(k = d-1\), this coloring is known as the antipodal coloring, and \(rc_{d-1}(G)\) referred to as the antipodal number, is denoted by \(ac(G)\). We derive a sufficient condition for an antipodal coloring to be minimal and apply this criterion to determine the antipodal number of the generalized Petersen graph \(GP(n,1)\) for all \(n\) except when \(n \equiv 2 \pmod{8}\), and for toroidal grids \(T_{r,s} = C_r \square C_s\) when \(rs\) is even. Additionally, we establish a lower bound for \(ac(T_{r,s})\) when \(rs\) is odd.</description>

      <title>Two Distinct Eigenvalues from a New Graph Product</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The parameter $q(G)$ of a graph $G$ is the minimum number of distinct eigenvalues of a symmetric matrix whose pattern is given by $G$. We introduce a novel graph product by which we construct new infinite families of graphs that achieve $q(G)=2$. Several graph families for which it is already known that $q(G)=2$ can also be thought of as arising from this new product.</description>

      <title>Matroid intersection and packing/covering conjectures are true in the class of finitary matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given two finite matroids on the same ground set, a celebrated result of Edmonds says that the ground set can be partitioned into two disjoint subsets in a manner that there is a common independent set in both matroids whose intersection with the first subset spans that subset in the first matroid, and whose intersection with the second subset spans that subset in the second matroid.
  There is a longstanding conjecture regarding the situation of two matroids defined on the same infinite ground set. Infinite matroids were only recently axiomatized in the early 2010s in the work of Bruhn et al., while the conjecture had been proposed during the 1990s for the class of structures that are now called finitary matroids, which are matroids all of whose circuits are finite sets.
  The packing/covering conjecture, due to Bowler and Carmesin, is a related conjecture in the sense that it is true in the class of all matroids if and only if the matroid intersection conjecture is true in the class of all matroids. Given any family of matroids on the same ground set, the conjecture asks if it is possible to partition the ground set into two disjoint subsets in a way such that the corresponding family of matroids restricted to the first subset admits a packing while the family of matroids contracted to the second subset admits a covering.
  We prove both of these conjectures in the class of finitary matroids. Our main tool is nonstandard analysis, specifically the technique of iterated nonstandard extensions. Roughly, we first embed any infinite matroid inside a hyperfinite matroid defined on a subset of the nonstandard extension of the original ground set, and we iteratively nonstandardly extend the hyperfinite structure again in order to prove results in the internal universe that can be directly transferred to obtain results about the matroid(s) we started with.</description>

      <title>Hindrance from a wasteful common independent set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For (potentially infinite) matroids $ M $ and $ N $, an $ (M,N) $-hindrance is a set $ H$ that is independent but not spanning in $ N.\mathsf{span}_M(H) $. This concept was introduced by Aharoni and Ziv in the very first paper investigating Nash-Williams' Matroid intersection conjecture. They proved that the conjecture is equivalent to the statement that the non-existence of hindrances implies the existence of an $ M $-independent spanning set of $ N $.
  In this paper we present a breakthrough towards the Matroid intersection conjecture. Namely, we found a matroidal generalization of the `popular vertex' approach applied in the proof of the infinite version of K\"onig's theorem. The main result of this paper is that if $ M $ and $ N $ admit a common independent set $ I $ that is "wasteful" in the sense that $ r(M/I)&lt;r(N/I) $, then there exists an $ (M,N) $-hindrance.</description>

      <title>On counting numerical semigroups by maximum primitive and Wilf's conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new way of counting numerical semigroups, namely by their maximum primitive, and show its relation with the counting of numerical semigroups by their Frobenius number. For any positive integer $n$, let $A_{n}$ denote the number of numerical semigroups whose maximum primitive is $n$, and let $N_{n}$ denote the number of numerical semigroups whose Frobenius number is $n$. We show that the sequences $(A_{n})$ and $(N_{n})$ are M\"obius transforms of one another. We also establish that almost all numerical semigroups with large enough maximum primitive satisfy Wilf's conjecture. A crucial step in the proof is a result of independent interest: a numerical semigroup $S$ with multiplicity $\mathrm{m}$ such that $|S\cap (\mathrm{m},2 \mathrm{m})|\geq \sqrt{3\mathrm{m}}$ satisfies Wilf's conjecture.</description>

      <title>A Relationship Between Character Values Of Wreath Products And The Symmetric Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A relation between certain irreducible character values of the hyperoctahedral group $B_n$ ($\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z} \wr S_n$) and the symmetric group $S_{2n}$ was proved by F. L\"ubeck and D. Prasad in 2021. Their proof is algebraic in nature and uses Lie theory. Using combinatorial methods, R. Adin and Y. Roichman proved a similar relation between certain character values of $G\wr S_n$ and $S_{rn}$, where $G$ is an abelian group of order $r$ (generalizing the result of L\"ubeck-Prasad). Using their result, we prove yet another relation between certain irreducible character values of $G\wr S_n$ and $S_{rn}$, where $G$ is an abelian group of order $r$.</description>

Abstract: We define a positive state sum for webs "of type D". These webs are graphs which mimic morphisms in the category of finite-dimensional quantum so(2N)-modules. From the state sum, we derive an invariant of framed unoriented links. After giving explicit details about some intertwiners in the category of quantum so(2N)-modules, we relate our state-sum link invariant with Reshetikhin--Turaev's invariant associated with quantum so(2N).</description>

      <title>Multivariate Exploration of Metric Dilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a weighted graph embedded in a metric space $(M, d_M )$. The vertices of $G$ correspond to the points in $M$ , with the weight of each edge $uv$ being the distance $d_M (u, v)$ between their respective points in $M$ . The dilation (or stretch) of $G$ is defined as the minimum factor $t$ such that, for any pair of vertices $u, v$, the distance between $u$ and $v$-represented by the weight of a shortest $u$, $v$-path is at most $ t \cdot d_M (u, v)$. We study Dilation t-Augmentation, where the objective is, given a metric $M $, a graph $G$, and numerical values $k$ and $t$, to determine whether $G$ can be transformed into a graph with dilation $t$ by adding at most $k$ edges.
  Our primary focus is on the scenario where the metric $M$ is the shortest path metric of an unweighted graph $\Gamma$. Even in this specific case, Dilation $t$-Augmentation remains computationally challenging. In particular, the problem is W[2]-hard parameterized by $k$ when $\Gamma$ is a complete graph, already for $t=2$. Our main contribution lies in providing new insights into the impact of combinations of various parameters on the computational complexity of the problem. We establish the following.
  -- The parameterized dichotomy of the problem with respect to dilation $t$, when the graph $G$ is sparse: Parameterized by $k$, the problem is FPT for graphs excluding a biclique $K_{d,d}$ as a subgraph for $t\leq 2$ and the problem is W[1]-hard for $t\geq 3$ even if $G$ is a forest consisting of disjoint stars.
  -- The problem is FPT parameterized by the combined parameter $k+t+\Delta$, where $\Delta$ is the maximum degree of the graph $G$ or $\Gamma$.</description>

      <title>Sharp Quantitative Stability for the Pr\'ekopa-Leindler and Borell-Brascamp-Lieb Inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Borell-Brascamp-Lieb inequality is a classical extension of the Pr\'ekopa-Leindler inequality, which in turn is a functional counterpart of the Brunn-Minkowski inequality. The stability of these inequalities has received significant attention in recent years. Despite substantial progress in the geometric setting, a sharp quantitative stability result for the Pr\'ekopa-Leindler inequality has remained elusive, even in the special case of log-concave functions. In this work, we provide a unified and definitive stability framework for these foundational inequalities. By establishing the optimal quantitative stability for the Borell-Brascamp-Lieb inequality in full generality, we resolve the conjectured sharp stability for the Pr\'ekopa-Leindler inequality as a particular case. Our approach builds on the recent sharp stability results for the Brunn-Minkowski inequality obtained by the authors.</description>

      <title>Spectral properties of $\mathcal{C}$-graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.07319v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Assumed to be undirected, simple, and connected are all of the graphs in this study, and adjacency matrix $A$ serves as the associated matrix. In this paper we show that it is possible to relate a creation sequence for a type of cographs (we call it $\mathcal{C}$-graphs). Those cographs can be defined by a finite sequence of natural numbers. Using that sequence we obtain the inertia of the cograph under consideration. An extended eigenvalue-free set from $(-1,0)$ to $\big{[}\frac{-1-\sqrt{2}}{2}, -1)\cup (-1, 0) \cup (0, \frac{-1+\sqrt{2}}{2}\alpha_{min}\big{]}$, (where $\alpha_{min}\geq1$ is the smallest integer of the creation sequence) is obtained for the cographs under consideration. Additionally, an exact formula is found for the characteristic polynomial.</description>

      <title>Degrees of interior polynomials and parking function enumerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.03221v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interior polynomial of a directed graph is defined as the $h^*$-polynomial of the graph's (extended) root polytope, and it displays several attractive properties. Here we express its degree in terms of the minimum cardinality of a directed join, and give a formula for the leading coefficient. We present natural generalizations of these results to oriented regular matroids; in the process we also give a facet description for the extended root polytope of an oriented regular matroid.
  By duality, our expression for the degree of the interior polynomial implies a formula for the degree of the parking function enumerator of an Eulerian directed graph (which is equivalent to the greedoid polynomial of the corresponding branching greedoid). We extend that result to obtain the degree of the parking function enumerator of an arbitrary rooted directed graph in terms of the minimum cardinality of a certain type of feedback arc set.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01166v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish the $e$-positivity of cycle-chord graphs by using the composition method which is developed by Zhou and the author recently. Our method is simpler than the $(e)$-positivity approach which is used for handling cycle-chords with girth at most $4$. We also provide a combinatorial interpretation of the $e$-coefficients, and conjecture that theta graphs are $e$-positive.</description>

Abstract: In this article we study extensions of Steiner triple systems by means of the associated Steiner loops. We recognize that the set of Veblen points of a Steiner triple system corresponds to the center of the Steiner loop. We investigate extensions of Steiner loops, focusing in particular on the case of Schreier extensions, which provide a powerful method for constructing Steiner triple systems containing Veblen points.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09217v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the symmetry groups and winding numbers of planar curves obtained as images of weighted sums of exponentials. More generally, we study the image of the complex unit circle under a finite or infinite Laurent series using a particular parametrization of the circle. We generalize various previous results on such sums of exponentials and relate them to other classes of curves present in the literature. Moreover, we consider the evolution under the wave equation of such curves for the case of binomials. Interestingly, our methods provide a unified and systematic way of constructing curves with prescribed properties, such as the number of cusps, the number of intersection points or the winding number.</description>

      <title>An asymmetric version of Elekes-Szab\'o via group actions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14215v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider when finite families $F \subseteq \mathbb{C}[t]$ of bounded degree polynomials, or more generally of bounded complexity finite-to-finite correspondences on $\mathbb{C}$, can exhibit non-expansion of the form $|F(A)| = O(|A|^{1+\eta})$ in their actions on finite sets $A \subseteq \mathbb{C}$ with $|F| \gg |A|^\eps \gg 1$, for a fixed $\eps&gt;0$ and arbitrarily small $\eta&gt;0$. Our conclusions generalise the Elekes-R\'onyai and Elekes-Szab\'o theorems, which correspond to the case that $F$ is parametrised by a single complex variable and $|F|=|A|$. Our result also applies to families of correspondences between varieties of arbitrary dimension if we impose a general position assumption on $A$. In all cases, the conclusion is that a commutative algebraic group structure is responsible. As a special case, we obtain asymmetric versions of Elekes-R\'onyai and Elekes-Szab\'o, with explicit bounds on exponents. Our methods originate in model theory.</description>

Abstract: A 1971 conjecture of Graham (later repeated by Erd\H{o}s and Graham) asserts that every set $A \subseteq \mathbb{F}_p \setminus \{0\}$ has an ordering whose partial sums are all distinct. We prove this conjecture for sets of size $|A| \leqslant e^{(\log p)^{1/4}}$; our result improves the previous bound of $\log p/\log \log p$. One ingredient in our argument is a structure theorem involving dissociated sets, which may be of independent interest.</description>

Abstract: The concept of Schreier extensions of loops was introduced in the general case in [11] and, more recently, it has been explored in the context of Steiner loops in [6]. In the latter case, it gives a powerful method for constructing Steiner triple systems containing Veblen points. Counting all Steiner triple systems of order v is an open problem for v&gt;21. In this paper, we investigate the number of Steiner triple systems of order 19, 27 and 31 containing Veblen points and we present some examples.</description>

Abstract: Let $t\geq2$ and $k\geq1$ be integers. A $t$-regular partition of a positive integer $n$ is a partition of $n$ such that none of its parts is divisible by $t$. Let $b_{t,k}(n)$ denote the number of hooks of length $k$ in all the $t$-regular partitions of $n$. Recently, the first and the third authors proved that $b_{3,2}(n)\geq b_{2,2}(n)$ for all $n\geq 4$, and conjectured that $b_{t+1,2}(n)\geq b_{t,2}(n)$ for all $t\geq 3$ and $n\geq 0$. In this paper, we prove that the conjecture is true for $t=3$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01602v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The cosmological polytope of a graph $G$ was recently introduced to give a geometric approach to the computation of wavefunctions for cosmological models with associated Feynman diagram $G$. Basic results in the theory of positive geometries dictate that this wavefunction may be computed as a sum of rational functions associated to the facets in a triangulation of the cosmological polytope. The normalized volume of the polytope then provides a complexity estimate for these computations. In this paper, we examine the (Ehrhart) $h^\ast$-polynomial of cosmological polytopes. We derive recursive formulas for computing the $h^\ast$-polynomial of disjoint unions and $1$-sums of graphs. The degree of the $h^\ast$-polynomial for any $G$ is computed and a characterization of palindromicity is given. Using these observations, a tight lower bound on the $h^\ast$-polynomial for any $G$ is identified and explicit formulas for the $h^\ast$-polynomials of multitrees and multicycles are derived. The results generalize the existing results on normalized volumes of cosmological polytopes. A tight upper bound and a combinatorial formula for the $h^\ast$-polynomial of any cosmological polytope are conjectured.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18368v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given an identity relating families of Schur and power sum symmetric functions, this may be thought of as encoding representation-theoretic properties according to how the $p$-to-$s$ transition matrices provide the irreducible character tables for symmetric groups. The case of the Murnaghan-Nakayama rule for cycles provides that $p_{n} = \sum_{i = 0}^{n-1} (-1)^i s_{(n-i, 1^{i})}$, and, since the power sum generator $p_{n}$ reduces to $\zeta(2n)$ for the Riemann zeta function $\zeta$ and for specialized values of the indeterminates involved in the inverse limit construction of the algebra of symmetric functions, this motivates both combinatorial and number-theoretic applications related to the given case of the Murnaghan-Nakayama rule. In this direction, since every Schur-hook admits an expansion in terms of twofold products of elementary and complete homogeneous generators, we exploit this property for the same specialization that allows us to express $p_{n}$ with the Bernoulli number $B_{2n}$, using remarkable results due to Hoffman on multiple harmonic series. This motivates our bijective approach, through the use of sign-reversing involutions, toward the determination of identities that relate Schur-hooks and power sum symmetric functions and that we apply to obtain a new recurrence for Bernoulli numbers.</description>

      <title>An Algorithmic Approach to Finding Degree-Doubling Nodes in Oriented Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00614v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Seymour's Second Neighborhood Conjecture asserts that in the square of any oriented graph, there exists a node whose out-degree at least doubles. This paper presents a definitive proof of the conjecture by introducing the GLOVER (Graph Level Order) data structure, which facilitates a systematic partitioning of neighborhoods and an analysis of degree-doubling conditions. By leveraging this structure, we construct a decreasing sequence of subsets that establish a well-ordering of nodes, ensuring that no counterexample can exist. This approach not only confirms the conjecture for all oriented graphs but also provides a novel framework for analyzing degrees and arcs in complex networks. The findings have implications for theoretical graph studies and practical applications in network optimization and algorithm design.</description>

Abstract: Let $A_n$ be an $n\times n$ matrix with iid entries distributed as Bernoulli random variables with parameter $p = p_n$. Rudelson and Tikhomirov, in a beautiful and celebrated paper, show that the distribution of eigenvalues of $A_n \cdot (pn)^{-1/2}$ is approximately uniform on the unit disk as $n\rightarrow \infty$ as long as $pn \rightarrow \infty$, which is the natural necessary condition.
  In this paper we give a much simpler proof of this result, in its full generality, using a perspective we developed in our recent proof of the existence of the limiting spectral law when $pn$ is bounded. One feature of our proof is that it avoids the use of $\epsilon$-nets entirely and, instead, proceeds by studying the evolution of the singular values of the shifted matrices $A_n-zI$ as we incrementally expose the randomness in the matrix.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17581v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Constraint programming (CP) is a powerful tool for modeling mathematical concepts and objects and finding both solutions or counter examples. One of the major strengths of CP is that problems can easily be combined or expanded. In this paper, we illustrate that this versatility makes CP an ideal tool for exploring problems in permutation patterns.
  We declaratively define permutation properties, permutation pattern avoidance and containment constraints using CP and show how this allows us to solve a wide range of problems. We show how this approach enables the arbitrary composition of these conditions, and also allows the easy addition of extra conditions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our techniques by modelling the containment and avoidance of six permutation patterns, eight permutation properties and measuring five statistics on the resulting permutations. In addition to calculating properties and statistics for the generated permutations, we show that arbitrary additional constraints can also be easily and efficiently added.
  This approach enables mathematicians to investigate permutation pattern problems in a quick and efficient manner. We demonstrate the utility of constraint programming for permutation patterns by showing how we can easily and efficiently extend the known permutation counts for a conjecture involving the class of $1324$ avoiding permutations. For this problem, we expand the enumeration of $1324$-avoiding permutations with a fixed number of inversions to permutations of length 16 and show for the first time that in the enumeration there is a pattern occurring which follows a unique sequence on the Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences.</description>

Abstract: Let $V:=(\mathbb{F}_q)^d$ be a $d$-dimensional vector space over the field $\mathbb{F}_q$ of order $q$. Fix positive integers $e_1,e_2$ satisfying $e_1+e_2=d$. Motivated by analysing a fundamental algorithm in computational group theory for recognising classical groups, we consider a certain quantity $P(e_1,e_2)$ which arises in both graph theory and group representation theory: $P(e_1,e_2)$ is the proportion of $3$-walks in the `bipartite $q$-Kneser graph' $\Gamma_{e_1,e_2}$ that are closed $3$-arcs. We prove that, for a group $G$ satisfying ${\rm SL}_d(q)\leqslant G\leqslant{\rm GL}_d(q)$, the proportion of certain element-pairs in $G$ called `$(e_1,e_2)$-stingray duos' which generate an irreducible subgroup is also equal to $P(e_1,e_2)$. We give an exact formula for $P(e_1,e_2)$, and prove that $1-q^{-1}-q^{-2}&lt; P(e_1,e_2)&lt; 1-q^{-1}-q^{-2}+2q^{-3}-2q^{-5}$ for $2\leqslant e_2\leqslant e_1$ and $q\geqslant2$.These bounds have implications for the complexity analysis of the state-of-the-art algorithms to recognise classical groups, which we discuss in the final section.</description>

Abstract: The Circuit diameter of polytopes was introduced by Borgwardt, Finhold and Hemmecke as a fundamental tool for the study of circuit augmentation schemes for linear programming and for estimating combinatorial diameters. Determining the complexity of computing the circuit diameter of polytopes was posed as an open problem by Sanit\`a as well as by Kafer, and was recently reiterated by Borgwardt, Grewe, Kafer, Lee and Sanit\`a.
  In this paper, we solve this problem by showing that computing the circuit diameter of a polytope given in halfspace-description is strongly NP-hard. To prove this result, we show that computing the combinatorial diameter of the perfect matching polytope of a bipartite graph is NP-hard. This complements a result by Sanit\`a (FOCS 2018) on the NP-hardness of computing the diameter of fractional matching polytopes and implies the new result that computing the diameter of a $\{0,1\}$-polytope is strongly NP-hard, which may be of independent interest. In our second main result, we give a precise graph-theoretic description of the monotone diameter of perfect matching polytopes and use this description to prove that computing the monotone (circuit) diameter of a given input polytope is strongly NP-hard as well.</description>

      <title>On the Spielman-Teng Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20308</link>

Abstract: Let $M$ be an $n\times n$ matrix with iid subgaussian entries with mean $0$ and variance $1$ and let $\sigma_n(M)$ denote the least singular value of $M$. We prove that \[\mathbb{P}\big( \sigma_{n}(M) \leq \varepsilon n^{-1/2} \big) = (1+o(1)) \varepsilon + e^{-\Omega(n)}\] for all $0 \leq \varepsilon \ll 1$. This resolves, up to a $1+o(1)$ factor, a seminal conjecture of Spielman and Teng.</description>

      <title>An improved lower bound for a problem of Littlewood on the zeros of cosine polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16075v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $Z(N)$ denote the minimum number of zeros in $[0,2\pi]$ that a cosine polynomial of the form $$f_A(t)=\sum_{n\in A}\cos nt$$ can have when $A$ is a finite set of non-negative integers of size $|A|=N$. It is an old problem of Littlewood to determine $Z(N)$. In this paper, we obtain the lower bound $Z(N)\geqslant (\log\log N)^{(1+o(1))}$ which exponentially improves on the previous best bounds of the form $Z(N)\geqslant (\log\log\log N)^c$ due to Erd\'elyi and Sahasrabudhe.</description>

      <title>Exclusivity principle, Ramsey theory, and $n$-cycle PR boxes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09773</link>

Abstract: The exclusivity principle (E-principle) states that the sum of probabilities of pairwise exclusive events cannot exceed 1. Unlike other principles proposed to characterize quantum correlations, its intrinsically non-bipartite formulation enables its application in more general contextuality scenarios. Although equivalent to the no-signalling condition for any bipartite Bell scenario, this equivalence breaks down for two independent copies of the same scenario. Such violation of the E-principle due to multiple copies, known as its activation effect, was studied in [Nat Commun 4, 2263 (2013)] for the nonlocal extremal boxes of $(2,m,2)$, $(2,2,d)$, and $(3,2,2)$ Bell scenarios. The authors mapped the problem of exhibiting activation effects to finding certain cliques inside joint exclusivity graphs. In this work, we refine the joint exclusivity structure to be an edge-colored exclusivity multigraph. This allows us to draw a novel connection to Ramsey theory, which guarantees the existence of certain monochromatic subgraphs in sufficiently large edge-colored cliques, providing a powerful tool for ruling out E-principle violations. We then exploit this connection, drawing on Ramsey-theoretic results to study violations of the E-principle by multiple copies of the contextual extremal boxes of $n$-cycle scenarios, called $n$-cycle PR boxes. For the usual ($n=4$) PR box we show that the known E-principle violation of $5/4$ is the maximal achievable using two copies, and that this same upper bound applies to two copies of the KCBS ($n = 5$) PR box. We then prove that $n \geq 6$-cycle PR boxes, unlike the extremal boxes of the aforementioned Bell scenarios, do not exhibit activation effects with two or three copies. Finally, for any number of independent copies $k$, we establish a lower bound on $n$ above which $n$-cycle PR boxes do not exhibit activation effects with $k$ copies.</description>
