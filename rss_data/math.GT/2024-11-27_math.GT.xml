      <title>The geometry of the six quaternionic equiangular lines in $\mathbb{H}^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a simple presentation of the six quaternionic equiangular lines in $\mathbb{H}^2$ as an orbit of the primitive quaternionic reflection group of order 720 (which is isomorphic to 2.A_6 the double cover of $A_6)$. Other orbits of this group are also seen to give optimal spherical designs (packings) of 10, 15 and 20 lines in $\mathbb{H}^2$, with angles { 1/3, 2/3 }, { 1/4, 5/8 } and { 0, 1/3, 2/3 }, respectively. We consider the origins of this reflection group as one of Blichfeldt's "finite collineation groups" for lines in $\mathbb{C}^4$, and general methods for finding nice systems of quaternionic lines.</description>

      <title>Equivariant Morse Homology for Reflection Actions via Broken Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a finite group $G$ acting on a manifold $M$. For any equivariant Morse function, which is a generic condition, there does not always exist an equivariant metric $g$ on $M$ such that the pair $(f,g)$ is Morse-Smale. Here, the pair $(f,g)$ is called Morse-Smale if the descending and ascending manifolds intersect transversely. The best possible metrics $g$ are those that make the pair $(f,g)$ stably Morse-Smale.
  A diffeomorphism $\phi: M \to M$ is a reflection, if $\phi^2 = \operatorname{id}$ and the fixed point set of $\phi$ forms a codimension-one submanifold (with $M \setminus M^{\operatorname{fix}}$ not necessarily disconnected).
  In this note, we focus on the special case where the group $G = \{\operatorname{id}, \phi\}$. We show that the condition of being stably Morse-Smale is generic for metrics $g$. Given a stably Morse-Smale pair, we introduce a canonical equivariant Thom-Smale-Witten complex by counting certain broken trajectories.
  This has applications to the case when we have a manifold with boundary and when the Morse function has critical points on the boundary.
  We provide an alternative definition of the Thom-Smale-Witten complexes, which are quasi-isomorphic to those defined by Kronheimer and Mrowka.
  We also explore the case when $G$ is generated by multiple reflections. As an example, we compute the Thom-Smale-Witten complex of an upright higher-genus surface by counting broken trajectories.</description>

      <title>Multiscale Jones Polynomial and Persistent Jones Polynomial for Knot Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many structures in science, engineering, and art can be viewed as curves in 3-space. The entanglement of these curves plays a crucial role in determining the functionality and physical properties of materials. Many concepts in knot theory provide theoretical tools to explore the complexity and entanglement of curves in 3-space. However, classical knot theory primarily focuses on global topological properties and lacks the consideration of local structural information, which is critical in practical applications. In this work, two localized models based on the Jones polynomial, namely the multiscale Jones polynomial and the persistent Jones polynomial, are proposed. The stability of these models, especially the insensitivity of the multiscale and persistent Jones polynomial models to small perturbations in curve collections, is analyzed, thus ensuring their robustness for real-world applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the property $P_{\text {naive }}$ of mapping class groups of surfaces of infinite type, that is, for any finite collection of non-trivial elements $h_{1},h_{2}, \cdots, h_{n}$, there exists another element $g\neq 1$ of infinite order such that for all $i$, $\langle g, h_{i}\rangle \cong \langle g \rangle * \langle h_{i} \rangle$.</description>

      <title>Dualities of $K$-theoretic Coulomb branches from a once-punctured torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the quantized $\mathrm{SL}_2$-character variety of a once-punctured torus. We show that this quantized algebra has three $\mathbb{Z}_2$-invariant subalgebras that are isomorphic to quantized $K$-theoretic Coulomb branches in the sense of Braverman, Finkelberg, and Nakajima. These subalgebras are permuted by the $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$ mapping class group action. Our results confirm various predictions from the physics literature about 4d $\mathcal{N}=2^*$ theories and their dualities.</description>

      <title>Projective representations of Hecke groups from Topological quantum field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.10745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.10745v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct projective (unitary) representations of Hecke groups from the vector spaces associated with the Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev topological quantum field theory of higher genus surfaces. In particular, we generalize the modular data of Temperley-Lieb-Jones modular categories. We also study some properties of the representation. We show the image group of the representation is infinite at low levels in genus $2$ by explicit computations. We also show the representation is reducible with at least three irreducible summands when the level equals $4l+2$ for $l\geq 1$.</description>

      <title>Nonacyclic Reidemeister torsions of manifolds of odd dimension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.10143v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given an oriented closed manifold $M$ of odd dimension and a unitary representation $\rho : \pi_1(M) \ra \GL_n(\F)$, we define a Reidemeister torsion, even if the cohomology associated with $\rho$ is not acyclic. As corollaries, we introduce some topological invariants of $M$, which include the nonacyclic extensions of abelian torsions and the Alexander polynomials of links. Further, we propose a volume form of the $\SU(n)$-character varieties of $M$. Moreover, we compute the Reidemeister torsions of some representations of 3-manifolds and compare the works of Farber--Turaev.</description>

      <title>The Dijkgraaf-Witten invariants from second Chern classes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10378v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a 3-cocycle $\psi$ in the cohomology of a finite group $G$, we can define the Dijkgraaf-Witten invariant of closed 3-manifolds. In this paper, we focus on the case where $\psi$ is a 3-cocycle canonically obtained from the second Chern class of a representation of $G$, and show some procedures for computing the invariant, and clarify its topological interpretation under some conditions.</description>

      <title>Cheeger inequalities on simplicial complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.01069v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cheeger-type inequalities in which the decomposability of a graph and the spectral gap of its Laplacian mutually control each other play an important role in graph theory and network analysis, in particular in the context of expander theory. The natural problem to extend such inequalities to simplicial complexes and their higher order Eckmann Laplacians has been open for a long time. Before proving any inequality, however, one needs to identify the right Cheeger-type constant for which such an inequality can hold. Here, we solve this problem. Our solution involves and combines constructions from simplicial topology, signed graphs, Gromov filling radii and an interpolation between the standard 2-Laplacians and the analytically more difficult 1-Laplacians, for which, however, the inequalities become equalities. It is then natural to develop a general theory for $p$-Laplacians on simplicial complexes and investigate the related Cheeger-type inequalities.</description>

      <title>Surgery and positive Bakry-\'Emery Ricci curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18859v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of preserving weighted Riemannian metrics of positive Bakry-\'Emery Ricci curvature along surgery. We establish two theorems of this type: One for connected sums, and one for surgeries along higher-dimensional spheres. In contrast to known surgery results for positive Ricci curvature, these results are local, i.e. we only impose assumptions on the weighted metric locally around the sphere along which the surgery is performed. As application we then show that all closed, simply-connected spin 5-manifolds admit a weighted Riemannian metric of positive Bakry-\'Emery Ricci curvature. By a result of Lott, this also provides new examples of manifolds with a Riemannian metric of positive Ricci curvature.</description>

      <title>The Tangle Hypothesis: Dimension 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23965v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce an $(\infty,1)$-category ${\sf Bord}_1^{\sf fr}(\mathbb{R}^n)$, the morphisms in which are framed tangles in $\mathbb{R}^n\times \mathbb{D}^1$. We prove that ${\sf Bord}_1^{\sf fr}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ has the universal mapping out property of the 1-dimensional Tangle Hypothesis of Baez--Dolan and Hopkins--Lurie: it is the rigid $\mathcal{E}_n$-monoidal $(\infty,1)$-category freely generated by a single object. Applying this theorem to a dualizable object of a braided monoidal $(\infty,1)$-category gives link invariants, generalizing the Reshetikhin--Turaev invariants.</description>
