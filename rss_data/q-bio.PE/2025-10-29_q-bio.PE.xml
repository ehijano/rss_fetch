      <title>Learning to generalize in evolution through annealed population heterogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evolutionary systems must learn to generalize, often extrapolating from a limited set of selective conditions to anticipate future environmental changes. The mechanisms enabling such generalization remain poorly understood, despite their importance to predict ecological robustness, drug resistance, or design future-proof vaccination strategies. Here, we demonstrate that annealed population heterogeneity, wherein distinct individuals in the population experience different instances of a complex environment over time, can act as a form of implicit regularization and facilitate evolutionary generalization. Mathematically, annealed heterogeneity introduces a variance-weighted demographic noise term that penalizes across-environment fitness variance and effectively rescales the population size, thereby biasing evolution toward generalist solutions. This process is indeed analogous to a variant of the mini-batching strategy employed in stochastic gradient descent, where an effective multiplicative noise produces an inductive bias by triggering noise-induced transitions.
  Through numerical simulations and theoretical analysis we discuss the conditions under which variation in how individuals experience environmental selection can naturally promote evolutionary strategies that generalize across environments and anticipate novel challenges.</description>

      <title>A two-size Wright--Fisher model: asymptotic analysis via uniform renewal theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03056v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a population with two types of individuals, distinguished by the resources required for reproduction: type-$0$ (small) individuals need a fractional resource unit of size $\vartheta \in (0,1)$, while type-$1$ (large) individuals require $1$ unit. The total available resource per generation is $R$. To form a new generation, individuals are sampled one by one, and if enough resources remain, they reproduce, adding their offspring to the next generation. The probability of sampling an individual whose offspring is small is $\rho_{R}(x)$, where $x$ is the proportion of small individuals in the current generation. We call this discrete-time stochastic model a two-size Wright--Fisher model, where the function $\rho_{R}$ can represent mutation and/or frequency-dependent selection. We show that on the evolutionary time scale, i.e. accelerating time by a factor $R$, the frequency process of type-$0$ individuals converges to the solution of a Wright--Fisher-type SDE. The drift term of that SDE accounts for the bias introduced by the function $\rho_{R}$ and the consumption strategy, the latter also inducing an additional multiplicative factor in the diffusion term. To prove this, the dynamics within each generation are viewed as a renewal process, with the population size corresponding to the first passage time $\tau(R)$ above level $R$. The proof relies on methods from renewal theory, in particular a uniform version of Blackwell's renewal theorem for binary, non-arithmetic random variables, established via $\varepsilon$-coupling.</description>

      <title>A geometric analysis of the Bazykin-Berezovskaya predator-prey model with Allee effect in an economic framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10355v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a fast-slow version of the Bazykin-Berezovskaya predator-prey model with Allee effect evolving on two timescales, through the lenses of Geometric Singular Perturbation Theory (GSPT). The system we consider is in non-standard form. We completely characterize its dynamics, providing explicit threshold quantities to distinguish between a rich variety of possible asymptotic behaviors. Moreover, we propose numerical results to illustrate our findings. Lastly, we comment on the real-world interpretation of these results, in an economic framework and in the context of predator-prey models.</description>
