      <title>LFS-Aware Surface Reconstruction from Unoriented 3D Point Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel approach for generating isotropic surface triangle meshes directly from unoriented 3D point clouds, with mesh density adapting to the estimated local feature size (LFS). The popular reconstruction pipelines first reconstruct a dense mesh from the input point cloud and then apply remeshing to obtain the isotropic mesh. The sequential pipeline makes it hard to find a lower-density mesh while preserving more details. Instead, our approach reconstructs both an implicit function and an LFS-aware mesh sizing function directly from the input point cloud, which is then used to produce the final LFS-aware mesh without remeshing. We combine local curvature radius and shape diameter to estimate the LFS directly from the input point clouds. Also, we propose a new mesh solver to solve an implicit function whose zero level set delineates the surface without requiring normal orientation. The added value of our approach is generating isotropic meshes directly from 3D point clouds with an LFS-aware density, thus enabling flexible mesh quality control. Our experiments demonstrate the robustness of our method to noise, outliers, and missing data. Our method is also capable of preserving sharp features for CAD point clouds.</description>

      <title>Augmented Reality Demonstrations for Scalable Robot Imitation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robot Imitation Learning (IL) is a widely used method for training robots to perform manipulation tasks that involve mimicking human demonstrations to acquire skills. However, its practicality has been limited due to its requirement that users be trained in operating real robot arms to provide demonstrations. This paper presents an innovative solution: an Augmented Reality (AR)-assisted framework for demonstration collection, empowering non-roboticist users to produce demonstrations for robot IL using devices like the HoloLens 2. Our framework facilitates scalable and diverse demonstration collection for real-world tasks. We validate our approach with experiments on three classical robotics tasks: reach, push, and pick-and-place. The real robot performs each task successfully while replaying demonstrations collected via AR.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Thermal Modality to Enhance Reconstruction in Low-Light Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) accomplishes photo-realistic novel view synthesis by learning the implicit volumetric representation of a scene from multi-view images, which faithfully convey the colorimetric information. However, sensor noises will contaminate low-value pixel signals, and the lossy camera image signal processor will further remove near-zero intensities in extremely dark situations, deteriorating the synthesis performance. Existing approaches reconstruct low-light scenes from raw images but struggle to recover texture and boundary details in dark regions. Additionally, they are unsuitable for high-speed models relying on explicit representations. To address these issues, we present Thermal-NeRF, which takes thermal and visible raw images as inputs, considering the thermal camera is robust to the illumination variation and raw images preserve any possible clues in the dark, to accomplish visible and thermal view synthesis simultaneously. Also, the first multi-view thermal and visible dataset (MVTV) is established to support the research on multimodal NeRF. Thermal-NeRF achieves the best trade-off between detail preservation and noise smoothing and provides better synthesis performance than previous work. Finally, we demonstrate that both modalities are beneficial to each other in 3D reconstruction.</description>

      <title>StyleCineGAN: Landscape Cinemagraph Generation using a Pre-trained StyleGAN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a method that can generate cinemagraphs automatically from a still landscape image using a pre-trained StyleGAN. Inspired by the success of recent unconditional video generation, we leverage a powerful pre-trained image generator to synthesize high-quality cinemagraphs. Unlike previous approaches that mainly utilize the latent space of a pre-trained StyleGAN, our approach utilizes its deep feature space for both GAN inversion and cinemagraph generation. Specifically, we propose multi-scale deep feature warping (MSDFW), which warps the intermediate features of a pre-trained StyleGAN at different resolutions. By using MSDFW, the generated cinemagraphs are of high resolution and exhibit plausible looping animation. We demonstrate the superiority of our method through user studies and quantitative comparisons with state-of-the-art cinemagraph generation methods and a video generation method that uses a pre-trained StyleGAN.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Frosting: Editable Complex Radiance Fields with Real-Time Rendering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose Gaussian Frosting, a novel mesh-based representation for high-quality rendering and editing of complex 3D effects in real-time. Our approach builds on the recent 3D Gaussian Splatting framework, which optimizes a set of 3D Gaussians to approximate a radiance field from images. We propose first extracting a base mesh from Gaussians during optimization, then building and refining an adaptive layer of Gaussians with a variable thickness around the mesh to better capture the fine details and volumetric effects near the surface, such as hair or grass. We call this layer Gaussian Frosting, as it resembles a coating of frosting on a cake. The fuzzier the material, the thicker the frosting. We also introduce a parameterization of the Gaussians to enforce them to stay inside the frosting layer and automatically adjust their parameters when deforming, rescaling, editing or animating the mesh. Our representation allows for efficient rendering using Gaussian splatting, as well as editing and animation by modifying the base mesh. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on various synthetic and real scenes, and show that it outperforms existing surface-based approaches. We will release our code and a web-based viewer as additional contributions. Our project page is the following: https://anttwo.github.io/frosting/</description>

      <title>ReNoise: Real Image Inversion Through Iterative Noising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in text-guided diffusion models have unlocked powerful image manipulation capabilities. However, applying these methods to real images necessitates the inversion of the images into the domain of the pretrained diffusion model. Achieving faithful inversion remains a challenge, particularly for more recent models trained to generate images with a small number of denoising steps. In this work, we introduce an inversion method with a high quality-to-operation ratio, enhancing reconstruction accuracy without increasing the number of operations. Building on reversing the diffusion sampling process, our method employs an iterative renoising mechanism at each inversion sampling step. This mechanism refines the approximation of a predicted point along the forward diffusion trajectory, by iteratively applying the pretrained diffusion model, and averaging these predictions. We evaluate the performance of our ReNoise technique using various sampling algorithms and models, including recent accelerated diffusion models. Through comprehensive evaluations and comparisons, we show its effectiveness in terms of both accuracy and speed. Furthermore, we confirm that our method preserves editability by demonstrating text-driven image editing on real images.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Image Diffusion for Indoor Single-view Material Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12274v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present Intrinsic Image Diffusion, a generative model for appearance decomposition of indoor scenes. Given a single input view, we sample multiple possible material explanations represented as albedo, roughness, and metallic maps. Appearance decomposition poses a considerable challenge in computer vision due to the inherent ambiguity between lighting and material properties and the lack of real datasets. To address this issue, we advocate for a probabilistic formulation, where instead of attempting to directly predict the true material properties, we employ a conditional generative model to sample from the solution space. Furthermore, we show that utilizing the strong learned prior of recent diffusion models trained on large-scale real-world images can be adapted to material estimation and highly improves the generalization to real images. Our method produces significantly sharper, more consistent, and more detailed materials, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by $1.5dB$ on PSNR and by $45\%$ better FID score on albedo prediction. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>An Image-based Typology for Visualization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05594v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present and discuss the results of a qualitative analysis of visual representations from images. We labeled each image's essential stimuli, the removal of which would render a visualization uninterpretable. As a result, we derive a typology of 10 visualization types of defined groups. We describe the typology derivation process in which we engaged. The resulting typology and image analysis can serve a number of purposes: enabling researchers to study the evolution of the community and its research output over time, facilitating the categorization of visualization images for the purpose of research and teaching, allowing researchers and practitioners to identify visual design styles to further align the quantification of any visual information processor, be that a person or an algorithm observer, and it facilitates a discussion of standardization in visualization. In addition to the visualization typology from images, we provide a dataset of 6,833 tagged images and an online tool that can be used to explore and analyze the large set of labeled images. The tool and data set enable scholars to closely examine the diverse visual designs used and how they are published and communicated in our community.
