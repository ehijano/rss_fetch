      <title>Delay Infectivity and Delay Recovery SIR model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have derived the governing equations for an SIR model with delay terms in both the infectivity and recovery of the disease. The equations are derived by modelling the dynamics as a continuous time random walk, where individuals move between the classic SIR compartments. With an appropriate choice of distributions for the infectivity and recovery processes delay terms are introduced into the governing equations in a manner that ensures the physicality of the model. This provides novel insight into the underlying dynamics of an SIR model with time delays. The SIR model with delay infectivity and recovery allows for a more diverse range of dynamical behaviours. The model accounts for an incubation effect without the need to introduce new compartments.</description>

      <title>Correlation entropy of free semigroup actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces the concepts of correlation entropy and local correlation entropy for free semigroup actions on compact metric space, and explores their fundamental properties. Thereafter, we generalize some classical results on correlation entropy and local correlation entropy to apply to free semigroup actions. Finally, we establish the relationship between topological entropy, measure-theoretic entropy, correlation entropy, and local correlation entropy for free semigroup actions under various conditions.</description>

      <title>Return time sets and product recurrence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a countable infinite discrete group. We show that a subset $F$ of $G$ contains a return time set of some piecewise syndetic recurrent point $x$ in a compact Hausdorff space $X$ with a $G$-action if and only if $F$ is a quasi-central set. As an application, we show that if a nonempty closed subsemigroup $S$ of the Stone-\v{C}ech compactification $\beta G$ contains the smallest ideal $K(\beta G)$ of $\beta G$ then $S$-product recurrent is equivalent to distality, which partially answers a question of Auslander and Furstenberg (Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 343, 1994, 221--232).</description>

      <title>Regularity of invariant densities for random switching between two linear odes in Rd</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a paper entitled singularities of invariant densities for random switching between two linear odes in 2D, Bakhtin et al [5], consider a Markov process obtained by random switching between two stable linear vector fields in the plane and characterize the singularities of the invariant density in terms of the switching and contraction rates. This paper considers a generalization of this model obtained by random switching between two stable linear vector fields in Rd and provides sufficient conditions ensuring that the invariant distribution is absolutely continuous and has a Cr density. In dimension greater than 3 it provides, to the best of our knowledge, the first fully non-elliptic example of random switching for which quantitative conditions guaranteeing smoothness of the invariant density can be proved.</description>

      <title>Input-to-state stability meets small-gain theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Input-to-state stability (ISS) unifies global asymptotic stability with respect to variations of initial conditions with robustness with respect to external disturbances. First, we present Lyapunov characterizations for input-to-state stability as well as ISS superpositions theorems showing relations of ISS to other robust stability properties. Next, we present one of the characteristic applications of the ISS framework - the design of event-based control schemes for the stabilization of nonlinear systems. In the second half of the paper, we focus on small-gain theorems for stability analysis of finite and infinite networks with input-to-state stable components. First, we present a classical small-gain theorem in terms of trajectories for the feedback interconnection of 2 nonlinear systems. Finally, a recent Lyapunov-based small-gain result for a network with infinitely many ISS components is shown.</description>

      <title>Learning Optimal Filters Using Variational Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Filtering-the task of estimating the conditional distribution of states of a dynamical system given partial, noisy, observations-is important in many areas of science and engineering, including weather and climate prediction. However, the filtering distribution is generally intractable to obtain for high-dimensional, nonlinear systems. Filters used in practice, such as the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF), are biased for nonlinear systems and have numerous tuning parameters. Here, we present a framework for learning a parameterized analysis map-the map that takes a forecast distribution and observations to the filtering distribution-using variational inference. We show that this methodology can be used to learn gain matrices for filtering linear and nonlinear dynamical systems, as well as inflation and localization parameters for an EnKF. Future work will apply this framework to learn new filtering algorithms.</description>

      <title>On finite spacer rank for words and subshifts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2010.05165v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define a notion of rank for words and subshifts that we call spacer rank, extending the notion of rank-one symbolic shifts of Gao and Hill. We construct infinite words of each finite spacer rank, of unbounded spacer rank, and show there exist words that do not have a spacer rank construction. We consider words that are fixed points of substitutions and give explicit conditions for the word to have an at most spacer rank two construction, and not to be rank one. We prove that finite spacer rank subshifts have topological entropy zero, and that there are zero entropy subshifts not defined by a word with a finite spacer rank construction. We also study shift systems associated with infinite words, including those associated to Sturmian sequences, which we show are spacer rank-two systems.</description>

      <title>Effects of local mutations in quadratic iterations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.14002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2011.14002v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce mutations in replication systems in which the intact copying mechanism is performed by discrete iterations of a complex quadratic map in the family $f_c(z) = z^2+c$. More specifically, we consider a "correct" function $f_{c_1}$ acting on the complex plane (representing the RNA to be copied). A "mutation" $f_{c_0}$ is a different ("erroneous") map acting on a locus of given radius $r$ around a mutation focal point $\xi^*$. The effect of the mutation is interpolated radially to eventually recover the original map $f_{c_1}$ when reaching an outer radius $R$. We call the resulting map a "mutated" map.
  In the theoretical framework of mutated iterations, we study how a mutation (replication error) affects the temporal evolution of the system, in the context of cellular differentiation. We use the prisoner set of the system to quantify simultaneously the long-term behavior of the entire space under mutated maps. We analyze how the position, timing and size of the mutation can alter the system's long-term evolution (as encoded in the topology of its prisoner set). In the context of genetics, this framework may increase our understanding of the factors and mechanisms that shape the genetic expression, in a specialized cell, in the process of differentiation from a stem cell.</description>

      <title>Lipschitz sub-actions for locally maximal hyperbolic sets of a $C^1$ flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.10135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.10135v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Liv\v{s}ic theorem for flows asserts that a Lipschitz observable that has zero mean average along every periodic orbit is necessarily a coboundary, that is the Lie derivative of a Lipschitz function smooth along the flow direction. The positive Liv\v{s}ic theorem bounds from below the observable by such a coboundary as soon as the mean average along every periodic orbit is non negative. Previous proofs give a H\"older coboundary. Assuming that the dynamics is given by a locally maximal hyperbolic flow, we show that the coboundary can be Lipschitz. We introduce a new tool: the Lax-Oleinik semigroup, inspired by Fathi's weak KAM theory.</description>

      <title>Proof of a conjecture by H. Dullin and R. Montgomery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.07097v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the framework of the planar Euler problem in the quasi--periodic regime, the formulae of the periods available in the literature are simple only on one side of their singularity. In this paper, we complement such formulae with others, which result simpler on the other side. The derivation of such new formulae uses the Keplerian limit and complex analysis tools.
  As an application, we prove a conjecture by H. Dullin and R. Montgomery, which states that such periods, as well as their ratio, the {\it rotation number}, are monotone functions of their non--trivial first integral, at any fixed energy level.</description>

      <title>Smooth Koopman eigenfunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00532v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Any dynamical system, whether it is generated by a differential equation or a transformation rule on a manifold, induces a dynamics on functional-spaces. The choice of functional-space may vary, but the induced dynamics is always linear, and codified by the Koopman operator. The eigenfunctions of the Koopman operator are of extreme importance in the study of the dynamics. They provide a clear distinction between the mixing and non-mixing components of the dynamics, and also reveal embedded toral rotations. The usual choice of functional-space is $L^2$, a class of square integrable functions. A fundamental problem with eigenfunctions in $L^2$ is that they are often extremely discontinuous, particularly if the system is chaotic. There are some prototypical systems called skew-product dynamics in which $L^2$ Koopman eigenfunctions are also smooth. The article shows that under general assumptions on an ergodic system, these prototypical examples are the only possibility. Moreover, the smooth eigenfunctions can be used to create a change of variables which explicitly characterizes of the weakly mixing component.</description>

      <title>On Convex Data-Driven Inverse Optimal Control for Nonlinear, Non-stationary and Stochastic Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.13928v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with a finite-horizon inverse control problem, which has the goal of reconstructing, from observations, the possibly non-convex and non-stationary cost driving the actions of an agent. In this context, we present a result enabling cost reconstruction by solving an optimization problem that is convex even when the agent cost is not and when the underlying dynamics is nonlinear, non-stationary and stochastic. To obtain this result, we also study a finite-horizon forward control problem that has randomized policies as decision variables. We turn our findings into algorithmic procedures and show the effectiveness of our approach via in-silico and hardware validations. All experiments confirm the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>Algorithm to find new identifiable reparametrizations of parametric rational ODE models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03057v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Structural identifiability concerns the question of which unknown parameters of a model can be recovered from (perfect) input-output data. If all of the parameters of a model can be recovered from data, the model is said to be identifiable. However, in many models, there are parameters that can take on an infinite number of values but yield the same input-output data. In this case, those parameters and the model are called unidentifiable. The question is then what to do with an unidentifiable model. One can either adjust the model, if experimentally feasible, or try to find a reparametrization to make the model identifiable. In this paper, we take the latter approach. While existing approaches to find identifiable reparametrizations were limited to scaling reparametrizations or were not guaranteed to find a globally identifiable reparametrization even if it exists, we significantly broaden the class of models for which we can find a globally identifiable model with the same input-output behavior as the original one. We also prove that, for linear models, a globally identifiable reparametrization always exists and show that, for a certain class of linear compartmental models, an explicit reparametrization formula exists. We illustrate our method on several examples and provide detailed analysis in supplementary material on github.</description>

      <title>A symplectic Hilbert-Smith conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07195v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove new cases of the Hilbert-Smith conjecture for actions by natural homeomorphisms in symplectic topology. Specifically, we prove that the group of $p$-adic integers $\mathbb Z_p$ does not admit non-trivial continuous actions by Hamiltonian homeomorphisms, the $C^0$ limits of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms, on symplectically aspherical symplectic manifolds. For a class of symplectic manifolds, including all standard symplectic tori, we deduce that a locally compact group acting faithfully by homeomorphisms in the $C^0$ closure of time-one maps of symplectic isotopies must be a Lie group. Our methods of proof differ from prior approaches to the question and involve barcodes and power operations in Floer cohomology. They also apply to other natural metrics in symplectic topology, notably Hofer's metric. An appendix by Leonid Polterovich uses this to deduce obstructions on Hamiltonian actions by semi-simple $p$-adic analytic groups.</description>
