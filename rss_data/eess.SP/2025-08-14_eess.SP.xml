      <title>Comparative Analysis of Attention Mechanisms for Automatic Modulation Classification in Radio Frequency Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatic Modulation Classification (AMC) is a critical component in cognitive radio systems and spectrum management applications. This study presents a comprehensive comparative analysis of three attention mechanisms (i.e., baseline multi-head attention, causal attention, and sparse attention) integrated with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for radio frequency (RF) signal classification. It proposes a novel CNN-Transformer hybrid architecture that leverages different attention patterns to capture temporal dependencies in I/Q samples from the RML2016.10a dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that while baseline attention achieves the highest accuracy of 85.05\%, causal and sparse attention mechanisms offer significant computational advantages with inference times reduced by 83\% and 75\% respectively, while maintaining competitive classification performance above 84\%. The analysis reveals distinct attention pattern preferences across different modulation schemes, providing insights for designing efficient attention mechanisms for real-time radio signal processing applications.</description>

      <title>Information Retention in Iterative Random Projection of Convex Bodies to Lower Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a bounded convex body $K_0 \subset \mathbb{R}^{n}$ subjected to two successive random orthogonal projections onto $\mathbb{R}^{n-1}$ and $\mathbb{R}^{n-2}$, respectively. First, we project $K_0$ orthogonally onto $U_{1}^{\perp}$, the orthogonal complement of $\mbox{\boldmath $U$}_1$, where $\mbox{\boldmath $U$}_1$ is uniformly distributed on the unit sphere $S^{n-1}$. This yields a random convex body $K_1 = \mathrm{Proj}_{{U_1}^{\perp}}(K_0) \subset \mathbb{R}^{n-1}$. We then repeat the process, projecting $K_1$ orthogonally onto ${U}_{2}^{\perp}$, the orthogonal complement of $\mbox{\boldmath $U$}_2$ chosen uniformly from the unit sphere in $\mbox{\boldmath $U$}_{1}^{\perp}$ or $S^{n-2}$, resulting in a second random convex body $K_2 = \mathrm{Proj}_{{U_2}^{\perp}}(K_1) \subset \mathbb{R}^{n-2}$. To quantify information retention through these sequential dimension reductions, we derive an upper bound for the conditional mutual information $I(K_1;K_2 \mid K_0)$. Furthermore, we extend this process to $m$ iterations and generalize the upper bound on $I(K_1;K_2 \mid K_0)$ to establish an analogous upper bound for $I(K_1;K_m \mid K_0)$. Finally, we examine the influence of $K_0$'s symmetry on the achievability of this upper bound for $I(K_1;K_m \mid K_0)$.</description>

      <title>A Deep Learning based Signal Dimension Estimator with Single Snapshot Signal in Phased Array Radar Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Signal dimension, defined here as the number of copies with different delays or angular shifts, is a prerequisite for many high-resolution delay estimation and direction-finding algorithms in sensing and communication systems. Thus, correctly estimating signal dimension itself becomes crucial. In this paper, we present a deep learning-based signal dimension estimator (DLSDE) with single-snapshot observation in the example application of phased array radar. Unlike traditional model-based and existing deep learning-based signal dimension estimators relying on eigen-decomposition and information criterion, to which multiple data snapshots would be needed, the proposed DLSDE uses two-dimensional convolutional neural network (2D-CNN) to automatically develop features corresponding to the dimension of the received signal. Our study shows that DLSDE significantly outperforms traditional methods in terms of the successful detection rate and resolution. In a phased array radar with 32 antenna elements, DLSDE improves detection Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) by &gt;15dB and resolution by &gt;1{\deg}. This makes the proposed method suitable for distinguishing multiple signals that are spatially correlated or have small angular separation. More importantly, our solution operates with a single snapshot signal, which is incompatible with other existing deep learning-based methods.</description>

      <title>Environment Reconstruction in Terahertz Monostatic Sensing: Joint Millimeter-level Geometry Mapping and Material Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Terahertz (THz) integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) offers high-speed communication alongside precise environmental sensing. This paper presents a computationally efficient framework for THz-based environment reconstruction by integrating connected component analysis (CCA)-assisted multipath component (MPC) estimation with a sliding-window refinement strategy. To start with, a monostatic sensing experiment is conducted in an indoor scenario using a vector network analyzer (VNA)-based sounder operating from 290 to 310 GHz. On one hand, as for geometry mapping, a CCA-based region search is employed to accelerate parameter extraction, significantly reducing the search space for space-alternating generalized expectation-maximization (SAGE)-based estimation and achieving an 8.4 times acceleration, while preserving resolution. Further analysis of the connected component structure enables the identification of indoor features such as flat walls and corners. A sliding-window refinement applied to the identified regions improves geometric mapping, achieving the mean distance error of 4.9 mm, which is one order of magnitude better than the literature. On the other hand, the deterministic and stochastic components of the monostatic channel are classified through reflection loss analysis. Then, material identification is performed by looking up the reflection loss in a THz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) database, which comprises over 200 materials across a 0-6 THz range. Experimental results validate millimeter-level accuracy in geometry mapping and reliable material classification, enhancing the environmental awareness capabilities of THz ISAC systems.</description>

      <title>Interleaved Transceiver Design for a Continuous- Transmission MIMO-OFDM ISAC System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes an interleaved transceiver design method for a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system utilizing orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) waveforms. We consider a continuous transmission system and focus on the design of the transmission signal and a receiving filter in the time domain for an interleaved transmission architecture. For communication performance, constructive interference (CI) is integrated into the optimization problem. For radar sensing performance, the integrated mainlobe-to-sidelobe ratio (IMSR) of the beampattern is considered to ensure desirable directivity. Additionally, we tackle the challenges of inter-block interference and eliminate the spurious peaks, which are crucial for accurate target detection. Regarding the hardware implementation aspect, the power of each time sample is constrained to manage the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR). The design problem is addressed using an alternating optimization (AO) framework, with the subproblem for transmitted waveform design being solved via the successive convex approximation (SCA) method. To further enhance computational efficiency, the alternate direction penalty method (ADPM) is employed to solve the subproblems within the SCA iterations. The convergence of ADPM is established, with convergence of the case of more than two auxiliary variables being established for the first time. Numerical simulations validate the effectiveness of our transceiver design in achieving desirable performance in both radar sensing and communication, with the fast algorithm achieving comparable performance with greater computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Second Order Channel Statistics: An Analysis for Optimal Single-user RIS Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key challenge facing reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) is channel state information acquisition. Passive RISs cannot generate pilot signals or process data, making rapid temporal changes in the channel problematic. Additionally, the impact of spatial changes in RIS channels has not been thoroughly investigated. Therefore, in this work, we use second order statistics to investigate the spatio-temporal behaviour of a single-user (SU) RIS system. Assuming a line-of-sight (LoS) RIS to base station (BS) link, we derive an exact expression for the level crossing rate (LCR) of the RIS link (user equipment (UE)-RIS-BS path) and propose a numerically stable approximation for the LCR of the global UE-BS channel. Each LCR expression attained is then utilised to find the corresponding average fade duration (AFD). The temporal signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) correlation is also derived assuming an LoS RIS-BS link. Assuming a Ricean RIS-BS link, expressions for the spatial correlation matrix of the global channel and the mean SNR loss due to channel ageing are derived. All of the analyses are verified by simulation, and the impact of key system parameters is investigated. We show that the use of an RIS does not significantly amplify changes in the channel.</description>

      <title>High SNR Probabilities of Continuous Fluid Antenna Systems in Ricean Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a single-user (SU) continuous fluid antenna system (CFAS) employing matched filtering (MF) operating over a Ricean fading channel. Focusing on the upper tail of the received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) distribution (the high SNR probability (HSP)), we derive accurate approximations for the HSP in 1, 2, and 3 dimensions using the expected Euler characteristic (EEC), presenting the first analytical results for a CFAS in a Ricean environment. In the process, we provide the first closed-form expression for the Euler characteristic density of a non-central chi-squared random field. We then examine the impact of the Ricean K-factor on the CFAS performance, emphasizing the critical role of channel variations in achieving a strong HSP.</description>

      <title>Inverse Synthetic Aperture Radar, Radar Cross Section, and Iterative Smooth Reweighting $\ell_1$-minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radar Cross Section measurement data is often analyzed using Inverse Synthetic Aperture Radar images. This paper compares backprojection and iterative smooth reweighted $\ell_1$-minimization as methods to analyze radar cross section measurements and extract radar cross section for parts of the measured object. The main conclusion is that using backprojection images to extract RCS is robust and accurate but is more limited by the resolution than iterative smooth reweighted $\ell_1$-minimization. The latter method can be used for closely spaced scatterers but is limited in accuracy.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Deep Equilibrium Model Learning for Large-Scale Channel Estimation with Performance Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supervised deep learning methods have shown promise for large-scale channel estimation (LCE), but their reliance on ground-truth channel labels greatly limits their practicality in real-world systems. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised learning framework for LCE that does not require ground-truth channels. The proposed approach leverages Generalized Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimate (GSURE) as a principled unsupervised loss function, which provides an unbiased estimate of the projected mean-squared error (PMSE) from compressed noisy measurements. To ensure a guaranteed performance, we integrate a deep equilibrium (DEQ) model, which implicitly represents an infinite-depth network by directly learning the fixed point of a parameterized iterative process. We theoretically prove that, under mild conditions, the proposed GSURE-based unsupervised DEQ learning can achieve oracle-level supervised performance. In particular, we show that the DEQ architecture inherently enforces a compressible solution. We then demonstrate that DEQ-induced compressibility ensures that optimizing the projected error via GSURE suffices to guarantee a good MSE performance, enabling a rigorous performance guarantee. Extensive simulations validate the theoretical findings and demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly outperforms various baselines when ground-truth channel is unavailable.</description>

      <title>Compressive Spectral Imaging in View of Earth Observation Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Earth observation from space is an important scientific and industrial activity that has applications in many sectors. The instruments employed are often large, complex, and expensive. In addition, they generate large amounts of data, which is challenging for storage and transfer purposes. Compressive spectral imaging would be a cheaper, more efficient, and well-adapted technique to perform Earth observation. An interesting architecture is compressive spectral imaging with diffractive lenses, which is extremely compact. This work investigates the possibility of replacing the diffractive lens in this system with a classical refractive lens. Taking advantage of the chromatic aberration of a lens makes the use of expensive diffractive lenses unnecessary. Simulations are performed to test the feasibility of the method. Signal recovery is a basis pursuit solved using the Douglas-Rashford algorithm.</description>

      <title>Towards Hybrid Lunar PNT: Error Models, Lower Bounds and Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate positioning, navigation and timing (PNT) are crucial for upcoming lunar surface missions. Lunar satellite navigation systems are being developed, but lack coverage during early deployment phases. Hybrid lunar PNT combining cooperative navigation, satellite systems, and an optional reference station offers improved accuracy and availability. This study develops realistic error models that incorporate temporal correlations often ignored in existing works. We derive a cooperative navigation error model considering fading and pseudorange bias from multipath propagation, and compare three error models for lunar satellite pseudorange and pseudorange rate signal-in-space error. These temporal error correlation models integrate easily into Kalman filters and provide realistic performance predictions essential for robust navigation engines. We perform case studies to demonstrate that hybrid navigation significantly improves accuracy, particularly with static users present. Most notably, hybrid navigation enables optimal performance when using a lunar reference station, achieving sub-meter accuracy with only two visible satellites.</description>

      <title>Affine Frequency Division Multiplexing with Subcarrier Power-Level Index Modulation for Integrated Sensing and Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study proposes an index modulation (IM) technique for affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) signals and examines its communication and sensing performance toward integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. The power levels of subcarriers are utilized as modulation indices while also transmitting data symbols within each subcarrier. Thus, the proposed AFDM with subcarrier power-level index modulation (AFDM-PLIM) maintains all subcarriers active at all times to achieve a higher spectral efficiency compared to other AFDM-IM techniques, where some of the subcarriers are turned off for IM. A low complexity estimator and subcarrier grouping are also proposed to reduce the computational complexity of the maximum likelihood estimator. Furthermore, this study also examines the delay and Doppler ambiguity functions of the proposed AFDM-PLIM and evaluates its range estimation performance. The results show that its sensing performance is better than AFDM-IM waveforms due to keeping all subcarriers active at all times.</description>

      <title>Reduction of motion artifacts from photoplethysmography signals using learned convolutional sparse coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective. Wearable devices with embedded photoplethysmography (PPG) enable continuous non-invasive monitoring of cardiac activity, offering a promising strategy to reduce the global burden of cardiovascular diseases. However, monitoring during daily life introduces motion artifacts that can compromise the signals. Traditional signal decomposition techniques often fail with severe artifacts. Deep learning denoisers are more effective but have poorer interpretability, which is critical for clinical acceptance. This study proposes a framework that combines the advantages of both signal decomposition and deep learning approaches. Approach. We leverage algorithm unfolding to integrate prior knowledge about the PPG structure into a deep neural network, improving its interpretability. A learned convolutional sparse coding model encodes the signal into a sparse representation using a learned dictionary of kernels that capture recurrent morphological patterns. The network is trained for denoising using the PulseDB dataset and a synthetic motion artifact model from the literature. Performance is benchmarked with PPG during daily activities using the PPG-DaLiA dataset and compared with two reference deep learning methods. Main results. On the synthetic dataset, the proposed method, on average, improved the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) from -7.07 dB to 11.23 dB and reduced the heart rate mean absolute error (MAE) by 55%. On the PPG-DaLiA dataset, the MAE decreased by 23%. The proposed method obtained higher SNR and comparable MAE to the reference methods. Significance. Our method effectively enhances the quality of PPG signals from wearable devices and enables the extraction of meaningful waveform features, which may inspire innovative tools for monitoring cardiovascular diseases.</description>

      <title>Fluid Antenna Enabled Direction-of-Arrival Estimation Under Time-Constrained Mobility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluid antenna (FA) technology has emerged as a promising approach in wireless communications due to its capability of providing increased degrees of freedom (DoFs) and exceptional design flexibility. This paper addresses the challenge of direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation for aligned received signals (ARS) and non-aligned received signals (NARS) by designing two specialized uniform FA structures under time-constrained mobility. For ARS scenarios, we propose a fully movable antenna configuration that maximizes the virtual array aperture, whereas for NARS scenarios, we design a structure incorporating a fixed reference antenna to reliably extract phase information from the signal covariance. To overcome the limitations of large virtual arrays and limited sample data inherent in time-varying channels (TVC), we introduce two novel DOA estimation methods: TMRLS-MUSIC for ARS, combining Toeplitz matrix reconstruction (TMR) with linear shrinkage (LS) estimation, and TMR-MUSIC for NARS, utilizing sub-covariance matrices to construct virtual array responses. Both methods employ Nystrom approximation to significantly reduce computational complexity while maintaining estimation accuracy. Theoretical analyses and extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed methods achieve underdetermined DOA estimation using minimal FA elements, outperform conventional methods in estimation accuracy, and substantially reduce computational complexity.</description>

By ingeniously harnessing the mobility of fluid antenna (FA) elements, the proposed architectures achieve an extended range of spatial degrees of freedom (DoF) compared to conventional fixed-position antenna (FPA) arrays. This innovation not only facilitates the seamless application of super-resolution DOA estimators but also enables robust DOA estimation, accurately localizing more sources than the number of physical antenna elements. We introduce two bespoke FA array structures and mobility strategies tailored to scenarios with aligned and misaligned received signals, respectively, demonstrating a hardware-driven approach to overcoming complexities typically addressed by intricate algorithms. A key contribution is a light-of-sight (LoS)-centric, closed-form DOA estimator, which first employs an eigenvalue-ratio test for precise LoS path number detection, followed by a polynomial root-finding procedure. This method distinctly showcases the unique advantages of FAS by simplifying the estimation process while enhancing accuracy. Numerical results compellingly verify that the proposed FA array designs and estimation techniques yield an extended DoF range, deliver superior DOA accuracy, and maintain robustness across diverse signal conditions.</description>

      <title>Scalable FAS: A New Paradigm for Array Signal Processing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most existing antenna array-based source localization methods rely on fixed-position arrays (FPAs) and strict assumptions about source field conditions (near-field or far-field), which limits their effectiveness in complex, dynamic real-world scenarios where high-precision localization is required. In contrast, this paper introduces a novel scalable fluid antenna system (SFAS) that can dynamically adjust its aperture configuration to optimize performance for different localization tasks. Within this framework, we develop a two-stage source localization strategy based on the exact spatial geometry (ESG) model: the first stage uses a compact aperture configuration for initial direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation, while the second stage employs an expanded aperture for enhanced DOA and range estimation. The proposed approach eliminates the traditional need for signal separation or isolation to classify source types and enables a single SFAS array to achieve high localization accuracy without field-specific assumptions, model simplifications, or approximations, representing a new paradigm in array-based source localization. Extensive simulations demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in terms of localization accuracy, computational efficiency, and robustness to different source types.</description>

      <title>Molecule Mixture Detection and Alphabet Design for Non-linear, Cross-reactive Receiver Arrays in MC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Air-based molecular communication (MC) has the potential to be one of the first MC systems to be deployed in real-world applications, enabled by existing sensor technologies such as metal-oxide semi-conductor (MOS) sensors. However, commercially available sensors usually exhibit non-linear and cross-reactive behavior, contrary to the idealizing assumptions about linear and perfectly molecule type-specific sensing often made in the MC literature. To address this gap, we propose a detector for molecule mixture communication with a general non-linear, cross-reactive receiver (RX) array that performs approximate maximum likelihood detection on the sensor outputs. Additionally, we introduce an algorithm for the design of mixture alphabets that accounts for the RX characteristics. We evaluate our detector and alphabet design algorithm through simulations that are based on measurements reported for two commercial MOS sensors. Our simulations demonstrate that the proposed detector achieves similar symbol error rates as data-driven methods without requiring large numbers of training samples and that the alphabet design algorithm outperforms methods that do not account for the RX characteristics. Since the proposed detector and alphabet design algorithm are also applicable to other chemical sensors, they pave the way for reliable air-based MC.</description>

      <title>MIMOSA: Multi-parametric Imaging using Multiple-echoes with Optimized Simultaneous Acquisition for highly-efficient quantitative MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Purpose: To develop a new sequence, MIMOSA, for highly-efficient T1, T2, T2*, proton density (PD), and source separation quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM). Methods: MIMOSA was developed based on 3D-quantification using an interleaved Look-Locker acquisition sequence with T2 preparation pulse (3D-QALAS) by combining 3D turbo Fast Low Angle Shot (FLASH) and multi-echo gradient echo acquisition modules with a spiral-like Cartesian trajectory to facilitate highly-efficient acquisition. Simulations were performed to optimize the sequence. Multi-contrast/-slice zero-shot self-supervised learning algorithm was employed for reconstruction. The accuracy of quantitative mapping was assessed by comparing MIMOSA with 3D-QALAS and reference techniques in both ISMRM/NIST phantom and in-vivo experiments. MIMOSA's acceleration capability was assessed at R = 3.3, 6.5, and 11.8 in in-vivo experiments, with repeatability assessed through scan-rescan studies. Beyond the 3T experiments, mesoscale quantitative mapping was performed at 750 um isotropic resolution at 7T. Results: Simulations demonstrated that MIMOSA achieved improved parameter estimation accuracy compared to 3D-QALAS. Phantom experiments indicated that MIMOSA exhibited better agreement with the reference techniques than 3D-QALAS. In-vivo experiments demonstrated that an acceleration factor of up to R = 11.8-fold can be achieved while preserving parameter estimation accuracy, with intra-class correlation coefficients of 0.998 (T1), 0.973 (T2), 0.947 (T2*), 0.992 (QSM), 0.987 (paramagnetic susceptibility), and 0.977 (diamagnetic susceptibility) in scan-rescan studies. Whole-brain T1, T2, T2*, PD, source separation QSM were obtained with 1 mm isotropic resolution in 3 min at 3T and 750 um isotropic resolution in 13 min at 7T. Conclusion: MIMOSA demonstrated potential for highly-efficient multi-parametric mapping.</description>

      <title>Energy-Efficient Index and Code Index Modulations for Spread CPM Signals in Internet of Things</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evolution of Internet of Things technologies is driven by four key demands: ultra-low power consumption, high spectral efficiency, reduced implementation cost, and support for massive connectivity. To address these challenges, this paper proposes two novel modulation schemes that integrate continuous phase modulation (CPM) with spread spectrum (SS) techniques. We begin by establishing the quasi-orthogonality properties of CPM-SS sequences. The first scheme, termed IM-CPM-SS, employs index modulation (IM) to select spreading sequences from the CPM-SS set, thereby improving spectral efficiency while maintaining the constant-envelope property. The second scheme, referred to as CIM-CPM-SS, introduces code index modulation (CIM), which partitions the input bits such that one subset is mapped to phase-shift keying symbols and the other to CPM-SS sequence indices. Both schemes are applied to downlink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) systems. We analyze their performance in terms of bit error rate (BER), spectral and energy efficiency, computational complexity, and peak-to-average power ratio characteristics under nonlinear amplifier conditions. Simulation results demonstrate that both schemes outperform conventional approaches in BER while preserving the benefits of constant-envelope, continuous-phase signaling. Furthermore, they achieve higher spectral and energy efficiency and exhibit strong resilience to nonlinear distortions in downlink NOMA scenarios.</description>

      <title>Integrated Communication and Remote Sensing in LEO Satellite Systems: Protocol, Architecture and Prototype</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the integration of communication and synthetic aperture radar (SAR)-based remote sensing in low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite systems to provide real-time SAR imaging and information transmission. Considering the high-mobility characteristics of satellite channels and limited processing capabilities of satellite payloads, we propose an integrated communication and remote sensing architecture based on an orthogonal delay-Doppler division multiplexing (ODDM) signal waveform. Both communication and SAR imaging functionalities are achieved with an integrated transceiver onboard the LEO satellite, utilizing the same waveform and radio frequency (RF) front-end. Based on such an architecture, we propose a transmission protocol compatible with the 5G NR standard using downlink pilots for joint channel estimation and SAR imaging. Furthermore, we design a unified signal processing framework for the integrated satellite receiver to simultaneously achieve high-performance channel sensing, low-complexity channel equalization and interference-free SAR imaging. Finally, the performance of the proposed integrated system is demonstrated through comprehensive analysis and extensive simulations in the sub-6 GHz band. Moreover, a software-defined radio (SDR) prototype is presented to validate its effectiveness for real-time SAR imaging and information transmission in satellite direct-connect user equipment (UE) scenarios within the millimeter-wave (mmWave) band.</description>

      <title>Quantum Wavefront Correction via Machine Learning for Satellite-to-Earth CV-QKD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: State-of-the-art free-space continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) protocols use phase reference pulses to modulate the wavefront of a real local oscillator at the receiver, thereby compensating for wavefront distortions caused by atmospheric turbulence. It is normally assumed that the wavefront distortion in these phase reference pulses is identical to the wavefront distortion in the quantum signals, which are multiplexed during transmission. However, in many real-world deployments, there can exist a relative wavefront error (WFE) between the reference pulses and quantum signals, which, among other deleterious effects, can severely limit secure key transfer in satellite-to-Earth CV-QKD. In this work, we introduce novel machine learning-based wavefront correction algorithms, which utilize multi-plane light conversion for decomposition of the reference pulses and quantum signals into the Hermite-Gaussian (HG) basis, then estimate the difference in HG mode phase measurements, effectively eliminating this problem. Through detailed simulations of the Earth-satellite channel, we demonstrate that our new algorithm can rapidly identify and compensate for any relative WFEs that may exist, whilst causing no harm when WFEs are similar across both the reference pulses and quantum signals. We quantify the gains available in our algorithm in terms of the CV-QKD secure key rate. We show channels where positive secure key rates are obtained using our algorithms, while information loss without wavefront correction would result in null key rates.</description>

      <title>A 240 Elements Matrix Probe with Aberration Mask for 4D Carotid Artery Computational Ultrasound Imaging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound provides enhanced visualization of the carotid artery (CA) anatomy and volumetric flow, offering improved accuracy for cardiovascular diagnosis and monitoring. However, fully populated matrix transducers with large apertures are complex and costly to implement. Computational ultrasound imaging (cUSi) offers a promising alternative by enabling simplified hardware design through model-based reconstruction and spatial field encoding. In this work, we present a 3D cUSi system tailored for CA imaging, consisting of a 240-element matrix probe with a 40 x 24 mm$^2$ large aperture and a spatial encoding mask. We describe the system's design, characterization, and image reconstruction. Phantom experiments show that computational reconstruction using matched filtering (MF) significantly improves volumetric image quality over delay-and-sum (DAS), with spatial encoding enhancing lateral resolution at the cost of reduced contrast ratio. LSQR-based reconstruction was demonstrated to further improve resolution and suppress artifacts. Using both Hadamard and 16-angle plane wave transmission schemes, the system achieved high-resolution images with reasonable contrast, supporting the feasibility of 4D CA imaging applications.</description>

      <title>Reproducible Physiological Features in Affective Computing: A Preliminary Analysis on Arousal Modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Affective Computing, a key challenge lies in reliably linking subjective emotional experiences with objective physiological markers. This preliminary study addresses the issue of reproducibility by identifying physiological features from cardiovascular and electrodermal signals that are associated with continuous self-reports of arousal levels. Using the Continuously Annotated Signal of Emotion dataset, we analyzed 164 features extracted from cardiac and electrodermal signals of 30 participants exposed to short emotion-evoking videos. Feature selection was performed using the Terminating-Random Experiments (T-Rex) method, which performs variable selection systematically controlling a user-defined target False Discovery Rate. Remarkably, among all candidate features, only two electrodermal-derived features exhibited reproducible and statistically significant associations with arousal, achieving a 100\% confirmation rate. These results highlight the necessity of rigorous reproducibility assessments in physiological features selection, an aspect often overlooked in Affective Computing. Our approach is particularly promising for applications in safety-critical environments requiring trustworthy and reliable white box models, such as mental disorder recognition and human-robot interaction systems.</description>

      <title>Differential Physiological Responses to Proxemic and Facial Threats in Virtual Avatar Interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Proxemics, the study of spatial behavior, is fundamental to social interaction and increasingly relevant for virtual reality (VR) applications. While previous research has established that users respond to personal space violations in VR similarly as in real-world settings, phase-specific physiological responses and the modulating effects of facial expressions remain understudied. We investigated physiological and subjective responses to personal space violations by virtual avatars, to understand how threatening facial expressions and interaction phases (approach vs. standing) influence these responses. Sixteen participants experienced a 2x2 factorial design manipulating Personal Space (intrusion vs. respect) and Facial Expression (neutral vs. angry) while we recorded skin conductance response (SCR), heart rate variability (HRV), and discomfort ratings. Personal space boundaries were individually calibrated using a stop-distance procedure. Results show that SCR responses are significantly higher during the standing phase compared to the approach phase when personal space was violated, indicating that prolonged proximity within personal space boundaries is more physiologically arousing than the approach itself. Angry facial expressions significantly reduced HRV, reflecting decreased parasympathetic activity, and increased discomfort ratings, but did not amplify SCR responses. These findings demonstrate that different physiological modalities capture distinct aspects of proxemic responses: SCR primarily reflects spatial boundary violations, while HRV responds to facial threat cues. Our results provide insights for developing comprehensive multi-modal assessments of social behavior in virtual environments and inform the design of more realistic avatar interactions.</description>

      <title>Self-Supervised Temporal Super-Resolution of Energy Data using Generative Adversarial Transformer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To bridge the temporal granularity gap in energy network design and operation based on Energy System Models, resampling of time series is required. While conventional upsampling methods are computationally efficient, they often result in significant information loss or increased noise. Advanced models such as time series generation models, Super-Resolution models and imputation models show potential, but also face fundamental challenges. The goal of time series generative models is to learn the distribution of the original data to generate high-resolution series with similar statistical characteristics. This is not entirely consistent with the definition of upsampling. Time series Super-Resolution models or imputation models can degrade the accuracy of upsampling because the input low-resolution time series are sparse and may have insufficient context. Moreover, such models usually rely on supervised learning paradigms. This presents a fundamental application paradox: their training requires the high-resolution time series that is intrinsically absent in upsampling application scenarios. To address the mentioned upsampling issue, this paper introduces a new method utilizing Generative Adversarial Transformers (GATs), which can be trained without access to any ground-truth high-resolution data. Compared with conventional interpolation methods, the introduced method can reduce the root mean square error (RMSE) of upsampling tasks by 9%, and the accuracy of a model predictive control (MPC) application scenario is improved by 13%.</description>

      <title>Ambiguity Function Analysis of Affine Frequency Division Multiplexing for Integrated Sensing and Communication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02582v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) is a chirp-based multicarrier waveform that was recently proposed for communication over doubly dispersive channels. Given its chirp nature, AFDM is expected to have superior sensing capabilities compared to orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and is thus a promising candidate for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) applications. In this paper, we derive a closed-form expression for the ambiguity function of AFDM waveforms modulated with $M$-ary quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) data symbols. We determine the condition on the chirp rate of the AFDM waveform that minimizes the sidelobes in the delay/range domain in the presence of random $M$-ary QAM symbols, thereby improving overall sensing performance. Additionally, we find an approximate statistical distribution for the magnitude of the derived ambiguity function. Simulation results are presented to evaluate the sensing performance of the AFDM waveform for various system parameters and to compare its peak-to-sidelobe ratio (PSLR) and integrated sidelobe ratio (ISLR) with those of OFDM.</description>

      <title>xApp Conflict Mitigation with Scheduler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06867v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Open RAN (O-RAN) fosters multi-vendor interoperability and data-driven control but simultaneously introduces the challenge of coordinating pre-trained xApps that may produce conflicting actions. Although O-RAN specifications mandate offline training and validation to prevent the deployment of untrained or inadequately tested models, operational conflicts can still arise under dynamic and context-dependent conditions.This work proposes a scheduler-based conflict mitigation framework to address these challenges without requiring training xApps together or further xApp re-training. By examining an indirect conflict involving power and resource block allocation xApps and employing an Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) approach to train both xApps and the scheduler, we illustrate that a straightforward A2C-based scheduler improves performance relative to independently deployed xApps and conflicting cases. Notably, among all tested deployment scenarios (including individual xApp deployment, multiple conflicting xApps, and limited scheduler configurations), augmenting the system with baseline xApps and enabling the scheduler to select from a broader pool achieves the highest total transmission rate, thereby underscoring the importance of adaptive scheduling mechanisms. These findings highlight the context-dependent nature of conflicts in automated network management, as two xApps may conflict under certain conditions but coexist under others. Consequently, the ability to dynamically update and adapt the scheduler to accommodate diverse operational intents is vital for future network deployments. By offering dynamic scheduling without re-training xApps, this framework advances practical conflict resolution solutions while supporting real-world scalability.</description>

Abstract: Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is a promising multiple access technique. Its performance depends strongly on the wireless channel property, which can be enhanced by reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs). In this paper, we jointly optimize base station (BS) precoding and RIS configuration with unsupervised machine learning (ML), which looks for the optimal solution autonomously. In particular, we propose a dedicated neural network (NN) architecture RISnet inspired by domain knowledge in communication. Compared to state-of-the-art, the proposed approach combines analytical optimal BS precoding and ML-enabled RIS, has a high scalability to control more than 1000 RIS elements, has a low requirement for channel state information (CSI) in input, and addresses the mutual coupling between RIS elements. Beyond the considered problem, this work is an early contribution to domain knowledge enabled ML, which exploit the domain expertise of communication systems to design better approaches than general ML methods.</description>

      <title>Double reflections Assisted RIS Deployment and Energy-efficient Group Selection in mmWaves D2D Communication</title>

Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) offer a viable way to improve the performance of multi-hop device-to-device (D2D) communication. However, due to the substantial propagation and penetration losses of the millimeter waves (mmWaves), a direct line of sight (LoS) link and close proximity of a device pair are required for a high data rate. Static obstacles like trees and buildings can easily impede the direct LoS connectivity between a device pair. Hence, RIS placement plays a crucial role in establishing an indirect LoS link between them. Therefore, in this work, we propose a set cover-based RIS deployment strategy for both single and double RIS-assisted D2D communication. In particular, we have demonstrated that permitting reflections via two consecutive RISs can greatly lower the RIS density in the environment, preventing resource waste and enabling the service of more obstructed device pairs. After the RIS deployment, for information transfer, we also propose an energy-efficient group selection criteria. Moreover, we prove that sometimes double reflections are more beneficial than single reflection, which is counter-intuitive. Numerical results show that our approach outperforms a random and a recent deployment strategy.</description>

      <title>Speech Enhancement based on cascaded two flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06842v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Speech enhancement (SE) based on diffusion probabilistic models has exhibited impressive performance, while requiring a relatively high number of function evaluations (NFE). Recently, SE based on flow matching has been proposed, which showed competitive performance with a small NFE. Early approaches adopted the noisy speech as the only conditioning variable. There have been other approaches which utilize speech enhanced with a predictive model as another conditioning variable and to sample an initial value, but they require a separate predictive model on top of the generative SE model. In this work, we propose to employ an identical model based on flow matching for both SE and generating enhanced speech used as an initial starting point and a conditioning variable. Experimental results showed that the proposed method required the same or fewer NFEs even with two cascaded generative methods while achieving equivalent or better performances to the previous baselines.</description>
