      <title>Polyanalytic Hermite polynomials associated with the elliptic Ginibre model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the connection between the eigenvalues of the complex Ginibre matrix model and the magnetic Laplacian in the complex plane, we derive analogues of the complex Hermite polynomials for the elliptic Ginibre model. To this end, we appeal to squeezed creation and annihilation operators arising from the Bogoliubov transformation of creation and annihilation operators on the Bargmann-Fock space. The obtained polynomials are then expressed as linear combinations of products of Hermite polynomials and share the same orthogonality relation with holomorphic Hermite polynomials. Moreover, this expression allows to identify them with the 2D-Hermite polynomials associated to a unimodular complex symmetric 2x2 matrix. Afterwards, we derive, for any Landau level, a closed formula for the kernel of the isometry mapping the basis of (rescaled) holomorphic Hermite polynomials to the corresponding complex Hermite polynomials. This kernel is also interpreted in terms of the two-photon coherent states and the metaplectic representation of the SU(1,1) group.</description>

      <title>Non relativistic limit of the nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation: Uniform in time convergence of KAM solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the non relativistic limit of the solutions of the cubic nonlinear Klein--Gordon (KG) equation on an interval with Dirichlet boundary conditions. We construct a family of quasi periodic solutions which, after a Gauge transformation, converge globally uniformly in time to quasi periodic solutions of the cubic NLS. The proof is based on KAM theory. We emphasize that, regardless of the spatial domain, all the previous results prove the convergence of KG solutions to NLS solutions only on compact time intervals.</description>

      <title>Connection formulae for the radial Toda equations II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is a continuation of [arXiv:2309.16550] in which we computed the asymptotics near $x = \infty$ of all solutions of the radial Toda equation. In this article, we compute the asymptotics near $x = \infty$ of all solutions of a "partner" equation. The equations are related in the sense that their respective monodromy data constitute connected components of the same "monodromy manifold". While all solutions of the radial Toda equation are smooth, those of the partner equation have infinitely many singularities, and this makes the Riemann-Hilbert nonlinear steepest descent method (and the asymptotics of solutions) more involved.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The p-Laplace operator in the entire N-dimensional Euclidean space, subject to external electromagnetic potentials, is investigated. In the general case 1&lt;p&lt;N, the existence of at least one solution of mountain pass type to a weighted critical equation is proved. Our technique relies on variational methods and faces a twofold difficulty: double lack of compactness, which requires concentration compactness arguments; and a complex quasilinear framework, which entails appropriate inequalities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We adapt the Worldline Formalism to obtain resummed expressions for the effective action and the heat kernel of a quantum scalar field coupled to a Yukawa background. The resummation includes all the invariants built from powers, first derivatives and second derivatives of the latter. Using such results, we compute the instability of the vacuum computing the vacuum persistence amplitude and the corresponding Schwinger pair production probability. We show that the inclusion of an additional, rapidly varying background can greatly enhance the production of pairs.</description>

      <title>Reaction-diffusion systems from kinetic models for bacterial communities on a leaf surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many mathematical models for biological phenomena, such as the spread of diseases, are based on reaction-diffusion equations for densities of interacting cell populations. We present a consistent derivation of reaction-diffusion equations from systems of suitably rescaled kinetic Boltzmann equations for distribution functions of cell populations interacting in a host medium. We show at first that the classical diffusive limit of kinetic equations leads to linear diffusion terms only. Then, we show possible strategies in order to obtain, from the kinetic level, macroscopic systems with nonlinear diffusion and also with cross-diffusion effects. The derivation from a kinetic description has the advantage of relating reaction and diffusion coefficients to the microscopic parameters of the interactions. We present an application of our approach to the study of the evolution of different bacterial populations on a leaf surface. Turing instability properties of the relevant macroscopic systems are investigated by analytical methods and numerical tools, with particular emphasis on pattern formation for varying parameters in two-dimensional space domains.</description>

      <title>Emergent multifractality in power-law decaying eigenstates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Eigenstate multifractality is of significant interest with potential applications in various fields of quantum physics. Most of the previous studies concentrated on fine-tuned quantum models to realize multifractality which is generally believed to be a critical phenomenon and fragile to random perturbations. In this work, we propose a set of generic principles based on the power-law decay of the eigenstates which allow us to distinguish a fractal phase from a genuine multifractal phase. We demonstrate the above principles in a 1d tight-binding model with inhomogeneous nearest-neighbor hopping that can be mapped to the standard quantum harmonic oscillator via energy-coordinate duality. We analytically calculate the fractal dimensions and the spectrum of fractal dimensions which are in agreement with numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Computing entanglement costs of non-local operations on the basis of algebraic geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In order to realize distributed quantum computations and quantify entanglement, it is crucial to minimize the entanglement consumption of implementing non-local operations by using local operations and classical communications (LOCC) channels. Although this optimization is generally NP-hard even if we relax the condition of LOCC channels to separable ones, many methodologies have been developed. However, each has only succeeded in determining the entanglement cost for specific cases.
  As a main mathematical result, we introduce a concept based on algebraic geometry to simplify the algebraic constraints in the optimization. This concept makes it possible to generalize previous studies in a unified way. Moreover, via the generalization, we solve an open problem posed by Yu et al. about the entanglement cost for local state discrimination. In addition to its versatility for analysis, this concept enables us to strengthen the DPS (Doherty, Parrilo, and Spedalieri) hierarchy and compute the entanglement cost approximately. By running the algorithm based on our improved DPS hierarchy, we numerically obtain the trade-off between the (one-shot) entanglement cost and the success probability for implementing various non-local quantum operations under separable channels, such as entanglement distillation and local implementation of non-local unitary channels, measurements, and state verification.</description>

      <title>Detecting quantum steering in networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum networks promise an unprecedented leap in semi-device-independent communication and security by capitalizing on quantum steering. However, current methods for assessing quantum network steering are constrained to specific cases. In this work, we introduce the network-Clauser-Horn-Shimony-Holt-like inequality for investigating network steering independent of entanglement source characteristics. We employ this inequality to detect full network steering in both single-node and multinode repeater networks and assess the tolerance of various noise models. Under a specific noise model, our method is used to compute the bound of semi-device-independent communication distance. Through case studies, we also demonstrate that our method, as a semi-device-independent entanglement witness, is more suitable for settings requiring Bell measurements compared to network Bell inequality. These findings open new avenues for broader ways to detect quantum steering independent of entanglement sources.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mobility edges (ME), defined as critical energies that separate the extended states from the localized states, are a significant topic in quantum physics. In this paper, we demonstrate the existence of two exact new mobility edges for two physically realistic models: the first, referred to as Type II ME, represents the critical energy that separates the critical states from localized states; the second, referred to as Type III ME, marks the critical energy that separate the critical states from extended states. The proof is based on spectral analysis of singular Jacobi operator on the strip.</description>

      <title>Infinite-dimensional Lagrange-Dirac systems with boundary energy flow I: Foundations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new geometric approach to systems with boundary energy flow is developed using infinite-dimensional Dirac structures within the Lagrangian formalism. This framework satisfies a list of consistency criteria with the geometric setting of finite-dimensional mechanics. In particular, the infinite-dimensional Dirac structure can be constructed from the canonical symplectic form on the system's phase space; the system's evolution equations can be derived equivalently from either a variational perspective or a Dirac structure perspective; the variational principle employed is a direct extension of Hamilton's principle in classical mechanics; and the approach allows for a process of system interconnection within its formulation. This is achieved by developing an appropriate infinite dimensional version of the previously developed Lagrange-Dirac systems. A key step in this construction is the careful choice of a suitable dual space to the configuration space, specifically, a subspace of the topological dual that captures the system's behavior in both the interior and the boundary, while allowing for a natural extension of the canonical geometric structures of mechanics. This paper focuses on systems where the configuration space consists of differential forms on a smooth manifold with a boundary. To illustrate our theory, several examples, including nonlinear wave equations, the telegraph equation, and the Maxwell equations are presented.</description>

Abstract: We consider two new families of quantum vertex algebras which are associated with the type $A$ trigonometric $R$-matrix and elliptic $R$-matrix of the eight-vertex model. We show that their $\phi$-coordinated representation theory is governed by the so-called FRT-operator, $h$-adically restricted operator satisfying the FRT-relation, and we demonstrate some applications of this result. Finally, in the elliptic case, we investigate the properties of the quantum determinant associated with the corresponding quantum vertex algebra.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions for fractional $\Phi^3_d$ on the torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the fractional $\Phi^3_d$-measure on the $d$-dimensional torus, with Gaussian free field having inverse covariance $(1-\Delta)^\alpha$, and show a phase transition at $d=3\alpha$. More precisely, in a regular regime $d&lt;3\alpha$, one can construct and normalise this measure, and obtain a measure which is absolutely continuous with respect to the Gaussian free field $\mu$. At $d=3\alpha$, the behaviour depends on the size $|\sigma|$ of the nonlinearity: for $|\sigma|\ll1$, the measure exists, but is singular with respect to $\mu$, whereas for $|\sigma|\gg1$, the measure is not normalisable. This generalises a result of Oh, Okamoto, and Tolomeo (2025) on the $\Phi^3_3$-measure.</description>

      <title>Single versus multifield scalar potentials from string theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the properties of string effective theories with scalar field(s) and a scalar potential. We first claim that in most examples known, such theories are multifield, with at least 2 non-compact field directions; the few counter-examples appear to be very specific and isolated. Such a systematic multifield situation has important implications for cosmology. Characterising properties of the scalar potential $V$ is also more delicate in a multifield setting. We provide several examples of string effective theories with $V&gt;0$, where the latter admits an asymptotically flat direction along an off-shell field trajectory: in other words, there exists a limit $\varphi \rightarrow \infty$ for which $\frac{|\partial_{\varphi} V|}{V} \rightarrow 0$. It is thus meaningless to look for a lower bound to this single field quantity in a multifield setting; the complete gradient $\nabla V$ is then better suited. Restricting to on-shell trajectories, this question remains open, especially when following the steepest descent or more generally a gradient flow evolution. Interestingly, single field statements in multifield theories seem less problematic for $V&lt;0$.</description>

      <title>Bosonized Momentum Distribution of a Fermi Gas via Friedrichs Diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11945v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, Benedikter and the author proved an approximate formula for the momentum distribution of a 3d fermionic gas interacting by a short-range pair potential in the mean-field regime, within a trial state close to the ground state. Here, we derive an exact formula for the momentum distribution in this trial state, using a diagrammatic formalism due to Friedrichs. We further demonstrate how the formula of Benedikter and the author arises from a restriction of the contributing diagrams to those corresponding to a bosonization approximation.</description>

      <title>The Ising Model Coupled to 2D Gravity: Genus Zero Partition Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03259v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the genus $0$ free energy for the $2$-matrix model with quartic interactions, which acts as a generating function for the Ising model's partition function on a random, $4$-regular, planar graph. This is consistent with the predictions of V.A. Kazakov and D.V. Boulatov on this model, as well as subsequent confirmation of this formula using combinatorial methods. We also provide a new parametric formula for the free energy and give a characterization of the phase space. Our analysis is based on a steepest descent Riemann-Hilbert analysis of the associated biorthogonal polynomials and the corresponding isomonodromic $\tau$-function. A key ingredient in the analysis is a parametrization of the spectral curve. This analysis lays the groundwork for the subsequent study of the multicritical point, which we will study in a forthcoming work.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium of Charges and Differential Equations Solved by Polynomials II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01494v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We continue study of equilibrium of two species of 2d coulomb charges (or point vortices in 2d ideal fluid) started in (Igor Loutsenko, J. Phys. A: Math. Gen. 37, 1309, 2004). Although for two species of vortices with circulation ratio -1 the relationship between the equilibria and the factorization/Darboux transformation of the Schrodinger operator was established a long ago, the question about similar relationship for the ratio -2 remained unanswered. Here we present the answer: One has to consider Darboux-type transformations of third order differential operators rather than second order Schrodinger operators. Furthermore, we show that such transformations can also generate equilibrium configurations where an additional charge of a third specie is present. Relationship with integrable hierarchies is briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Trotterization in Quantum Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.13296v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Trotterization in quantum mechanics is an important theoretical concept in handling the exponential of noncommutative operators. In this communication, we give a mathematical formulation of the Trotter Product Formula, and apply it to basic examples in which the utility of Trotterization is evident. Originally, this article was completed in December 2020 as a report under the mentorship of Esteban C\'ardenas for the University of Texas at Austin Mathematics Directed Reading Program (DRP). However, the relevance of Trotterization in reducing quantum circuit complexity has warranted the release of a revised and more formal version of the original. Thus, we present a mathematical perspective on Trotterization, including a detailed sketch of a formal proof of the Trotter Product Formula.</description>

Abstract: We show that the construction of vertex algebras from Costello-Gwilliam factorization algebras on $\mathbb{C}$ can be achieved without the discreteness condition on the weight spaces. Furthermore, we construct locally constant factorization algebras from commutative vertex algebras, and discuss the relationship between this construction and the jet algebras of commutative algebras.</description>

      <title>Noninvertible operators in one, two, and three dimensions via gauging spatially modulated symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16744v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spatially modulated symmetries have emerged since the discovery of fractons, which characterize unconventional topological phases with mobility-constrained quasiparticle excitations. On the other hand, non-invertible duality defects have attracted substantial attention in communities of high energy and condensed matter physics due to their deep insight into quantum anomalies and exotic phases of matter. However, the connection between these exotic symmetries and defects has not been fully explored. In this paper, we construct concrete lattice models with non-invertible duality defects via gauging spatially modulated symmetries and investigate their exotic fusion rules. Specifically, we construct spin models with subsystem symmetries or dipole symmetries on one, two, and three-dimensional lattices. Gauging subsystem symmetries leads to non-invertible duality defects whose fusion rules involve $0$-form subsystem charges in two dimensions and higher-form operators that correspond to ``lineon'' excitations (excitations which are mobile along one-dimensional line) in three dimensions. Gauging dipole symmetries leads to non-invertible duality defects with dipole algebras that describe a hierarchical structure between global and dipole charges. Notably, the hierarchical structure of the dual dipole charges is inverted compared with the original ones. Our work provides a unified and systematic analytical framework for constructing exotic duality defects by gauging relevant symmetries.</description>

      <title>Efficient pseudometrics for data-driven comparisons of nonlinear dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18681v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computationally efficient solutions for pseudometrics quantifying deviation from topological conjugacy between dynamical systems are presented. Deviation from conjugacy is quantified in a Pareto optimal sense that accounts for spectral properties of Koopman operators as well as trajectory geometry. Theoretical justification is provided for computing such pseudometrics in Koopman eigenfunction space rather than observable space. Furthermore, it is shown that theoretical consistency with topological conjugacy can be maintained when restricting the search for optimal transformations between systems to the unitary group. Therefore the pseudometrics are based on analytical solutions for unitary transformations in Koopman eigenfunction space. Geometric considerations for the deviation from conjugacy Pareto optimality problem are used to develop scalar pseudometrics that account for all possible optimal solutions given just two Pareto points. The approach is demonstrated on two example problems; the first being a simple benchmarking problem and the second an engineering example comparing the dynamics of morphological computation of biological nonlinear muscle actuators to simplified man-made (including bioinspired) approaches. The benefits of considering operator and trajectory geometry based dissimilarity measures in a unified and consistent formalism is demonstrated. Overall, the deviation from conjugacy pseudometrics provide practical advantages in terms of efficiency and scalability, while maintaining theoretical consistency.</description>

      <title>On clogged and fast diffusions in porous media with fractional pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11645v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the existence and infinite-speed propagation of solutions to models arising in porous media, when the mobility is highly degenerate (inverse power law). The approach is based on maximum principles for the fractional Laplacian, and allows to derive lower bounds on solutions in a straightforward manner. Finally, in the case of clogged porous media, where the mobility vanishes at points of unbounded density, solutions that become instantaneously bounded are constructed.</description>

      <title>Jordan-H\"older property for shifted quantum affine algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16859v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that finite length representations of shifted quantum affine algebras in category $\mathcal{O}^{\mathrm{sh}}$ are stable by fusion product. This implies that in the topological Grothendieck ring $K_0(\mathcal{O}^{\mathrm{sh}})$ the Grothendieck group of finite length representations forms a non-topological subring. We also conjecture this subring is isomorphic to the cluster algebra discovered in arXiv:2401.04616. In the course of our proofs, we establish that any simple representation in category $\mathcal{O}^{\mathrm{sh}}$ descends to a truncation, for certain truncation parameters as conjectured in arXiv:2010.06996 in terms of Langlands dual $q$-characters.</description>
