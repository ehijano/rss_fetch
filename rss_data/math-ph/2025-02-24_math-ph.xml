      <title>Emergence of coupled Korteweg-de Vries equations in $m$ fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation is of fundamental importance in a wide range of subjects with generalization to multi-component systems relevant for multi-species fluids and cold atomic mixtures. We present a general framework in which a family of multi-component KdV (mKdV) equations naturally arises from a broader mathematical structure under reasonable assumptions on the nature of the nonlinear couplings. In particular, we derive a universal form for such a system of $m$ KdV equations that is parameterized by $m$ non-zero real numbers and two symmetric functions of those $m$ numbers. Secondly, we show that physically relevant setups such as $N\geq m+1$ multi-component nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations (MNLS), under scaling and perturbative treatment, reduce to such a mKdV equation for a specific choice of the symmetric functions. The reduction from MNLS to mKdV requires one to be in a suitable parameter regime where the associated sound speeds are repeated. Hence, we connect the assumptions made in the derivation of mKdV system to physically interpretable assumptions for the MNLS equation. Lastly, our approach provides a systematic foundation for facilitating a natural emergence of multi-component partial differential equations starting from a general mathematical structure.</description>

      <title>Bound on the Excess Charge of Generalized Thomas-Fermi-Weizs\"acker Functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We bound the number of electrons $Q$ that an atom can bind in excess of neutrality for density functionals generalizing the classical Thomas-Fermi-Weizs\"acker functional: instead of the classical power $5/3$ more general powers $p$ are considered. For $3/2&lt;p&lt;2$ we prove the excess charge conjecture, i.e., that $Q$ is uniformly bounded in the atomic number $Z$. The case $p=3/2$ is critical: the behavior changes from a uniform bound in $Z$ to a linear bound at the critical coupling $4\sqrt\pi$ of the nonlinear term. We also improve the linear bound for all $p\geq6/5$.</description>

      <title>Foundational aspects of spinor structures and exotic spinors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spinors are mathematical objects susceptible to the spacetime characteristics upon which they are defined. Not all spacetimes admit spinor structure; when it does, it may have more than one spinor structure, depending on topological properties. When more than one nonequivalent spinor structure is allowed in a given spacetime, the spinors resulting from the extra structures are called exotic. In this review, we revisit the topological conditions driving the discussion about the spacetime characteristics leading to the existence and (non)uniqueness of spinor structures in a relatively comprehensive manner, accounting for step-to-step demonstrations. In the sequel, we delve into the topologically corrected Dirac operator, explicitly obtaining it and exploring the physical consequences encoded in the exotic spinor dynamics. Finally, we overview early and recent achievements in the area, pointing out possible directions within this research program.</description>

      <title>Generalized determinant inspired by QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a generalized determinant as a function of $N$ distinct $N \times N$ complex matrices into a complex number. This function, originally introduced in the study of the chiral anomaly in QCD (PRD 97 (2018) 9, 091901 PRD 109 (2024) 7, L071502), in particular in connections to mesons, reduces to the usual determinant when all the matrices are taken as equal. Hence, we denote it as `polydeterminant'. Here, we explore its main algebraic properties as well as its geometric interpretation in detail.</description>

      <title>Stochastic interpretations of the oceanic primitive equations with relaxed hydrostatic assumptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate how weakening the classical hydrostatic balance hypothesis impacts the well-posedness of the stochastic LU primitive equations. The models we consider are intermediate between the incompressible 3D LU Navier-Stokes equations and the LU primitive equations with standard hydrostatic balance. As such, they are expected to be numerically tractable, while accounting well for phenomena within the grey zone between hydrostatic balance and non-hydrostatic processes. Our main result is the well-posedness of a low-pass filtering-based stochastic interpretation of the LU primitive equations, with rigid-lid type boundary conditions, in the limit of ``quasi-barotropic'' flow. This assumption is linked to the structure assumption proposed in the work of Agresti et al., which can be related to the dynamical regime where the primitive equations remain valid. Furthermore, we present and study two eddy-(hyper)viscosity-based models.</description>

      <title>A Multiplicative Ergodic Theorem for Repeated Bistochastic Quantum Interactions with Applications to Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider compositions of random bistochastic completely positive (bcp) maps driven by an ergodic dynamical system. Our main result is the explicit description of Oseledets's Multiplicative Ergodic Theorem (MET) for such compositions in terms of the random multiplicative domains corresponding to the random bcp maps in the compositions. By applying our main theorem, we classify when compositions of random bcp maps are asymptotically entanglement breaking, and use this classification to show that occasionally PPT maps are asymptotically entanglement breaking, i.e., if compositions of random bcp maps contain PPT bcp maps with positive probability, then they are asymptotically entanglement breaking almost surely. We then strengthen our results in the case of compositions of i.i.d. random bcp maps, and, by an application of the theory of random walks on linear groups, we prove a generalization of a theorem of Kuperberg for compositions of i.i.d. random bcp maps. We conclude with a cursory discussion of how to use our methods to move beyond asymptotics and find random finite times at which compositions of random bcp maps are entanglement breaking.</description>

      <title>Dissipative anomalies of stresses in soft amorphous solids: footprints of density singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In soft amorphous solids, localized irreversible (plastic) stress dissipation occurs as a response to external forcings. A crucial question is whether we can identify structural properties linked to a region's propensity to undergo a plastic stress drop when thermal effects are negligible. To address this question, I follow a theoretical framework provided by Onsager's ideal turbulence theory, representing a non-perturbative application of the renormalization group scale-invariance principle. First, I analyze the zero temperature limit for the fine-grained balance equation for the stress tensor corresponding to instanton realizations. I show that irreversible stress drops can occur if the density gradients diverge. I then derive a balance relation for the coarse-grained instantaneous stress tensor with arbitrary regularization scale $\ell$. From the latter, I obtain an expression for the local inter-scale stress flux in terms of moments of the density increments. By assuming that the density field is Besov regular, I determine the scaling of the stress flux with $\ell$. From this scaling, I show that distributional solutions of the noiseless Dean (NDE) equation can sustain stress dissipation due to a non-equilibrium inter-scale stress flux if the scaling exponents of the density structure functions are below a critical threshold. The athermal limit of fine-grained and coarse-grained descriptions must describe the same phenomenology, \textit{i.e.} the existence of stress dissipation must be independent of any regularization of the dynamics. Using this principle, I analyze the limit $\ell\rightarrow 0$ and argue that flow realizations of athermal disordered systems correspond to ultraviolet fixed-point solutions of the coarse-grained NDE equations with sufficiently low Besov regularity.</description>

      <title>Mixed Berndt-Type Integrals and Generalized Barnes Multiple Zeta Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we define and study four families of Berndt-type integrals, called mixed Berndt-type integrals, which contains (hyperbolic) sine and cosine functions in the integrand function. By contour integration, these integrals are first converted to some hyperbolic (infinite) sums of Ramanujan type, all of which can be calculated in closed forms by comparing both the Fourier series expansions and the Maclaurin series expansions of a few Jacobi elliptic functions. These sums can be expressed as rational polynomials of {\Gamma}(1/4) and {\pi}^{-1} which give rise to the closed formulas of the mixed Berndt-type integrals we are interested in. Moreover, we also present some interesting consequences and illustrative examples. Further, we define a generalized Barnes multiple zeta function, and find a classic integral representation of the generalized Barnes multiple zeta function. Furthermore, we give an alternative evaluation of the mixed Berndt-type integrals in terms of the generalized Barnes multiple zeta function. Finally, we obtain some direct evaluations of rational linear combinations of the generalized Barnes multiple zeta function.</description>

      <title>Numerical and graphical exploration of the generalized beta-logarithmic matrix function and its properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the generalized beta-logarithmic matrix function (GBLMF),which combines the extended beta matrix function and the logarithmic mean. The study establishes essential properties of this function, including functional relations, inequalities, finite and infinite sums, integral representations, and partial derivative formulas. Theoretical results are accompanied by numerical examples and graphical representations to demonstrate the behavior of the new matrix function. Additionally, a comparison with classical and previously studied beta matrix functions is presented to highlight the differences and advantages of the generalized version. The findings offer valuable insights into the properties and applications of the extended beta-logarithmic matrix function in various mathematical and applied contexts.</description>

      <title>Ontological models cannot adequately represent state update for sequential measurement of incompatible observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ontological models (as used in the generalized contextuality literature) play a central role in current research on quantum foundations, serving as a framework for defining classicality, constructing classical analogues of key quantum phenomena, and even examining the ontology of quantum states. In this work, we analyse the quantum state update rule in these models and argue that incompatibility -- or, equivalently, order-dependent theoretical predictions of sequential measurements -- is sufficient to stop them from being able to adequately represent a scenario. This is because, as we argue, the quantum state update rule requires ontological models to update their states according to conditional probability, which in turn renders predictions of sequential measurements order-independent. This implies that ontological models, even contextual ones, must either act differently to what we would expect given the quantum state update rule, or cannot model quantum behaviour. Building on this, we argue that classical wave theory is equally incompatible with ontological models, challenging the notion that generalized contextuality serves as a signature of classicality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The master equation of the Proca field in the Schwarzschild spacetime is studied by using the Seiberg-Witten/quasinormal modes duality. We establish the dictionary between the parameters in gauge and gravity theories, since both sides lead to Heun-type equations. Applying the technique of instanton counting, we analytically find the eigenfrequencies of the quasinormal modes and quasi-bound states for massive vector fields around black holes, with the boundary conditions linked by the connection formula. The results show consistency with known numerical researches in the literature.</description>

      <title>Spin-$s$ $Q$-systems: Twist and Open Boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In integrable spin chains, the spectral problem can be solved by the method of Bethe ansatz, which transforms the problem of diagonalization of the Hamiltonian into the problem of solving a set of algebraic equations named Bethe equations. In this work, we systematically investigate the spin-$s$ XXX chain with twisted and open boundary conditions using the rational $Q$-system, which is a powerful tool to solve Bethe equations. We establish basic frameworks of the rational $Q$-system and confirm its completeness numerically in both cases. For twisted boundaries, we investigate the polynomiality conditions of the rational $Q$-system and derive physical conditions for singular solutions of Bethe equations. For open boundaries, we uncover novel phenomena such as hidden symmetries and magnetic strings under specific boundary parameters. Hidden symmetries lead to the appearance of extra degeneracies in the Hilbert space, while the magnetic string is a novel type of exact string configuration, whose length depends on the boundary magnetic fields. These findings, supported by both analytical and numerical evidences, offer new insights into the interplay between symmetries and boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Embedding integrable spin models in solvable vertex models on the square lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02377v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exploring a mapping among $n$-state spin and vertex models on the square lattice we argue that a given integrable spin model with edge weights satisfying the rapidity difference property can be formulated in the framework of an equivalent solvable vertex model. The Lax operator and the $\mathrm{R}$-matrix associated to the vertex model are built in terms of the edge weights of the spin model and these operators are shown to satisfy the Yang-Baxter algebra. The unitarity of the $\mathrm{R}$-matrix follows from an assumption that the vertical edge weights of the spin model satisfy certain local identity known as inversion relation. We apply this embedding to the scalar $n$-state Potts model and we argue that the corresponding $\mathrm{R}$-matrix can be written in terms of the underlying Temperley-Lieb operators. We also consider our construction for the integrable Ashkin-Teller model and the respective $\mathrm{R}$-matrix is expressed in terms of sixteen distinct weights parametrized by theta functions. We comment on the possible extention of our results to spin models whose edge weights are not expressible in terms of the difference of spectral parameters.</description>

      <title>Clustering theorem in 1D long-range interacting systems at arbitrary temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11431v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper delves into a fundamental aspect of quantum statistical mechanics -- the absence of thermal phase transitions in one-dimensional (1D) systems. Originating from Ising's analysis of the 1D spin chain, this concept has been pivotal in understanding 1D quantum phases, especially those with finite-range interactions as extended by Araki. In this work, we focus on quantum long-range interactions and successfully derive a clustering theorem applicable to a wide range of interaction decays at arbitrary temperatures. This theorem applies to any interaction forms that decay faster than $r^{-2}$ and does not rely on translation invariance or infinite system size assumptions. Also, we rigorously established that the temperature dependence of the correlation length is given by $e^{{\rm const.} \beta}$, which is the same as the classical cases. Our findings indicate the absence of phase transitions in 1D systems with super-polynomially decaying interactions, thereby expanding upon previous theoretical research. To overcome significant technical challenges originating from the divergence of the imaginary-time Lieb-Robinson bound, we utilize the quantum belief propagation to refine the cluster expansion method. This approach allowed us to address divergence issues effectively and contributed to a deeper understanding of low-temperature behaviors in 1D quantum systems.</description>

Abstract: The transfer of information from one part of a quantum system to another is fundamental to the understanding and design of quantum information processing devices. In the realm of discrete systems, such as spin chains, inhomogeneous networks have been engineered that allow for the perfect transfer of qubits from one end to the other. Here, by contrast, we investigate perfect transfer of information in continuous systems, phrased in terms of wave propagation. A remarkable difference is found between systems that possess conformal invariance and those that do not. Systems in the first class enjoy perfect wave transfer (PWT), explicitly shown for one-particle excitations and expected in general. In the second class, those that exhibit PWT are characterized as solutions to an inverse spectral problem. As a concrete example, we demonstrate how to formulate and solve this problem for a prototypical class of bosonic theories, showing the importance of conformal invariance for these theories to enjoy PWT. Using bosonization, our continuum results extend to theories with interactions, broadening the scope of perfect information transfer to more general quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Superspace invariants and correlators in 4d $\mathcal{N}=1$ superconformal field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01903v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using polarization spinor methods in conjunction with the superspace formalism, we construct 3-point superconformal invariants that are used to determine the form of 3-point correlators of spinning superfield operators in $\mathcal{N}=1$ superconformal field theories (SCFTs) in 4-dimensions. We enumerate the structural form of various spinning 3-point correlators using these invariants and find additional constraints on their form when the operators are conserved supercurrents. For these purposes, we first construct the invariants and 3-point correlators in non-supersymmetric $4d$ CFTs which are then extended using superspace methods to $4d$ SCFTs.</description>

      <title>Noncommutative Gelfand Duality: the algebraic case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11816v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to define a notion of non-commutative Gelfand duality. Using techniques from derived algebraic geometry, we show that the category of rings is anti-equivalent to a subcategory of pre-ringed sites, inspired by Grothendieck's work on commutative rings. Our notion of spectrum, although formally reminiscent of the Grothendieck spectrum, is new. Remarkably, an appropriately refined relative version of our spectrum agrees with the Grothendieck spectrum for finitely generated commutative algebras over the complex numbers, among others. This work aims to represent the starting point for a rigorous study of geometric properties of quantum spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Localized past stability of the subcritical Kasner-scalar field spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09210v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the nonlinear stability, in the contracting direction, of the entire subcritical family of Kasner-scalar field solutions to the Einstein-scalar field equations in four spacetime dimensions. Our proof relies on a zero-shift, orthonormal frame decomposition of a conformal representation of the Einstein-scalar field equations. To synchronise the big bang singularity, we use the time coordinate $\tau = \exp\bigl(\frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}\phi\bigr)$, where $\phi$ is the scalar field, which coincides with a conformal harmonic time slicing. We show that the perturbed solutions are asymptotically pointwise Kasner, geodesically incomplete to the past and terminate at quiescent, crushing big bang singularities located at $\tau=0$, which are characterised by curvature blow up. Specifically, we establish two stability theorems. The first is a global in-space stability result where the perturbed spacetimes are of the form $M =\bigcup_{t\in (0,t_0]} \tau^{-1}(\{t\}) \cong (0,t_0] \times \mathbb{T}^{3}$. The second is a localised version where the perturbed spacetimes are given by $M=\bigcup_{t\in (0,t_0]}\tau^{-1}(\{t\})\cong \bigcup_{t\in (0,t_0]} \{t\}\times\mathbb{B}_{\rho(t)}$ with time-dependent radius function $\rho(t)=\rho_0+(1-\vartheta)\rho_0\bigl(\bigl(\frac{t}{t_0}\bigr)^{1-\epsilon}-1\bigr)$. Spatial localisation is achieved through our choice of zero-shift, harmonic time slicing that leads to hyperbolic evolution equations with a finite propagation speed.</description>
