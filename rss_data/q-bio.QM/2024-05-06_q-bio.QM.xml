      <title>SCIMAP: A Python Toolkit for Integrated Spatial Analysis of Multiplexed Imaging Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiplexed imaging data are revolutionizing our understanding of the composition and organization of tissues and tumors. A critical aspect of such tissue profiling is quantifying the spatial relationship relationships among cells at different scales from the interaction of neighboring cells to recurrent communities of cells of multiple types. This often involves statistical analysis of 10^7 or more cells in which up to 100 biomolecules (commonly proteins) have been measured. While software tools currently cater to the analysis of spatial transcriptomics data, there remains a need for toolkits explicitly tailored to the complexities of multiplexed imaging data including the need to seamlessly integrate image visualization with data analysis and exploration. We introduce SCIMAP, a Python package specifically crafted to address these challenges. With SCIMAP, users can efficiently preprocess, analyze, and visualize large datasets, facilitating the exploration of spatial relationships and their statistical significance. SCIMAP's modular design enables the integration of new algorithms, enhancing its capabilities for spatial analysis.</description>

      <title>Multi-grid reaction-diffusion master equation: applications to morphogen gradient modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The multi-grid reaction-diffusion master equation (mgRDME) provides a generalization of stochastic compartment-based reaction-diffusion modelling described by the standard reaction-diffusion master equation (RDME). By enabling different resolutions on lattices for biochemical species with different diffusion constants, the mgRDME approach improves both accuracy and efficiency of compartment-based reaction-diffusion simulations. The mgRDME framework is examined through its application to morphogen gradient formation in stochastic reaction-diffusion scenarios, using both an analytically tractable first-order reaction network and a model with a second-order reaction. The results obtained by the mgRDME modelling are compared with the standard RDME model and with the (more detailed) particle-based Brownian dynamics simulations. The dependence of error and numerical cost on the compartment sizes is defined and investigated through a multi-objective optimization problem.</description>

      <title>bio2Byte Tools deployment as a Python package and Galaxy tool to predict protein biophysical properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a unified Python package for the prediction of protein biophysical properties, streamlining previous tools developed by the Bio2Byte research group. This suite facilitates comprehensive assessments of protein characteristics, incorporating predictors for backbone and sidechain dynamics, local secondary structure propensities, early folding, long disorder, beta-sheet aggregation and FUS-like phase separation. Our package significantly eases the integration and execution of these tools, enhancing accessibility for both computational and experimental researchers.</description>

      <title>Multitask Extension of Geometrically Aligned Transfer Encoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular datasets often suffer from a lack of data. It is well-known that gathering data is difficult due to the complexity of experimentation or simulation involved. Here, we leverage mutual information across different tasks in molecular data to address this issue. We extend an algorithm that utilizes the geometric characteristics of the encoding space, known as the Geometrically Aligned Transfer Encoder (GATE), to a multi-task setup. Thus, we connect multiple molecular tasks by aligning the curved coordinates onto locally flat coordinates, ensuring the flow of information from source tasks to support performance on target data.</description>

      <title>Parameter estimation in ODEs: assessing the potential of local and global solvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of parameter estimation in dynamic systems described by ordinary differential equations. A review of the existing literature emphasizes the need for deterministic global optimization methods due to the nonconvex nature of these problems. Recent works have focused on expanding the capabilities of specialized deterministic global optimization algorithms to handle more complex problems. Despite advancements, current deterministic methods are limited to problems with a maximum of around five state and five decision variables, prompting ongoing efforts to enhance their applicability to practical problems.
  Our study seeks to assess the effectiveness of state-of-the-art general-purpose global and local solvers in handling realistic-sized problems efficiently, and evaluating their capabilities to cope with the nonconvex nature of the underlying estimation problems.</description>

      <title>nach0: Multimodal Natural and Chemical Languages Foundation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12410v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have substantially driven scientific progress in various domains, and many papers have demonstrated their ability to tackle complex problems with creative solutions. Our paper introduces a new foundation model, nach0, capable of solving various chemical and biological tasks: biomedical question answering, named entity recognition, molecular generation, molecular synthesis, attributes prediction, and others. nach0 is a multi-domain and multi-task encoder-decoder LLM pre-trained on unlabeled text from scientific literature, patents, and molecule strings to incorporate a range of chemical and linguistic knowledge. We employed instruction tuning, where specific task-related instructions are utilized to fine-tune nach0 for the final set of tasks. To train nach0 effectively, we leverage the NeMo framework, enabling efficient parallel optimization of both base and large model versions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on single-domain and cross-domain tasks. Furthermore, it can generate high-quality outputs in molecular and textual formats, showcasing its effectiveness in multi-domain setups.</description>

      <title>A Simple Comparison of Biochemical Systems Theory and Metabolic Control Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00810v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper explores some basic concepts of Biochemical Systems Theory (BST) and Metabolic Control Analysis (MCA), two frameworks developed to understand the behavior of biochemical networks. Initially introduced by Savageau, BST focuses on system stability and employs power laws in modeling biochemical systems. On the other hand, MCA, pioneered by authors such as Kacser and Burns and Heinrich and Rapoport, emphasizes linearization of the governing equations and describes relationships (known as theorems) between different measures. Despite apparent differences, both frameworks are shown to be equivalent in many respects. Through a simple example of a linear chain, the paper demonstrates how BST and MCA yield identical results when analyzing steady-state behavior and logarithmic gains within biochemical pathways. This comparative analysis highlights the interchangeability of concepts such as kinetic orders, elasticities and other logarithmic gains.</description>
