      <title>AI Diffusion to Low-Middle Income Countries; A Blessing or a Curse?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20399v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rapid advancements in AI have sparked significant research into its impacts on productivity and labor, which can be profoundly positive or negative. Often overlooked in this debate is understanding of how AI technologies spread across and within economies. Equally ignored are developing economies facing substantial labor market impacts from rapid, and a loss in competitiveness, from slow AI diffusion. This paper reviews literature on technology diffusion and proposes a three-way framework for understanding AI diffusion: global value chains, research collaboration, and inter-firm knowledge transfers. This is used to measure AI diffusion in sixteen low-middle-income, and four developed economies, as well as to evaluate dependence on China and the USA for access to AI technologies. The study finds a significant gap in diffusion rates between the two groups, but current trends indicate it is narrowing. China is identified as a crucial future source of AI diffusion through value chains, while the USA is more influential in research and knowledge transfers. The paper's limitations include the omission of additional data sources and countries, and the lack of investigation into the relationship between diffusion and technology intensity. Nonetheless, it raises salient macro-level questions about AI diffusion and suggests emphasis on redistribution mechanisms of AI induced economic gains, and bilateral agreements as a complement to international accords, to address diverse needs and corresponding risks faced by economies transitioning into an AI-dominated era. Additionally, it highlights the need for research into the links between AI diffusion, technology intensity, and productivity; case studies combined with targeted policy recommendations; more accurate methods for measuring AI diffusion; and a deeper investigation into its labor market impacts particular to LMICs.</description>

      <title>Divide and Diverge: Polarization Incentives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study polarization in a probabilistic voting model with aggregate shocks and a decreasing marginal utility from office rents. In equilibrium, parties offer different policies, despite being rent-motivated and ex-ante identical from the point of view of voters. When candidates compete on a single policy issue, parties' equilibrium payoffs increase in voter polarization, even when the change is driven by the supporters of the opposite party becoming more extreme. With multiple policy issues, parties benefit if the society is split into two factions and the ideological cohesion within such factions increases. We connect our results to empirical evidence on polarizing political communication, party identity, and zero-sum thinking, and find that polarization could be reduced by intervening on the electoral rule.</description>

      <title>Tracking the Credibility Revolution across Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20604v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper updates Currie, Kleven, and Zwiers (2020) by examining the credibility revolution across fields, including finance and macroeconomics, using NBER working papers up to May 2024. While the growth in terms related to identification and research designs have continued, finance and macroeconomics have lagged behind applied micro. Difference-in-differences and regression discontinuity designs have risen since 2002, but the growth in difference-in-difference has been larger, more persistent, and more ubiquitous. In contrast, instrumental variables have stayed flat over this period. Finance and macro, particularly corporate finance, has experienced significant growth in mentions of experimental and quasi-experimental methods and identification over this time period, but a large component of the credibility revolution in finance is due to difference-in-differences. Bartik and shift-share instruments have grown across all fields, with the most pronounced growth in international trade and investment, economic history, and labor studies. Synthetic control has not seen continued growth, and has fallen since 2020.</description>

      <title>Inflation Determinants in Argentina (2004-2022)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper analyzes the empirical relationship between the inflation rate and its proximate determinants in Argentina, using quarterly data over the period 2004-2022 and an error-correction vector model approach. Unlike previous literature, this paper uses a theoretical framework to motivate the inclusion of variables that are expected to contribute to explain inflation, thus reducing the risk of omitting relevant variables and formalizing key mechanisms. Inference is performed through Granger causality analysis, impulse response functions and forecast errors variance decomposition. The results suggest that an anti-inflationary plan for Argentina should take into consideration both the greater relevance of the inertial component, the exchange rate and the interest rate in the short-run dynamics of the price level, and the long-run relationship between prices, interest rate and activity level.</description>

      <title>A Branch-Price-Cut-And-Switch Approach for Optimizing Team Formation and Routing for Airport Baggage Handling Tasks with Stochastic Travel Times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In airport operations, optimally using dedicated personnel for baggage handling tasks plays a crucial role in the design of resource-efficient processes. Teams of workers with different qualifications must be formed, and loading or unloading tasks must be assigned to them. Each task has a time window within which it can be started and should be finished. Violating these temporal restrictions incurs severe financial penalties for the operator. In practice, various components of this process are subject to uncertainties. We consider the aforementioned problem under the assumption of stochastic travel times across the apron. We present two binary program formulations to model the problem at hand and solve it with a Branch-Price-Cut-and-Switch approach, in which we dynamically switch between two master problem formulations. Furthermore, we use an exact separation method to identify violated rank-1 Chv\'atal-Gomory cuts and utilize an efficient branching rule relying on task finish times. We test the algorithm on instances generated based on real-world data from a major European hub airport with a planning horizon of up to two hours, 30 flights per hour, and three available task execution modes to choose from. Our results indicate that our algorithm is able to significantly outperform existing solution approaches. Moreover, an explicit consideration of stochastic travel times allows for solutions that utilize the available workforce more efficiently, while simultaneously guaranteeing a stable service level for the baggage handling operator.</description>

      <title>Sources of capital growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.03403v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data from national accounts show no effect of change in net saving or consumption, in ratio to market-value capital, on change in growth rate of market-value capital (capital acceleration). Thus it appears that capital growth and acceleration arrive without help from net saving or consumption restraint. We explore ways in which this is possible, and discuss implications for economic teaching and public policy</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13869v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Net profit is sometimes found from data for net operating surplus. We propose a way to find it from data for consumption, pay and market-value capital, and concomitantly to reveal the factor shares in consumption.</description>
