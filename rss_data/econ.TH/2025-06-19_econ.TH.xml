      <title>Upstream competition and exclusive content provision in media markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With a multilateral vertical contracting model of media markets, we examine upstream competition and contractual arrangements in content provision. We analyze the trade of content by the Nash bargaining solution and the downstream competition by the Hotelling location model. We characterize the equilibrium outcomes and the contractual arrangements for various vertical structures. We show that the possibility of exclusive contracts rises when the value of the premium content increases, the degree of horizontal differentiation in the downstream market decreases, the importance of advertising revenue decreases, and the relative bargaining power of upstream firm decreases.</description>

      <title>Efficient reallocation of indivisible resources: Pair-efficiency versus Pareto-efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the object reallocation problem, achieving Pareto-efficiency is desirable, but may be too demanding for implementation purposes. In contrast, pair-efficiency, which is the minimal efficiency requirement, is more suitable. Despite being a significant relaxation, however, pair-efficiency ensures Pareto-efficiency for any strategy-proof and individually rational rule when agents' preferences are unrestricted.
  What if agents' preferences have specific restricted structures, such as single-peakedness or single-dippedness? We often encounter such situations in real-world scenarios. This study aims to investigate whether pair-efficiency is sufficient to ensure Pareto-efficiency in such cases.
  Our main contribution in this paper is establishing the equivalence between pair-efficiency and Pareto-efficiency when dealing with single-peaked or single-dipped preference profiles. This equivalence holds without needing to assume any other properties of the rule. We further show that both the single-peaked domain and the single-dipped domain are the "maximal" domains where this equivalence holds.</description>

      <title>Binary Self-Selective Voting Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel binary stability property for voting rules-called binary self-selectivity-by which a society considering whether to replace its voting rule using itself in pairwise elections will choose not to do so. In Theorem 1, we show that a neutral voting rule is binary self-selective if and only if it is universally self-selective. We then use this equivalence to show, in Corollary 1, that under the unrestricted strict preference domain, a unanimous and neutral voting rule is binary self-selective if and only if it is dictatorial. In Theorem 2 and Corollary 2, we show that whenever there is a strong Condorcet winner; a unanimous, neutral and anonymous voting rule is binary self-selective (or universally self-selective) if and only if it is the Condorcet voting rule.</description>

      <title>Self-Equivalent Voting Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, I introduce a novel stability axiom for stochastic voting rules, called self-equivalence, by which a society considering whether to replace its voting rule using itself will choose not do so. I then show that under the unrestricted strict preference domain, a voting rule satisfying the democratic principles of anonymity, optimality, monotonicity, and neutrality is self-equivalent if and only if it assigns to every voter equal probability of being a dictator (i.e., uniform random dictatorship). Thus, any society that desires stability and adheres to the aforementioned democratic principles is bound to either employ the uniform random dictatorship or decide whether to change its voting rule using a voting rule other than itself.</description>

      <title>Minimal Stable Voting Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, I characterize minimal stable voting rules and minimal self-stable constitutions (i.e., pairs of voting rules) for societies in which only power matters. To do so, I first let players' preference profiles over voting rules satisfy four natural axioms commonly used in the analysis of power: non-dominance, anonymity, null player and swing player. I then provide simple notions of minimal stability and minimal self-stability, and show that the families of minimal stable voting rules and minimal self-stable constitutions are fairly small. Finally, I conclude that political parties have evolved to ensure the minimal self-stability of otherwise not minimal self-stable constitutions.</description>

      <title>Coarse Information Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.18020v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study an information design problem with continuous state and discrete signal space. Under convex and S-shaped value functions, the optimal information structure is interval-partitional and exhibits a dual expectations property: each induced signal is the conditional mean (taken under the prior density) of each interval; and each interval cutoff is the barycenter (taken under the value function curvature) of the interval formed by neighboring signals. This property enables an examination into which part of the state space is more finely partitioned. The analysis can be extended to general value functions and adapted to study coarse mechanism design.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Domar aggregation over transforming production networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18137v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An economy-wide production network, as a form of monetary input--output coefficients, becomes unstable during the general equilibrium propagation of sectoral productivity shocks, when the substitution elasticities of sectoral production are nonneutral. The associated network transformation hence leads to nonlinearity in aggregating sectoral productivity shocks into the economy's output, i.e., in Domar aggregation. In this study, we demonstrate the possibility of production networks being transformed into a singular one. We also explore the conditions under which productivity shocks are synergistic in Domar aggregation.</description>
