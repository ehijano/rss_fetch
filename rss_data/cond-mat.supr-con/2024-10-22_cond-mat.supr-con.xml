      <title>Comment on "The Law of Entropy Increase and the Meissner Effect" by A. Nikulov</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Entropy 24, 83 (2022) [1], titled "The Law of Entropy Increase and the Meissner Effect", A. Nikulov claims that the Meissner effect exhibited by type I superconductors violates the second law of thermodynamics. Contrary to this claim, I show that the Meissner effect is consistent with the second law of thermodynamics provided that a mechanism exists for the supercurrent to start and stop without generation of Joule heat. The theory of hole superconductivity provides such a mechanism, the conventional theory of superconductivity does not. It requires the existence of hole carriers in the normal state of the system.</description>

      <title>A problem with the conservation law observed in macroscopic quantum phenomena is a consequence of violation of the correspondence principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article draws attention that the puzzle of the change of the angular momentum without any force is a consequence of the contradiction of macroscopic quantum phenomena with the correspondence principle, which reveals a fundamental difference between microscopic quantum phenomena, described by the Schrodinger wave mechanics, and macroscopic quantum phenomena, described by the theory of superconductivity and the theory of superfluidity. To explain why macroscopic quantum phenomena are observed despite the correspondence principle, Lev Landau postulated in 1941 that microscopic particles in superfluid helium and superconductor cannot move separately. The angular momentum can change without any force only due to quantization in both microscopic and macroscopic quantum phenomena. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle eliminates the contradiction with the conservation law in the first case, since according to the correspondence principle, the change in angular momentum cannot exceed the Planck constant. But this principle cannot eliminate the contradiction with the conservation law the macroscopic change of angular momentum due to quantization observed in superconductors contrary to the correspondence principle. Quantization can change not only the angular momentum, but also the kinetic energy of a superconducting condensate on a macroscopic amount. For this reason, the Meissner effect and other macroscopic quantum phenomena contradict the second law of thermodynamics. The reluctance of physicists to admit the violation of the second law of thermodynamics provoked a false understanding of the phenomenon of superconductivity and obvious contradictions in books on superconductivity.</description>

      <title>A new approach to N-doped di-molybdenum carbide with enhanced superconductivity via Urea</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chemical doping is a critical factor in the development of new superconductors or optimizing the superconducting transition temperature (Tc) of the parent superconducting materials. Herein, a new simple urea approach is developed to synthesize the N-doped alfa-Mo2C. Benefiting from the simple urea method, a broad superconducting dome is found in the Mo2C1-xNx compositions. XRD results show that the structure of alfa-Mo2C remains unchanged and that there is a variation of lattice parameters with nitrogen doping. Resistivity, magnetic susceptibility, and heat capacity measurement results confirm that the superconducting transition temperature (Tc) was strongly increased from 2.68 K (x = 0) to 7.05 K (x = 0.49). First-principles calculations and our analysis indicate that increasing nitrogen doping leads to a rise in the density of states at the Fermi level and doping-induced phonon softening, which enhances electron-phonon coupling. This results in an increase in Tc and a sharp rise in the upper critical field. Our findings provide a promising strategy for fabricating transition metal carbonitrides and provide a material platform for further study of the superconductivity of transition metal carbides.</description>

      <title>Intertwined charge and spin density wave state of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15649v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Research on nickel-based superconductors has progressed from infinite-layer LaNiO$_2$ to finite-layer La$_{6}$Ni$_{5}$O$_{12}$, and most recently to the Ruddlesden-Popper-phase La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ discovered under pressure $\sim$16\,GPa, the system exhibits the onset of superconductivity at approximately $\sim$80\,K. Unlike the $d$-wave superconductivity driven by the nearly half-filled $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals in finite- and infinite-layers nickelates, the Ni-$d_{z^2}$ and O-2$p$ orbitals contribute significantly to the low energy states and potentially to the superconducting electron pairing mechanism. Employing density functional calculations and multi-orbital multi-atom Ni$_2$O$_9$ cluster exact diagonalization including local exchange and coulomb interactions, we delve into the pressure dependent electronic structure of the Ni$_2$O$_9$ cluster. We find that several possible charge and spin ordering states are nearly degenerate at ambient pressure but become strongly mixed leading to a more homogeneous phase at high pressure. The various possible spin states and the exchange and superexchange mechanisms are quantified via the involvement of the Ni-$3d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbitals, the apical bridging O $2p_z$ orbitals, and the orbitals involved in the formation of local Zhang-Rice singlet like states. We note that the energy difference between the charge (CDW)/spin (SDW) density wave states and the uniform high pressure phase is about 10 meV in concordance with phase transition temperatures found experimentally at ambient pressure.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic electromagnetic damping in superconductor-ferromagnet proximity heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of the response of superconducting hybrid structures with magnetic materials to microwave irradiation is necessary for the development of effective superconducting spintronic devices. The role of the magnetic proximity effect (direct and inverse) on the electrical properties of hybrid structures is a pressing issue for its application. We theoretically study the electromagnetic impedance of a thin superconducting (S) film covering a ferromagnetic insulator (FI). An intrinsic damping of microwave irradiation is predicted because of the inverse proximity effect. The system of Usadel equations is solved numerically and self-consistently in the Nambu-Keldysh formalism with boundary conditions for strong spin polarization of the insulator. Based on the calculated Green's function, the features of the bilayer complex conductivity and impedance as a function of the field frequency have been discovered. It is shown how the ferromagnetic proximity effect leads to irremovable damping in the electromagnetic response of such heterostructures. The mechanism related to the formation of triplet Cooper pairs in an S layer at proximity of the FI interface is analyzed. Even gapless superconductivity has been found in a thin S film similar to a magnetic superconductor. The resulting intrinsic damping must be taken into account when designing superconducting devices for microwave applications.</description>

      <title>Non-local detection of coherent Yu-Shiba-Rusinov quantum projections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Probing spatially confined quantum states from afar - a long-sought goal to minimize external interference - has been proposed to be achievable in condensed matter systems via coherent projection. The latter can be tailored by sculpturing the eigenstates of the electron sea that surrounds the quantum state using atom-by-atom built cages, so-called quantum corrals. However, assuring the coherent nature of the projection, and manipulating its quantum composition, has remained an elusive goal. Here, we experimentally realize the coherent projection of a magnetic impurity-induced, Yu-Shiba-Rusinov quantum state using the eigenmodes of corrals on the surface of a superconductor, which enables us to manipulate the particle-hole composition of the projected state by tuning corral eigenmodes through the Fermi energy. Our results demonstrate a controlled non-local method for the detection of magnet superconductor hybrid quantum states.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in PrNiO2 infinite-layer nickelates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several reports about infinite-layer nickelate thin films suggest that the superconducting critical temperature versus chemical doping phase diagram has a dome-like shape, similar to cuprates. Here, we demonstrate a highly reproducible superconducting state in undoped PrNiO$_2$ thin films grown onto SrTiO$_3$. Scanning transmission electron microscopy measurements demonstrate coherent and defect-free infinite-layer phase, a high structural quality with no unintentional chemical doping and a total absence of interstitial oxygen. X-ray absorption measurements show very sharp features at the Ni L$_{3,2}$-edges with a large linear dichroism, indicating the preferential hole-occupation of Ni$^{1+}$-3d$_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals in a square planar geometry. Resonant inelastic X-ray scattering measurements reveal sharp magnon excitations of 200\,meV energy at magnetic Brillouin zone boundary, highly resonant at the Ni$^{1+}$ absorption peak. The results indicate that, when properly stabilized, infinite-layer nickelate thin films are superconducting without chemical doping.</description>

      <title>Transport properties and quantum phase transitions in one-dimensional superconductor-ferromagnetic insulator heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically propose a one-dimensional electronic nanodevice inspired in recently fabricated semiconductor-superconductor-ferromagnetic insulator (SE-SC-FMI) hybrid heterostructures, and investigate its zero-temperature transport properties. While previous related studies have primarily focused on the potential for generating topological superconductors hosting Majorana fermions, we propose an alternative application: using these hybrids to explore controllable quantum phase transitions (QPTs) detectable through transport measurements. Our study highlights two key differences from existing devices: first, the length of the FMI layer is shorter than that of the SE-SC heterostructure, introducing an inhomogeneous Zeeman interaction with significant effects on the induced Andreev bound states (ABS). Second, we focus on semiconductor nanowires with minimal or no Rashba spin-orbit interaction, allowing for the induction of spin-polarized ABS and high-spin quantum ground states. We show that the device can be tuned across spin- and fermion parity-changing QPTs by adjusting the FMI layer length orange and/or by applying a global backgate voltage, with zero-energy crossings of subgap ABS as signatures of these transitions. Our findings suggest that these effects are experimentally accessible and offer a robust platform for studying quantum phase transitions in hybrid nanowires.</description>

      <title>Electronic and magnetic properties of LaCu$_{x}$Sb$_{2}$ tuned by Cu occupancy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report thermodynamic and transport properties of LaCu$_{x}$Sb$_{2}$ ($0.92 \leq x \leq 1.12$), synthesized by controlling the initial loading composition and investigated by magnetization, electrical resistivity, and specific heat measurements. The physical properties of this system are highly dependent on Cu-site occupancy $x$, where residual resistivity ratio (RRR), magnetoresistance (MR), superconducting transition temperature ($T_{c}$), and electronic specific heat coefficient ($\gamma$) indicate a systematic variation as a function of $x$. The Shubnikov-de Haas quantum oscillations are observed in magnetoresistance measurements for samples close to the Cu stoichiometry $x \sim 1$, while the de Haas-van Alphen oscillations are detected in a wide range of $x$ ($0.92 \leq x \le 1.12$). For $H \parallel c$, the oscillation frequency indicates a clear $x$-dependence, implying a systematic change of Fermi surface. DFT calculations for the sample closest to ideal Cu stoichiometry reveal electronic structures with a common feature of the square-net-based semimetals, which is in good agreement with the experimental observations. The magnetic response of LaCu$_{x}$Sb$_{2}$ to magnetic fields is anisotropic owing to the Fermi surface anisotropy. Our results show how the physical properties are influenced by the Cu-site occupancy $x$, linked to the electronic bands arising from the Sb square net.</description>

      <title>Facile synthesis of palladium hydride via ionic gate-driven protonation using a deep eutectic solvent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Developing novel protocols for hydrogen (H) loading is crucial for furthering the investigation of hydrides as potential high-temperature superconductors at lower pressures compared to recent discoveries. Ionic gating-induced protonation (IGP) has emerged as a promising technique for H loading due to its inherent simplicity, but it can be limited in the maximum density of injected H when ionic liquids are used as a gating medium. Here, we demonstrate that large H concentrations can be successfully injected in both palladium (Pd) bulk foils and thin films (up to a stoichiometry PdH$_{0.89}$) by using a choline chloride-glycerol deep eutectic solvent (DES) as gate electrolyte and applying gate voltages in excess of the cathodic stability limit. The attained H concentrations are large enough to induce superconductivity in Pd, albeit with an incomplete resistive transition which suggests a strongly inhomogeneous H incorporation in the Pd matrix. This DES-based IGP protocol can be used as a guideline for maximizing H loading in different materials, although specific details of the applied voltage profile might require adjustments based on the material under investigation.</description>

      <title>Visualization of Skyrmion-Superconducting Vortex Pairs in a Chiral-Magnet-Superconductor Heterostructure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.13363v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions, the topological states possessing chiral magnetic structure with nontrivial topology, have been widely investigated as a promising candidate for spintronic devices. They can also couple with superconducting vortices to form skyrmion-vortex pairs, hosting Majorana zero mode, which is a potential candidate for topological quantum computing. Many theoretical proposals have been put forward on constructing skyrmion-vortex pairs in heterostructures of chiral magnets and superconductors. Nevertheless, how to generate skyrmion-vortex pairs in a controllable way experimentally remains a significant challenge. We have designed a heterostructure of a chiral magnet and superconductor [Ta/Ir/CoFeB/MgO]7/Nb in which zero field N\'eel-type skyrmions can be stabilized and the superconducting vortices can couple with the skyrmions when Nb is in the superconducting state. We have directly observed the formation of skyrmion-superconducting vortex pairs that is dependent on the direction of the applied magnetic field. Our results provide an effective method to manipulate the quantum states of skyrmions with the help of superconducting vortices, which can be used to explore new routines to control the skyrmions for spintronics devices.</description>

      <title>Josephson Diode Effect in Topological Superconductor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.09009v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the Josephson diode effect (JDE) in topological Josephson junctions. By both analytic and numerical calculations, we find that while a Josephson junction in the topological phase may exhibit higher diode efficiency compared to that in the trivial phase, this behavior is not universal. The presence of Majorana bound states is not a sufficient condition for a large diode effect. Furthermore, the diode efficiency undergoes substantial changes only in specific regions along the topological phase transition boundary, and a significant diode effect does coincide with the topological phases. Thereby our paper suggests the utilization of topological superconductivity for enhanced JDE, and also the Josephson diode effect may serve as an indicator for topological superconductor phase. These results suggest a nuanced relationship between the topological aspects of Josephson junctions and Josephson diode effect.</description>

      <title>Quasiparticle scattering interference in cuprate superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07122v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quasiparticle scattering interference (QSI) is intimately related to the nature of the quasiparticle and of its interplay with a variety of electronic orders and superconductivity. Here starting from the microscopic octet scattering model, the nature of QSI in cuprate superconductors is studied in the $T$-matrix approach. In particular, a new method of the inversion of matrix is developed to accurately derive the $T$-matrix for various kinds of impurities, and then the obtained $T$-matrix is employed to calculate the local density of states (LDOS). It is shown that the overall features of the LDOS modulation can be described qualitatively by taking into account the quasiparticle scattering from a single impurity on the kinetic-energy-driven homogeneous superconducting-state, where the QSI scattering wave vectors ${\bf q}_{i}$ and the related QSI peak dispersions are internally consistent within the octet scattering model. However, the pronounced QSI peaks in the momentum-space LDOS modulation pattern for a single impurity are smeared heavily in the case for multiple impurities, and then the momentum-space LDOS modulation for multiple impurities exhibits a speckle pattern. Moreover, the momentum-space LDOS modulation for Gaussian-random-distribution of on-site impurity at a relatively large deviation displays a similar behavior of the LDOS modulation for multiple impurities. The theory also indicates that the impurity weight linearly increases with the increase of the impurity-scattering strength for the weak scattering strength and tends to saturate in the strong scattering strength, while it decreases with the increase of the impurity-scattering screening length for the short screening-length and saturates in the long screening-length.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional quantum criticality</title>

Abstract: Quantum critical phenomena are widely studied across various materials families, from high temperature superconductors to magnetic insulators. They occur when a thermodynamic phase transition is suppressed to zero temperature as a function of some tuning parameter such as pressure or magnetic field. This generally yields a point of instability - a so-called quantum critical point - at which the phase transition is driven exclusively by quantum mechanical fluctuations. Here we show that the heavy fermion metamagnet UTe$_2$ possesses a quantum phase transition at extreme magnetic field strengths of over 70 T. Surprisingly, rather than terminating at one singular point, we find that the phase boundary is sensitive to magnetic field components in each of the three cartesian axes of magnetic field space. This results in the three-dimensional transition surface being bounded by a continuous ring of quantum critical points, the locus of which forms an extended line of quantum criticality - a novel form of quantum critical phase boundary. Within this quantum critical line sits an intensely field-resilient superconducting state in a striking toroidal shape, persisting to fields over 70 T. We model our data by a phenomenological free energy expansion, and show how a three-dimensional quantum critical phase boundary - rather than a more conventional singular point of instability - anchors the remarkable high magnetic field phase landscape of UTe$_2$.</description>

      <title>Probing electron quadrupling order through ultrasound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03020v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent experiments have pointed to the formation of a new state of matter, the electron quadrupling condensate in Ba$_{1-x}$K$_x$Fe$_2$As$_2$. The state spontaneously breaks time-reversal symmetry and is sandwiched between two critical points, separating it from the superconducting and normal-metal states. We report a theory of the acoustic effects of systems with an electron quadrupling phase based on ultrasound-velocity measurements of Ba$_{1-x}$K$_x$Fe$_2$As$_2$ single crystals. The theoretical analysis suggests that the ultrasound data can be understood by considering a plain $s$+i$d_{xy}$ order parameter or an $s$+i$s$ order parameter with symmetry-breaking deformations in this material with enhanced nematic susceptibility for the [110] direction, or when the transition to the quartic state is a weakly first-order. Our work provides the theoretical basis and proposes the experimental strategy to study the order parameter symmetry of emerging quadrupling condensates in superconductors.</description>

      <title>Gate-controlled proximity effect in superconductor/ferromagnet van der Waals heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07575v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The discovery of 2D materials opens up unprecedented opportunities to design new materials with specified properties. In many cases, the design guiding principle is based on one or another proximity effect, i.e. the nanoscale-penetration of electronic correlations from one material to another. In a few layer van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures the proximity regions occupy the entire system. Here we demonstrate that the physics of magnetic and superconducting proximity effects in 2D superconductor/ferromagnet vdW heterostructures is determined by the effects of interface hybridization of the electronic spectra of both materials. The degree of hybridization can be adjusted by gating, which makes it possible to achieve a high degree of controllability of the proximity effect. In particular, we show that this allows for electrical switching of superconductivity in such structures on and off, as well as for control of the amplitude and sign of the Zeeman splitting of superconducting spectra, opening interesting opportunities for spintronics and spin caloritronics.</description>

      <title>Information dynamics of our brains in dynamically driven disordered superconducting loop networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19279v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Complex systems of many interacting components exhibit patterns of recurrence and emergent behaviors in their time evolution that can be understood from a new perspective in physics of information dynamics modeled after one such system, our brains. A generic brain-like network model is derived from a system of disordered superconducting loops with Josephson junction oscillators to demonstrate these behaviors. The loops can trap multiples of fluxons that represent quantized information units in many distinct memory configurations populating a state space. The state can be updated by exciting the junctions to $fire$ or allow the movement of fluxons through the network as the current through them surpasses their thresholds. Simulations performed with a lumped circuit model of a 4-loop network show that information written through excitations is translated into stable states of trapped flux and their time evolution. Experimental implementation on the 4-loop network shows dynamically stable flux flow in each pathway characterized by the junction firing statistics. The network separates information from multiple excitations into state categories with large energy barriers observed in simulations that correspond to different flux (information) flow patterns observed across junctions in experiments. Strong evidence for associative and time-dependent (short-to-long-term) memories distributed across the network is observed, dependent on its intrinsic and geometrical properties as described by the model. Suitable network topologies can model various other systems leading to a universal description of the nature of information dynamics.</description>

      <title>Multi-band superconductors have enhanced critical temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17297v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a multi-band BCS free energy functional and prove that for a multi-band superconductor the effect of inter-band coupling can only increase the critical temperature, irrespective of its attractive or repulsive nature and its strength. Further, for weak coupling and weaker inter-band coupling, we prove that the dependence of the increase in critical temperature on the inter-band coupling is (1) linear, if there are two or more equally strongly superconducting bands, or (2) quadratic, if there is only one dominating band.</description>
