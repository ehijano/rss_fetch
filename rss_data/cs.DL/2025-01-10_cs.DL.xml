      <title>40 Years of Interdisciplinary Research: Phases, Origins, and Key Turning Points (1981-2020)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05001</link>

Abstract: This study examines the historical evolution of interdisciplinary research (IDR) over a 40-year period, focusing on its dynamic trends, phases, and key turning points. We apply time series analysis to identify critical years for interdisciplinary citations (CYICs) and categorizes IDR into three distinct phases based on these trends: Period I (1981-2002), marked by sporadic and limited interdisciplinary activity; Period II (2003-2016), characterized by the emergence of large-scale IDR led primarily by Medicine, with significant breakthroughs in cloning and medical technology; and Period III (2017-present), where IDR became a widely adopted research paradigm. Our findings indicate that IDR has been predominantly concentrated within the Natural Sciences, with Medicine consistently at the forefront, and highlights increasing contributions from Engineering and Environmental disciplines as a new trend. These insights enhance the understanding of the evolution of IDR, its driving factors, and the shifts in the focus of interdisciplinary collaborations.</description>

      <title>Comparison of Feature Learning Methods for Metadata Extraction from PDF Scholarly Documents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The availability of metadata for scientific documents is pivotal in propelling scientific knowledge forward and for adhering to the FAIR principles (i.e. Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability) of research findings. However, the lack of sufficient metadata in published documents, particularly those from smaller and mid-sized publishers, hinders their accessibility. This issue is widespread in some disciplines, such as the German Social Sciences, where publications often employ diverse templates. To address this challenge, our study evaluates various feature learning and prediction methods, including natural language processing (NLP), computer vision (CV), and multimodal approaches, for extracting metadata from documents with high template variance. We aim to improve the accessibility of scientific documents and facilitate their wider use. To support our comparison of these methods, we provide comprehensive experimental results, analyzing their accuracy and efficiency in extracting metadata. Additionally, we provide valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of various feature learning and prediction methods, which can guide future research in this field.</description>
