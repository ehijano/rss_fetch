      <title>Kinetic development of low-temperature propane oxidation in a repetitively-pulsed nanosecond discharge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The kinetics of plasma assisted low temperature oxidation of C3H8O2Ar mixtures have been studied in a wide specific deposition energy with the help of nanosecond repetitively pulsed discharge. Two types of nanosecond pulsed plasma sources, the nanosecond capillary discharge (nCD) and dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) combined with the synchrotron photoionization mass spectrometry are investigated. The electron impact reaction rate of propane dissociation and some combustion chemical reactions rate constants are updated according to the nCD and DBD experiment results,and uncertainty of the reactions are analyzed in detail. Compared to the existing model, the updated model's prediction accuracy has great improvement in species H2O, CO, CO2, CH4, CH2O, CH3OH, C2H2, C2H4, C2H6, C2H5OH, C2H5OOH, C3H4-A, C3H4-P, C2H5CHO, i-C3H7OH and C3H7OOH. The propane oxidation processes assisted by DBD and nCD were compared under different single pulse deposition energy (SPDE) conditions while maintaining the same total deposition energy. The reduced electric field in nCD is concentrated at 150-200 Td and 450-500 Td, whereas in DBD it ranges from 0-25 Td and 50-250 Td. Notably, SPDE shows minimal influence on the propane oxidation process, which is primarily controlled by total deposition energy and demonstrates little dependence on the discharge type (DBD or nCD).</description>

      <title>Full Helicon thruster modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research work is part of a PhD project aiming to design a new helicon plasma thruster for cargo space missions, within a collaboration between the School of Aerospace Engineering of La Sapienza University and the ENEA Frascati research center. A 0-D global design model of the thruster is first established to identify the main operational conditions of the thruster, starting from a targeted performance in terms of specific impulse and thrust. These operational conditions are tested with dedicated simulations on the electromagnetic plasma-wave interaction within the ionization chamber, and on the electrostatic plasma acceleration within the magnetic nozzle. The former are carried out with a finite element electromagnetic code and confirm the technical feasibility of the identified operational RF power with a predefined chamber geometry. The latter are obtained with an electrostatic particle-in-cell code, which allows to estimate more precisely the achieved thruster performance. A sub-optimal thruster with an absorbed plasma power of around 1 kW, a thrust of around 10 mN and a specific impulse higher than 1000 s is successfully simulated. The established simulation framework will serve as the basis for the next optimization of the thruster geometry and operational conditions, with the ultimate goal of building and testing a new helicon thruster prototype.</description>

      <title>Turbulent features near the X point of a DTT-like tokamak plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The background magnetic geometry at the edge of a tokamak plasma has to be designed in order to mitigate the particle and energy looses essentially due to turbulent transport. The Divertor-Tokamak-Test (DTT) facility under construction at ENEA Frascati will test several magnetic configurations and mitigation strategies, that are usually based on the realization of nontrivial topologies in which one or more X points are present. In order to get a clear understanding of turbulent transport near one of such X points, we perform 3D electro-static fluid simulations of tokamak edge plasma for a DTT-like scenario. We will outline: i) the resulting turbulent spectral features and their dependence on some model parameters (the background pressure gradients and diffusivity) and on the magnetic geometry through a comparative analysis with the results of the companion paper [19], ii) the connection between small scale poloidal structures and toroidal asymmetries, iii) the formation of quiescent regions, iv)the crucial role of radial Dirichlet boundary conditions for the excitation of zonal flows that can screen the radial component of the magnetic geometry.</description>

      <title>On the convergence of bootstrap current to the Shaing-Callen limit in stellarators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bootstrap current in stellarators can be presented as a sum of a collisionless value given by the Shaing-Callen asymptotic formula and an off-set current, which non-trivially depends on plasma collisionality and radial electric field. Using NEO-2 modelling, analytical estimates and semi-analytical studies with help of a propagator method, it is shown that the off-set current in the $1/\nu$ regime does not converge with decreasing collisionality $\nu_\ast$ but rather shows oscillations over $\log\nu_\ast$ with an amplitude of the order of the bootstrap current in an equivalent tokamak. The convergence to the Shaing-Callen limit appears in regimes with significant orbit precession, in particular, due to a finite radial electric field, where the off-set current decreases as $\nu_\ast^{3/5}$. The off-set current strongly increases in case of nearly aligned magnetic field maxima on the field line where it diverges as $\nu_\ast^{-1/2}$ in the $1/\nu$ regime and saturates due to the precession at a level exceeding the equivalent tokamak value by ${v_E^\ast}^{-1/2}$ where $v_E^\ast$ is the perpendicular Mach number. The latter off-set, however, can be minimized by further aligning local magnetic field maxima and by fulfilling an extra integral condition of "equivalent ripples" for the magnetic field. A criterion for the accuracy of this alignment and of ripple equivalence is derived. In addition, the possibility of the bootstrap effect at the magnetic axis caused by the above off-set is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Influences of $\delta$B Contribution and Parallel Inertial Term of Energetic Particles on MHD-Kinetic Hybrid Simulations: A Case Study of the 1/1 Internal Kink Mode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetohydrodynamic-kinetic (MHD-kinetic) hybrid model [Park et. al., 1992] has been widely applied in studying energetic particles (EPs) problems in fusion plasmas for past decades. The pressure-coupling scheme or the current-coupling scheme is adopted in this model. However, two noteworthy issues arise in the model application: firstly, the coupled term introduced in the pressure-coupling scheme, $\left( \nabla \cdot \mathbf{P}_{\mathrm{h}} \right)_{\bot}$, is often simplified by $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{P}_{\mathrm{h}}$, which is equivalent to neglecting the parallel inertial term of EPs; secondly, besides the $\delta f $ contribution caused by changing in the EP distribution function, the magnetic field perturbation (the $\delta \mathbf{B} $ contribution) generated during development of the instabilities should also be considered, but it is often ignored in existing hybrid simulations. In this paper, we derive the analytical formulations under these two coupling schemes and then numerically study the representative case of the linear stability of the m/n=1/1 internal kink mode (IKM) [Fu et. al., 2006] by using the CLT-K code. It is found that the approximated models can still yield reasonable results when EPs are isotopically distributed. But it fails completely in cases with anisotropic EP distributions. In addition, we further investigate the influence of EP's orbit width on the stability of IKM and verify the equivalence between pressure-coupling scheme and the current-coupling scheme.</description>

      <title>On Extended d-D Kappa Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermal Doppler broadening of spectral profiles for particle populations in the absence or presence of potential fields are described by kappa distributions. The kappa distribution provides a replacement for the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution which can be considered as a generalization for describing systems characterized by local correlations among their particles as found in space and astrophysical plasmas. This paper presents all special cases of kappa distributions as members of a general pathway family of densities introduced by Mathai.</description>
