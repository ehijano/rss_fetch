      <title>Plane Symmetric, Cylindrically Symmetric and Spherically Symmetric Vacuum Solutions of Einstein Field Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.2013</link>
      <description>arXiv:1411.2013v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we present Plane symmetric, Cylindrically Symmetric and Spherically Symmetric Black hole or Vacuum solutions of Einstein Field Equations(EFEs). Some of these solutions are new which we have not seen in the literature. This calculation will help us in understanding the gravitational wave and gravitational wave spacetimes.</description>

      <title>(Pseudo-)Synthetic BRST quantisation of the bosonic string and the higher quantum origin of dualities</title>

Abstract: In this article I am arguing in favour of the hypothesis that the origin of gauge and string dualities in general can be found in a higher-categorical interpretation of basic quantum mechanics. It is interesting to observe that the Galilei group has a non-trivial cohomology, while the Lorentz/Poincare group has trivial cohomology. When we constructed quantum mechanics, we noticed the non-trivial cohomology structure of the Galilei group and hence, we required for a proper quantisation procedure that would be compatible with the symmetry group of our theory, to go to a central extension of the Galilei group universal covering by co-cycle. This would be the Bargmann group. However, Nature didn't choose this path. Instead in nature, the Galilei group is not realised, while the Lorentz group is. The fact that the Galilei group has topological obstructions leads to a central charge, the mass, and a superselection rule, required to implement the Galilei symmetry, that forbids transitions between states of different mass. The topological structure of the Lorentz group however lacks such an obstruction, and hence allows for transitions between states of different mass. The connectivity structure of the Lorentz group as opposed to that of the Galilei group can be interpreted in the sense of an ER=EPR duality for the topological space associated to group cohomology. In string theory we started with the Witt algebra, and due to similar quantisation issues, we employed the central extension by co-cycle to obtain the Virasoro algebra. This is a unique extension for orientation preserving diffeomorphisms on a circle, but there is no reason to believe that, at the high energy domain in physics where this would apply, we do not have a totally different structure altogether and the degrees of freedom present there would require something vastly more general and global.</description>

      <title>A new theory of tensor-scalar gravity coupled to Aharonov-Bohm electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05230v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tensor-scalar theories of gravitation are commonly employed as extensions of General Relativity that allow to describe a much wider phenomenology. They are also naturally generated as low energy limit of higher-dimensional or unified theories, and the gravitational scalar components can represent quantum corrections to the Einstein theory. The coupling of the scalars to an e.m. field does not introduce any relevant new physics if the e.m. action has the usual Maxwell form, implying a vanishing trace of the e.m. energy-momentum tensor. In the case of the extended Aharonov-Bohm electrodynamics some interesting new situations are possible, which in this work are analyzed in the gravitational weak-field approximation and for a basic version of tensor-scalar gravity involving only a Brans-Dicke field plus another scalar. Since the Aharonov-Bohm theory differs from Maxwell theory only in the presence of anomalous sources with local violation of charge conservation, which is thought to be possible only at a quantum level, the resulting formal framework can be useful to model interactions between gravitation and physical systems with macroscopic quantization. The theory contains some unknown parameters, the most important being the VEV $\psi_0$ of the second gravitational scalar and the level $\gamma$ of violation of local charge conservation in the e.m. sector. An attempt is done to relate these parameters to some experimental constraints. However, there is presently much space left for uncertainty.</description>
