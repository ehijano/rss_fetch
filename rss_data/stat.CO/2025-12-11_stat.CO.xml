      <title>All Emulators are Wrong, Many are Useful, and Some are More Useful Than Others: A Reproducible Comparison of Computer Model Surrogates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate and efficient surrogate modeling is essential for modern computational science, and there are a staggering number of emulation methods to choose from. With new methods being developed all the time, comparing the relative strengths and weaknesses of different methods remains a challenge due to inconsistent benchmarking practices and (sometimes) limited reproducibility and transparency. In this work, we present a large-scale, fully reproducible comparison of $29$ distinct emulators across $60$ canonical test functions and $40$ real emulation datasets. To facilitate rigorous, apples-to-apples comparisons, we introduce the R package \texttt{duqling}, which streamlines reproducible simulation studies using a consistent, simple syntax, and automatic internal scaling of inputs. This framework allows researchers to compare emulators in a unified environment and makes it possible to replicate or extend previous studies with minimal effort, even across different publications. Our results provide detailed empirical insight into the strengths and weaknesses of state-of-the-art emulators and offer guidance for both method developers and practitioners selecting a surrogate for new data. We discuss best practices for emulator comparison and highlight how \texttt{duqling} can accelerate research in emulator design and application.</description>

      <title>Minimization of Functions on Dually Flat Spaces Using Geodesic Descent Based on Dual Connections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose geodesic-based optimization methods on dually flat spaces, where the geometric structure of the parameter manifold is closely related to the form of the objective function. A primary application is maximum likelihood estimation in statistical models, especially exponential families, whose model manifolds are dually flat. We show that an m-geodesic update, which directly optimizes the log-likelihood, can theoretically reach the maximum likelihood estimator in a single step. In contrast, an e-geodesic update has a practical advantage in cases where the parameter space is geodesically complete, allowing optimization without explicitly handling parameter constraints. We establish the theoretical properties of the proposed methods and validate their effectiveness through numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>BISTRO - A Bi-Fidelity Stochastic Gradient Framework using Trust-Regions for Optimization Under Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic optimization of engineering systems is often infeasible due to repeated evaluations of a computationally expensive, high-fidelity simulation. Bi-fidelity methods mitigate this challenge by leveraging a cheaper, approximate model to accelerate convergence. Most existing bi-fidelity approaches, however, exploit either design-space curvature or random-space correlation, not both. We present BISTRO - a BI-fidelity Stochastic Trust-Region Optimizer for unconstrained optimization under uncertainty through a stochastic approximation procedure. This approach exploits the curvature information of a low-fidelity objective function to converge within a basin of a local minimum of the high-fidelity model where low-fidelity curvature information is no longer valuable. The method then switches to a variance-reduced stochastic gradient descent procedure. We provide convergence guarantees in expectation under certain regularity assumptions and ensure the best-case $\mathcal{O}(1/n)$ convergence rate for stochastic optimization. On benchmark problems and a 20-dimensional space shuttle reentry case, BISTRO converges faster than adaptive sampling and variance reduction procedures and cuts computational expense by up to 29x.</description>

      <title>Debiased Bayesian Inference for High-dimensional Regression Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There has been significant progress in Bayesian inference based on sparsity-inducing (e.g., spike-and-slab and horseshoe-type) priors for high-dimensional regression models. The resulting posteriors, however, in general do not possess desirable frequentist properties, and the credible sets thus cannot serve as valid confidence sets even asymptotically. We introduce a novel debiasing approach that corrects the bias for the entire Bayesian posterior distribution. We establish a new Bernstein-von Mises theorem that guarantees the frequentist validity of the debiased posterior. We demonstrate the practical performance of our proposal through Monte Carlo simulations and two empirical applications in economics.</description>

      <title>LASPATED: A Library for the Analysis of Spatio-Temporal Discrete Data (User Manual)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13889v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This is the User Manual of the LASPATED library. This library is available on GitHub (at https://github.com/vguigues/LASPATED)) and provides a set of tools to analyze spatiotemporal data. A video tutorial for this library is available on Youtube. It is made of a Python package for time and space discretizations and of two packages (one in Matlab and one in C++) implementing the calibration of the probabilistic models for stochastic spatio-temporal data proposed in the companion paper arXiv:2203.16371v2.</description>

      <title>Bayesian power spectral density estimation for LISA noise based on P-splines with a parametric boost</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00533v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Flexible and accurate noise characterization is crucial for the precise estimation of gravitational-wave parameters. We introduce a Bayesian method for estimating the power spectral density (PSD) of long, stationary time series, explicitly tailored for LISA data analysis. Our approach models the PSD as the geometric mean of a parametric and a nonparametric component, combining the knowledge from parametric models with the flexibility to capture deviations from theoretical expectations. The nonparametric component is expressed by a mixture of penalized B-splines. Adaptive, data-driven knot placement, performed once at initialization, removes the need for reversible-jump Markov chain Monte Carlo, while hierarchical roughness-penalty priors prevent overfitting. Validation on simulated autoregressive AR(4) data demonstrates estimator consistency and shows that well-matched parametric components reduce the integrated absolute error compared to an uninformative baseline, requiring fewer spline knots to achieve comparable accuracy. Applied to one year of simulated LISA X-channel (univariate) noise, our method achieves relative integrated absolute errors of $\mathcal{O}(10^{-2})$, making it suitable for iterative analysis pipelines and multi-year mission data sets.</description>

      <title>Generalized Guarantees for Variational Inference in the Presence of Even and Elliptical Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01064v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend several recent results providing symmetry-based guarantees for variational inference (VI) with location-scale families. VI approximates a target density $p$ by the best match $q^*$ in a family $Q$ of tractable distributions that in general does not contain $p$. It is known that VI can recover key properties of $p$, such as its mean and correlation matrix, when $p$ and $Q$ exhibit certain symmetries and $q^*$ is found by minimizing the reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence. We extend these guarantees in two important directions. First, we provide symmetry-based guarantees for $f$-divergences, a broad class that includes the reverse and forward Kullback-Leibler divergences and the $\alpha$-divergences. We highlight properties specific to the reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence under which we obtain our strongest guarantees. Second, we obtain further guarantees for VI when the target density $p$ exhibits even and elliptical symmetries in some but not all of its coordinates. These partial symmetries arise naturally in Bayesian hierarchical models, where the prior induces a challenging geometry but still possesses axes of symmetry. We illustrate these theoretical results in a number of experimental settings.</description>
