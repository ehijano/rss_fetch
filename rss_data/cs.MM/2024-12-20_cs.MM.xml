      <title>A Panopticon on My Wrist: The Biopower of Big Data Visualization for Wearables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Big data visualization - the visual-spatial display of quantitative information culled from huge data sets - is now firmly embedded within the everyday experiences of people across the globe, yet scholarship on it remains surprisingly small. Within this literature, critical theorizations of big data visualizations are rare, as digital positivist perspectives dominate. This paper offers a critical, design-informed perspective on big data visualization in wearable health tracking ecosystems like FitBit. I argue that such visualizations are tools of individualized, neoliberal governance that operate largely through experiences of seduction and addiction to facilitate participation in the corporate capture and monetization of personal information. Exploration of my personal experience of the FitBit ecosystem illuminates this argument and emphasizes the capacity for harm to individuals using these ecosystems, leading to an exploration of the complex professional challenges for user experience designers working on visualizations within the ecosystems of wearables.</description>

      <title>Efficient Self-Supervised Video Hashing with Selective State Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-supervised video hashing (SSVH) is a practical task in video indexing and retrieval. Although Transformers are predominant in SSVH for their impressive temporal modeling capabilities, they often suffer from computational and memory inefficiencies. Drawing inspiration from Mamba, an advanced state-space model, we explore its potential in SSVH to achieve a better balance between efficacy and efficiency. We introduce S5VH, a Mamba-based video hashing model with an improved self-supervised learning paradigm. Specifically, we design bidirectional Mamba layers for both the encoder and decoder, which are effective and efficient in capturing temporal relationships thanks to the data-dependent selective scanning mechanism with linear complexity. In our learning strategy, we transform global semantics in the feature space into semantically consistent and discriminative hash centers, followed by a center alignment loss as a global learning signal. Our self-local-global (SLG) paradigm significantly improves learning efficiency, leading to faster and better convergence. Extensive experiments demonstrate S5VH's improvements over state-of-the-art methods, superior transferability, and scalable advantages in inference efficiency.

      <title>Spectrum-based Modality Representation Fusion Graph Convolutional Network for Multimodal Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Incorporating multi-modal features as side information has recently become a trend in recommender systems. To elucidate user-item preferences, recent studies focus on fusing modalities via concatenation, element-wise sum, or attention mechanisms. Despite having notable success, existing approaches do not account for the modality-specific noise encapsulated within each modality. As a result, direct fusion of modalities will lead to the amplification of cross-modality noise. Moreover, the variation of noise that is unique within each modality results in noise alleviation and fusion being more challenging. In this work, we propose a new Spectrum-based Modality Representation (SMORE) fusion graph recommender that aims to capture both uni-modal and fusion preferences while simultaneously suppressing modality noise. Specifically, SMORE projects the multi-modal features into the frequency domain and leverages the spectral space for fusion. To reduce dynamic contamination that is unique to each modality, we introduce a filter to attenuate and suppress the modality noise adaptively while capturing the universal modality patterns effectively. Furthermore, we explore the item latent structures by designing a new multi-modal graph learning module to capture associative semantic correlations and universal fusion patterns among similar items. Finally, we formulate a new modality-aware preference module, which infuses behavioral features and balances the uni- and multi-modal features for precise preference modeling. This empowers SMORE with the ability to infer both user modality-specific and fusion preferences more accurately. Experiments on three real-world datasets show the efficacy of our proposed model. The source code for this work has been made publicly available at https://github.com/kennethorq/SMORE.</description>

      <title>Stable-V2A: Synthesis of Synchronized Sound Effects with Temporal and Semantic Controls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sound designers and Foley artists usually sonorize a scene, such as from a movie or video game, by manually annotating and sonorizing each action of interest in the video. In our case, the intent is to leave full creative control to sound designers with a tool that allows them to bypass the more repetitive parts of their work, thus being able to focus on the creative aspects of sound production. We achieve this presenting Stable-V2A, a two-stage model consisting of: an RMS-Mapper that estimates an envelope representative of the audio characteristics associated with the input video; and Stable-Foley, a diffusion model based on Stable Audio Open that generates audio semantically and temporally aligned with the target video. Temporal alignment is guaranteed by the use of the envelope as a ControlNet input, while semantic alignment is achieved through the use of sound representations chosen by the designer as cross-attention conditioning of the diffusion process. We train and test our model on Greatest Hits, a dataset commonly used to evaluate V2A models. In addition, to test our model on a case study of interest, we introduce Walking The Maps, a dataset of videos extracted from video games depicting animated characters walking in different locations. Samples and code available on our demo page at https://ispamm.github.io/Stable-V2A.</description>

      <title>Prompt-A-Video: Prompt Your Video Diffusion Model via Preference-Aligned LLM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text-to-video models have made remarkable advancements through optimization on high-quality text-video pairs, where the textual prompts play a pivotal role in determining quality of output videos. However, achieving the desired output often entails multiple revisions and iterative inference to refine user-provided prompts. Current automatic methods for refining prompts encounter challenges such as Modality-Inconsistency, Cost-Discrepancy, and Model-Unaware when applied to text-to-video diffusion models. To address these problem, we introduce an LLM-based prompt adaptation framework, termed as Prompt-A-Video, which excels in crafting Video-Centric, Labor-Free and Preference-Aligned prompts tailored to specific video diffusion model. Our approach involves a meticulously crafted two-stage optimization and alignment system. Initially, we conduct a reward-guided prompt evolution pipeline to automatically create optimal prompts pool and leverage them for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of the LLM. Then multi-dimensional rewards are employed to generate pairwise data for the SFT model, followed by the direct preference optimization (DPO) algorithm to further facilitate preference alignment. Through extensive experimentation and comparative analyses, we validate the effectiveness of Prompt-A-Video across diverse generation models, highlighting its potential to push the boundaries of video generation.</description>

Abstract: Audio-visual speaker tracking has drawn increasing attention over the past few years due to its academic values and wide application. Audio and visual modalities can provide complementary information for localization and tracking. With audio and visual information, the Bayesian-based filter can solve the problem of data association, audio-visual fusion and track management. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive overview of audio-visual speaker tracking. To our knowledge, this is the first extensive survey over the past five years. We introduce the family of Bayesian filters and summarize the methods for obtaining audio-visual measurements. In addition, the existing trackers and their performance on AV16.3 dataset are summarized. In the past few years, deep learning techniques have thrived, which also boosts the development of audio visual speaker tracking. The influence of deep learning techniques in terms of measurement extraction and state estimation is also discussed. At last, we discuss the connections between audio-visual speaker tracking and other areas such as speech separation and distributed speaker tracking.</description>

      <title>Sign-IDD: Iconicity Disentangled Diffusion for Sign Language Production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13609v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sign Language Production (SLP) aims to generate semantically consistent sign videos from textual statements, where the conversion from textual glosses to sign poses (G2P) is a crucial step. Existing G2P methods typically treat sign poses as discrete three-dimensional coordinates and directly fit them, which overlooks the relative positional relationships among joints. To this end, we provide a new perspective, constraining joint associations and gesture details by modeling the limb bones to improve the accuracy and naturalness of the generated poses. In this work, we propose a pioneering iconicity disentangled diffusion framework, termed Sign-IDD, specifically designed for SLP. Sign-IDD incorporates a novel Iconicity Disentanglement (ID) module to bridge the gap between relative positions among joints. The ID module disentangles the conventional 3D joint representation into a 4D bone representation, comprising the 3D spatial direction vector and 1D spatial distance vector between adjacent joints. Additionally, an Attribute Controllable Diffusion (ACD) module is introduced to further constrain joint associations, in which the attribute separation layer aims to separate the bone direction and length attributes, and the attribute control layer is designed to guide the pose generation by leveraging the above attributes. The ACD module utilizes the gloss embeddings as semantic conditions and finally generates sign poses from noise embeddings. Extensive experiments on PHOENIX14T and USTC-CSL datasets validate the effectiveness of our method. The code is available at: https://github.com/NaVi-start/Sign-IDD.</description>
