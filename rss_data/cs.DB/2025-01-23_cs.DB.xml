      <title>Column-Oriented Datalog on the GPU</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Datalog is a logic programming language widely used in knowledge representation and reasoning (KRR), program analysis, and social media mining due to its expressiveness and high performance. Traditionally, Datalog engines use either row-oriented or column-oriented storage. Engines like VLog and Nemo favor column-oriented storage for efficiency on limited-resource machines, while row-oriented engines like Souffle use advanced data structures with locking to perform better on multi-core CPUs. The advent of modern datacenter GPUs, such as the NVIDIA H100 with its ability to run over 16k threads simultaneously and high memory bandwidth, has reopened the debate on which storage layout is more effective. This paper presents the first column-oriented Datalog engines tailored to the strengths of modern GPUs. We present VFLog, a CUDA-based Datalog runtime library with a column-oriented GPU datastructure that supports all necessary relational algebra operations. Our results demonstrate over 200x performance gains over SOTA CPU-based column-oriented Datalog engines and a 2.5x speedup over GPU Datalog engines in various workloads, including KRR.</description>

      <title>LEGO-GraphRAG: Modularizing Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Design Space Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05844v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: GraphRAG integrates (knowledge) graphs with large language models (LLMs) to improve reasoning accuracy and contextual relevance. Despite its promising applications and strong relevance to multiple research communities, such as databases and natural language processing, GraphRAG currently lacks modular workflow analysis, systematic solution frameworks, and insightful empirical studies. To bridge these gaps, we propose LEGO-GraphRAG, a modular framework that enables: 1) fine-grained decomposition of the GraphRAG workflow, 2) systematic classification of existing techniques and implemented GraphRAG instances, and 3) creation of new GraphRAG instances. Our framework facilitates comprehensive empirical studies of GraphRAG on large-scale real-world graphs and diverse query sets, revealing insights into balancing reasoning quality, runtime efficiency, and token or GPU cost, that are essential for building advanced GraphRAG systems.</description>

      <title>Enumeration and updates for conjunctive linear algebra queries through expressibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04118v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to the importance of linear algebra and matrix operations in data analytics, there is significant interest in using relational query optimization and processing techniques for evaluating (sparse) linear algebra programs. In particular, in recent years close connections have been established between linear algebra programs and relational algebra that allow transferring optimization techniques of the latter to the former. In this paper, we ask ourselves which linear algebra programs in MATLANG correspond to the free-connex and q-hierarchical fragments of conjunctive first-order logic. Both fragments have desirable query processing properties: free-connex conjunctive queries support constant-delay enumeration after a linear-time preprocessing phase, and q-hierarchical conjunctive queries further allow constant-time updates. By characterizing the corresponding fragments of MATLANG, we hence identify the fragments of linear algebra programs that one can evaluate with constant-delay enumeration after linear-time preprocessing and with constant-time updates. To derive our results, we improve and generalize previous correspondences between MATLANG and relational algebra evaluated over semiring-annotated relations. In addition, we identify properties on semirings that allow to generalize the complexity bounds for free-connex and q-hierarchical conjunctive queries from Boolean annotations to general semirings.</description>

      <title>DBgDel: Database-Enhanced Gene Deletion Framework for Growth-Coupled Production in Genome-Scale Metabolic Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08077v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When simulating metabolite productions with genome-scale constraint-based metabolic models, gene deletion strategies are necessary to achieve growth-coupled production, which means cell growth and target metabolite production occur simultaneously. Since obtaining gene deletion strategies for large genome-scale models suffers from significant computational time, it is necessary to develop methods to mitigate this computational burden. In this study, we introduce a novel framework for computing gene deletion strategies. The proposed framework first mines related databases to extract prior information about gene deletions for growth-coupled production. It then integrates the extracted information with downstream algorithms to narrow down the algorithmic search space, resulting in highly efficient calculations on genome-scale models. Computational experiment results demonstrated that our framework can compute stoichiometrically feasible gene deletion strategies for numerous target metabolites, showcasing a noteworthy improvement in computational efficiency. Specifically, our framework achieves an average 6.1-fold acceleration in computational speed compared to existing methods while maintaining a respectable success rate. The source code of DBgDel with examples are available on https://github.com/MetNetComp/DBgDel.</description>
