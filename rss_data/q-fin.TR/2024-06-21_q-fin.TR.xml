      <title>Adaptive Curves for Optimally Efficient Market Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automated Market Makers (AMMs) are essential in Decentralized Finance (DeFi) as they match liquidity supply with demand. They function through liquidity providers (LPs) who deposit assets into liquidity pools. However, the asset trading prices in these pools often trail behind those in more dynamic, centralized exchanges, leading to potential arbitrage losses for LPs. This issue is tackled by adapting market maker bonding curves to trader behavior, based on the classical market microstructure model of Glosten and Milgrom. Our approach ensures a zero-profit condition for the market maker's prices. We derive the differential equation that an optimal adaptive curve should follow to minimize arbitrage losses while remaining competitive. Solutions to this optimality equation are obtained for standard Gaussian and Lognormal price models using Kalman filtering. A key feature of our method is its ability to estimate the external market price without relying on price or loss oracles. We also provide an equivalent differential equation for the implied dynamics of canonical static bonding curves and establish conditions for their optimality. Our algorithms demonstrate robustness to changing market conditions and adversarial perturbations, and we offer an on-chain implementation using Uniswap v4 alongside off-chain AI co-processors.</description>

      <title>MacroHFT: Memory Augmented Context-aware Reinforcement Learning On High Frequency Trading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-frequency trading (HFT) that executes algorithmic trading in short time scales, has recently occupied the majority of cryptocurrency market. Besides traditional quantitative trading methods, reinforcement learning (RL) has become another appealing approach for HFT due to its terrific ability of handling high-dimensional financial data and solving sophisticated sequential decision-making problems, \emph{e.g.,} hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) has shown its promising performance on second-level HFT by training a router to select only one sub-agent from the agent pool to execute the current transaction. However, existing RL methods for HFT still have some defects: 1) standard RL-based trading agents suffer from the overfitting issue, preventing them from making effective policy adjustments based on financial context; 2) due to the rapid changes in market conditions, investment decisions made by an individual agent are usually one-sided and highly biased, which might lead to significant loss in extreme markets. To tackle these problems, we propose a novel Memory Augmented Context-aware Reinforcement learning method On HFT, \emph{a.k.a.} MacroHFT, which consists of two training phases: 1) we first train multiple types of sub-agents with the market data decomposed according to various financial indicators, specifically market trend and volatility, where each agent owns a conditional adapter to adjust its trading policy according to market conditions; 2) then we train a hyper-agent to mix the decisions from these sub-agents and output a consistently profitable meta-policy to handle rapid market fluctuations, equipped with a memory mechanism to enhance the capability of decision-making. Extensive experiments on various cryptocurrency markets demonstrate that MacroHFT can achieve state-of-the-art performance on minute-level trading tasks.</description>

      <title>Liquidity Dynamics in RFQ Markets and Impact on Pricing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.04216v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To assign a value to a portfolio, it is common to use Mark-to-Market prices. However, how should one proceed when the securities are illiquid? When transaction prices are scarce, how can one use all the available real-time information? In this article, we address these questions for over-the-counter (OTC) markets based on requests for quotes (RFQs). We extend the concept of micro-price, which was recently introduced for assets exchanged through limit order books in the market microstructure literature, and incorporate ideas from the recent literature on OTC market making. To account for liquidity imbalances in RFQ markets, we use an approach based on bidimensional Markov-modulated Poisson processes. Beyond extending the concept of micro-price to RFQ markets, we introduce the new concept of Fair Transfer Price. Our concepts of price can be used to value securities fairly, even when the market is relatively illiquid and/or tends to be one-sided.</description>
