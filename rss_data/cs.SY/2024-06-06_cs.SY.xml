      <title>Constructive Safety-Critical Control: Synthesizing Control Barrier Functions for Partially Feedback Linearizable Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Certifying the safety of nonlinear systems, through the lens of set invariance and control barrier functions (CBFs), offers a powerful method for controller synthesis, provided a CBF can be constructed. This paper draws connections between partial feedback linearization and CBF synthesis. We illustrate that when a control affine system is input-output linearizable with respect to a smooth output function, then, under mild regularity conditions, one may extend any safety constraint defined on the output to a CBF for the full-order dynamics. These more general results are specialized to robotic systems where the conditions required to synthesize CBFs simplify. The CBFs constructed from our approach are applied and verified in simulation and hardware experiments on a quadrotor.</description>

      <title>Development of an underwater inductive coupling communication system with power carrier technology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inductive coupling communication is one of the main methods of underwater communication systems due to its excellent comprehensive performance. However, the data transmission distance and operational power consumption need to be further enhanced. In this paper, an underwater induction coupling communication scheme based on power carrier technology is proposed to improve the transmission speed and reduce the bit error rate. The microcontroller of STM32L series with ultra-low power consumption was employed as the core of the system. Through the construction and simulation of the communication channel, the optimal parameters were determined. According to the circuit model of the power carrier communication, the effect of different modulation and demodulation methods to the signal transmission quality were discussed, which demonstrates the superiority of Differential Phase Shift Keying (DPSK). With the system-level low power design and onboard communication quality optimization, the device was developed. The test results in the laboratory environment show that the system can achieve efficient data communication with a rate of 115200bps and static power consumption as low as 660{\mu}A in the 700m channel. This study provides a practical design approach for the high-speed communication and Low-power operation of underwater communication systems.</description>

      <title>Multivariate Physics-Informed Convolutional Autoencoder for Anomaly Detection in Power Distribution Systems with High Penetration of DERs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the relentless progress of deep learning models in analyzing the system conditions under cyber-physical events, their abilities are limited in the power system domain due to data availability issues, cost of data acquisition, and lack of interpretation and extrapolation for the data beyond the training windows. In addition, the integration of distributed energy resources (DERs) such as wind and solar generations increases the complexities and nonlinear nature of power systems. Therefore, an interpretable and reliable methodology is of utmost need to increase the confidence of power system operators and their situational awareness for making reliable decisions. This has led to the development of physics-informed neural network (PINN) models as more interpretable, trustworthy, and robust models where the underlying principled laws are integrated into the training process of neural network models to achieve improved performance. This paper proposes a multivariate physics-informed convolutional autoencoder (PIConvAE) model to detect cyber anomalies in power distribution systems with unbalanced configurations and high penetration of DERs. The physical laws are integrated through a customized loss function that embeds the underlying Kirchhoff's circuit laws into the training process of the autoencoder. The performance of the multivariate PIConvAE model is evaluated on two unbalanced power distribution grids, IEEE 123-bus system and a real-world feeder in Riverside, CA. The results show the exceptional performance of the proposed method in detecting various cyber anomalies in both systems. In addition, the model's effectiveness is evaluated in data scarcity scenarios with different training data ratios. Finally, the model's performance is compared with existing machine learning models where the PIConvAE model surpasses other models with considerably higher detection metrics.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Small-Signal Security Assessment Using Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Security assessment is one of the most crucial functions of a power system operator. However, growing complexity and unpredictability make this an increasingly complex and computationally difficult task. In recent times, machine learning methods have gained attention for their ability to handle complex modeling applications. Some methods proposed include deep learning using convolutional neural networks, decision trees, etc. While these methods generate promising results, most methods still require long training times and computational resources. This paper proposes a graph neural network (GNN) approach to the small-signal security assessment problem using data from Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs). Leveraging the inherently graphical structure of the power grid using GNNs, training times can be reduced and efficiency improved for real-time application. Also, using graph properties, optimal PMU placement is determined and the proposed method is shown to perform efficiently under partial observability with limited PMU data. Case studies with simulated data from the IEEE 68-bus system and the NPCC 140-bus system are used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Study on layout of double rotated serpentine springs for vertical-comb-driven torsional micromirror</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The combination of double rotated serpentine springs (RSS) and vertical comb-drive is a suitbale solution for the development of torsional micromirror with high fill factor, low fabrication difficulty and good performance. However, the alignment error between upper and lower comb set caused by fabrication can induce force with unexpected direction. And the cross-axis coupled spring constants in double rotated serpentine springs (DRSSs) makes micromirror more susceptible to this alignment error. Herein, in order to minimize the unexpected deflection caused by alignment error of vertical-comb-driven micromirror, this paper, for the first time, studies the effect of layout (centrosymmetrically-arranged and axisymmetrically-arranged) of DRSSs on cross-axis coupled spring constants. Both of theoretical analysis and finite element analysis (FEA) simulation are conducted to reveal this phenomenon. With an example, centrosymmetrically-arranged DRSSs are proved to be more resistant to pull-in of two comb sets. Finally, the relationship between key structure parameters and cross-axis coupled spring constants of centrosymmetrically -arranged DRSSs are presented.</description>

      <title>Exponentially Stable Projector-based Control of Lagrangian Systems with Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing accurate yet robust tracking controllers with tight performance guarantees for Lagrangian systems is challenging due to nonlinear modeling uncertainties and conservative stability criteria. This article proposes a structure-preserving projector-based tracking control law for uncertain Euler-Lagrange (EL) systems using physically consistent Lagrangian-Gaussian Processes (L-GPs). We leverage the uncertainty quantification of the L-GP for adaptive feedforward-feedback balancing. In particular, an accurate probabilistic guarantee for exponential stability is derived by leveraging matrix analysis results and contraction theory, where the benefit of the proposed controller is proven and shown in the closed-form expressions for convergence rate and radius. Extensive numerical simulations not only demonstrate the controller's efficacy based on a two-link and a soft robotic manipulator but also all theoretical results are explicitly analyzed and validated.</description>

      <title>CommonPower: Supercharging Machine Learning for Smart Grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing complexity of power system management has led to an increased interest in the use of reinforcement learning (RL). However, no tool for comprehensive and realistic benchmarking of RL in smart grids exists. One prerequisite for such a comparison is a safeguarding mechanism since vanilla RL controllers can not guarantee the satisfaction of system constraints. Other central requirements include flexible modeling of benchmarking scenarios, credible baselines, and the possibility to investigate the impact of forecast uncertainties. Our Python tool CommonPower is the first modular framework addressing these needs. CommonPower offers a unified interface for single-agent and multi-agent RL training algorithms and includes a built-in model predictive control approach based on a symbolic representation of the system equations. This makes it possible to combine model predictive controllers with RL controllers in the same system. Leveraging the symbolic system model, CommonPower facilitates the study of safeguarding strategies via the flexible formulation of safety layers. Furthermore equipped with a generic forecasting interface, CommonPower constitutes a versatile tool significantly augmenting the exploration of safe RL controllers in smart grids on several dimensions.</description>

Abstract: This paper develops a technique for computing a quadratic terminal cost for linear model predictive controllers that is valid for all states in the maximal control invariant set. This maximizes the set of recursively feasible states for the controller, ensures asymptotic stability using standard proofs, and allows for easy tuning of the controller in linear operation.</description>

      <title>Sound Heuristic Search Value Iteration for Undiscounted POMDPs with Reachability Objectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) are powerful models for sequential decision making under transition and observation uncertainties. This paper studies the challenging yet important problem in POMDPs known as the (indefinite-horizon) Maximal Reachability Probability Problem (MRPP), where the goal is to maximize the probability of reaching some target states. This is also a core problem in model checking with logical specifications and is naturally undiscounted (discount factor is one). Inspired by the success of point-based methods developed for discounted problems, we study their extensions to MRPP. Specifically, we focus on trial-based heuristic search value iteration techniques and present a novel algorithm that leverages the strengths of these techniques for efficient exploration of the belief space (informed search via value bounds) while addressing their drawbacks in handling loops for indefinite-horizon problems. The algorithm produces policies with two-sided bounds on optimal reachability probabilities. We prove convergence to an optimal policy from below under certain conditions. Experimental evaluations on a suite of benchmarks show that our algorithm outperforms existing methods in almost all cases in both probability guarantees and computation time.</description>

      <title>A Successive Gap Constraint Linearization Method for Optimal Control Problems with Equilibrium Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we propose a novel gap-constraint-based reformulation for optimal control problems with equilibrium constraints (OCPECs). We show that the proposed reformulation generates a new constraint system equivalent to the original one but more concise and with favorable differentiability. Moreover, constraint regularity can be recovered by a relaxation strategy. We show that the gap constraint and its gradient can be evaluated efficiently. We then propose a successive gap constraint linearization method to solve the discretized OCPEC. We also provide an intuitive geometric interpretation of the gap constraint. Numerical experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed reformulation and solution method.</description>

      <title>Amalgam: A Framework for Obfuscated Neural Network Training on the Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Training a proprietary Neural Network (NN) model with a proprietary dataset on the cloud comes at the risk of exposing the model architecture and the dataset to the cloud service provider. To tackle this problem, in this paper, we present an NN obfuscation framework, called Amalgam, to train NN models in a privacy-preserving manner in existing cloud-based environments. Amalgam achieves that by augmenting NN models and the datasets to be used for training with well-calibrated noise to "hide" both the original model architectures and training datasets from the cloud. After training, Amalgam extracts the original models from the augmented models and returns them to users. Our evaluation results with different computer vision and natural language processing models and datasets demonstrate that Amalgam: (i) introduces modest overheads into the training process without impacting its correctness, and (ii) does not affect the model's accuracy.</description>

Abstract: This paper introduces Physics-Informed Deep Equilibrium Models (PIDEQs) for solving initial value problems (IVPs) of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Leveraging recent advancements in deep equilibrium models (DEQs) and physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), PIDEQs combine the implicit output representation of DEQs with physics-informed training techniques. We validate PIDEQs using the Van der Pol oscillator as a benchmark problem, demonstrating their efficiency and effectiveness in solving IVPs. Our analysis includes key hyperparameter considerations for optimizing PIDEQ performance. By bridging deep learning and physics-based modeling, this work advances computational techniques for solving IVPs, with implications for scientific computing and engineering applications.</description>

      <title>A High-Gain Observer Approach to Robust Trajectory Estimation and Tracking for a Multi-rotor UAV</title>

      <description>arXiv:2103.13429v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the context of trajectory estimation and tracking for multi-rotor unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), we explore the challenges in applying high-gain observers to highly dynamic systems. The multi-rotor will operate in the presence of external disturbances and modeling errors. At the same time, the reference trajectory is unknown and generated from a reference system with unknown or partially known dynamics. We assume the only measurements that are available are the position and orientation of the multi-rotor and the position of the reference system. We adopt an extended high-gain observer (EHGO) estimation framework to estimate the unmeasured multi-rotor states, modeling errors, external disturbances, and the reference trajectory. We design a robust output feedback controller for trajectory tracking that comprises a feedback linearizing controller and the EHGO. The proposed control method is rigorously analyzed to establish its stability properties. Finally, we illustrate our theoretical results through numerical simulation and experimental validation in which a multi-rotor tracks a moving ground vehicle with an unknown trajectory and dynamics and successfully lands on the vehicle while in motion.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we propose matrix-scaled consensus algorithms for linear dynamical agents interacting over an undirected network. Under the proposed algorithms, the state vectors of all agents to asymptotically agree up to some matrix scaling weights. First, the algebraic properties of the matrix-scaled Laplacian and the geometry of the matrix-scaled consensus space are studied. Second, we examine matrix-scaled consensus algorithms for networks of single-integrators with or without constant parametric uncertainties. Nonlinear and finite-time matrix-scaled consensus algorithms are also proposed. Third, observer-based matrix-scaled consensus algorithms for homogeneous or heterogeneous linear-time invariant agents are designed. The convergence of the proposed algorithms is asserted by rigorous mathematical analysis and supported by numerical simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.19353v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the problem of stabilizing a leader-follower formation specified by a set of bearing constraints and being disturbed by some unknown uniformly bounded disturbance{s}. A set of leaders are positioned at their desired positions, while each follower is modeled by a single integrator with an additive time-varying disturbance. Adaptive variable-structure control laws using displacements or only bearing vectors are provided to stabilize the desired formation. Thanks to the adaptive mechanisms, the proposed control laws require neither information of the bearing Laplacian nor the disturbances' directions and upper bounds. It is further proved that when the leaders are moving with a same bounded uniformly continuous velocity, the moving target formation can still be achieved under the proposed control laws. Simulation results are also given to support the stability analysis.</description>

Abstract: With the development of CNC machine tools toward high speed and high precision, the traditional static design methods can hardly meet the demand. Hence, in this paper, the dynamics matching design methods of existing CNC machine tool feed systems were investigated and analyzed. Further, sub-system coupling mechanisms and optimization design studies were carried out for each sub-system. First, the required kinematic indexes must be achieved when designing the feed system dynamics of high-speed, high-precision CNC machine tools. Second, the CNC machine tool feed systems generally have four sub-systems: motion process, control system, motor, and mechanical structure. The coupling effect between the sub-systems should also be considered in the design. Based on the dynamics design, each sub-system should be optimized to maximize the system dynamic performance with minimum resource allocation. Finally, based on the review, future research directions within the field were detected.</description>

      <title>Optimized Pseudo-Linearization-Based Model Predictive Controller Design: Direct Data-Driven Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19367v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To reduce the typical time-consuming routines of plant modeling for model-based controller designs, the fictitious reference iterative tuning (FRIT) has been proposed and has proven to be effective in many applications. However, it is generally difficult to select a reference model properly without information on the plant, which significantly affects the control performance and sometimes leads to considerable performance degradation. To address this problem, we propose a pseudo-linearization (PL) method using FRIT and design a new controller for nonlinear systems that combines data-driven and model-based control. This design considers the input constraints using model predictive control. The effectiveness of the proposed method was evaluated according to several practical references using numerical simulations for nonlinear classes and experiments involving artificial muscles with hysteresis characteristics.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Control Against False Data Injection Attacks</title>

Abstract: The rise of cyber-security concerns has brought significant attention to the analysis and design of cyber-physical systems (CPSs). Among the various types of cyberattacks, denial-of-service (DoS) attacks and false data injection (FDI) attacks can be easily launched and have become prominent threats. While resilient control against DoS attacks has received substantial research efforts, countermeasures developed against FDI attacks have been relatively limited, particularly when explicit system models are not available. To address this gap, the present paper focuses on the design of data-driven controllers for unknown linear systems subject to FDI attacks on the actuators, utilizing input-state data. To this end, a general FDI attack model is presented, which imposes minimally constraints on the switching frequency of attack channels and the magnitude of attack matrices. A dynamic state feedback control law is designed based on offline and online input-state data, which adapts to the channel switching of FDI attacks. This is achieved by solving two data-based semi-definite programs (SDPs) on-the-fly to yield a tight approximation of the set of subsystems consistent with both offline clean data and online attack-corrupted data. It is shown that under mild conditions on the attack, the proposed SDPs are recursively feasible and controller achieves exponential stability. Numerical examples showcase its effectiveness in mitigating the impact of FDI attacks.</description>

      <title>On Metzler positive systems on hypergraphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03652v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In graph-theoretical terms, an edge in a graph connects two vertices while a hyperedge of a hypergraph connects any more than one vertices. If the hypergraph's hyperedges further connect the same number of vertices, it is said to be uniform. In algebraic graph theory, a graph can be characterized by an adjacency matrix, and similarly, a uniform hypergraph can be characterized by an adjacency tensor. This similarity enables us to extend existing tools of matrix analysis for studying dynamical systems evolving on graphs to the study of a class of polynomial dynamical systems evolving on hypergraphs utilizing the properties of tensors. To be more precise, in this paper, we first extend the concept of a Metzler matrix to a Metzler tensor and then describe some useful properties of such tensors. Next, we focus on positive systems on hypergraphs associated with Metzler tensors. More importantly, we design control laws to stabilize the origin of this class of Metzler positive systems on hypergraphs. In the end, we apply our findings to two classic dynamical systems: a higher-order Lotka-Volterra population dynamics system and a higher-order SIS epidemic dynamic process. The corresponding novel stability results are accompanied by ample numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable Power Converters with Increased Utilization for Unbalanced Power Distribution System Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03978v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A low-cost reconfiguration stage connected at the output of balanced three-phase, multi-terminal ac/dc/ac converters can increase the feasible set of power injections substantially, increasing converter utilization and therefore achieving a lower system cost. However, the approach has yet to be explored for phase unbalance mitigation in power distribution networks, an important application for future energy systems. This study addresses this by considering power converter reconfiguration's potential for increasing the feasible set of power transfers of four-wire power converters. Reconfigurable topologies are compared against both conventional four-wire designs and an idealised, fully reconfigurable converter. Results show that conventional converters need up to 75.3% greater capacity to yield a capability chart of equivalent size to an idealised reconfigurable converter. The number and capacity of legs impact the capability chart's size, as do constraints on dc-side power injections. The proposed approach shows significant promise for maximizing the utilization of power electronics used to mitigate impacts of phase unbalance.</description>

Abstract: This paper studies the stability of discrete-time polynomial dynamical systems on hypergraphs by utilizing the Perron-Frobenius theorem for nonnegative tensors with respect to the tensors Z-eigenvalues and Z-eigenvectors. Firstly, for a multilinear polynomial system on a uniform hypergraph, we study the stability of the origin of the corresponding systems. Next, we extend our results to non-homogeneous polynomial systems on non-uniform hypergraphs. We confirm that the local stability of any discrete-time polynomial system is in general dominated by pairwise terms. Assuming that the origin is locally stable, we construct a conservative (but explicit) region of attraction from the system parameters. Finally, we validate our results via some numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Learning Low-dimensional Latent Dynamics from High-dimensional Observations: Non-asymptotics and Lower Bounds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06089v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on learning a linear time-invariant (LTI) model with low-dimensional latent variables but high-dimensional observations. We provide an algorithm that recovers the high-dimensional features, i.e. column space of the observer, embeds the data into low dimensions and learns the low-dimensional model parameters. Our algorithm enjoys a sample complexity guarantee of order $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(n/\epsilon^2)$, where $n$ is the observation dimension. We further establish a fundamental lower bound indicating this complexity bound is optimal up to logarithmic factors and dimension-independent constants. We show that this inevitable linear factor of $n$ is due to the learning error of the observer's column space in the presence of high-dimensional noises. Extending our results, we consider a meta-learning problem inspired by various real-world applications, where the observer column space can be collectively learned from datasets of multiple LTI systems. An end-to-end algorithm is then proposed, facilitating learning LTI systems from a meta-dataset which breaks the sample complexity lower bound in certain scenarios.</description>

      <title>Chance-Constrained Economic Dispatch with Flexible Loads and RES</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15187v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the increasing penetration of intermittent renewable energy sources (RESs), it becomes increasingly challenging to maintain the supply-demand balance of power systems by solely relying on the generation side. To combat the volatility led by the uncertain RESs, demand-side management by leveraging the multi-dimensional flexibility (MDF) has been recognized as an economic and efficient approach. Thus, it is important to integrate MDF into existing power systems. In this paper, we propose an enhanced day-ahead energy market, where the MDFs of aggregate loads are traded to minimize the generation cost and mitigate the volatility of locational marginal prices (LMPs) in the transmission network. We first explicitly capture the negative impact of the uncertainty from RESs on the day-ahead market by a chance-constrained economic dispatch problem (CEDP). Then, we propose a bidding mechanism for the MDF of the aggregate loads and combine this mechanism into the CEDP for the day-ahead market. Through multiple case studies, we show that MDF from load aggregators can reduce the volatility of LMPs. In addition, we identify the values of the different flexibilities in the MDF bids, which provide useful insights into the design of more complex MDF markets.</description>

      <title>Robust Economic Dispatch with Flexible Demand and Adjustable Uncertainty Set</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15259v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With more renewable energy sources (RES) integrated into the power system, the intermittency of RES places a heavy burden on the system. The uncertainty of RES is traditionally handled by controllable generators to balance the real time wind power deviation. As the demand side management develops, the flexibility of aggregate loads can be leveraged to mitigate the negative impact of the wind power. In view of this, we study the problem of how to exploit the multi-dimensional flexibility of elastic loads to balance the trade-off between a low generation cost and a low system risk related to the wind curtailment and the power deficiency. These risks are captured by the conditional value-at-risk. Also, unlike most of the existing studies, the uncertainty set of the wind power output in our model is not fixed. By contrast, it is undetermined and co-optimized based on the available load flexibility. We transform the original optimization problem into a convex one using surrogate affine approximation such that it can be solved efficiently. In case studies, we apply our model on a six-bus transmission network and demonstrate that how flexible load aggregators can help to determine the optimal admissible region for the wind power deviations.</description>

      <title>Differentially-Private Distributed Model Predictive Control of Linear Discrete-Time Systems with Global Constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18690v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Distributed model predictive control (DMPC) has attracted extensive attention as it can explicitly handle system constraints and achieve optimal control in a decentralized manner. However, the deployment of DMPC strategies generally requires the sharing of sensitive data among subsystems, which may violate the privacy of participating systems. In this paper, we propose a differentially-private DMPC algorithm for linear discrete-time systems subject to coupled global constraints. Specifically, we first show that a conventional distributed dual gradient algorithm can be used to address the considered DMPC problem but cannot provide strong privacy preservation. Then, to protect privacy against the eavesdropper, we incorporate a differential-privacy noise injection mechanism into the DMPC framework and prove that the resulting distributed optimization algorithm can ensure both provable convergence to a global optimal solution and rigorous $\epsilon$-differential privacy. In addition, an implementation strategy of the DMPC is designed such that the recursive feasibility and stability of the closed-loop system are guaranteed. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed approach.</description>

      <title>Rao-Blackwellized Particle Smoothing for Simultaneous Localization and Mapping</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.03953v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) is the task of building a map representation of an unknown environment while at the same time using it for positioning. A probabilistic interpretation of the SLAM task allows for incorporating prior knowledge and for operation under uncertainty. Contrary to the common practice of computing point estimates of the system states, we capture the full posterior density through approximate Bayesian inference. This dynamic learning task falls under state estimation, where the state-of-the-art is in sequential Monte Carlo methods that tackle the forward filtering problem. In this paper, we introduce a framework for probabilistic SLAM using particle smoothing that does not only incorporate observed data in current state estimates, but it also back-tracks the updated knowledge to correct for past drift and ambiguities in both the map and in the states. Our solution can efficiently handle both dense and sparse map representations by Rao-Blackwellization of conditionally linear and conditionally linearized models. We show through simulations and real-world experiments how the principles apply to radio (BLE/Wi-Fi), magnetic field, and visual SLAM. The proposed solution is general, efficient, and works well under confounding noise.</description>

      <title>Are More LLM Calls All You Need? Towards Scaling Laws of Compound Inference Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02419v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many recent state-of-the-art results in language tasks were achieved using compound systems that perform multiple Language Model (LM) calls and aggregate their responses. However, there is little understanding of how the number of LM calls - e.g., when asking the LM to answer each question multiple times and taking a majority vote - affects such a compound system's performance. In this paper, we initiate the study of scaling properties of compound inference systems. We analyze, theoretically and empirically, how the number of LM calls affects the performance of Vote and Filter-Vote, two of the simplest compound system designs, which aggregate LM responses via majority voting, optionally applying LM filters. We find, surprisingly, that across multiple language tasks, the performance of both Vote and Filter-Vote can first increase but then decrease as a function of the number of LM calls. Our theoretical results suggest that this non-monotonicity is due to the diversity of query difficulties within a task: more LM calls lead to higher performance on "easy" queries, but lower performance on "hard" queries, and non-monotone behavior can emerge when a task contains both types of queries. This insight then allows us to compute, from a small number of samples, the number of LM calls that maximizes system performance, and define an analytical scaling model for both systems. Experiments show that our scaling model can accurately predict the performance of Vote and Filter-Vote systems and thus find the optimal number of LM calls to make.</description>

      <title>Intrusion Tolerance for Networked Systems through Two-Level Feedback Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01741v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formulate intrusion tolerance for a system with service replicas as a two-level optimal control problem. On the local level node controllers perform intrusion recovery, and on the global level a system controller manages the replication factor. The local and global control problems can be formulated as classical problems in operations research, namely, the machine replacement problem and the inventory replenishment problem. Based on this formulation, we design TOLERANCE, a novel control architecture for intrusion-tolerant systems. We prove that the optimal control strategies on both levels have threshold structure and design efficient algorithms for computing them. We implement and evaluate TOLERANCE in an emulation environment where we run 10 types of network intrusions. The results show that TOLERANCE can improve service availability and reduce operational cost compared with state-of-the-art intrusion-tolerant systems.</description>

      <title>Lyapunov-stable Neural Control for State and Output Feedback: A Novel Formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07956v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning-based neural network (NN) control policies have shown impressive empirical performance in a wide range of tasks in robotics and control. However, formal (Lyapunov) stability guarantees over the region-of-attraction (ROA) for NN controllers with nonlinear dynamical systems are challenging to obtain, and most existing approaches rely on expensive solvers such as sums-of-squares (SOS), mixed-integer programming (MIP), or satisfiability modulo theories (SMT). In this paper, we demonstrate a new framework for learning NN controllers together with Lyapunov certificates using fast empirical falsification and strategic regularizations. We propose a novel formulation that defines a larger verifiable region-of-attraction (ROA) than shown in the literature, and refines the conventional restrictive constraints on Lyapunov derivatives to focus only on certifiable ROAs. The Lyapunov condition is rigorously verified post-hoc using branch-and-bound with scalable linear bound propagation-based NN verification techniques. The approach is efficient and flexible, and the full training and verification procedure is accelerated on GPUs without relying on expensive solvers for SOS, MIP, nor SMT. The flexibility and efficiency of our framework allow us to demonstrate Lyapunov-stable output feedback control with synthesized NN-based controllers and NN-based observers with formal stability guarantees, for the first time in literature.

      <description>arXiv:2406.01904v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Animals have evolved to rapidly detect and recognise brief and intermittent encounters with odour packages, exhibiting recognition capabilities within milliseconds. Artificial olfaction has faced challenges in achieving comparable results -- existing solutions are either slow; or bulky, expensive, and power-intensive -- limiting applicability in real-world scenarios for mobile robotics. Here we introduce a miniaturised high-speed electronic nose; characterised by high-bandwidth sensor readouts, tightly controlled sensing parameters and powerful algorithms. The system is evaluated on a high-fidelity odour delivery benchmark. We showcase successful classification of tens-of-millisecond odour pulses, and demonstrate temporal pattern encoding of stimuli switching with up to 60 Hz. Those timescales are unprecedented in miniaturised low-power settings, and demonstrably exceed the performance observed in mice. For the first time, it is possible to match the temporal resolution of animal olfaction in robotic systems. This will allow for addressing challenges in environmental and industrial monitoring, security, neuroscience, and beyond.</description>
