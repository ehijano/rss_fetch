      <title>Magnetosonic Waves as a Driver of Observed Temperature Fluctuation Patterns in AGN Accretion Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observations have revealed slow, coherent temperature fluctuations in AGN disks that propagate both inward and outward at velocities of $\sim 0.01 - 0.1c$, a kind of variability that is distinct from reverberation (mediated by the reprocessing of light) between different regions of the disk. We investigate the origin and nature of these fluctuations using global 3D radiation-magnetohydrodynamic simulations of radiation and magnetic pressure-dominated AGN accretion disks. Disks with a significant turbulent Maxwell stress component exhibit wave-like temperature perturbations, most evident close to the midplane, whose propagation speeds exactly match the local fast magnetosonic speed and are consistent with the speeds inferred in observations. These fluctuations have amplitudes of $2 - 4\%$ in gas temperature, which are also consistent with observational constraints. Disks that are dominated by mean-field Maxwell stresses do not exhibit such waves. While waves may be present in the body of the disk, we do not find them to be present in the photosphere. Although this may in part be due to low numerical resolution in the photosphere region, we discuss the physical challenges that must be overcome for the waves to manifest there. In particular, the fact that such waves are observed implies that the disk photospheres must be magnetically dominated, since radiative damping from photon diffusion smooths out radiation pressure fluctuations. Furthermore, the gas and radiation fluctuations must be out of local thermodynamic equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Acceleration of Neutron Star Pulse Profile Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ray tracing algorithms that compute pulse profiles from rotating neutron stars are essential tools for constraining neutron-star properties with data from missions such as NICER. However, the high computational cost of these simulations presents a significant bottleneck for inference algorithms that require millions of evaluations, such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. In this work, we develop a residual neural network model that accelerates this calculation by predicting the observed flux from the surface of a spinning neutron star as a function of its physical parameters and rotational phase. Leveraging GPU-parallelized evaluation, we demonstrate that our model achieves many orders-of-magnitude speedup compared to traditional ray tracing while maintaining high accuracy. We also show that the trained network can efficiently accommodate complex emission geometries, including non-circular and multiple hot spots, by integrating over localized flux predictions.</description>

      <title>Multi-band Emission from Star-Disk Collision and Implications for Quasi-Periodic Eruptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform two-dimensional, multi-group radiation hydrodynamic simulations to explore the observational properties of a solar-like star colliding with an accretion disk around a supermassive black hole at separation of $\sim 100$ gravitational radii. We find that the star-disk collision produces ejecta on both sides of the disk. As the ejecta expand and cool, transient flares arise, reaching peak bolometric luminosity of up to $L\gtrsim10^{43}\rm erg~s^{-1}$. We estimate that the typical light curve rises and decays on an hour timescale. The spectral energy distribution (SED) peaks in $20-50$eV. The optical depth in soft X-rays is lower than the frequency-integrated optical depth, yielding $100$eV-$1$KeV luminosity $\nu L_{\nu}\gtrsim10^{42}\rm erg~s^{-1}$. The ejecta aligned with the star's incident direction shows breakout emission, leading to asymmetric SED evolution of the two ejecta. The SED evolution is roughly consistent with those seen in short-period quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs), which have eruption duration ranging from sub-hour to hours, but the ejecta cooling emission alone may not be sufficient to explain the longer duration flares. Increasing incident velocity generally produces a brighter and harder flare. A larger disk scale height prolongs the breakout emission but leads to a somewhat softer SED. A higher disk surface density can lead to higher ejecta temperature, reducing bound-free opacity and increasing luminosity. When lowering the disk surface density, we find that the ejecta becomes optically thin when the scattering optical depth across disk is at the order of $\tau_{\rm disk}\sim200$, and the ejecta disappear when $\tau_{\rm disk}\sim10$.</description>

      <title>Properties and microscopic structures of dense stellar matter in RMF models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11492v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data tables on the equation of state (EOS) and microscopic structures for cold dense stellar matter with proton fractions $Y_p =0.01$-$0.65$ and baryon number densities $n_\text{b}=10^{-8}$-$2 \ \mathrm{fm}^{-3}$ are obtained adopting 13 different relativistic density functionals, i.e., NL3, PK1, PK1r, GM1, MTVTC, DD-LZ1, PKDD, DD-ME2, TW99, DD-MEX, DD-MEX1, DD-MEX2, and DD-MEY. The EOSs of dense stellar matter inside neutron stars with baryon number densities $n_\text{b}=7.6\times 10^{-11}$-$2 \ \mathrm{fm}^{-3}$ are obtained as well fulfilling $\beta$-stability condition. In general, the dense stellar matter exhibits droplet phase at $n_\mathrm{b}\lesssim 0.015\ \mathrm{fm}^{-3}$, while more exotic structures such as rods, slabs, tubes, and bubbles appear sequentially as density increases. The critical proton fractions $Y_p^\mathrm{drip}$ ($\approx 0.26$-0.31) for neutron drip are obtained, where neutron gas emerges outside of nuclei at $Y_p&lt; Y_p^\mathrm{drip}$. For dense stellar matter at small densities ($n_\text{b}\lesssim 10^{-5} \ \mathrm{fm}^{-3}$) or large proton fractions ($n_\text{b}\lesssim0.1 \ \mathrm{fm}^{-3}$ and $Y_p\gtrsim Y_p^\mathrm{drip}$), the EOSs and microscopic structures are generally insensitive to the adopted density functionals. With the onset of neutron drip at $Y_p\lesssim Y_p^\mathrm{drip}$, the uncertainties emerge and peak at $n_\text{b} \approx 0.02 \ \mathrm{fm}^{-3}$ within the range $10^{-5} \lesssim n_\text{b}\lesssim0.1 \ \mathrm{fm}^{-3}$. At $n_\text{b}\gtrsim0.1 \ \mathrm{fm}^{-3}$, the dense stellar matter becomes uniform and muons eventually appear, where the uncertainties in the EOSs grow significantly.</description>

      <title>Event-by-event reconstruction of air-shower events with IceCube using a two component lateral distribution function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The IceCube Neutrino Observatory, located at the geographic South Pole, comprises a surface component, IceTop, and an optical in-ice array. This unique com\-bi\-na\-tion allows for coincident measurements of low-energy ($\sim \rm{GeV}$) and high-energy ($\gtrsim 400\,\rm{GeV}$) muons produced in cosmic-ray air showers. The ratio of the low- and high-energy muon yields can constitute a useful tool not only for composition analyses but also for testing different hadronic interaction models. However, since IceTop does not feature dedicated muon detectors, the measurement of the low-energy muon component for individual air showers is challenging. In this work, a new approach for a single-event based estimation of the low-energy muon content using a two component lateral distribution function (LDF) is utilized. This method combines an analytic description for the electromagnetic and muon lateral distributions of the total signal, with an aim to reconstruct primary energy and low-energy muon number, respectively. The underlying principle of this method as well as the resulting reconstruction performance will be detailed in this work.</description>

      <title>Numerical analysis of quasiperiodic oscillations in the Hartle-Thorne spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We numerically analyze quasiperiodic oscillations (QPOs) using a well-established spacetime model with neutron star sources. Within the framework of general relativity, we present expressions for the fundamental frequencies of test particles in the gravitational field of a slowly rotating and slightly deformed compact object defined by the Hartle-Thorne (HT) metric. Using the Relativistic Precession Model (RPM) formulated by Stella and Morinsk, we examine quasiperiodic oscillation data from eight neutron stars in low-mass X-ray binary systems. Employing Markov Chain Monte Carlo analyses with the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, we estimate 1-$\sigma$ and 2-$\sigma$ error bars. Finally, we compare our results with predictions from the Schwarzschild, Lense-Thirring, and Kerr metrics, demonstrating that three of the eight sources can be well explained within the Hartle-Thorne model.</description>

      <title>Comparing the Space Densities of Millisecond-Spin Magnetars and Fast X-Ray Transients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast X-ray transients (FXTs) are bright X-ray flashes with durations of minutes to hours, peak isotropic luminosities of L_X,peak ~ 10^42-10^47 erg/s, and total isotropic energies of E ~ 10^47-10^50 erg. They have been detected in the soft X-ray band by Chandra, XMM-Newton, Swift-XRT, and, most recently, by Einstein Probe, which has reported more than 50 FXTs in its first year of operation. While several models have been proposed, the nature of many FXTs remains unknown. One model suggests FXTs are powered by the spin-down of newly formed millisecond magnetars, typically produced by binary neutron star (BNS) mergers. However, the BNS volumetric rate, ~10^2 Gpc^-3 yr^-1, barely overlaps with the estimated FXT rate of 10^3-10^4 Gpc^-3 yr^-1. Even within that overlap, BNS mergers would need to produce FXTs at nearly 100% efficiency. We explore whether other millisecond magnetar formation channels could account for this discrepancy. We compile rate densities for several proposed progenitors: accretion-induced collapse of white dwarfs, binary white dwarf mergers, neutron star-white dwarf mergers, and the collapse of massive stars, and convert Galactic event rates into volumetric rates using either the star formation rate or the stellar mass density distributions as a function of redshift. We find that the highest potential formation rates arise from binary white dwarf mergers and massive star collapses. However, both channels face theoretical and observational challenges: the spin and magnetic field properties of the resulting neutron stars are uncertain, and few are expected to satisfy both conditions required for FXT production. Across all scenarios, the fraction of suitable millisecond magnetars is low or poorly constrained. We conclude that they are unlikely to be the dominant progenitors of FXTs and can contribute to at most 10% of the observed FXT population.</description>

      <title>The Energy Spectrum of Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Rays across Declinations $-90^\circ$ to $+44.8^\circ$ as measured at the Pierre Auger Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The energy spectrum of cosmic rays above 2.5 EeV has been measured across the declination range $-90^\circ \leq\delta\leq +44.8^\circ$ using data from $\sim 310{,}000$ events accrued at the Pierre Auger Observatory from an exposure of $(104{,}900\pm 3{,}100)$ km$^2\,$sr$\,$yr. No significant variations of energy spectra with declination are observed, after allowing or not for non-uniformities across the sky arising from the well-established dipolar anisotropies in the arrival directions of ultra-high energy cosmic rays. Additionally, the instep feature in the spectrum at $\simeq$ 10 EeV reported previously is now established at a significance above $5\,\sigma$. The quasi-uniformity of the energy spectrum across declinations disfavors an origin for the instep from a few distinctive sources.</description>

      <title>Gapless neutron superfluidity in the crust of the accreting neutron stars KS 1731-260 and MXB 1659-29</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interpretation of the thermal evolution of the transiently accreting neutron stars MXB 1659-29 and KS 1731-260 after an outburst is challenging, both within the traditional deep-crustal heating paradigm and the thermodynamically consistent approach of Gusakov and Chugunov that accounts for neutron diffusion throughout the crust. All these studies assume that the neutron superfluid in the crust is at rest. However, we have recently shown that a finite superflow could exist and could lead to a new gapless superfluid phase if quantized vortices are pinned. We have revisited the cooling of MXB 1659-29 and KS 1731-260 and we have found that gapless superfluidity could naturally explain their late time cooling. We pursue here our investigation by performing new simulations of the thermal relaxation of the crust of MXB 1659-29 and KS 1731-260 within a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method accounting for neutron diffusion and allowing for gapless superfluidity. We have varied the global structure of the neutron star, the composition of the heat-blanketing envelope, and the mass accretion rate. In all cases, observations are best fitted by models with gapless superfluidity. Finally, we make predictions that could be tested by future observations.</description>

      <title>A Hyperactive FRB Pinpointed in an SMC-Like Satellite Host Galaxy</title>

Abstract: Precise localizations of fast radio bursts (FRBs) are essential for uncovering their host galaxies and immediate environments. We present the milliarcsecond-precision European VLBI Network (EVN) localization of FRB 20240114A, a hyper-active repeating FRB, achieving &lt;90x30 mas (1-sigma) accuracy. This precision places the burst 0.5 kpc from the nucleus of its low-metallicity star-forming dwarf host at a spectroscopic redshift of z = 0.1300. Our Gran Telescopio CANARIAS (GTC) spectroscopic follow-up reveals that the dwarf FRB host is gravitationally bound to a more massive, star-forming spiral galaxy. This establishes the first known instance of an FRB residing in a satellite galaxy within a larger galactic system. This configuration, analogous to the Small Magellanic Cloud orbiting the Milky Way (but at a lower overall mass scale), expands the known diversity of FRB host environments and offers important insights for interpreting seemingly "hostless" or highly offset FRBs. Furthermore, our detailed dispersion measure (DM) budget analysis indicates that the dominant contribution to FRB 20240114A's DM likely originates from the foreground halo of the central galaxy. This finding addresses the anomalously high DM observed for this FRB and underscores the significant role of intervening foreground structures in shaping observed FRB DMs, which is important for accurate FRB-based cosmological measurements. Our results highlight the importance of deep, high-resolution optical/infrared observations (e.g., with Hubble or James Webb Space Telescopes) to fully leverage our precise radio localization and probe the immediate astrophysical birthplaces of FRB progenitors within these complex galactic systems.</description>

      <title>A solution to the tension of burning on neutron stars and nuclear physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When neutron stars accrete matter from a companion star, this matter forms a disc around them and eventually falls on their surface. Here, the fuel can ignite into bright flashes called Type I bursts. Theoretical calculations based on state-of-the-art nuclear reactions are able to explain many features of the bursts. However, models predict that the bursts should cease at high accretion rates, whereas in many sources they disappear at much lower rates. Moreover, their recurrence times also show strong discrepancies with predictions. Although various solutions have been proposed, none can account for all the observational constraints. Here we describe a new model that explains all the contradictory behaviours within a single picture. We are able to reconstruct the conditions on the star surface that determine the burst properties by comparing data to new simulations. We find strong evidence that the physical mechanism driving the burst behaviour is the structure of the accretion disc in the regions closest to the star. This connection reconciles the puzzling burst phenomenology with nuclear physics and also opens a new window on the study of accretion processes around compact objects.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Guide to the U.S. Civil Space Budget</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an overview of the U.S. federal civil space budget between FY23 and proposed spending in FY25, providing a foundational reference dataset for civil space budget analyses. Projects that support, enable, or leverage space activities for civil purposes are found in more than 100 individual line items spread across 17 federal departments and agencies and are funded by 4 different appropriations bills. Across all these elements, civil space-related appropriations total roughly 44 billion dollars in FY25, of which NASA constitutes about 58 percent (Figure 1).
  To better view the cross-cutting nature of space missions and the support that enables them, the second half of this report introduces a novel representation of the civil space budget by organizing the data into six national priority areas: American Leadership and Manufacturing; Workforce Development; Fundamental Science; Efficiency, Improvements, and Growth; Homeland Security; Infrastructure, Energy, and Resiliency; and Remote Sensing Applications (Figure 2). This organization of the data highlights the ubiquity of space-related activity throughout diverse sectors to reach the same common goal.</description>

      <title>Physical Constraint Preserving Higher Order Finite Volume Schemes for Divergence-Free Astrophysical MHD and RMHD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Higher order finite volume schemes for magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) and relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD) are very valuable because they allow us to carry out astrophysical simulations with very high accuracy. However, astrophysical problems sometimes have unusually large Mach numbers, exceptionally high Lorentz factors and very strong magnetic fields. All these effects cause higher order codes to become brittle and prone to code crashes. In this paper we document physical constraint preserving (PCP) methods for treating numerical MHD and RMHD. While unnecessary for standard problems, for stringent astrophysical problems these methods show their value. We describe higher order methods that allow divergence-free evolution of the magnetic field. We present a novel two-dimensional Riemann solver. This two-dimensional Riemann solver plays a key role in the design of PCP schemes for MHD and RMHD. We present a very simple PCP formulation and show how it is amalgamated with the evolution of face-centered magnetic fields. The methods presented here are time-explicit and do not add much to the computational cost. We show that the methods meet their design accuracies and work well on problems that would otherwise be considered too extreme for typical higher order Godunov methods of the type used in computational astrophysics.</description>

      <title>Modeling Gravitational Wave Bias from 3D Power Spectra of Spectroscopic Surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a framework for relating gravitational wave (GW) sources to the astrophysical properties of spectroscopic galaxy samples. We show how this can enable using clustering measurements of gravitational wave (GW) sources to infer the relationship between the GW sources and the astrophysical properties of their host galaxies. We accomplish this by creating mock GW catalogs from the spectroscopic Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) DR7 galaxy survey. We populate the GWs using a joint host-galaxy probability function defined over stellar mass, star formation rate (SFR), and metallicity. This probability is modeled as the product of three broken power-law distributions, each with a turnover point motivated by astrophysical processes governing the relation between current-day galaxy properties and BBH mergers, such as galaxy quenching and BBH delay time. Our results show that GW bias is most sensitive to host-galaxy probability dependence on stellar mass, with increases of up to $\sim O (10)\%$ relative to galaxy bias as the stellar mass pivot scale rises. We also find a notable relationship between GW bias and SFR: when the host-galaxy probability favors low-SFR galaxies, the GW bias significantly increases. In contrast, we observe no strong correlation between GW bias and metallicity. These findings suggest that the spatial clustering of GW sources is primarily driven by the stellar mass and SFR of their host galaxies and shows how GW bias measurements can inform models of the host-galaxy probability function.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Scattering of Two Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first numerical relativity simulations of the gravitational scattering of two neutron stars. Constraint-satisfying initial data for two equal-mass non-spinning sequences are constructed at fixed energy and various initial angular momenta (impact parameter) and evolved with Einstein equations through the scattering process. The strong-field scattering dynamics are explored up to scattering angles of $225^\circ$ and the threshold of dynamical captures. The transition to bound orbits is aided by significant mass ejecta up to baryon mass ${\sim}1M_\odot$. A quantitative comparison with predictions of the scattering angle from state-of-the-art effective-one-body and post-Minkowskian calculations indicates quantitative agreement for large initial angular momenta although significant discrepancies in the tidal contribution emerge towards the capture threshold. Gravitational waveforms and radiated energy are in qualitative agreement with the analogous black hole problem and state-of-the-art effective-one-body predictions. Towards the capture threshold waveforms from scattering dynamics carry a strong imprint of matter effects, including the stars' $f$-mode excitations during the close encounter. Overall, our simulations open a new avenue to study tidal interactions in the relativistic two-body problem.</description>

      <title>X-ray investigation of the remarkable galaxy group Nest200047</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11312v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Galaxy groups are more susceptible to feedback from the central active galactic nuclei (AGN) due to their lower gravitational binding energy compared to clusters. This makes them ideal laboratories to study feedback effects on the overall energy and baryonic mass budget. We study the LOFAR-detected galaxy group Nest200047, where there is clear evidence of multiple generations of radio lobes from the AGN. Using 140 ks Chandra and 25 ks XMM-Newton data, we investigate thermodynamic properties of the the intragroup medium including any excess energy due to the central AGN. We also investigate X-ray properties of the central black hole and constrain the $2-10$ keV X-ray flux. We used spectral analysis techniques to measure various thermodynamic profiles across the whole field of view. We also used both imaging and spectral analysis to detect and estimate the energy deposited by potential shocks and cavities. Due to the faint emission from the object beyond the core, various background effects were considered. Nest200047 has significant excess entropy, and the AGN likely contributes to a part of it. There is an excess energy of $(5-6.5) \times 10^{60}$ erg within 400 kpc, exceeding the binding energy. The pressure profile indicates that gas is likely being ejected from the system, resulting in a baryon fraction of $\sim4\%$ inside $r_{500}$. From scaling relations, we estimate a black hole mass of $(1-4)\times 10^9 M_{\odot}$. An upper limit of $2.1 \times 10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$ was derived on the black hole bolometric luminosity, which is $\sim$2.5% of the Bondi accretion power. Nest200047 is likely part of a class of over-heated galaxy groups like ESO 3060170, AWM 4 and AWM 5. Such excessive heating may lead to high quenching of star formation. Moreover, the faint X-ray nuclear emission in Nest is likely due to the accretion energy being converted into jets rather than radiation.</description>

      <title>Effective supernova dust yields from rotating and non-rotating stellar progenitors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supernovae (SNe) are believed to be the dominant sources of dust production at high redshift. However, the reverse shock generated by the interaction of the SN forward shock and the interstellar medium (ISM) significantly reduces the mass of newly formed dust in SN ejecta. This study quantifies the mass, composition, and grain size distribution of surviving dust after the passage of the reverse shock using the GRASHrev model. Our analysis covers a grid of SN models with progenitor masses $13\,M_\odot\leq m_\star\leq120M_\odot$, metallicity $-3\leq\text{[Fe/H]}\leq0$, and rotation velocities $v = 0$ and $300\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$. The SN explosions occur in a uniform ISM with densities $n_\text{ISM} = 0.05, 0.5$, and $5\text{ cm}^{-3}$. We find that the larger grains ($\gtrsim10\text{ nm}$) are more resistant to destruction by the reverse shock, with amorphous carbon dominating the surviving dust mass in most models. The surviving dust mass decreases with increasing ISM density. For non-rotating progenitors, the maximum mass of dust surviving the passage of the reverse shock is $\simeq 0.02\,M_\odot$ released by SN explosions of a $120\,M_\odot$ progenitor with $\text{[Fe/H]}=0$ in the ISM density $0.5\,\text{cm}^{-3}$, corresponding to $\simeq4\%$ of the initial dust mass before the passage of the reverse shock. Among rotating progenitors, a maximum surviving mass fraction is $\simeq5\%$ with a final dust mass $\simeq0.03\,M_\odot$ in $\text{[Fe/H]}=-1$ models. Although the reverse shock has a strong destructive impact, our results indicate that, on very short timescales, SNe can enrich the ISM with carbonaceous grains ranging in size from approximately $1\text{ nm}$ to $100\text{ nm}$ (up to $\simeq1\,\mathrm{\mu m}$ in non-rotating models). This is notable given the detection of the 2175 \r{A} extinction bump in galaxies at $z&gt;6$, suggesting the early presence of such dust.</description>

      <title>The possibility of multi-TeV secondary gamma rays from GRB221009A</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05402v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The brightest gamma ray burst (GRB) ever observed, GRB221009A, produced a surprisingly large flux of gamma rays with multi-TeV energies, which are expected to be absorbed in interactions with extragalactic background light (EBL). If the highest energy gamma rays were produced at the source, their spectral shape would have to exhibit a nonphysical spike even for the lowest levels of EBL. We show that, for widely accepted models of EBL, the data can be explained by secondary gamma rays produced in cosmic ray interactions along the line of sight, as long as the extragalactic magnetic fields along the line of sight are $10^{-16}$G or smaller, assuming 1 Mpc correlation length. Our interpretation supports the widely held expectation that GRB jets can accelerate cosmic rays to energies as high as 10 EeV and above, and it has implications for understanding the magnitudes of EGMFs.</description>

      <title>Two-component jet model for the afterglow emission of GRB 201216C and GRB 221009A and implications for jet structure of very-high-energy gamma-ray bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19051v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, afterglow emission in the very-high-energy (VHE) band above 100 GeV has been clearly detected for at least five gamma-ray bursts (GRBs 180720B, 190114C, 190829A, 201216C and 221009A). For some of these VHE GRBs, we previously proposed a two-component jet model, consisting of two uniform jets with narrow and wide opening angles to explain their multiwavelength afterglows including VHE gamma rays. In this paper, we show that the VHE spectra and light curves of GRBs 201216C and 221009A can also be reasonably explained by our two-component jet model, based on two top-hat jets propagating into a constant-density circumburst medium. We find that for the five VHE GRBs, the collimation-corrected kinetic energies of the narrow and wide jets have typical values of 5*10^{49} erg and 5*10^{50} erg, respectively. We discuss the similarities and differences among the VHE GRBs, and the implications for the structure of their jets. In agreement with previous studies, the narrow jet of GRB 221009A has an atypically small opening angle, so that its intrinsic, collimation-corrected energy remains within a plausible range despite the unusually large isotropic-equivalent energy.</description>

      <title>Variability study of classical supergiant X-ray binary 4U 1907+09 using NuSTAR</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02791v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the X-ray variability of the supergiant X-ray binary 4U 1907+09 using the new NuSTAR observation of 2024. The source had a relatively stable flux level during previous NuSTAR observations, but the flux varied significantly during the current one. The light curve exhibits dips (off-state) and flares (on-state). The phase-coherent timing analysis during the on-state yields a pulse period of $443.99(4)~\mathrm{s}$, showing the pulsar's continued spin-down. The pulse profiles show an asymmetric double-peaked structure with a phase separation of 0.47 between the two peaks. A cyclotron resonance scattering feature (CRSF) is also detected at $\sim 17.6~\mathrm{keV}$, along with its harmonic at $\sim 38~\mathrm{keV}$, persisting across all flux states. Flux-resolved spectroscopy reveals that the CRSF remains constant despite a 25-fold change in flux. The spectral parameters like photon index and e-fold energy are out of phase with the pulse shape, whereas cutoff energy is in phase with the pulse shape. The source's luminosity during the on-state is $2.85 \times 10^{35}~\mathrm{erg~s^{-1}}$, consistent with a "pencil" beam radiation pattern expected at this flux level from a collisionless gas-mediated shock. These results offer further insights into the accretion dynamics and magnetic field geometry of this system.</description>

      <title>Alien Type Ia supernovae from the Milky Way merger history and one possible candidate: Kepler's supernova</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03085v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Milky Way is a dynamic and evolving system shaped by numerous merger events throughout its history. These mergers bring stars with kinematic and dynamic properties differing from the main stellar population. However, it remains uncertain whether any of the Galactic supernova remnants can be attributed to such a merger origin. In this work, we compare the progenitor of Kepler's supernova to its nearby stars, ``alien'' stars, and in-situ Milky Way stellar populations. We uncover the abnormal kinematics and dynamics of Kepler's supernova and propose that its progenitor may have an extragalactic origin. We call the Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) produced by stars accreted into the Milky Way through merger events ``alien SNe Ia'' since they are cosmic immigrants. We estimate the rate of alien SNe Ia exploded recently using two methods: through galactic chemical evolution, and through a method without considering exact star formation history, introduced for the first time in this paper. We consider the past accretion of a few major satellite galaxies -- Kraken, Gaia-Enceladus-Sausage, the Helmi streams, Sequoia, Sagittarius, Wukong/LMS-1, and Cetus -- assuming these were dry mergers. The first method yields $1.5\times 10^{-5} - 5.0\times10^{-5}\rm\,yr^{-1}$, while the second method yields a comparable ${3.1}^{+1.8}_{-{1.1}}\times10^{-5}\rm\,yr^{-1}$ as the rate estimates for recent alien SNe Ia. These estimates represent lower bounds because we assumed no postmerger star formation.</description>

Abstract: Previous studies suggest that the Galactic diffuse X-ray emission is composed of unresolved point sources, primarily mCVs. However, nearby mCVs have a much lower 6.7 keV line equivalent width ($\rm EW_{6.7}$) compared to the diffuse X-ray emission. Therefore, the primary contributors to the unresolved X-ray emission remain unclear. We detected a total of 859 sources in the 6.5-7 keV band using XMM-Newton observations of the inner Galactic disc, of which 72 sources show significant iron line emission at 6.7 keV. The distribution of spectral index $\Gamma$ for these 72 sources is bimodal, with peaks at $\Gamma=0.5\pm0.4$ and $1.8\pm0.3$, suggesting two populations of sources. The soft X-ray sources have significantly larger $\rm EW_{6.7}$ than the hard X-ray sources. Furthermore, 18 of the 32 hard sources are associated with previously known CVs. We identify CV candidates in our sample as those with spectral index $\Gamma&lt;1.25$. The line ratio, 2-10 keV luminosity, and previous detection of spin period suggest that most of these hard sources are mCVs. The distribution of the $\rm EW_{6.7}$ line for the combined sample of previously identified and candidate CVs has a mean value of &lt;$\rm EW_{6.7}$&gt;$=415\pm39$ eV. Furthermore, we computed the stacked spectra of all sources detected in the 6.5-7 keV band for different flux groups, and we find evidence in the stacked spectra of hard sources that the $\rm EW_{6.7}$ increases with decreasing flux. The soft X-ray sources have &lt;$\rm EW_{6.7}$&gt;$=1.1\pm0.1$ keV. We identified 13 of the 30 soft sources associated with active stars, young stellar objects, and active binaries of RS CVn type. The &lt;$\rm EW_{6.7}$&gt; of our CV candidate sample is more than twice as large as the typical $\rm EW_{6.7}$ found in mCVs within 500 pc, and the &lt;$\rm EW_{6.7}$&gt; of our CV candidate sample is close to the $\rm EW_{6.7}$ value of Galactic diffuse X-ray emission.</description>

      <title>A Parameter Survey of Neutron Star Accretion Column Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02288</link>

Abstract: We conduct a parameter survey of neutron star accretion column simulations by solving the relativistic radiation MHD equations with opacities that account for strong magnetic fields and pair production. We study how column properties depend on accretion rate, magnetic field strength, and accretion flow geometry. All the simulated accretion columns exhibit kHz oscillatory behavior, consistent with our previous findings. We show how the predicted oscillation properties depend on the column parameters. At higher accretion rates for fixed magnetic field, the column height increases, reducing the local field strength and leading to an anti-correlation between the observed cyclotron line energy and luminosity. We estimate the line energy from the simulations and find agreement with the observed trend. Downward scattering in the free-fall zone plays a key role in shaping sideways emission properties and column height. Strong downward scattering not only re-injects heat back into the column, increasing its height, but also compresses sideways emission, potentially smearing out shock oscillation signals. When the pair-production regime is reached at the base of the column, the system quickly readjusts to a force balance between gravity and radiative support. The high opacity in the pair-production region raises the radiation energy density, enhancing sideways emission through a large horizontal gradient. This shifts the sideways fan-beam radiation toward lower altitudes. In a hollow column geometry, both pencil- and fan-beam radiation emission occurs. Self-illumination across the hollow region increases the height and stabilizes the inner wall of the column, while shock oscillations persist in the outer regions.</description>

      <title>Deep Neural Networks Hunting Ultra-Light Dark Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04100v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultra-light dark matter (ULDM) is a compelling candidate for cosmological dark matter. If ULDM interacts with ordinary matter, it can induce measurable, characteristic signals in pulsar-timing data because it causes the orbits of pulsars in binary systems to osculate. In this work, we investigate the potential of machine learning (ML) techniques to detect such ULDM signals. To this end, we construct three types of neural networks: an autoencoder, a binary classifier, and a multiclass classifier. We apply these methods to four theoretically well-motivated ULDM models: a linearly coupled scalar field, a quadratically coupled scalar field, a vector field and a tensor field. We show that the sensitivity achieved using ML methods is comparable to that of a semi-analytical Bayesian approach, which to date has only been applied to the linear scalar case. The ML approach is readily applicable to all four ULDM models and, in the case of the multiclass classifier, can distinguish between them. Our results, derived from simulated data, lay the foundation for future applications to real pulsar-timing observations.</description>

      <title>Varstrometry for Off-nucleus and Dual sub-Kpc AGN (VODKA): Long-slit optical spectroscopic follow-up with Gemini/GMOS and HST/STIS</title>

Abstract: High spatial and spectral resolution observations are essential for identifying sub-arcsecond dual and lensed quasars and confirming their redshifts. We present Gemini/GMOS and HST/STIS optical spectra for 27 dual quasar candidates selected based on their variability-induced astrometric noise or double detections in Gaia (the VODKA project). From this follow-up, we spectroscopically identify 11 star superpositions and 7 dual/lensed quasars. Among the remaining targets, 2 are likely dual/lensed quasars based on additional radio imaging, while the rest are quasars with unknown companions. Without prior photometric or spectroscopic selection, we find the star contamination rate to be 41-67%, while the dual/lensed quasar fraction is $\gtrsim$ 26% in the follow-up VODKA sample. However, when combined with existing unresolved spectra and spatially-resolved two-band color cuts, the dual/lensed quasar fraction can be increased to $\gtrsim$ 67%. Our study highlights the need for high-quality spectral data, including a signal-to-noise ratio of at least 20, spatial resolution that is at least twice finer than the source separation, and a spectral resolution of $R \gtrsim 1000$, in order to separate close sources, exclude stellar superpositions, and reliably identify dual quasars.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Ray-Driven Galactic Winds with Resolved ISM and Ion-Neutral Damping</title>

Abstract: Feedback processes in galaxies dictate their structure and evolution. Baryons can be cycled through stars, which inject energy into the interstellar medium (ISM) in supernova explosions, fueling multiphase galactic winds. Cosmic rays (CRs) accelerated at supernova remnants are an important component of feedback. CRs can effectively contribute to wind driving; however, their impact heavily depends on the assumed CR transport model. We run high-resolution "tallbox" simulations of a patch of a galactic disk using the moving mesh magnetohydrodynamics code AREPO, including varied CR implementations and the CRISP non-equilibrium thermochemistry model. We characterize the impact of CR feedback on star formation and multiphase outflows. While CR-driven winds are able to supply energy to a global-scale wind, a purely thermal wind loses most of its energy by the time it reaches 3 kpc above the disk midplane. We further find that the adopted CR transport model significantly affects the steady-state of the wind. In the model with CR advection, streaming, diffusion, and nonlinear Landau damping, CRs provide very strong feedback. Additionally accounting for ion-neutral damping (IND) decouples CRs from the cold ISM, which reduces the impact of CRs on the star formation rate. Nevertheless, CRs in this most realistic model are able to accelerate warm gas and levitate cool gas in the wind but have little effect on cold gas and hot gas. This model displays moderate mass loading and significant CR energy loading, demonstrating that IND does not prevent CRs from providing effective feedback.</description>

      <title>Impact of initial mass function on the chemical evolution of high-redshift galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06139v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Star formation and metal enrichment in galaxies are regulated by supernova (SN) explosions and metal yields from massive stars, which are sensitive to the high-mass end of the initial mass function (IMF). Recent JWST observations found evidence for an invariant relation between stellar mass, metallicity, and star formation rate up to $z\sim 8$ and its breakdown at higher redshifts. It is crucial to understand the underlying physics, especially the role played by the IMF. We explore the impact of IMF on the chemical evolution of high-redshift galaxies and the interplay between IMF and galactic outflow parameters. The ultimate goal is to constrain the high-mass end of the IMF by the cosmic star formation history and stellar mass-metallicity-star formation rate relation (MZSFR) inferred from observations at $z\sim 4-10$. Using the semi-analytical galaxy evolution code A-SLOTH, we follow galactic baryon cycles along merger trees built from a high-resolution cosmological simulation. Stellar feedback is modeled with up-to-date stellar evolution tracks covering the full metallicity range ($Z \sim 10^{-11} - 0.03$) and a broad stellar mass range ($m_\star\sim2 - 600\ \rm M_\odot$) including the metal yields from stellar winds and all types of SNe. Assuming a Kroupa-like shape of the IMF with a varying upper mass limit $m_{\max}$, we find $m_{\max} \gtrsim 200\ \rm M_\odot$ is required to reproduce the observed MZSFR. Observational data at $z\gtrsim 6$ favor a galactic outflow model where the outflow rate is proportional to the supernova energy injection rate divided by the halo binding energy. We conclude that very massive ($\gtrsim 200\ \rm M_\odot$) stars can play important roles in the star formation and chemical enrichment histories of high-$z$ galaxies and discuss the implications of our results for reionization and transient sources of both electromagnetic waves and gravitational waves.</description>
