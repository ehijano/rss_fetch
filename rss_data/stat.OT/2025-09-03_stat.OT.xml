      <title>Grid Transmission Evaluation for Solar Deployment and Data Center Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid growth of renewable energy deployment and data center demand in the United States has intensified challenges in grid interconnection, with project delays and escalating costs threatening both economic expansion and energy reliability. This study investigates transmission constraints using the IEEE 39-bus New England Power System model to evaluate the simultaneous interconnection of a 1 GW solar facility and a 1 GW data center load. Employing PSSE and Python-based automation (psspy), we conducted 1,560 load flow simulations across varying siting configurations to assess branch overloads and transmission line limits. Results revealed that only 14 configurations avoided overloads, while most scenarios highlighted recurring congestion on specific network branches, particularly between buses 21 and 22. Optimal siting was identified with the load at bus #35 and the generator at bus #39, yielding minimal overloads (maximum 91.1% loading). Conversely, poor siting decisions resulted in severe congestion with maximum branch loading above 220%. The findings underscore the critical importance of optimized siting and modernized, automated interconnection studies to reduce delays and costs in renewable integration. This research demonstrates the potential of advanced modeling tools to accelerate interconnection processes, improve system reliability, and inform future strategies for balancing renewable energy deployment with rising data center demand.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Consistency and Generalization in Hybrid Models of Regularized Selection and Nonlinear Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07754v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study explores how different types of supervised models perform in the task of predicting and selecting relevant variables in high-dimensional contexts, especially when the data is very noisy. We analyzed three approaches: regularized models (such as Lasso, Ridge, and Elastic Net), black-box models (such as Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, and H2O GBM), and hybrid models that combine both approaches: regularization with nonlinear algorithms. Based on simulations inspired by the Friedman equation, we evaluated 23 models using three complementary metrics: RMSE, Jaccard index, and recall rate. The results reveal that, although black-box models excel in predictive accuracy, they lack interpretability and simplicity, essential factors in many real-world contexts. Regularized models, on the other hand, proved to be more sensitive to an excess of irrelevant variables. In this scenario, hybrid models stood out for their balance: they maintain good predictive performance, identify relevant variables more consistently, and offer greater robustness, especially as the sample size increases. Therefore, we recommend using this hybrid framework in market applications, where it is essential that the results make sense in a practical context and support decisions with confidence.</description>
