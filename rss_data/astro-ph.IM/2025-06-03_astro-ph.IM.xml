      <title>The near infrared airglow continuum conundrum. Constraints for ground-based faint object spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The airglow continuum in the near infrared is a challenge to quantify due to its faintness, and the grating scattered light from atmospheric hydroxyl (OH) emission lines. Despite its faintness, the airglow continuum sets the fundamental limits for ground-based spectroscopy of faint targets, and makes the difference between ground and space-based observation in the interline regions between atmospheric emission lines. We aim to quantify the level of airglow continuum radiance in the VIS -- NIR wavelength range observable with silicon photodetectors for the site Observatorio del Roque de los Muchachos in a way that our measurement will not be biased by the grating scattered light. We aim to do this by measuring the airglow continuum radiance with a minimal and controlled contamination from the broad instrumental scattering wings caused by the bright atmospheric OH lines. We measure the airglow continuum radiance with longslit $\lambda/\Delta\lambda\sim4000$ spectrograph in $\sim$100\r{A} wide narrow band passes centered at 6720, 7700, 8700 and 10500\r{A} (in line with the R, I, and Z broadbands) with the 2.5-meter Nordic Optical Telescope under photometric dark sky conditions. The bandpasses are chosen to be as clean as possible from atmospheric absorption and the OH line emission keeping the radiation reaching the grating surface at minimum. We observe the zenith equivalent airglow continuum to be 22.5mag/arcsec2 at 6720\r{A} band, and 22mag/arcsec2 at 8700\r{A}. We derive upper limits of 22mag/arcsec2 at 7700\r{A} due to difficulty to find a clean part of spectrum for measurement, and 20.8mag/arcsec2 at 10500\r{A} due to low system sensitivity. Within measurement errors and the natural variability expected for the airglow emission our results for the Observatorio del Roque de los Muchachos are comparable to values reported for other major observatory sites.

      <title>fftvis: A Non-Uniform Fast Fourier Transform Based Interferometric Visibility Simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection and characterization of the 21cm signal from the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) demands extraordinary precision in radio interferometric observations and analysis. For modern low-frequency arrays, achieving the dynamic range necessary to detect this signal requires simulation frameworks to validate analysis techniques and characterize systematic effects. However, the computational expense of direct visibility calculations grows rapidly with sky model complexity and array size, posing a potential bottleneck for scalable forward modeling. In this paper, we present fftvis, a high-performance visibility simulator built on the Flatiron Non-Uniform Fast-Fourier Transform (finufft) algorithm. We show that fftvis matches the well-validated matvis simulator to near numerical precision while delivering substantial runtime reductions, up to two orders of magnitude for dense, many-element arrays. We provide a detailed description of the fftvis algorithm and benchmark its computational performance, memory footprint, and numerical accuracy against matvis, including a validation study against analytic solutions for diffuse sky models. We further assess the utility of fftvis in validating 21cm analysis pipelines through a study of the dynamic range in simulated delay and fringe-rate spectra. Our results establish fftvis as a fast, precise, and scalable simulation tool for 21cm cosmology experiments, enabling end-to-end validation of analysis pipelines.</description>

      <title>Meta-heuristic design of a light-weight homologous backup structure of the primary reflector for the Large Submillimeter Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of large-aperture submillimeter telescopes, such as the Large Submillimeter Telescope (LST) and the Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST), is essential to overcome the limitations of current observational capabilities in submillimeter astronomy. These telescopes face challenges related to maintaining high surface accuracy of the main reflector while minimizing the weight of the telescope structure. This study introduces a genetic algorithm (GA)-based structural optimization, previously applied in related works, to 50 m-class backup structures (BUSes) with a variable focal position, addressing the challenge of achieving both lightweight construction and high surface accuracy through the consideration of homologous deformation. We model the BUS as a truss structure and perform multi-objective optimization using a GA. The optimization process considers two structures: axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric between the top and bottom. The optimization aims to find structures that simultaneously minimize the maximum stroke length of actuators and the mass of the BUS under practical constraints. The optimized structures show improved surface accuracy, primarily due to the minimization of the maximum actuator stroke length, and reduced weight, both achieved under the imposed constraints. Notably, we find a homologous BUS solution that achieves a surface error of down to $\sim 5\,\mu\mathrm{m}$ RMS with a tiny portion of the truss nodes being actively controlled. The results highlight the potential of GA-based optimization in the design of next-generation submillimeter telescopes, suggesting that further exploration of non-axisymmetric structures could yield even more effective solutions. Our findings support the application of advanced optimization techniques to achieve high-performance and cost-effective telescope designs.</description>

      <title>Prediction of the SVOM MXT camera end of life spectral performance based onproton irradiation results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SVOM, the Space-based Variable astronomical Object Monitor, launched on June 22nd 2024, is a Chinese-French mission focused on exploring the brightest phenomena in the cosmos - Gamma-Ray Bursts. Among the four instruments on board is the Micro-channel X-ray Telescope (MXT). The MXT camera features a 256x256 pixel pnCCD detector to perform X-ray imaging and spectroscopy in the 0.2-10 keV energy range. Cruising in a low-Earth orbit (600 km) that crosses the South Atlantic Anomaly, the MXT focal plane is exposed to radiation, primarily protons, that will lead to performance degradation over time. The challenge for MXT, and possibly for future missions with similar mass and mechanical constraints, is to maintain spectral performance all along the mission duration. To assess the expected radiation-induced performance degradation, a spare flight model of MXT focal plane underwent an irradiation campaign with 50 MeV protons at the Arronax cyclotron facility in June 2022. Then, the proton irradiated spare model was characterized in detail at the X-ray Metrology beamline of the SOLEIL Synchrotron facility in June 2023, as well as with a laboratory X-ray fluorescence source. We find through the evaluation of key indicators of performance such as the charge transfer inefficiency (CTI) and the low energy threshold, that MXT will remain compliant to its requirements over the SVOM mission lifetime. We also report an unexpected effect of proton irradiation that is the inversion of the trend of CTI with energy, recovered with two different sources illuminating the detector, and never reported in literature so far.</description>

      <title>Residual 1D CNN for Low SFR Surface Density Regression: A Design Note</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This technical note describes the design and modular implementation of a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D CNN) adapted from residual networks (ResNet), developed for photometric regression tasks with an emphasis on low star formation rate surface density ($\Sigma_{\mathrm{SFR}}$) inference. The model features residual block structures optimized for sparse targets, with optional loss weighting and diagnostic tools for analyzing residual behavior. The implementation (version \texttt{v1.4}) originated during a collaborative project and is documented here independently. No external data are reproduced or analyzed. This note provides a reusable architectural reference for scalar regression problems in astronomy and related domains.</description>

      <title>An Exploratory Framework for Future SETI Applications: Detecting Generative Reactivity via Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an exploratory framework to test whether noise-like input can induce structured responses in language models. Instead of assuming that extraterrestrial signals must be decoded, we evaluate whether inputs can trigger linguistic behavior in generative systems. This shifts the focus from decoding to viewing structured output as a sign of underlying regularity in the input. We tested GPT-2 small, a 117M-parameter model trained on English text, using four types of acoustic input: human speech, humpback whale vocalizations, Phylloscopus trochilus birdsong, and algorithmically generated white noise. All inputs were treated as noise-like, without any assumed symbolic encoding. To assess reactivity, we defined a composite score called Semantic Induction Potential (SIP), combining entropy, syntax coherence, compression gain, and repetition penalty. Results showed that whale and bird vocalizations had higher SIP scores than white noise, while human speech triggered only moderate responses. This suggests that language models may detect latent structure even in data without conventional semantics. We propose that this approach could complement traditional SETI methods, especially in cases where communicative intent is unknown. Generative reactivity may offer a different way to identify data worth closer attention.</description>

      <title>Performance of the image persistence model for Euclid infrared detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-format infrared detectors are at the heart of major ground and space-based astronomical instruments, and the HgCdTe HxRG is the most widely used. The Near Infrared Spectrometer and Photometer (NISP) of the ESA's Euclid mission launched in July 2023 hosts 16 H2RG detectors in the focal plane. Their performance relies heavily on the effect of image persistence, which results in residual images that can remain in the detector for a long time contaminating any subsequent observations. Deriving a precise model of image persistence is challenging due to the sensitivity of this effect to observation history going back hours or even days. Nevertheless, persistence removal is a critical part of image processing because it limits the accuracy of the derived cosmological parameters. We will present the empirical model of image persistence derived from ground characterization data, adapted to the Euclid observation sequence and compared with the data obtained during the in-orbit calibrations of the satellite.</description>

      <title>The Growing Impact of Unintended Starlink Broadband Emission on Radio Astronomy in the SKA-Low Frequency Range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the largest survey to date characterising intended and unintended emission from Starlink satellites across the SKA-Low frequency range. This survey analyses ~76 million full sky images captured over ~29 days of observing with an SKA-Low prototype station - the Engineering Development Array 2 - at the site of SKA-Low. We report 112,534 individual detections of 1,806 unique Starlink satellites, some emitting broadband emission and others narrowband emission. Our analysis compares observations across different models of Starlink satellite, with 76% of all v2-mini Ku and 71% of all v2-mini Direct to Cell satellites identified. It is shown that in the worst cases, some datasets have a detectable Starlink satellite in ~30% of all images acquired. Emission from Starlink satellites is detected in primary and secondary frequency ranges protected by the International Telecommunication Union, with 13 satellites identified between 73.00 - 74.60 MHz and 703 identified between 150.05 - 153.00 MHz. We also detect the reflections of terrestrial FM radio off different models of Starlink satellites at 99.70 MHz. The polarisation of the broadband emission shows the flux density of two orthogonal polarisations is anti-correlated with temporally shifting spectral structure observed. We compare our results to previous EDA2 and LOFAR results and provide open public access to our final data products to assist in quantifying future changes in this emission.</description>

      <title>High-Contrast Coronagraphy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Imaging terrestrial exoplanets around nearby stars is a formidable technical challenge, requiring the development of coronagraphs to suppress the stellar halo of diffracted light at the location of the planet. In this review, we derive the science requirement for high-contrast imaging, present an overview of diffraction theory and the Lyot coronagraph, and define the parameters used in our optimization. We detail the working principles of coronagraphs both in the laboratory and on-sky with current high-contrast instruments, and we describe the required algorithms and processes necessary for terrestrial planet imaging with the extremely large telescopes and proposed space telescope missions:
  * Imaging terrestrial planets around nearby stars is possible with a combination of coronagraphs and active wavefront control using feedback from wavefront sensors.
  * Ground based 8-40m class telescopes can target the habitable zone around nearby M dwarf stars with contrasts of $10^{-7}$ and space telescopes can search around solar-type stars with contrasts of $10^{-10}$.
  * Focal plane wavefront sensing, hybrid coronagraph designs and multiple closed loops providing active correction are required to reach the highest sensitivities.
  * Polarization effects need to be mitigated for reaching $10^{-10}$ contrasts whilst keeping exoplanet yields as high as possible.
  * Recent technological developments, including photonics and microwave kinetic inductance detectors, will be folded into high-contrast instruments.</description>

      <title>Verification of the Timing System for the X-ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission in the GPS Unsynchronized Mode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the results from the ground and on-orbit verifications of the XRISM timing system when the satellite clock is not synchronized to the GPS time. In this case, the time is determined by a free-run quartz oscillator of the clock, whose frequency changes depending on its temperature. In the thermal vacuum test performed in 2022, we obtained the GPS unsynchronized mode data and the temperature-versus-clock frequency trend. Comparing the time values calculated from the data and the true GPS times when the data were obtained, we confirmed that the requirement (within a 350 $\mu$s error in the absolute time, accounting for both the spacecraft bus system and the ground system) was satisfied in the temperature conditions of the thermal vacuum test. We also simulated the variation of the timing accuracy in the on-orbit temperature conditions using the Hitomi on-orbit temperature data and found that the error remained within the requirement over $\sim 3 \times 10^{5}$ s. The on-orbit tests were conducted in 2023 September and October as part of the bus system checkout. The temperature versus clock frequency trend remained unchanged from that obtained in the thermal vacuum test and the observed time drift was consistent with that expected from the trend.</description>

      <title>Post-glitch Recovery and the Neutron Star Structure: The Vela Pulsar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pulsar glitches, sudden changes in a neutron star's rotation, offer a unique window into the extreme physics governing these celestial bodies. The post-glitch recovery phase, characterized by a gradual recovery, reveals insights into the superfluid dynamics within the star. The post-glitch recovery phase probes the coupling mechanisms between different stellar components, sheds light on the properties of neutron star matter at supra-nuclear densities and even allows us to predict the time to the next glitch. In this work, we present a detailed analysis of the Vela pulsar's rotational behavior using around 100 months of observational data spanning from September 2016 to January 2025, during which four glitches were identified. Here, we demonstrate the post-glitch recovery of these glitches within the framework of the vortex creep model, providing new insights into the Vela pulsar's internal structure. Notably, we present the first-ever investigation of vortex residuals (the discrepancy between observed values and those predicted by the vortex creep model) through the lens of the vortex bending model, marking a significant step forward in understanding neutron star physics through pulsar glitches.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The impending discovery and monitoring of hundreds of new gravitationally lensed quasars and supernovae from upcoming ground and space based large area surveys such as LSST, \textit{Euclid}, and \textit{Roman} necessitates the development of improved numerical methods for studying gravitational microlensing. We present in this work the fastest microlensing map generation code currently publicly available. We utilize graphics processing units to take advantage of the inherent parallelizable nature of creating magnification maps, in addition to using 1) the fast multipole method to reduce the runtime dependence on the number of microlenses and 2) inverse polygon mapping to reduce the number of rays required. The code is available at https://github.com/weisluke/microlensing/.</description>

      <title>A GPU Code for Finding Microlensing Critical Curves and Caustics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advancements in analyses of caustic crossing events in gravitationally microlensed quasars and supernovae can benefit from numerical simulations which locate the caustics in conjunction with the creation of magnification maps. We present a GPU code which efficiently solves this problem; the code is available at https://github.com/weisluke/microlensing/. We discuss how the locations of the microcaustics can be used to determine the number of caustic crossings and the distances to caustics, both of which can be used to constrain the space of nuisance parameters such as source position and velocity within magnification maps.</description>

      <title>Sorcha: Optimized Solar System Ephemeris Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sorcha is a solar system survey simulator built for the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) and future large-scale wide-field surveys. Over the ten-year survey, the LSST is expected to collect roughly a billion observations of minor planets. The task of a solar system survey simulator is to take a set of input objects (described by orbits and physical properties) and determine what a real or hypothetical survey would have discovered. Existing survey simulators have a computational bottleneck in determining which input objects lie in each survey field, making them infeasible for LSST data scales. Sorcha can swiftly, efficiently, and accurately calculate the on-sky positions for sets of millions of input orbits and surveys with millions of visits, identifying which exposures these objects cross, in order for later stages of the software to make detailed estimates of the apparent magnitude and detectability of those input small bodies. In this paper, we provide the full details of the algorithm and software behind Sorcha's ephemeris generator. Like many of Sorcha's components, its ephemeris generator can be easily used for other surveys.</description>

      <title>A Pan-STARRS Search for Distant Planets: Part 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a search for distant planets in Pan-STARRS1. We calibrated our search by injecting an isotropic control population of synthetic detections into Pan-STARRS1 source catalogs, providing a high-fidelity alternative to injecting synthetic sources at the image level. We found that our method is sensitive to a wide range of distances, as well as all rates and directions of motion. We identified 692 solar system objects (109 of which are not yet listed in the Minor Planet Center's database), including 642 TNOs, 23 of which are dwarf planets. By raw number of detections, this makes our search the third most productive Kuiper Belt survey to date, in spite of the fact that we did not explicitly search for objects closer than 80 au. Although we did not find Planet Nine or any other planetary objects, we were able to show that the remaining parameter space for Planet Nine is highly concentrated in the galactic plane.</description>

      <title>Performance of multiple filter-cavity schemes for frequency-dependent squeezing in gravitational-wave detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational-wave detectors use state-of-the-art quantum technologies to circumvent vacuum fluctuations via squeezed states of light. Future detectors such as Einstein Telescope may require the use of two filter cavities or a 3-mirror, coupled filter cavity to achieve a complex rotation of the squeezing ellipse in order to reduce the quantum noise over the whole detector bandwidth. In this work, we compare the theoretical feasibility and performances of these two systems and their resilience with respect to different degradation sources (optical losses, mismatching, locking precision). We provide both analytical models and numerical insights. We extend previous analysis on squeezing degradation and find that the coupled cavity scheme provides similar or better performances than the two-cavity option, in terms of resilience with respect to imperfections and optical losses. We propose a possible two-step implementation scheme for Einstein Telescope using a single filter cavity that can be possibly upgraded into a coupled filter cavity.</description>

      <title>Rapid stellar and binary population synthesis with COMPAS: methods paper II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The COMPAS public rapid binary population synthesis code has undergone a number of key improvements since the original COMPAS methods paper (Team COMPAS: Riley et al., 2022) was published. These include more sophisticated and robust treatments of binary interactions: mass transfer physics, common-envelope events, tides and gravitational-wave radiation reaction; and updated prescriptions for stellar evolution, winds and supernovae. The code structure and outputs have also been updated, with a focus on improving resolution without sacrificing computational speed. This paper describes the substantive changes in the code between the previous methods paper and COMPAS v03.20.02.</description>

      <title>Alkali phenoxides in comets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Potassium was first detected in spectra of the sungrazer comet Ikeya-Seki at the heliocentric distance rh = 0.15 au and, 48 years later, in comets PanSTARRS and ISON at rh = 0.46 au. The alkali tail photoionization model provides a Na/K ratio close to the solar value. No lithium was detected in any comet: the lower limit of the Na/Li ratio was almost one order of magnitude greater than the solar ratio. Here we searched for the emissions of the alkali NaI, KI, and LiI in Comets C/2020 F3 and C/2024 G3. High-resolution spectra of the comets were taken with the 0.84 m telescope at the Schiaparelli Observatory at rh = 0.36 and 0.15 au, the observations closest to the Sun since Ikeya-Seki. To model the data, we assumed that alkali phenoxides are present in the aromatic fraction of organic dust at the nucleus surface where they react with carbon dioxide ejecting alkali atoms. NaI and KI were detected in emission lines of exceptional intensity in both comets, with no evidence of LiI emission. The NaI/KI ratios were determined: 31 +/- 5 and 26 +/- 8, whereas solar Na/K = 15. This excess and its observed trend with the heliocentric distance are consistent with chemistry between CO2 and alkali phenoxides at the nucleus surface. The Li upper limit for comet C/2020 F3 is very stringent at Na/Li &gt; 3.4 10^4, a factor of 34 greater than the solar value. This Li depletion is consistent with the reaction rate of lithium phenoxides, which is a factor of 10^4 slower than sodium phenoxides. The widespread chemistry of carbon dioxide with organic dust may provide a significant energy and mass sink of carbon dioxide in all comets also at rh &gt; 1 au, reconciling recent models of cometary activity with Rosetta CO2 measurements. At rh &lt; 0.5 au potassium was observed in all comets, so that we predict the formation of a KI tail spatially resolved from the NaI tail.</description>

      <title>Predictions of the LSST Solar System Yield: Near-Earth Objects, Main Belt Asteroids, Jupiter Trojans, and Trans-Neptunian Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The NSF-DOE Vera C. Rubin Observatory is a new 8m-class survey facility presently being commissioned in Chile, expected to begin the 10yr-long Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) by the end of 2025. Using the purpose-built Sorcha survey simulator (Merritt et al. In Press), and near-final observing cadence, we perform the first high-fidelity simulation of LSST's solar system catalog for key small body populations. We show that the final LSST catalog will deliver over 1.1 billion observations of small bodies and raise the number of known objects to 1.27E5 near-Earth objects, 5.09E6 main belt asteroids, 1.09E5 Jupiter Trojans, and 3.70E4 trans-Neptunian objects. These represent 4-9x more objects than are presently known in each class, making LSST the largest source of data for small body science in this and the following decade. We characterize the measurements available for these populations, including orbits, griz colors, and lightcurves, and point out science opportunities they open. Importantly, we show that ~70% of the main asteroid belt and more distant populations will be discovered in the first two years of the survey, making high-impact solar system science possible from very early on. We make our simulated LSST catalog publicly available, allowing researchers to test their methods on an up-to-date, representative, full-scale simulation of LSST data.</description>

      <title>Sorcha: A Solar System Survey Simulator for the Legacy Survey of Space and Time</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The upcoming Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) at the Vera C. Rubin Observatory is expected to revolutionize solar system astronomy. Unprecedented in scale, this ten-year wide-field survey will collect billions of observations and discover a predicted $\sim$5 million new solar system objects. Like all astronomical surveys, its results will be affected by a complex system of intertwined detection biases. Survey simulators have long been used to forward-model the effects of these biases on a given population, allowing for a direct comparison to real discoveries. However, the scale and tremendous scope of the LSST requires the development of new tools. In this paper we present Sorcha, an open-source survey simulator written in Python. Designed with the scale of LSST in mind, Sorcha is a comprehensive survey simulator to cover all solar system small-body populations. Its flexible, modular design allows Sorcha to be easily adapted to other surveys by the user. The simulator is built to run both locally and on high-performance computing (HPC) clusters, allowing for repeated simulation of millions to billions of objects (both real and synthetic).</description>

      <title>Preliminary analysis of a potential asteroid from the IASC campaign using Pan-STARRS data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a detailed analysis of a potential asteroid candidate, ISP0010, using images provided by the Pan-STARRS 1 telescope as part of our participation in the International Astronomical Search Collaboration campaign. IASC is one of the leading contributors to the detection of various Near-Earth Objects and Main Belt asteroids. Using Astrometrica software we analysed those images and extracted their key parameters such as signal-to-noise ratio, right ascension, declination, flux, FWHM, RMS, and magnitude. Later, we analysed its trajectory, apparent angular speed, and error analyses using python and its libraries. In the end, we concluded that ISP0010 would be a potential candidate for an asteroid. However, on cross-verifying with the Minor Planet Centre database, we found that ISP0010 was already reported on February 27, 2021, and a total of 25 observations has been reported up to the date and currently the object has been designated as 2021 CP66. Our date of observation of 2021 CP66 was February 27, 2025. This study thus provides an independent confirmation and characterization of 2021 CP66, demonstrating the accuracy of our analysis and underscoring the importance of thorough database verification in asteroid detection.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity of a Gigahertz Fabry-P\'erot Resonator for Axion Dark Matter Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Axions are hypothetical pseudo-Nambu Goldstone bosons that could explain the observed cold dark matter density and solve the strong CP problem of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Haloscope experiments commonly employ resonant cavities to search for a conversion of axion dark matter into photons in external magnetic fields. As the expected signal power degrades with increasing frequency, this approach becomes challenging at frequencies beyond tens of Gigahertz. Here, we propose a novel haloscope design based on an open Fabry-P\'erot resonator. Operating a small-scale resonator at cryogenic temperatures and at modest magnetic fields should already lead to an unparalleled sensitivity for photon-axion couplings $g_{a\gamma} \gtrsim 3\times10^{-12}\,\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$ at 35GHz. We demonstrate how this sensitivity could be further improved using graded-phase mirrors and sketch possibilities to probe benchmark models of the QCD axion.</description>

      <title>A "Rosetta Stone" for Studies of Spatial Variation in Astrophysical Data: Power Spectra, Semivariograms, Structure Functions, and More</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14068v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: From the turbulent interstellar medium to the cosmic web, astronomers in many different fields have needed to make sense of spatial data describing our Universe. Through different historical choices for mathematical conventions, many different subfields of spatial data analysis have evolved their own language for analysing structures and quantifying correlation in spatial data. Because of this history, terminology from a myriad of different fields is used, often to describe two data products that are mathematically identical. In this Note, we define and describe the differences and similarities between the power spectrum, the two-point correlation function, the covariance function, the semivariogram, and the structure functions, in an effort to unify the languages used to study spatial correlation. We also highlight under which conditions these data products are useful and describe how the results found using one method can be translated to those found using another, allowing for easier comparison between different subfields' native methods. We hope for this document to be a ``Rosetta Stone" for translating between different statistical approaches, allowing results to be shared between researchers from different backgrounds, facilitating more cross-disciplinary approaches to data analysis.</description>

      <title>Euclid Quick Data Release (Q1): From images to multiwavelength catalogues: the Euclid MERge Processing Function</title>

Abstract: The Euclid satellite is an ESA mission that was launched in July 2023. \Euclid is working in its regular observing mode with the target of observing an area of $14\,000~\text{deg}^2$ with two instruments, the Visible Camera (VIS) and the Near IR Spectrometer and Photometer (NISP) down to $I_{\rm E} = 24.5~\text{mag}$ ($10\, \sigma$) in the Euclid Wide Survey. Ground-based imaging data in the \textit{ugriz} bands complement the \Euclid data to enable photo-$z$ determination and VIS PSF modeling for week lensing analysis. Euclid investigates the distance-redshift relation and the evolution of cosmic structures by measuring shapes and redshifts of galaxies and clusters of galaxies out to $z\sim 2$. Generating the multi-wavelength catalogues from \Euclid and ground-based data is an essential part of the \Euclid data processing system. In the framework of the \Euclid Science Ground Segment (SGS), the aim of the MER Processing Function (PF) pipeline is to detect objects in the \Euclid imaging data, measure their properties, and MERge them into a single multi-wavelength catalogue. The MER PF pipeline performs source detection on both visible (VIS) and near-infrared (NIR) images and offers four different photometric measurements: Kron total flux, aperture photometry on PSF-matched images, template fitting photometry, and S\'ersic fitting photometry. Furthermore, the MER PF pipeline measures a set of ancillary quantities, spanning from morphology to quality flags, to better characterise all detected sources. In this paper, we show how the MER PF pipeline is designed, detailing its main steps, and we show that the pipeline products meet the tight requirements that Euclid aims to achieve on photometric accuracy. We also present the other measurements (e.g. morphology) that are included in the OU-MER output catalogues and we list all output products coming out of the MER PF pipeline.</description>

      <title>XENONnT WIMP Search: Signal &amp; Background Modeling and Statistical Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13638v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The XENONnT experiment searches for weakly-interacting massive particle (WIMP) dark matter scattering off a xenon nucleus. In particular, XENONnT uses a dual-phase time projection chamber with a 5.9-tonne liquid xenon target, detecting both scintillation and ionization signals to reconstruct the energy, position, and type of recoil. A blind search for nuclear recoil WIMPs with an exposure of 1.1 tonne-years (4.18 t fiducial mass) yielded no signal excess over background expectations, from which competitive exclusion limits were derived on WIMP-nucleon elastic scatter cross sections, for WIMP masses ranging from 6 GeV/$c^2$ up to the TeV/$c^2$ scale. This work details the modeling and statistical methods employed in this search. By means of calibration data, we model the detector response, which is then used to derive background and signal models. The construction and validation of these models is discussed, alongside additional purely data-driven backgrounds. We also describe the statistical inference framework, including the definition of the likelihood function and the construction of confidence intervals.</description>

      <title>In-ice Askaryan Emission from Air Showers: Implications for Radio Neutrino Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08615v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the most promising techniques for detecting ultra-high energy neutrinos involves the use of radio antennas to observe the 10-1000 MHz radiation generated by the showers that neutrinos induce in large volumes of ice. The expected neutrino detection rates of one neutrino or less per detector station per 10 years make the characterization of backgrounds a priority. The largest natural background comes from ultra-high energy cosmic rays which are orders of magnitude more abundant than neutrinos. Particularly crucial is the understanding of geometries in which substantial energy of the cosmic-ray-induced air shower is deposited in the ice giving rise to a compact in-ice shower close to the ice surface. We calculated the radio emission of air-shower cores using the novel CORSIKA 8 code and found it to be similar to the predictions for neutrino-induced showers. For the first time, we calculated the detection rates for O(100m) deep antennas yielding 10-100 detections per year and detector station, which makes this a useful calibration source as these downward-going signals can be differentiated from neutrino-induced showers based on the signal arrival direction. However, the presence of reflection layers in the ice confuses the arrival directions, which makes this a potentially important background. We review the existing information on reflecting layers in the South Pole glacier and, for the first time, quantify the corresponding rate of reflected air-shower signals for the proposed IceCube-Gen2 radio array and discuss mitigation strategies. The reflectivity of the layers is the dominant uncertainty resulting in rate predictions of much less than one detection to several detections per year for IceCube-Gen2 if not mitigated.</description>

      <title>High-contrast spectroscopy with the new VLT/ERIS instrument: Molecular maps and radial velocity of the gas giant AF Lep b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19961v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Enhanced Resolution Imager and Spectrograph (ERIS) is the new Adaptive-Optics (AO) assisted Infrared instrument at the Very Large Telescope (VLT). Its refurbished Integral Field Spectrograph (IFS) SPIFFIER leverages a new AO module, enabling high-contrast imaging applications and giving access to the orbital and atmospheric characterisation of super-Jovian exoplanets. We test the detection limits of ERIS and demonstrate its scientific potential by exploring the atmospheric composition of the young super-Jovian AF Lep b and improving its orbital solution by measuring its radial velocity relative to its host star. We present new spectroscopic observations of AF Lep b in $K$-band at $R\sim 11000$ obtained with ERIS/SPIFFIER at the VLT. We reduce the data using the standard pipeline together with a custom wavelength calibration routine, and remove the stellar PSF using principal component analysis along the spectral axis. We compute molecular maps by cross-correlating the residuals with molecular spectral templates and measure the radial velocity of the planet relative to the star. Furthermore, we compute contrast grids for molecular mapping by injecting fake planets. We detect a strong signal from H$_{2}$O and CO but not from CH$_{4}$ or CO$_{2}$. This result corroborates the hypothesis of chemical disequilibrium in the atmosphere of AF Lep b. Our measurement of the RV of the planet yields $\Delta v_{\mathrm{R,P\star}} = 7.8 \pm 1.7$ km s$^{-1}$. This enables us to disentangle the degeneracy of the orbital solution, namely the correct longitude of the ascending node is $\Omega=248^{+0.4}_{-0.7}$ deg and the argument of periapsis is $\omega=109^{+13}_{-21}$ deg. Our results demonstrate the competitiveness of the new ERIS/SPIFFIER instrument for the orbital and atmospheric characterisation of exoplanets at high contrast and small angular separation.</description>

      <title>The uncertainty of magnetic fields in 3D non-local thermodynamic equilibrium inversions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09708v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe our approach to solve the problem of ensuring the solenoidality of the magnetic field vector in three-dimensional (3D) inversions, as well as the estimation of the uncertainty in the inferred magnetic field. The solenoidality of the magnetic field vector is often disregarded in the inversion of spectropolarimetric data due to limitations in the traditional one-dimensional inversion techniques. We propose a method to ensure the solenoidal condition in 3D inversions based on our meshfree approach. The increase in dimensionality with respect to the 1D inversion techniques is such that some of the traditional methods to determine the uncertainties become unfeasible. We propose a method based on a Monte Carlo approach to determine the uncertainty of the magnetic field inference. Due to the physics of the problem, we can compute the uncertainty increasing the total required computational time by just a factor of about two. We also propose a metric to quantify the uncertainty to describe the degree of confidence of the magnetic field inference. Finally, we perform a numerical experiment to demonstrate the feasibility of both the method and the metric proposed to quantify the uncertainty.</description>
