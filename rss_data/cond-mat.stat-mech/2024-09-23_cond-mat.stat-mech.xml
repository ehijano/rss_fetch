      <title>Transfer Matrix and Lattice Dilatation Operator for High-Quality Fixed Points in Tensor Network Renormalization Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tensor network renormalization group maps study critical points of 2d lattice models like the Ising model by finding the fixed point of the RG map. In a prior work arXiv:2408.10312 we showed that by adding a rotation to the RG map, the Newton method could be implemented to find an extremely accurate fixed point. For a particular RG map (Gilt-TNR) we studied the spectrum of the Jacobian of the RG map at the fixed point and found good agreement between the eigenvalues corresponding to relevant and marginal operators and their known exact values. In this companion work we use two further methods to extract many more scaling dimensions from this Newton method fixed point, and compare the numerical results with the predictions of conformal field theory (CFT). The first method is the well-known transfer matrix. We introduce some extensions of this method that provide spins of the CFT operators modulo an integer. We find good agreement for the scaling dimensions and spins up to $\Delta=3\frac1 8$. The second method we refer to as the lattice dilatation operator (LDO). This lesser-known method obtains good agreement with CFT up to $\Delta=6$. Moreover, the inclusion of a rotation in the RG map makes it possible to extract spins of the CFT operators modulo 4 from this method. Some of the eigenvalues of the Jacobian of the RG map can come from perturbations associated with total derivative interactions and so are not universal. In some past studies (arXiv:2102.08136, arXiv:2305.09899) such non-universal eigenvalues did not appear in the Jacobian. We explain this surprising result by showing that their RG map has the unusual property that the Jacobian is equivalent to the LDO operator.</description>

      <title>Unique and Universal scaling in dynamical quantum phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Universality and scaling are fundamental concepts in equilibrium continuous phase transitions. Here, we unveil a unique and universal scaling behavior of the critical time in slowly driven dynamical quantum phase transition. Going beyond the analogy with equilibrium phase transition, we find that the critical time exhibits a power-law scaling with quenching rate and the scaling exponent is fully determined by underlining universality class. We explain this unique scaling behavior based on the adiabatic-impulse scenario in the Kibble-Zurek mechanism. This universal scaling behavior is verified to be valid not only in noninteracting single-particle system, but also in many-body interacting system, and not only in Hermitian system, but also in non-Hermitian system. Our study unravels a deep and fundamental relationship between dynamical phase transition and equilibrium phase tranition.</description>

      <title>Field theories and quantum methods for stochastic reaction-diffusion systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex systems are composed of many particles or agents that move and interact with one another. The underlying mathematical framework to model many of these systems must incorporate the spatial transport of particles and their interactions, as well as changes to their copy numbers, all of which can be formulated in terms of stochastic reaction-diffusion processes. The probabilistic representation of these processes is complex because of combinatorial aspects arising due to nonlinear interactions and varying particle numbers. This review presents the main field theory representations of stochastic reaction-diffusion systems, which handle these issues `under-the-hood'. First, we focus on bringing techniques familiar to theoretical physicists -- such as second quantization, Fock space, and path integrals -- back into the classical domain of reaction-diffusion systems. We demonstrate how various field theory representations can all be unified under a single basis-independent representation. We then extend existing quantum-based methods and notation to work directly on the level of the unifying representation, and we illustrate how they can be used to consistently obtain previous known results, such as numerical discretizations and relations between model parameters at multiple scales. Throughout the work, we contextualize how these representations mirror well-known models of chemical physics depending on their spatial resolution, as well as the corresponding macroscopic limits. The framework presented here may find applications in a diverse set of scientific fields, including physical chemistry, theoretical ecology, epidemiology, game theory and socio-economical models of complex systems. The presentation is done in a self-contained educational and unifying manner such that it can be followed by researchers across several fields.</description>

      <title>Exponential speed-up of quantum annealing via n-local catalysts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum speedup in solving optimization problems via adiabatic quantum annealing is often hindered by the closing of the energy gap during the anneal, especially when this gap scales exponentially with system size. In this work, we address this by demonstrating that for the Maximum Weighted Independent Set (MWIS) problem, an informed choice of $n-$local catalysts (operators involving $n$ qubits) can re-open the gap or prevent it from closing during the anneal process. By analyzing first-order phase transitions in toy instances of the MWIS problem, we identify effective forms of catalysts and also show that non-stoquasticity is not essential to avoid such phase transitions. While some of the toy problems studied might not be classically NP-hard, they reveal that $n-$local catalysts exponentially improve gap scaling and need to be connected across unfrustrated loops in the problem graph to be effective. Our analysis suggests that non-local quantum fluctuations entangling multiple qubits are key to achieving the desired quantum advantage.</description>

      <title>Scalability of Graph Neural Network in Accurate Prediction of Force Chain Network in Suspensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dense suspensions often exhibit shear thickening, characterized by a dramatic increase in viscosity under large external forcing. This behavior has recently been linked to the formation of a system-spanning force chain network (FCN), which contributes to increased resistance during deformation. However, identifying these force chains poses experimental challenges and is computationally expensive. This study introduces a Graph Neural Network (GNN) model designed to accurately predict FCNs in two dimensional simulations of dense shear thickening suspensions. The results demonstrate the GNN model's robustness and scalability across various stress levels $(\sigma)$, packing fractions$(\phi)$, system sizes, particle size ratios$(\Delta)$, and amount of smaller particles. The model is further able to predict both the occurrence and structure of the FCN. The presented model is accurate and interpolates and extrapolates to conditions far from its control parameters. This machine learning approach provides more accurate, cheaper, and faster predictions of suspension properties as compared to conventional methods, while using only small systems. Ultimately, our findings pave the way for predicting force chain networks in real-life large-scale polydisperse suspensions, for which theoretical models are largely limited due to computational challenges.</description>

      <title>Deterministic versus stochastic dynamical classifiers: opposing random adversarial attacks with noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Continuous-Variable Firing Rate (CVFR) model, widely used in neuroscience to describe the intertangled dynamics of excitatory biological neurons, is here trained and tested as a veritable dynamically assisted classifier. To this end the model is supplied with a set of planted attractors which are self-consistently embedded in the inter-nodes coupling matrix, via its spectral decomposition. Learning to classify amounts to sculp the basin of attraction of the imposed equilibria, directing different items towards the corresponding destination target, which reflects the class of respective pertinence. A stochastic variant of the CVFR model is also studied and found to be robust to aversarial random attacks, which corrupt the items to be classified. This remarkable finding is one of the very many surprising effects which arise when noise and dynamical attributes are made to mutually resonate.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed renormalisation group flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The physics of strongly correlated systems offers some of the most intriguing physics challenges such as competing orders or the emergence of dynamical composite degrees of freedom. Often, the resolution of these physics challenges is computationally hard, but can be simplified enormously by a formulation in terms of the dynamical degrees of freedom and within an expansion about the physical ground state. Importantly, such a formulation does not only reduce or minimise the computational challenges, it also facilitates the access to the physics mechanisms at play. The tasks of finding the dynamical degrees of freedom and the physical ground state can be systematically addressed within the functional renormalisation group approach with flowing fields which accommodates both, emergent composites as well as the physical ground state.
  In the present work we use this approach to set up physics-informed renormalisation group flows (PIRG flows): Scale-dependent coordinate transformations in field space induce emergent composites, and the respective flows for the effective action generate a large set of target actions, formulated in these emergent composite fields. This novel perspective on RG flows bears a great potential both for conceptual as well as computational applications: to begin with, PIRG flows allow for a systematic search of the dynamical degrees of freedom and the respective ground state that leads to the most rapid convergence of expansion schemes, thus minimising the computational effort. Secondly, the resolution of the remaining computational tasks within a given expansion scheme can be further reduced by optimising the physics content within a given approximation. Thirdly, the maximal variability of PIRG flows can be used to reduce the analytic and numerical effort of solving the flows within a given approximation.</description>

      <title>Universal aspects of the random first order phase transition theory of the structural glass transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1401.2024</link>
      <description>arXiv:1401.2024v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the ways in which the random first order phase transition (RFOT) of the glass transition differs from the well-studied regular first order and second order (or continuous) phase transitions. Just as is the case in the latter two classes of phase transitions, the RFOT also exhibits universal features. Here, we discuss these features and compare and contrast the RFOT with other types of transitions with an emphasis on the structural glass transition problem. An important feature of the complete RFOT theory is that it has at least two distinct transition temperatures, one of which is a dynamical (avoided) transition signaling loss of effective ergodicity, and the other is an equilibrium ideal glass transition. Particular attention is paid to the coherence, or correlation, length associated with these transitions in the RFOT. We also derive universal scaling relations for several experimentally measurable quantities that are valid near the ideal glass transition. In particular, activated scaling ideas are used to obtain a scaling equation for the non-linear structural glass susceptibility as the ideal glass transition is approached. Important finite corrections to the ideal glass transition temperature are also discussed. Our work provides additional criteria for assessing the validity of RFOT theory of the liquid to glass transition, and provides a firm theoretical foundation for analyzing experimental data on the temperature dependence of the relaxation times.</description>

      <title>Generalized nonlinear Langevin equation from quantum nonlinear projection operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15825v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We systematically derive the quantum generalized nonlinear Langevin equation using Morozov's projection operator method. This approach extends the linear Mori-Zwanzig projection operator technique, allowing for the inclusion of nonlinear interactions among macroscopic modes. Additionally, we obtain the quantum generalized Fokker-Planck equation within the Heisenberg picture, which is consistent with Morozov's original formulation. These equations are fundamentally significant in non-equilibrium statistical physics, particularly in scenarios characterized by enhanced fluctuations, such as anomalous transport phenomena near critical points. The quantum nature of the derived generalized Langevin and Fokker-Planck equations is anticipated to provide a more detailed description than their classical equivalents. Specifically, the noise kernel in the quantum generalized Langevin equation is multiplicative, which broadens the applicability beyond Gaussian approximations. Given specific interactions, these equations are expected to be instrumental in investigating critical transport phenomena.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo simulations of glass-forming liquids beyond Metropolis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19704v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Monte Carlo simulations are widely employed to measure the physical properties of glass-forming liquids in thermal equilibrium. Combined with local Monte Carlo moves, the Metropolis algorithm can also be used to simulate the relaxation dynamics, thus offering an efficient alternative to molecular dynamics. Monte Carlo simulations are however more versatile, because carefully designed Monte Carlo algorithms can more efficiently sample the rugged free energy landscape characteristic of glassy systems. After a brief overview of Monte Carlo studies of glass-formers, we define and implement a series of Monte Carlo algorithms in a three-dimensional model of polydisperse hard spheres. We show that the standard local Metropolis algorithm is the slowest, and that implementing collective moves or breaking detailed balance enhances the efficiency of the Monte Carlo sampling. We use time correlation functions to provide a microscopic interpretation of these observations. Seventy years after its invention, the Monte Carlo method remains the most efficient and versatile tool to compute low-temperatures properties in supercooled liquids.</description>

      <title>A Universal Model of Floquet Operator Krylov Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15116v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is shown that the stroboscopic time-evolution under a Floquet unitary, in any spatial dimension, and of any Hermitian operator, can be mapped to an operator Krylov space which is identical to that generated by the edge operator of the non-interacting Floquet transverse-field Ising model (TFIM) in one-spatial dimension, and with inhomogeneous Ising and transverse field couplings. The latter has four topological phases reflected by the absence (topologically trivial) or presence (topologically non-trivial) of edge modes at $0$ and/or $\pi$ quasi-energies. It is shown that the Floquet dynamics share certain universal features characterized by how the Krylov parameters vary in the topological phase diagram of the Floquet TFIM with homogeneous couplings. These results are highlighted through examples, all chosen for numerical convenience to be in one spatial dimension: non-integrable Floquet spin $1/2$ chains and Floquet $Z_3$ clock model where the latter hosts period-tripled edge modes.</description>

      <title>Path integral for the quartic oscillator: An accurate analytic formula for the partition function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09859v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work an approximate analytic expression for the quantum partition function of the quartic oscillator described by the potential $V(x) = \frac{1}{2} \omega^2 x^2 + g x^4$ is presented. Using a path integral formalism, the exact partition function is approximated by the partition function of a harmonic oscillator with an effective frequency depending both on the temperature and coupling constant $g$. By invoking a Principle of Minimal Sensitivity (PMS) of the path integral to the effective frequency, we derive a mathematically well-defined analytic formula for the partition function. Quite remarkably, the formula reproduces qualitatively and quantitatively the key features of the exact partition function. The free energy is accurate to a few percent over the entire range of temperatures and coupling strengths $g$. Both the harmonic ($g\rightarrow 0$) and classical (high-temperature) limits are exactly recovered. The divergence of the power series of the ground-state energy at weak coupling, characterized by a factorial growth of the perturbational energies, is reproduced as well as the functional form of the strong-coupling expansion along with accurate coefficients. Explicit accurate expressions for the ground- and first-excited state energies, $E_0(g)$ and $E_1(g)$ are also presented.</description>

      <title>Quasiprobabilities in quantum thermodynamics and many-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17138v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this tutorial, we present the definition, interpretation and properties of some of the main quasiprobabilities that can describe the statistics of measurement outcomes evaluated at two or more times. Such statistics incorporate the incompatibility of the measurement observables and the state of the measured quantum system. We particularly focus on Kirkwood-Dirac quasiprobabilities and related distributions. We also discuss techniques to experimentally access a quasiprobability distribution, ranging from the weak two-point measurement scheme, to a Ramsey-like interferometric scheme and procedures assisted by an external detector. We illustrate the use of quasiprobabilities in quantum thermodynamics to describe the quantum statistics of work and heat, and to explain anomalies in the energy exchanges entailed by a given thermodynamic transformation. On the one hand, in work protocols, we show how absorbed energy can be converted to extractable work and vice versa due to Hamiltonian incompatibility at distinct times. On the other hand, in exchange processes between two quantum systems initially at different temperatures, we explain how quantum correlations in their initial state may induce cold-to-hot energy exchanges, which are unnatural between any pair of equilibrium nondriven systems. We conclude the tutorial by giving simple examples where quasiprobabilities are applied to many-body systems: scrambling of quantum information, sensitivity to local perturbations, and quantum work statistics in the quenched dynamics of models that can be mapped onto systems of free fermions, for instance the Ising model with a transverse field. We meticulously present derivations of essential concepts alongside straightforward examples, aiming to enhance comprehension and facilitate learning.</description>

Abstract: We propose that the thermodynamics and the kinetics of state switching for the asymptotically flat black hole enclosed by a cavity can be studied in terms of the free energy landscape formalism. The generalized free energy for the black hole enclosed by a cavity in the canonical ensemble is derived by using the York's approach, where the temperature on the cavity and the charges inside the cavity are kept as the fixed parameters. By quantifying the corresponding free energy landscape, we obtain the phase diagrams for the black hole in cavity, which reveal a Hawking-Page type transition for the uncharged black hole and a Van der Waals type transition for the charged black hole. We further assume that the dynamics of black hole state switching is mutually determined by the gradient force and the stochastic force arising from the free energy landscape and the thermal noises respectively. We then derive a recurrence relation for the $n$-momentum of the first passage time distribution function, which enables the calculation of the kinetic times characterized by the mean first passage time and its relative fluctuation. Our analysis illustrates that the kinetics of black hole state switching is determined by the ensemble temperature and the barrier height on the free energy landscape.</description>

      <title>Chaos controlled and disorder driven phase transitions induced by breaking permutation symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00521</link>

Abstract: The effects of disorder and chaos on quantum many-body systems can be superficially similar, yet their interplay has not been sufficiently explored. This work finds a continuous phase transition when disorder breaks permutation symmetry, with details of the transition being controlled by the degree of chaos in the clean limit. The system changes from an area law entangled phase in the permutation symmetric subspace where collective variables exist to volume law entanglement in the full Hilbert space, beyond a critical strength of the disorder. The critical strength tends to zero when the original disorder free system is fully chaotic. We study this mainly via the scaling of the collective spin of non-equilibrium states which transit to have properties of what has been dubbed "deep Hilbert space". This has potential implications for general many body physics, as well as technologies such as transmon qubits.</description>

      <title>$\mathbb{Z}_4$ transitions in quantum loop models on a zig-zag ladder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.20093v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the nature of quantum phase transitions out of $\mathbb{Z}_4$ ordered phases in quantum loop models on a zig-zag ladder. We report very rich critical behavior that includes a pair of Ising transitions, a multi-critical Ashkin-Teller point and a remarkably extended interval of a chiral transition. Although plaquette states turn out to be essential to realize chiral transitions, we demonstrate that critical regimes can be manipulated by deforming the model as to increase the presence of leg-dimerized states. This can be done to the point where the chiral transition turns into first order, we argue that this is associated with the emergence of a critical end point.</description>

      <title>Global decomposition of networks into multiple cores formed by local hubs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00355v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Networks are ubiquitous in various fields, representing systems where nodes and their interconnections constitute their intricate structures. We introduce a network decomposition scheme to reveal multiscale core-periphery structures lurking inside, using the concept of locally defined nodal hub centrality and edge-pruning techniques built upon it. We demonstrate that the hub-centrality-based edge pruning reveals a series of breaking points in network decomposition, which effectively separates a network into its backbone and shell structures. Our local-edge decomposition method iteratively identifies and removes locally least important nodes, and uncovers an onion-like hierarchical structure as a result. Compared with the conventional $k$-core decomposition method, our method based on relative information residing in local structures exhibits a clear advantage in terms of discovering locally crucial substructures. Furthermore, we introduce the core-periphery score to properly separate the core and periphery with our decomposition scheme. By extending the method combined with the network community structure, we successfully detect multiple core-periphery structures by decomposition inside each community. Moreover, the application of our decomposition to supernode networks defined from the communities reveals the intricate relation between the two representative mesoscale structures.</description>

      <title>Analytic Model for the Energy Spectrum of the Anharmonic Oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01146v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a recent work we have proposed an original analytic expression for the partition function of the quartic oscillator. This partition function, which has a simple and compact form with {\it no adjustable parameters}, reproduces some key mathematical properties of the exact partition function and provides free energies accurate to a few percent over a wide range of temperatures and coupling constants. In this work, we present the derivation of the energy spectrum of this model. We also generalize our previous study limited to the quartic oscillator to the case of a general anharmonic oscillator. Numerical application for a potential of the form $V(x)=\frac{\omega^2}{2} x^2 + g x^{2m}$ show that the energy levels are obtained with a relative error of about a few percent, a precision which we consider to be quite satisfactory given the simplicity of the model, the absence of adjustable parameters, and the negligible computational cost.</description>

      <title>Information geometry approach to quantum stochastic thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06083v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements have revealed new links between information geometry and classical stochastic thermodynamics, particularly through the Fisher information with respect to time. Recognizing the non-uniqueness of the quantum Fisher metric in Hilbert space, we exploit the fact that any quantum Fisher information (QFI) can be decomposed into a metric-independent incoherent part and a metric-dependent coherent contribution. We demonstrate that the incoherent component of any QFI can be directly linked to entropic acceleration, and for GKSL dynamics with local detailed balance, to the rate of change of generalized thermodynamic forces and entropic flow, paralleling the classical results. Furthermore, we show that the classical uncertainty relation between the geometric uncertainty of a path in state space and the time-averaged rate of information change also holds for quantum systems. We generalise a classical geometric bound on the entropy rate for far-from-equilibrium processes by incorporating a non-negative quantum contribution that arises from the geometric action due to coherent dynamics. Finally, we apply an information-geometric analysis to the recently proposed quantum-thermodynamic Mpemba effect, demonstrating this framework's ability to capture thermodynamic phenomena.</description>
