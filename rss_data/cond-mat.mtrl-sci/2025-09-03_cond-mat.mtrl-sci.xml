      <title>Nonadiabatic Wave-Packet Dynamics: Nonadiabatic Metric, Quantum Geometry, and Analogue Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a unified theory for the nonadiabatic wave-packet dynamics of Bloch electrons subject to slowly varying spatial and temporal perturbations. Extending the conventional wave-packet ansatz to include interband contributions, we derive equations for the interband coefficients using the time-dependent variational principle, referred to as the wave-packet coefficient equation. Solving these equations and integrating out interband contributions yields the leading-order nonadiabatic corrections to the wave-packet Lagrangian. These corrections appear in three forms: (i) a nonadiabatic metric in real and momentum space, which we identify with the energy-gap-renormalized quantum metric, (ii) modified Berry connections associated with the motion of the wave-packet center, and (iii) an energy correction arising from spatial and temporal variations of the Hamiltonian. This metric reformulates the wave-packet dynamics as geodesic motion in phase space, enabling an analogue-gravity perspective in condensed matter systems. As an application, we analyze one-dimensional Dirac electron systems under a slowly varying exchange field $\bm{m}$. Our results demonstrate that variations in the magnitude of $\bm{m}$ are important to nonadiabatic dynamics, in sharp contrast to the adiabatic regime where directional variations of $\bm{m}$ are crucial.</description>

      <title>Reexamining Machine Learning Models on Predicting Thermoelectric Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermoelectric materials can generate clean energy by transforming waste heat into electricity. The effectiveness of thermoelectric materials is measured by the dimensionless figure of merit, ZT. The quest for high ZT materials has drawn extensive research experimentally and theoretically. However, due to the vast material space, finding high ZT materials is time-consuming and costly. To improve the efficiency of discovering new thermoelectric materials, recent studies have employed machine learning with databases to search for high ZT candidates. In this work, we examine the effects of adding various physical concepts on the performance of machine learning models in predicting TE properties. The objective is to improve the model ability to capture the underlying physics in designing TE materials. These concepts include short range order and crystal structure class. Results show some improvements in accuracy. However, the current models do not distinguish between dilute alloys and concentrated alloys, rendering them inadequate in predicting doping effects. To better capture the electronic band structure effect from doping, we included various dopant properties as features. This increases the prediction accuracy in doped materials. Furthermore, we used a genetic algorithm to rank features for various thermoelectric properties to provide physical insight into key parameters in designing thermoelectric materials.</description>

      <title>Free-carrier screening unlocks high electron mobility in ultrawide bandgap semiconductor CaSnO$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alkaline earth stannates have emerged as promising transparent conducting oxides due to their wide band gaps and high room-temperature electron mobilities. Among them, CaSnO$_3$ possesses the widest band gap, yet reported mobilities vary widely and are highly sample-dependent, leaving its intrinsic limit unclear. Here, we present ab initio calculations of electron mobility in CaSnO$_3$ across a range of temperatures and doping levels, using state-of-the-art methods that explicitly account for free-carrier screening in electron-phonon interactions. We identify the dominant limiting mechanism to be the long-range longitudinal optical phonon scattering, which is significantly suppressed at high doping due to free-carrier screening, leading to enhanced phonon-limited mobility. While ionized impurity scattering emerges as a competing mechanism at carrier concentrations up to ~10$^{20}$ cm$^{-3}$, the phonon scattering reduction dominates, yielding a net mobility increase with predicted room-temperature values reaching about twice the highest experimental report. Our work highlights the substantial untapped conductivity in CaSnO$_3$, establishing it as a compelling ultrawide bandgap semiconductor for transparent and high-power electronic applications.</description>

      <title>Dimensional hierarchy of topological bound states in the continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bound states in the continuum (BICs), with the ability of trapping and manipulating waves within the radiation continuum, have gained significant attention for their potential applications in optics and acoustics. However, challenges arise in reducing wave leakage and noise from fabrication imperfections. The emergence of robust wave manipulations based on topological BICs (TBICs) offers promising solutions. Traditionally, TBICs of different dimensions are observed separately in distinct systems. Here, we report the experimental discovery of the coexistence of two-dimensional surface TBICs and one-dimensional hinge TBICs in a single three-dimensional phononic crystal system. Such an unprecedented dimensional hierarchy of TBICs is triggered by the mechanism of separability and protected by the valley Chern numbers. Notably, these TBICs inherit dispersive propagation characteristics from valley topology and can propagate robustly against defects without leakage. Our findings offer an efficient approach to multidimensional TBICs and can be applied in designing highly efficient acoustic devices for wave trapping and manipulation in multidimensional environments.</description>

      <title>Simulations of grain growth in tungsten armor materials under ARC plasma edge operation conditions using an integrated plasma-edge/materials model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An integrated model of grain growth deuterium-exposed tungsten polycrystals, consisting of a two-dimensional vertex dynamics model fitted to atomistic data, has been developed to assess the grain growth kinetics of deuterium-exposed polycrystalline tungsten (W). The model tracks the motion of grain boundaries under the effect of driving forces stemming from grain boundary curvature and differential deuterium concentration accumulation. We apply the model to experimentally-synthesized W polycrystals under deuterium saturated conditions consistent with those of the ARC concept design, and find fast grain growth kinetics in the material region adjacent to the plasma (at 1400 K, &lt;100 seconds for full transformation), while the microstructure is stable deep inside the material (several days to complete at a temperature of 1000 K). Our simulations suggest that monolithic W fabricated using conventional techniques will be highly susceptible to grain growth in the presence of any driving force at temperatures above 1000 K.</description>

      <title>Hidden ferromagnetism of centrosymmetric antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The time-reversal symmetry ($\mathcal{T}$) breaking is a signature of ferromagnetism, giving rise to such phenomena as the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) and orbital magnetism (OM). Nevertheless, $\mathcal{T}$ can be also broken in certain classes of antiferromagnets, such as weak ferromagnets or altermagnets, which remain invariant under the spatial inversion. In the light of this similarity with the ferromagnetism, it is tempting to ask whether such anomalous antiferromagnetic (AFM) state can be presented as a simplest ferromagnetic one, i.e. within a minimal unit cell containing only one magnetic cite. We show that such presentation is possible due to the special form of the spin-orbit (SO) interaction in an antiferroelectrically distorted lattice hosting this AFM state. The inversion symmetry, combined with the lattice translations, imposes a severe constraint on the form of the SO interaction, which becomes invariant under the symmetry operation $\{ \mathcal{S}| {\bf t} \}$, combining the $180^{\circ}$ rotation of spins ($\mathcal{S}$) with the lattice shift ${\bf t}$, connecting antiferromagnetically coupled sublattices. This is the fundamental symmetry property of centrosymmetric antiferromagnets, which justifies the use of the generalized Bloch theorem and transformation to the local coordinate frame with one magnetic cite per cell. It naturally explains the emergence of AHE and OM, and provides transparent expressions for these properties in terms of the electron hoppings and SO interaction operating between nearest neighbors as well as the orthorhombic strain of the next-nearest-neighbor hoppings. The idea is illustrated on a number of examples, using realistic models derived from first-principles calculations. These examples include two-dimensional square lattice, monoclinic VF$_4$ and CuF$_2$, and RuO$_2$-type materials with the tetragonal symmetry.</description>

      <title>Role of lattice structure and breaking of antiferromagnetic spin order in enhancement of ferromagnetic, electronic, and magneto-electric properties in Fe$_{2-x}$Sc$_x$O$_3$ system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The strategy of breaking AFM ground state of alpha-Fe2O3 by doping non-magnetic Sc3+ (3d0) ions at the Fe3+ (3d5) sites has been used to understand modified lattice-structure, magnetic spin order, and charge-spin coupling in Fe$_{2-x}$Sc$_x$O$_3$  system ($x =$ 0.2, 0.5, 1.0). The material has been stabilized in single-phased (rhombohedral $\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$) or mix-phased (rhombohedral alpha-Fe$_2$O$_3$ and cubic Sc$_2$O$_3$-types) structures by varying the Sc content and heat treatment temperature. Neutron diffraction confirmed magnetic moment approximately 2.75-4.68 Bohr-magneton per Fe site and spin reorientation from in-plane to out of plane direction below the Morin transition approximately 260 K. The material showed magnetic coercivity (0.2 to 6 kOe). The electrical properties transformed from insulating state (conductivity 10-14-10-10 S/cm and polarization 0.5-2 micro-C/cm$^2$) to high conductive state (conductivity approximately 10-10 -10-7 S/cm and polarization greater than 2 micro-C/cm$^2$) above Morin transition. The material at 300 K produced the maximum current density 20-95 micro-A/cm$^2$, ferroelectric polarization 2.7-15.6 micro-C/cm$^2$, ME voltage up to 5 mV with coupling coefficient 0.53 mV/Oe/cm and huge negative magnetoconductance up to 90%. The results in the present hematite based canted ferromagnetic materials are expected to be useful for applying in low power spintronic devices.</description>

Abstract: Emerging ferroic materials may pave a new way to next-generation nanoelectronic and spintronic devices due to their interesting physical properties. Here, we systematically review unconventional ferroelectric systems, from Hf-based and elementary ferroelectrics to stacking ferroelectricity, polar metallicity, fractional quantum ferroelectricity, wurtzite-type ferroelectricity, and freestanding membranes ferroelectricity. Moreover, multiferroic materials are reviewed, particularly the interplay between novel magnetic states and ferroelectricity, as well as ferrovalley-ferroelectric coupling. Finally, we conclude by discussing current challenges and future opportunities in this field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the possible stabilization of ferroelectricity in bulk Y2O3-doped hafnia and zirconia. We use density functional theory (DFT) with large random supercells of hafnia and zirconia and study the relative phase stability of the centrosymmetric cubic and monoclinic phases compared with the polar orthorhombic phase. We find that Y2O3-doping stabilizes the polar ferroelectric phase over the monoclinic baddeleyite phase in both hafnia and zirconia.</description>

      <title>From diamond to BC8 to simple cubic and back: kinetic pathways to post-diamond carbon phases from metadynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The experimental observation of elusive post-diamond carbon phases at extreme pressures remains a major challenge in high-pressure science. Using metadynamics with coordination-number-based collective variables and SNAP machine-learned interatomic potential, we uncover atomistic mechanisms governing the transformation of cubic and hexagonal diamond into post-diamond phases above 1.5 TPa. The transition initiates via homogeneous nucleation of nanoscale liquid droplets, which rapidly crystallize into either BC8 (below 1.8 TPa) or simple cubic phases (above 2.1 TPa), once the liquid nucleus surpasses a critical size. Favorable conditions for synthesizing BC8 are identified near 1.8 TPa and 3500--5000 K. Decompression pathways from simple cubic and BC8 phases were also simulated to study possible experimental recovery of post-diamond carbon allotropes at ambient conditions. We also find a new metastable low-enthalpy structure with four-coordinated carbon atoms and space group P222. Our insights provide a theoretical foundation for experimental discovery of ultra-dense carbon phases under extreme conditions.</description>

      <title>Sliding-induced ferrovalley polarization and possible antiferromagnetic half-metal in bilayer altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnets, a newly discovered class of materials, exhibit zero net magnetization while hosting spin-split electronic bands. However, monolayer altermagnets maintain degenerate band gaps at the high-symmetry X and Y points in the Brillouin zone, manifesting a paravalley phase characterized by unpolarized valley states. In this work, we demonstrate that spontaneously broken valley degeneracy can be achieved through interlayer sliding in engineered M$_2$A$_2$B and M$_2$AA$'$B bilayer altermagnets by first-principles calculations and minimal microscopic model. We propose a promising route to achieve antiferromagnetic half-metal driven by sliding and emergent ferrovalley phase without applied electric field, which is realized in the V$_2$SSeO engineered bilayer. Our calculations also reveal that Mo$_2$O$_2$O exhibits the largest valley splitting gap of ~0.31 eV, making it a promising candidate for valley-spin valve devices. Furthermore, band structure calculations on Mo$_2$AA$'$O materials demonstrate that increasing the difference in atomic number ($\Delta$Z) between A and A$'$ site atoms effectively enhances valley polarization. This work establishes a novel platform for discovering and controlling ferrovalley states in altermagnetic systems.</description>

      <title>"One defect, one potential" strategy for accurate machine learning prediction of defect phonons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomic vibrations play a critical role in phonon-assisted electron transitions at defects in solids. However, accurate phonon calculations in defect systems are often hindered by the high computational cost of large-supercell first-principles calculations. Recently, foundation models, such as universal machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs), emerge as a promising alternative for rapid phonon calculations, but the quantitatively low accuracy restricts its fundamental applicability for high-level defect phonon calculations, such as nonradiative carrier capture rates. In this paper, we propose a "one defect, one potential" strategy in which an MLIP is trained on a limited set of perturbed supercells. We demonstrate that this strategy yields phonons with accuracy comparable to density functional theory (DFT), regardless of the supercell size. The predicted accuracy of defect phonons is validated by phonon frequencies, Huang-Rhys factors, and phonon dispersions. Further calculations of photoluminescence (PL) spectra and nonradiative capture rates based on this defect-specific model also show good agreements with DFT results, meanwhile reducing the computational expenses by more than an order of magnitude. Our approach provides a practical pathway for studying defect phonons in 10$^4$-atom large supercell with high accuracy and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Magnetic dynamics in NiTiO3 honeycomb antiferromagnet using neutron scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ilmenite NiTiO3 consists of a buckled honeycomb lattice, with the Ni spins aligned ferromagnetically in-plane and antiferromagnetically out-of-plane. Using neutron spectroscopy, the magnetic structure and the dynamics were investigated as a function of temperature. Dispersive acoustic bands and nearly dispersionless optical bands at ~3.7 meV are described by a highly anisotropy Heisenberg model with stronger antiferromagnetic (AFM) out-of-plane, weaker ferromagnetic (FM) in-plane interactions and an anisotropy gap of 0.95 meV. The order parameter yields a critical exponent between the Heisenberg and two-dimensional Ising models, consistent with highly anisotropic Heisenberg systems. The frustration parameter ~ 2 supports a weakly frustrated system.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Insulating Ferro and Ferrimagnetism in Double-Double Perovskite Oxides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of ferro- and ferrimagnetic behavior in insulating materials is uncommon, largely due to Hund's rules. Utilizing symmetry analysis, first-principles methods, and classical Monte Carlo simulations, \textcolor{black}{we report technologically important insulating ferro and ferrimagnetic double-double perovskite oxides. Our study predicts LaA$^{\prime}$MnNiO$_6$ (A$^{\prime}$ = V, Cr, Mn, Co, and Ni) as promising candidates for spintronic and optical applications exhibiting band gaps between 1.3 eV and 1.9 eV. We explain the mechanisms driving band gap openings and magnetic exchange interactions in these ferro and ferrimagnetic compounds. Monte Carlo simulations, together with state-of-the-art orbital-decomposed exchange parameter analysis, reveal intriguing variations in magnetic transition temperatures (up to 242 K) and the corresponding exchange mechanisms in all LaA$^{\prime}$MnNiO$_6$ compounds.} In addition, we assess the thermodynamic and dynamic stability of these compounds to comment on the feasibility of these systems.</description>

      <title>Surface Effects on the Magnetocrystalline Anisotropy of IrMn$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic anisotropy is a key parameter to describe the exchange bias effect in heterostructures. In this paper, we describe explicit density functional calculations of the magnetic structure of an interface between the industrially critically antiferromagnetic material, IrMn, and Fe, which together form a simple ferromagnet-antiferromagnet heterostructure. Additionally, the magnetic anisotropy was evaluated for several terminations of the IrMn. It was found that the [111] surface had a perpendicular anisotropy of 1.62 meV/$\text{\AA}^2$, whereas the two possible [100] surfaces (Ir-rich and Mn-rich) had in-plane anisotropies of 0.13 meV/$\text{\AA}^2$ and 1.39 meV/$\text{\AA}^2$ respectively. The affect of the magnetic order of the easy and hard configurations were calculated and used to explain the relative values of the anisotropies.</description>

      <title>Domain-Wall Mediated Polarization Switching in Ferroelectric AlScN: Strain Relief and Field-Dependent Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aluminum nitride is a traditional wide-bandgap semiconductor that has been widely used in high-power electronic and optoelectronic devices. Recently, scandium-doped aluminum nitride (AlScN) was shown to host ferroelectricity with high remnant polarization and excellent thermal stability. However, its practical use is currently limited by its high coercive field, $E_c$. Understanding the atomic-scale switching mechanism is essential to guide strategies for reducing $E_c$. Here, we combine density functional theory and machine-learning molecular dynamics to investigate polarization switching mechanisms in AlScN over various Sc concentrations and applied electric fields. We find that collective switching induces excessive lattice strain and is therefore unlikely to occur. Rather, pre-existing domain walls relieve strain and lead to a distinct switching dynamics, with the associated switching mechanism being field dependent. More precisely, at low electric fields, switching proceeds via gradual domain-wall propagation, well described by the Kolmogorov-Avram-Ishibashi model; meanwhile high fields trigger additional nucleation events, producing rapid and more homogeneous reversal, whose mixed switching process is better described by the simultaneous non-linear nucleation and growth model. These findings highlight the critical role of domain-wall dynamics in nitride ferroelectrics and suggest that domain engineering provides a viable route to control coercive fields and enhance device performance.</description>

      <title>First principles study on the oxidation resistance of two-dimensional intrinsic and defective GeO2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although two-dimensional (2D) oxide semiconductors exhibit remarkable oxidation resistance compared to conventional 2D materials, the microscopic physical processes that govern this behavior at the atomic scale remains elusive. Using first-principles calculations, we investigated the defect formation and oxidation dynamics of the GeO${_2}$ monolayer (ML). The investigations reveal that the intrinsic GeO${_2}$ ML is resistant to oxidation due to strong electrostatic repulsion between surface oxygen ions and approaching O$_2$ molecules, effectively suppressing chemisorption. In contrast, defective GeO$_2$ ML with surface O vacancies shows vulnerability to oxidation with the O$_2$ molecule occupying the vacancy through a low-energy activation energy ($E_a$) of 0.375 eV. Remarkably, the subsequent O$_2$ dissociation into atomic species faces a higher activation barrier ($E_a$ = 1.604 eV), suggesting self-limiting oxidation behavior. Electronic structure analysis demonstrates that oxidation primarily modifies the valence bands of defective GeO${_2}$ MLs through oxygen incorporation, while the conduction bands and electron effective mass recover to pristine-like characteristics. We further proved that the high O$_2$ pressure hinders the formation of the O vacancy, while high temperature increases the oxidation rate in GeO$_2$ ML. These atomic-level insights not only advance our understanding of oxidation resistance in 2D oxides but also provide guidelines for developing stable GeO${_2}$-based nanoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Integration of promising piezoelectric and photocatalytic properties in Janus In$XY$ ($X$ = S, Se, Te; $Y$ = Cl, Br, I) monolayers and their heterojunctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) Janus materials show great promise as piezoelectric materials and photocatalysts for water splitting. In this work, we systematically investigated the piezoelectric and photocatalytic properties of the hexagonal Janus InXY (X = S, Se, Te; Y = Cl, Br, I) monolayers (MLs) using first-principles calculations. Except for InSeCl ML, the remaining eight InXY MLs are stable and exhibit exceptionally high in-plane piezoelectric coefficients ($|d_{22}| = $6.07--155.27 pm/V), which exceed those of most known 2D materials. InXY MLs possess band edges straddling the water redox potentials at pH = 0. Their intrinsic vertical polarization induces an intralayer polarization field $E_{\rm intra}$, leading to low exciton binding energies (0.44--0.78 eV). Moreover, their strong vertical piezoelectric responses ($|d_{32}|$ = 0.34--0.65 pm/V) suggest that in-plane stress can further enhance $E_{\rm intra}$ to facilitate the separation of photogenerated carriers. Additionally, these InXY MLs exhibit high electron mobility (101--899 cm$^2$/V/s) and a pronounced anisotropy ratio in carrier mobility, which effectively suppresses charge recombination. To optimize performance, we constructed a van der Waals heterojunction (InSI/InSeBr), which demonstrates remarkable photocatalytic properties, including enhanced redox ability, a direct Z-scheme charge transfer pathway, strong visible-light absorption, high carrier mobility, and excellent photocorrosion resistance. Our results indicate that hexagonal Janus InXY MLs and their heterojunctions are multifunctional materials integrating piezoelectricity and photocatalysis, paving the way for energy conversion applications.</description>

      <title>Interplay of energy and charge transfer in WSe2/CrSBr heterostructures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Van der Waals heterostructures (vdWHs) composed of transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) and layered magnetic semiconductors offer great opportunities to manipulate exciton and valley properties of TMDs. Here, we present magneto-photoluminescence (PL) studies in a WSe2 monolayer (ML) on a CrSBr crystal, an anisotropic layered antiferromagnetic semiconductor. Our results reveal unique behavior of each of the ML-WSe2 PL peaks under magnetic field that is distinct from the pristine case. An intriguing feature is the clear enhancement of the PL intensity that we observe each time the external magnetic field tunes the energy of an exciton in CrSBr into resonance with one of the optical states of WSe2. This result suggests a magnetic field-controlled resonant energy transfer (RET) beyond other effects reported in similar structures. Our work provides deep insight on the importance of different mechanisms into magnetic vdWHs and underscores its great potential for light harvesting and emission enhancement of two-dimensional materials.</description>

      <title>Protocol for Clustering 4DSTEM Data for Phase Differentiation in Glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase-change materials (PCMs) such as Ge-Sb-Te alloys are widely used in non-volatile memory applications due to their rapid and reversible switching between amorphous and crystalline states. However, their functional properties are strongly governed by nanoscale variations in composition and structure, which are challenging to resolve using conventional techniques. Here, we apply unsupervised machine learning to 4-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) data to identify compositional and structural heterogeneity in Ge-Sb-Te. After preprocessing and dimensionality reduction with principal component analysis (PCA), cluster validation was performed with t-SNE and UMAP, followed by k-means clustering optimized through silhouette scoring. Four distinct clusters were identified which were mapped back to the diffraction data. Elemental intensity histograms revealed chemical signatures change across clusters, oxygen and germanium enrichment in Cluster 1, tellurium in Cluster 2, antimony in Cluster 3, and germanium again in Cluster 4. Furthermore, averaged diffraction patterns from these clusters confirmed structural variations. Together, these findings demonstrate that clustering analysis can provide a powerful framework for correlating local chemical and structural features in PCMs, offering deeper insights into their intrinsic heterogeneity.</description>

      <title>Performance Improvement of Deorbitalized Exchange-Correlation Functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deorbitalization of a conventional meta-generalized-gradient exchange-correlation approximation replaces its dependence upon the Kohn-Sham kinetic energy density with a dependence on the density gradient and Laplacian. In principle, that simplification should provide improved computational performance relative to the original meta-GGA form because of the shift from an orbital-dependent generalized Kohn-Sham potential to a true KS local potential. Often that prospective gain is lost because of problematic roughness in the density caused by the density Laplacian and consequent roughness in the exchange-correlation potential from the resulting higher-order spatial derivatives of the density in it. We address the problem by constructing a deorbitalizer based on the RPP deorbitalizer [Phys. Rev. Mater. 6, 083803 (2022)] with comparative smoothness of the potential along with retention of constraint satisfaction as design goals. Applied to the r^2SCAN exchange-correlation functional [J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 11, 8208 (2020)], we find substantial timing improvements for solid-state calculations over both r^2SCAN and its earlier deorbitalization for high precision calculations of structural properties, while improving upon the accuracy of RPP deorbitalization for both solids and molecules.</description>

      <title>Common errors in BoltzTraP-based calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Boltzmann transport calculations based on band structures computed from first principles play an important role in modern thermoelectric materials research. Among available codes, the \textsc{BoltzTraP} code is the most widely adopted, but many recent studies contain systematic mistakes. We identify three error modes: (1) inserting the electronic thermal conductivity at zero electric field, $\kappa_0$, in place of the electronic thermal conductivity at zero electric current, $\kappa_e$, (2) computing the figure of merit $zT$ by combining a constant relaxation time of unity while keeping the lattice thermal conductivity $\kappa_\ell$ in standard units, and (3) doing both errors at once. We have found many examples of the third error, but since the first two are simpler, we suspect they are also present in the literature. For the single parabolic band model, we derive exact analytical limits in the non-degenerate and near-degenerate regimes, and we show how mistakes appear for the realistic case study of ZrNiSn. Our results illustrate how faulty calculations can appear reasonable at certain temperatures and Fermi levels, and we provide practical guidance for identifying faulty results and avoiding such pitfalls in thermoelectric transport studies.</description>

      <title>Control of Covalent Bond Enables Efficient Magnetic Cooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic cooling, harnessing the temperature change in matter when exposed to a magnetic field, presents an energy-efficient and climate-friendly alternative to traditional vapor-compression refrigeration systems, with a significantly lower global warming potential. The advancement of this technology would be accelerated if irreversible losses arising from hysteresis in magnetocaloric materials were minimized. Despite extensive efforts to manipulate crystal lattice constants at the unit-cell level, mitigating hysteresis often compromises cooling performance. Herein, we address this persistent challenge by forming Sn(Ge)3/Sn(Ge)3 bonds within the unit cell of the Gd5Ge4 compound. Our approach enables an energetically favorable phase transition, leading to the elimination of thermal hysteresis. Consequently, we achieve a synergistic improvement of two key magnetocaloric figures of merit: a larger magnetic entropy change and a twofold increase in the reversible adiabatic temperature change (from 3.8 to 8 K) in the Gd5Sn2Ge2 compound. Such synergies can be extended over a wide temperature range. This study demonstrates a paradigm shift in mastering hysteresis toward simultaneously achieving exceptional magnetocaloric metrics and opens up promising avenues for gas liquefaction applications in the longstanding pursuit of sustainable energy solutions.</description>

      <title>Odd-Parity Selection in Parity-Forbidden Electronic Transitions Revealed by Mn4+ Fluorescence Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01248v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mn4+-doped fluoride phosphors represent a significant class of narrow band red-emitting materials, whose luminescent properties are profoundly influenced by electron-phonon coupling. However, the parity-forbidden nature of these electronic transition systems is incompatible with the conventional Condon approximation, which is widely adopted in the classic theories such as the Huang-Rhys theory, a framework established on the assumption of parity-allowed electric dipole transitions. This results in a critical knowledge gap regarding the principles governing the phonon sidebands of parity-forbidden electronic transitions. This study experimentally reveals a pronounced parity-dependent intensity distribution in the phonon sidebands of these systems: significantly suppressed even-order sidebands and normally observed odd-order sidebands. To elucidate the phenomenon, we extend the Huang-Rhys theory to parity-forbidden systems by incorporating the Herzberg-Teller approximation into the treatment of the transition matrix elements. The improved theory successfully uncovers the physical mechanism behind the strong suppression of the even-order sidebands in the parity-forbidden systems, in which the Huang-Rhys factor is derived as S=((2I_3)/(9I_1 ))^(1/2). This work not only reveals new findings regarding the phonon sidebands of the parity-forbidden electronic transition systems, but also establishes an improved theoretical framework for understanding the electron-phonon coupling mechanisms of color centers in solids.</description>

      <title>Dipolar Nematic State in Relaxor Ferroelectrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relaxor ferroelectrics exhibit exceptional dielectric and electromechanical properties, yet their microscopic origins remain elusive due to the interplay of hierarchical polar structures and chemical complexity. While models based on polar nanoregions or nanodomains offer valuable phenomenological insights, they often lack the first-principles predictive capability necessary for quantitatively describing functional properties such as piezoelectric coefficients. Here, we use large-scale molecular dynamics simulations, enabled by a universal first-principles-based machine-learning interatomic potential, to investigate atomic-scale polar dynamics in canonical Pb-, Bi-, and Ba-based relaxors. Across all systems, we uncover a universal dipolar nematic state, characterized by long-range orientational order of local polarizations without local alignment, challenging conventional polar cluster-based paradigms. We introduce a universal order parameter, derived from the skewness of the distributions of the local polarization autocorrelation functions, that captures the thermal evolution of both lead-based and lead-free systems within a single master curve. This nematic order, and its robust structural memory under electric field cycling, underpins key relaxor phenomena, including diffuse phase transition, frequency-dependent dielectric dispersion, and reversible giant piezoelectricity. Our findings establish a unified microscopic framework for relaxors and present a broadly applicable statistical approach to understanding complex disordered materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: THz emission associated with currents in conductive domains in BiFeO$_3$ following infrared radiation is theoretically investigated. This experimentally observed phenomenon is explained by the domain wall stripes acting as metallic resonators with the oscillating charge accumulation being at the domain wall edges. The charge oscillation frequency is related to the plasma frequency inside the domain wall. The value of plasma frequency determines both the frequency and the amplitude of the emission emanating from the BiFeO$_3$ lattice. We show that for certain geometries of the domain wall structure and for specific polarization of the incident pulse the THz emission embodies a non-vanishing chirality.</description>

      <title>Quantum Computation of the Electronic Structure of Some Prototype Solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the last decade, researchers have been working to improve a crucial aspect of quantum computing to predict Hamiltonian energy of solids. Quantum algorithms such as Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) and Variational Quantum Deflation (VQD) have been used to study the molecular systems. However, there is growing interest in adapting and applying these methods to periodic solid-state materials. In this work, we have integrated first-principles density functional theory with VQE and VQD algorithms and utilizing the Wannier Tight-Binding Hamiltonian (WTBH) method to predict the electronic characteristics of solids. We demonstrate that VQE and VQD algorithms can be used to accurately predict electronic characteristics in a variety of multi-component prototype solid-state materials such as-Silicon (semiconductor), Gold (metallic), Boron Nitrile (insulator), Graphene (semi-metal). Efficient SU2 performs well among all the predefined ansatz used in the study. COBYLA is the fastest optimizer among the classical optimizers with minimum number of iterations for convergence. Results of noise models help to understand the band structure when calculated on real quantum hardware. As quantum hardware advances, our method stands as a prototype for future quantum simulations of materials pushing us closer to autonomous quantum discovery engines.</description>

      <title>Direct spatiotemporal imaging of a long-lived bulk photovoltaic effect in $BiFeO_{3}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE), a manifestation of broken centrosymmetry, has attracted interest as a probe of the symmetry and quantum geometry of materials, and for use in novel optoelectronic devices. Despite its bulk nature, the BPVE is typically measured with interfaces and metal contacts, raising concerns as to whether the observed signals are genuinely of bulk origin. Here, we use a contactless pump-probe microscopy method to observe the space- and time-resolved dynamics of photoexcited carriers in single-crystal, monodomain $BiFeO_{3}$. We observe asymmetric transport of carriers along the polar axis, confirming the intrinsic bulk and symmetry-driven nature of BPVE. This asymmetric transport persists for several nanoseconds after photoexcitation, which cannot be explained by the shift or phonon ballistic current BPVE mechanisms. Monte Carlo simulations show that asymmetric momentum scattering by defects under non-equilibrium conditions explains the long-lived carrier drift, while first principles calculations confirm that oxygen vacancies have an asymmetric electronic state that can cause such asymmetric scattering. Our findings highlight the critical role of defects in long-lived photoresponses.</description>

      <title>Quantitative and bond-traceable resonant X-ray optical tensors of organic molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray scattering at the carbon absorption edge is uniquely sensitive to local molecular bond identity and orientation in organic nanostructures, encoded as a function of photon energy and polarization. However, quantitative analysis is precluded due to the lack of accurate optical models with bond and orientation specificity. We generate such a model through an algorithm that parameterizes and refines density functional theory calculations with angle-resolved absorbance spectroscopy measurements. The resulting optical tensor is shown to reproduce data from samples with domains of different orientation and crystalline packing, enabling label-free orientation analyses of individual chemical moieties within molecular nanostructures using resonant X-rays.</description>

      <title>A Concise Review of Recently Synthesized 2D Carbon Allotropes: Amorphous Carbon, Graphynes, Biphenylene and Fullerene Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) carbon allotropes have received considerable attention due to their unique properties and potential applications in several fields, including electronics, catalysis, energy storage, and sensing. Following the experimental realization of graphene, numerous other 2D carbon structures have been proposed and, in some cases, successfully synthesized. This work presents a concise review of the recently experimentally realized 2D carbon allotropes, including graphynes, biphenylene-based networks, fullerene networks, and monolayer amorphous carbon. For each class, we discuss structural characteristics, theoretical predictions, and synthesis methods, with emphasis on the interplay between theory and experiment. We also highlight instances where experimental studies overlooked relevant theoretical contributions. Finally, we identify theoretically predicted structures that remain unexplored experimentally, suggesting opportunities for synthesis-driven investigations.</description>

      <title>Raman spectroscopy of graphite with water as the pressure medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a high-pressure Raman spectroscopy study of a graphite-water mixture using water as the pressure-transmitting medium up to 9.9 GPa. In the graphite-rich region, three characteristic Raman features-the $E_{2g}^{(1)}$ shear mode, the G band ($E_{2g}^{(2)}$), and the 2D band-were observed and tracked as a function of pressure. The G band exhibits a pronounced blue shift with increasing pressure, indicating enhanced interlayer coupling between graphite planes. In the water-rich region, the librational band and three distinct O-H stretching modes were identified. Notably, above 8 GPa, the slope of the pressure dependence decreases relative to the earlier report, likely due to the influence of the water pressure medium, emphasizing the need for further investigation at higher pressures.</description>

      <title>Defining structural gradient hardening through Type II back stress for heterostructured materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recently proposed term "heterostructured (HS) materials" serves as an umbrella classification encompassing a wide range of materials that hold great promise for enhanced mechanical properties. Most HS materials exhibit back-stress strengthening, as is typical for all plastically non-homogeneous materials. To better embody the distinctiveness of materials crafted via innovative heterostructuring, here we introduce the concept of "structural gradient hardening" (SGH), which captures an essential feature of HS materials and complements traditional strengthening mechanisms. SGH refers to the extra strengthening that arises from a characteristic gradient structure introduced by heterostructuring, beyond what is predicted by the rule of mixtures. This distinction is useful, as the overall back stress can in fact be partitioned into Type I and Type II components, with the latter specifically quantifying the extra hardening originating from the structural and strain gradients established by heterostructuring, as articulated in this Viewpoint article.</description>

      <title>High-quality Tungsten-doped Vanadium Dioxide Thin Films Fabricated in an Extremely Low-oxygen Furnace Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work reports the fabrication and characterization of high-quality tungsten-doped vanadium dioxide (WxV1-xO2, x = 0~3 at. %) by thermal oxidation of sputtered tungsten-vanadium alloyed thin films with different atomic percentages and high-temperature annealing in an extremely low oxygen atmosphere (5 to 20 ppm) along with reduction of surface over-oxides in high vacuum (1 mPa). Oxidation parameters such as temperature, time and nitrogen purging rate are first optimized for obtaining high quality undoped VO2 thin film. Insulator-to-metal (IMT) phase transition behavior of VO2 thin films fabricated in a low-O2 environment is characterized with temperature dependent spectral infrared transmittance and electrical resistivity measurements, where there is 15% higher infrared transmittance change and additional 1 order change in resistivity in comparison with VO2 thin films fabricated in a O2-rich environment. Grazing angle X-ray diffraction scan confirms no presence of higher oxides in the VO2 oxidized in low-O2 environment, which improves its quality significantly. Comprehensive studies on thermal annealing and vacuum reduction for tungsten doped VO2 thin films are also carried out to find the optimal fabrication conditions. With the tungsten at. % measured by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, the optimal WVO2 thin films fabricated through this streamlined oxidation, annealing and reduction processes in extremely low-O2 furnace environment exhibit lowered IMT temperature at -23{\deg}C per at.% of tungsten dopants from 68{\deg}C without doping. This low-cost and scalable fabrication method could facilitate the wide development of tunable WVO2 coatings in thermal and energy applications.</description>

      <title>Interfacial Control of both Magnetism and Polarization in a van der Waals Ferromagnet/Ferroelectric Heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional multiferroic van der Waals heterostructures provide a promising platform for the simultaneous control of distinct ferroic orders, with potential applications in magnetoelectric devices and spintronics. The practical implementation of such technologies requires 2D magnets with high Curie temperatures and strong perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA). Here, based on first-principles calculations, we propose a multiferroic heterostructure composed of the room-temperature ferromagnet $\text{Fe}_3\text{Ga}\text{Te}_2$ and the ferroelectric $\text{In}_2\text{Se}_3$. We show that intercalation of Fe atoms into the van der Waals gap of the $\text{Fe}_3\text{Ga}\text{Te}_2$/$\text{In}_2\text{Se}_3$ heterostructure enhances PMA by nearly an order of magnitude relative to the pristine $\text{Fe}_3\text{Ga}\text{Te}_2$ monolayer, while simultaneously allowing electric polarization to be modulated through interfacial charge redistribution. The enhancement of PMA arises from interfacial hybridization that modifies the spin-orbit coupling of Fe $d$-orbitals. Our results demonstrate an effective pathway to engineer magnetoelectric coupling in two-dimensional multiferroic heterostructures and pave the way toward energy-efficient spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Optically induced spin Hall current in monolayer Janus NbSSe: A first-principles study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monolayer Janus transition-metal dichalcogenides possess Ising- and Rashba-type spin-orbit-couplings (SOC), leading to intriguing spin splitting effects at K and K$'$, and around $\Gamma$ points across the wide energy range. Using first-principles calculations, we unveil these SOC characteristics in metallic Janus NbSSe and demonstrate its potential for optically controlled spin current eneration. On the basis of the symmetry of the system, we show that different linear polarized light can selectively drive spin currents of distinct spin components. Our findings establish NbSSe as a promising candidate for next-generation optospintronic technologies, which is offering a pathway toward the development of polarization-tunable spin-current sources.</description>

      <title>Extremely Large and Angle-Dependent Magnetoresistance in Kagome Dirac Semimetal RFe$_6$Sn$_6$ (R=Ho, Dy)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the electronic, magnetic, and magneto-transport properties of Fe-based kagome Dirac system, RFe$_6$Sn$_6$ (R = Ho, Dy). Magnetic properties study reveals an antiferromagnetic order with N$\acute{e}$el temperature of $T_N \approx$ 570 K. Additionally, a weak ferromagnetic order emerge at low temperatures. Magnetotransport measurements demonstrate an extremely large magnetoresistance (XMR) reaching as high as $3\times 10^{3} \%$ for HoFe$_6$Sn$_6$ and $ 1\times 10^{3} \%$ for DyFe$_6$Sn$_6$ when measured at 2 K with 9 T of magnetic field. The semi-classical two-band model fitting of the Hall conductivity reveals nearly perfect electron-hole compensation and high carrier mobility, which leads to XMR behaviour in these system. Further, we identify large magnetoresistance anisotropy for the magnetic fields applied in different crystallographic orientations. In addition, considerable modification in the angle-dependent magnetoresistance (ADMR) pattern has been noticed between 2 and 50 K, indicating temperature-dependent changes in the Fermi surface topology of these systems.</description>

      <title>Phase field simulation of dendrite growth in solid-state lithium batteries based on mechanical-thermo-electrochemical coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solid-state lithium batteries possess numerous advantages, such as high energy density, excellent cycle stability, superior mechanical strength, non-flammability, enhanced safety, and extended service life. These characteristics make them highly suitable for applications in aerospace, new energy vehicles, and portable electronic devices. However, the growth of lithium dendrite at the electrode/electrolyte interface remains a critical challenge, limiting both performance and safety. The growth of lithium dendrites in the electrolyte not only reduces the Coulombic efficiency of the battery but also poses a risk of puncturing the electrolyte, leading to internal short circuits between the anode and cathode. This study is to solve the problem of lithium dendrite growth in solid-state lithium batteries by employing phase-field theory for numerical simulations. A phase-field model is developed by coupling the mechanical stress field, thermal field, and electrochemical field, to investigate the morphology and evolution of lithium dendrites under the condition of different ambient temperatures, external pressures, and their combined effects. The results indicate that higher temperature and greater external pressure significantly suppress lithium dendrite growth, leading to fewer side branches, smoother surfaces, and more uniform electrochemical deposition. Increased external pressure inhibits longitudinal dendrite growth, resulting in a compressed morphology with higher compactness, but at the cost of increased mechanical instability. The combined effect of temperature and pressure exhibits a pronounced inhibitory influence on dendrite growth, with stress concentrating at the dendrite roots. This stress distribution promotes lateral growth, facilitating the formation of flatter and denser lithium deposits.</description>

      <title>A High-Throughput Search for Stable and Magnetically Robust Fe$_3$XY$_2$ Monolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present first principles exploration of 529 Fe$_3$XY$_2$ compounds, where $X$ and $Y$ elements are selected from the $p$-block of the periodic table. Out of the entire set, 31 compounds satisfy all criteria for energetic, dynamic, mechanical, and thermal stability. Our analysis reveals several key trends: halide-containing systems exhibit the highest average magnetic moments and the highest magnetic transition temperatures, highlighting their potential for room-temperature spintronic applications. The majority of stable compounds display perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA), with Fe$_3$SiTe$_2$ exhibiting the strongest PMA among all candidates. Exchange interactions are found to be governed by a dual mechanism, direct exchange between nearest-neighbor Fe atoms and indirect, $p$-orbital-mediated exchange for second-nearest neighbors and beyond. Notably, four compounds have non-centrosymmetric crystal structures and exhibit finite spiralization constants. Among them, Fe$_3$AsBr$_2$ is predicted to host N\'eel-type skyrmions even at zero external magnetic field, as confirmed by micromagnetic simulations. These findings offer a roadmap for experimental realization of novel 2D ferromagnets with enhanced functionalities.</description>

      <title>Theoretical calculation of finite-temperature X-ray absorption fine structure: application to sodium K-edge in NaCl</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive computational framework for reproducing the full X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) through quantum-chemical simulations. The near-edge region is accurately captured using an efficient implementation of time-dependent density-functional perturbation theory applied to core excitations, while ab initio molecular dynamics provides essential sampling of core-excitation energies and interatomic distance distributions for interpreting extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) features. Owing to the efficiency of the approach, the total spectrum can be decomposed into contributions from bulk, defective, and surface environments, which commonly coexist in experimental systems. The methodology is demonstrated for sodium at the Na K-edge in NaCl, where the predicted spectra show good agreement with experimental measurements on thin film samples. This strategy offers a practical route to generating chemically specific XAFS cross-section data for elements and species that remain challenging to characterize experimentally, thereby enabling deeper insights into materials of technological importance.</description>

      <title>Non-Ferroelectric to Ferroelectric Phase Transition in epitaxial Y:HfO$_2$ via Rapid Thermal Annealing Induced Nitrogen Doping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02229v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Oxygen vacancies are often essential for stabilizing the orthorhombic ferroelectric phase in HfO$_2$, with cationic doping widely employed to introduce such defects. In contrast, systematic studies on anionic doping to induce ferroelectricity remain largely in nascent stages. On epitaxial Y:HfO$_2$ grown on ITO buffered YSZ substrates that crystallize in a mixed monoclinic (non-polar) and orthorhombic (polar) phases, we introduce nitrogen doping via post deposition rapid thermal annealing (RTA) in N$_2$ atmosphere at 900~$^\circ$C. As the annealing time increases from 10s to 4min, the monoclinic phase fraction diminishes, enabling the emergence of well-defined ferroelectric loops in films annealed beyond 2~min. We clearly show that this is an effect of nitrogen incorporation (doping) into the samples through a suite of structure-property correlation measurements including x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. These results reveal that nitrogen actively participates in the RTA-induced phase stabilization, enabling ferroelectricity in epitaxial Y:HfO$_2$ without sacrificing crystallographic coherence, providing a viable pathway for structure-property correlation studies and a model system to study opto-electronic devices integrated with ferroelectrics.</description>

      <title>Improving atomic force microscopy structure discovery via style-translation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomic force microscopy (AFM) is a key tool for characterising nanoscale structures, with functionalised tips now offering detailed images of the atomic structure. In parallel, AFM simulations using the particle probe model provide a cost-effective approach for rapid AFM image generation. Using state-of-the-art machine learning models and substantial simulated datasets, properties such as molecular structure, electrostatic potential, and molecular graph can be predicted from AFM images. However, transferring model performance from simulated to experimental AFM images poses challenges due to the subtle variations in real experimental data compared to the seemingly flawless simulations. In this study, we explore style translation to augment simulated images and improve the predictive performance of machine learning models in surface property analysis. We reduce the style gap between simulated and experimental AFM images and demonstrate the method's effectiveness in enhancing structure discovery models through local structural property distribution comparisons. This research presents a novel approach to improving the efficiency of machine learning models in the absence of labelled experimental data.</description>

      <title>Van der Waals Density Functional for Molecular Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the development of the nonlocal correlation functional vdW-DF, the family of van der Waals density functionals has grown to better describe a wide variety of systems. A recent generation of the vdW-DF family, vdW-DF3, featured a newly-constructed form of the nonlocal correlation that more accurately modeled molecular dimers, layered structures, and surface adsorption. However, it also revealed an intrinsic tradeoff in vdW-DF3's parametrization and inflexibility of exchange in the generalized gradient approximation (GGA), limiting its accuracy for molecular crystals. In this paper we propose a new optimization of vdW-DF3 that is tailored to 3D molecular crystals. This functional, called vdW-DF3-mc, contains a new, tunable form of the exchange enhancement factor with parameters that directly correspond to physically relevant qualities. In addition, within the nonlocal correlation, we prioritize smoothness of the kernel switching function as a means of restoring flexibility to vdW-DF3's design. Testing vdW-DF3-mc on several benchmark sets, we achieve highly accurate energetics and geometries for molecular crystals. This is particularly evident for the case of polymorphs of ice, for which errors in the volume and cohesive energy are on the order of only 1%, indicating very promising performance for important subcategories of molecular crystals, such as polymorphism and hydrogen-bonded solids.</description>

      <title>Pressure-Induced Mechanical Instabilities in Cubic SiC: Structural and Electronic Properties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silicon carbide is widely used in electronics, ceramics, and renewable energy due to its exceptional hardness and resistance. In this study, we investigate the effects of hydrostatic and uniaxial pressure (both compressive and tensile) on the structural and electronic properties of $3C$-SiC. Our analysis is based on atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using an efficient tight-binding Hamiltonian, whose accuracy is validated against density functional theory calculations. Moreover, to account for nuclear quantum effects, we employ path-integral MD simulations. Our results show significant changes in the direct electronic gap as a function of temperature and pressure, with a renormalization of about 80 meV due to zero-point motion. Under hydrostatic tensile pressure, the direct band gap $E_{\Gamma}$ vanishes at the material's mechanical stability limit (spinodal point, where the bulk modulus $B \to 0$). For uniaxial pressure, we observe instabilities (Young's modulus $Y \to 0$) at approximately 90 GPa for both tension and compression, where $E_{\Gamma} \to 0$. Additionally, we analyze the pressure dependence of the internal energy, lattice parameter, and bond length, along with their finite-temperature fluctuations, which exhibit anomalies near the instability points.</description>

      <title>Experimental electronic structure of the mineral superconductor covellite CuS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Covellite (CuS) is the first known natural mineral superconductor. Despite its simple chemical formula, covellite exhibits a rich crystal structure at the origin of several remarkable properties. The ionic arrangement in CuS crystals leads to a mixed valence of Cu and a second-order structural transition at 55 K. Despite the abundance of structural studies and theoretical reports on its electronic structure, there are scarce references on its experimental band structure. By means of Angle Resolved PhotoEmission Spectroscopy (ARPES), we have probed the experimental electronic structure of covellite. We compare our results with the predictions of density-functional theory (DFT) calculations. Our experimental data are in remarkable agreement with the calculations, revealing subtle fingerprints of the structural phase transition, and confirming the quasi-2D nature of the electronic structure of CuS.</description>

      <title>Medium-range structural order in amorphous arsenic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medium-range order (MRO) is a key structural feature of amorphous materials, but its origin and nature remain elusive. Here, we reveal the MRO in amorphous arsenic (a-As) using advanced atomistic simulations, based on machine-learned potentials derived using automated workflows. Our simulations accurately reproduce the experimental structure factor of a-As, especially the first sharp diffraction peak (FSDP), which is a signature of MRO. We compare and contrast the structure of a-As with that of its lighter homologue, red amorphous phosphorus (a-P), identifying the dihedral-angle distribution as a key factor differentiating the MRO in both. The pressure-dependent structural behaviors of a-As and a-P differ as well, which we link to the interplay of ring topology and structural entropy. We finally show that the origin of the FSDP is closely correlated with the size and spatial distribution of voids in the amorphous networks. Our work provides fundamental insights into MRO in an amorphous elemental system, and more widely it illustrates the usefulness of automation for machine-learning-driven atomistic simulations.</description>

      <title>General structure factor and dynamic effects of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction in S = 1/2 clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the effects of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) has become increasingly important in the context of nanoscale magnetism and spintronics. In this study, we derive a general structure factor equation for an S = 1/2 dimer and show that the anisotropic ratio $D_z/|J|$ and complex phase $\phi$ of the DMI control the gap energy and intensity of the $|0,0\rangle \to |1,0\rangle$ transition. {Using exact diagonalization of the Heisenberg spin-spin Hamiltonian that incorporates both isotropic and anisotropic interactions,} as well as the effects of an external magnetic field and an electric field. Our results show that the DM interaction splits energy eigenstates, induces level repulsion, and significantly modifies the spin dimer structure factor. These effects reveal a direct correspondence between thermodynamic anomalies in the heat capacity and spin-resolved selection rules.</description>

      <title>Photothermomechanicaly Efficient, Low-Cost, High-Cycle-Life, Hybrid MXene-Polymer Actuators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photothermomechanical polymer film actuators stand out among the dynamic components available for soft robotics due to a combination of assets, such as capability for rapid energy transduction, wireless control, and ease of miniaturization. Despite their anticipated superior performance, several design challenges remain. These include high operational temperatures, inadequate mechanical output relative to the radiation energy provided, limited durability during repeated use, and high production costs; such factors hinder the scalability of these actuating materials in practical applications. Here, we report a viable solution by substituting performance-enhancing nanoparticles with MXenes--carbon-based, two-dimensional materials known for their theoretical photothermal conversion efficiency of up to 100%. This led to the development of MXene-dispersed polymer trilayer actuators (MPTAs). Extensive photothermal and thermomechanical characterization demonstrated superior performance compared to previously reported actuators, with a reduced shed power demand (0.1 mW cm$^{-2}$ $^\circ$C$^{-1}$), substantial bending capacity per irradiation power per time (0.1$^\circ$ mW$^{-1}$ cm$^{2}$ s$^{-1}$), and enhanced cyclic longevity, with fatigueless operation of at least 1,000 cycles. We demonstrate three applications: A kirigami-inspired flower, parallel manipulator, and soft gripper. Additionally, these materials are cost-effective; thus, they are the optimal choice for long-term, reversible operation with efficient heat-to-work transduction.</description>

      <title>Poroelasticity of bottlebrush and linear polymer networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The transport of solvent molecules through soft, swollen networks is critical in both natural and engineered systems. While this poroelastic flow has traditionally been explored in networks where the mesh size is comparable to the solvent molecule size, the effect of network architecture on permeability remains underexplored. Here we investigate solvent transport in linear polymer networks (LPN) and highly elastic bottlebrush elastomer networks (BBN), where the presence of densely grafted sidechains allows for control over swelling and mechanical properties. By synthesizing BBNs with systematically varied crosslinking density while maintaining constant sidechain length and grafting density, we probe the poroelastic response in the stretched backbone regime (SBB). Poroelastic relaxation indentation experiments, performed in toluene, reveal how permeability scales with crosslink density and polymer volume fraction. Compared to LPN with identical chemistry, the BBN exhibited a lower permeability scaling exponent with polymer volume fraction that closely matches the theoretical exponent. Despite architectural differences, permeability data for both networks collapse onto a single curve when plotted against dry shear modulus. Our findings demonstrate that molecular network architecture significantly influences permeability, offering new routes to tailor solvent transport in soft, swollen networks. These insights highlight BBNs as a promising platform for applications in permeable membranes, filtration, and microfluidic systems, and pave the way for further studies on how network parameters, such as sidechain length, impact permeability in these highly tunable materials.</description>

      <title>When wall slip wins over shear flow: A temperature-dependent Eyring slip law and a thermal multiscale model for diamond-like carbon lubricated by a polyalphaolefin oil</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantitative description of lubricant flow in nanoscale channels is complicated by various finite-size effects that are not taken into account in conventional thermo-elasto-hydrodynamic lubrication (TEHL) models. One of these effects is wall slip, a phenomenon that has been extensively studied both theoretically and experimentally. The relationship between wall slip and thermal effects is intricate, and some authors debate whether the friction reduction observed in their experiments in the TEHL regime can be explained by either slip or viscosity reduction in heated lubricants. To disentangle these mechanisms, a comprehensive molecular dynamics study of the relationship between temperature and slip in the shear flow of a 4 cSt polyalphaolefin (PAO4) base oil in a nanoscale diamond-like carbon (DLC) channel is performed here. An Eyring law describes the relationship between slip velocity and shear stress at the solid-liquid interface for a given temperature and pressure. The same simulation campaign provides a pressure-dependent law for the interface thermal resistance (ITR) between DLC and PAO4. These constitutive laws are employed in a continuum model for lubricated parallel channels. By taking heat conduction into account and combining the slip and ITR laws with a temperature- and pressure-dependent Eyring viscosity law, questions about the competition of slip and thermal thinning of the lubricant can be answered. For DLC film thicknesses compatible with tribological experiments and applications, this model shows that slip is only relevant for very thin lubricant films that are typical of boundary lubrication, suggesting the dominance of thermal thinning in the TEHL regime.</description>

      <title>Homogenization framework for rigid and non-rigid foldable origami metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Origami metamaterials typically consist of folded sheets with periodic patterns, conferring them with remarkable mechanical properties. In the context of Continuum Mechanics, the majority of existing predictive methods are mechanism analogs which favor rigid folding and panel bending. While effective in predicting primary deformation modes, existing methods fall short in capturing the full spectrum of deformation of non-rigid foldable origami, such as the emergence of curvature along straight creases, local strain at vertices and warpage in panels. To fully capture the entire deformation spectrum and enhance the accuracy of existing methods, this paper introduces a homogenization framework for origami metamaterials where the faces are modeled as plate elements. Both asymptotic and energy-based homogenization methods are formulated and implemented. As a representative crease pattern, we examine the Miura origami sheet homogenized as an equivalent Kirchhoff-Love plate. The results reveal that certain effective elastic properties are nonlinearly related to both the initial fold angle and the crease stiffness. When benchmarked with results from fully resolved simulations, our framework yields errors up to 12.9\%, while existing models, including the bar-and-hinge model and the rigid-panel model, show up to 161\% error. The differences in errors are associated with the complex modes of crease and panel deformation in non-rigid origami, unexplored by the existing models. This work demonstrates a precise and efficient continuum framework for origami metamaterials as an effective strategy for predicting their elastic properties, understanding their mechanics, and designing their functionalities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: M\"ossbauer spectroscopy is widely used in biochemistry, geology, and solid-state physics to obtain structural information on materials. Here, we extend this technique into the optical range using a vacuum ultraviolet laser to probe the low-energy nuclear transitions of thorium-229, doped in calcium fluoride crystals. We discover four distinct doping sites for the thorium ions, determine the characteristic electric field gradients emerging in the interaction with the host crystal, and identify the microscopic structure of the two dominant configurations. Site-selective laser excitation allows to study the isomeric state lifetime and laser-induced quenching for all sites. This laser-based M\"ossbauer spectroscopy provides a powerful probe of the nuclear environment, yielding foundational data for designing future solid-state nuclear clocks.</description>

      <title>Phase-Field Modeling of Two-Phase Flows: A Projection-Based Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The coupled Cahn-Hilliard and Navier-Stokes (CH-NS) equations provide a powerful framework for modeling multiphase flows with diffuse interfaces, enabling simulations of droplet breakup, bubble dynamics, and hydrodynamic instabilities. These capabilities are vital in boiling heat transfer, microfluidics, coating, additive manufacturing, and oil-water separation, where resolving fluid-fluid interactions is essential. Numerically, the CH-NS system is challenging: the Cahn-Hilliard equation involves higher-order derivatives and nonlinearities, and coupling with Navier-Stokes introduces strong two-way interactions. The velocity field advects the phase field, while the evolving interface alters density and viscosity, feeding back into the flow. Variable-density and variable-viscosity systems further increase complexity, requiring accurate treatment of property contrasts without losing stability or mass conservation. To address this, we employ a decoupled pressure-projection method with finite differences on staggered grids and explicit Euler time stepping. Our formulation extends the CH-NS system to homogeneous and variable-property fluids with consistent hydrodynamic-phase-field coupling. Validation against canonical benchmarks-including bubble rise and Plateau-Taylor instability shows excellent agreement in rise velocity, interface shape, and instability wavelength. This framework establishes a reproducible foundation for multiphysics extensions such as heat transfer, phase change, and electrohydrodynamics in boiling, droplet manipulation, and electronics cooling</description>

      <title>Migration as a Probe: A Generalizable Benchmark Framework for Specialist vs. Generalist Machine-Learned Force Fields in Doped Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine-learned force fields (MLFFs), particularly pre-trained foundation models, promise to bring ab initio-level accuracy to the length and time scales of molecular dynamics. Yet this shift raises a central question: is it better to build a specialist model from scratch or adapt a generalist foundation model for a specific system? The trade-offs in data efficiency, predictive accuracy, and risks of out-of-distribution (OOD) failure remain unclear. Here, we present a benchmarking framework that contrasts bespoke (from scratch) and fine-tuned foundation models in a test case of a technologically relevant 2D material, Cr-intercalated Sb2Te3, using the MACE architecture. Our framework employs migration pathways, evaluated through nudged elastic band (NEB) trajectories, as a diagnostic probe that tests both interpolation and extrapolation. We assess accuracy for equilibrium, kinetic (atomic migration), and mechanical (interlayer sliding) tasks. While all models capture equilibrium structures, predictions for non-equilibrium processes diverge. Task-specific fine-tuning substantially improves kinetic accuracy compared with both from-scratch and zero-shot models, but can degrade learned representations of long-range physics. Analysis of internal representations shows that training paradigms yield distinct, non-overlapping latent encodings of system physics. This work offers a practical guide for MLFF development, highlights migration-based probes as efficient diagnostics, and suggests pathways toward uncertainty-aware active learning strategies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advanced scientific user facilities, such as next generation X-ray light sources and self-driving laboratories, are revolutionizing scientific discovery by automating routine tasks and enabling rapid experimentation and characterizations. However, these facilities must continuously evolve to support new experimental workflows, adapt to diverse user projects, and meet growing demands for more intricate instruments and experiments. This continuous development introduces significant operational complexity, necessitating a focus on usability, reproducibility, and intuitive human-instrument interaction. In this work, we explore the integration of agentic AI, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), as a transformative tool to achieve this goal. We present our approach to developing a human-in-the-loop pipeline for operating advanced instruments including an X-ray nanoprobe beamline and an autonomous robotic station dedicated to the design and characterization of materials. Specifically, we evaluate the potential of various LLMs as trainable scientific assistants for orchestrating complex, multi-task workflows, which also include multimodal data, optimizing their performance through optional human input and iterative learning. We demonstrate the ability of AI agents to bridge the gap between advanced automation and user-friendly operation, paving the way for more adaptable and intelligent scientific facilities.</description>

      <title>afspm: A Framework for Manufacturer-Agnostic Automation in Scanning Probe Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scanning probe microscopy (SPM) is a valuable technique by which one can investigate the physical characteristics of the surfaces of materials. However, its widespread use is hampered by the time-consuming nature of running an experiment and the significant domain knowledge required. Recent studies have shown the value of multiple forms of automation in improving this, but their use is limited due to the difficulty of integrating them with SPMs other than the one it was developed for. With this in mind, we propose an automation framework for SPMs aimed toward facilitating code sharing and reusability of developed components. Our framework defines generic control and data structure schemas which are passed among independent software processes (components), with the final SPM commands sent after passing through an SPM-specific translator. This approach permits multi-language support and allows for experimental components to be decoupled among multiple computers. Our mediation logic limits access to the SPM to a single component at a time, with a simple override mechanism in order to correct detected experiment problems. To validate our proposal, we integrated and tested it with two SPMs from separate manufacturers, and ran an experiment involving a thermal drift correction component.</description>

      <title>Percolation transition in entangled granular networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00216v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Highly nonconvex granular particles, such as staples and metal shavings, can form solid-like cohesive structures through geometric entanglement (interlocking). The network structure formed by this entanglement, however, remains largely unexplored. Here we utilize network science to investigate the entanglement networks of C-shaped granular particles under vibration through experiments and simulations. By analyzing key network properties, we demonstrate that these networks undergo a percolation transition as the number of links increases logarithmically over time; the entangled particles form a giant cluster when the number of links exceeds a critical threshold. We propose a continuum percolation model of rings that effectively describes the observed transition. Additionally, we find that particle's opening angle significantly affects mechanical bonding and, consequently, the network structure. This work highlights the potential of network-based approaches to study entangled materials, paving the way for advancements in applications ranging from mechanical metamaterials to entangled robot swarms.</description>

      <title>Strategies to search for two-dimensional materials with long spin qubit coherence time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials that can host qubits with long spin coherence time (T2) have the distinct advantage of integrating easily with existing microelectronic and photonic platforms, making them attractive for designing novel quantum devices with enhanced performance. However, the relative lack of 2D materials as spin qubit hosts, as well as appropriate substrates that can help maintain long T2, necessitates a strategy to search for candidates with robust spin coherence. Here, we develop a high-throughput computational workflow to predict the nuclear spin bath-driven qubit decoherence and T2 in 2D materials and heterostructures. We initially screen 1173 2D materials and find 190 monolayers with T2 &gt; 1 ms, higher than that of naturally-abundant diamond. We then construct 1554 lattice-commensurate heterostructures between high-T2 2D materials and select 3D substrates, and we find that T2 is generally lower in a heterostructure than in the bare 2D host material; however, low-noise substrates (such as CeO2 and CaO) can help maintain high T2. To further accelerate the material screening effort, we derive analytical models that enable rapid predictions of T2 for 2D materials and heterotructures. The models offer a simple, yet quantitative, way to determine the relative contributions to decoherence from the nuclear spin baths of the 2D host and substrate in a heterostructural system. By developing a high-throughput workflow and analytical models, we expand the genome of 2D materials and their spin coherence times for the development of spin qubit platforms.</description>

      <title>Insights into the Structure and Dynamics of Water at Co$_3$O$_4$(001) Using a High-Dimensional Neural Network Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Co$_3$O$_4$ is an important catalyst for the oxidation of organic molecules in the liquid phase. Still, understanding the atomistic details of Co$_3$O$_4$-water interfaces under operando conditions remains extremely challenging. While ab initio molecular dynamics have become an essential tool for investigating these dynamic interfaces in silico, they are limited to only a few picoseconds and a few hundred atoms. In this work, we overcome these limitations by training a high-dimensional neural network potential (HDNNP) on density functional theory data, which allows us to significantly extend the accessible time and length scales. Employing this HDNNP, we perform simulations to unravel the structure, dynamics, and reactivity of Co$_3$O$_4$(001)-water interfaces in detail. Our simulations reveal distinct characteristics of the two possible A and B terminations. The B-terminated surface stabilizes a compact, quasi-epitaxial hydration layer with strong templating effects, enhanced hydroxylation, and a well-organized hydrogen-bond network. In contrast, the A-termination forms a more diffuse contact layer with weaker templating, lower hydroxylation, and less ordered interfacial water. Extended simulations further uncover proton transfer pathways, including intermittent protonation of surface hydroxyls, migration of water molecules into the epitaxial layer, and rare hydronium-like configurations.</description>

Abstract: This work focuses on the study of the spectral problem for Dirac materials immersed in position-dependent magnetic and electric fields. To achieve this, the system of differential equations satisfied by the eigenfunction components of the Hamiltonian has been decoupled, and the solutions for some specific cases have been analyzed using Heun functions, which provide us with a quantization relation and allow us to determine the solutions for the bound states.</description>

Abstract: Group-IV vacancy (G4V, or XV, where X = Si, Ge, Sn, Pb) color centers constitute a novel and promising class of defects in diamonds. This chapter reviews and refines the theoretical models for the XV systems, encompassing the intrinsic interactions, including spin-orbit coupling and electron-phonon interactions, and the external interactions involving strain, electric, light, and magnetic fields. Based on the refined model, we predict their properties, explain the experimental data, and suggest follow-up experiments. This article established a solid foundation for controlling the XV system, thus paving the way for quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>A Further Comparison of TD-DMRG and ML-MCTDH for Nonadiabatic Dynamics of Exciton Dissociation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tensor network methods, such as time-dependent density matrix renormalization group (TD-DMRG) and multi-layer multiconfiguration time-dependent Hartree (ML-MCTDH), are powerful tools for simulating quantum dynamics. While both methods are theoretically exact in the limit of large bond dimensions, a recent study reported up to 60% discrepancy in their calculations for exciton dissociation. To resolve this inconsistency, we conduct a systematic comparison using Renormalizer, a unified software framework for matrix product states (MPS) and tree tensor network states (TTNS). By revisiting the benchmark P3HT:PCBM heterojunction model, we show that the observed discrepancies arise primarily from insufficient bond dimensions. By increasing bond dimensions, we first reduce the difference to less than 10%. Further refinement using an extrapolation scheme and an optimized tensor network structure lowers the difference to approximately 2%. Our results confirm both methods converge to numerically exact solutions when bond dimensions are adequately scaled. This work not only validates the reliability of both methods but also provides high-accuracy benchmark data for future developments in quantum dynamics simulations.</description>

      <title>rhodent: A Python package for analyzing real-time TDDFT response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-time time-dependent density functional theory (rt-TDDFT) is a well-established method for studying the dynamic response of matter in the femtosecond or optical range. In this method, the Kohn-Sham (KS) wave functions are propagated forward in time, and in principle, one can extract any observable at any given time. Alternatively, by taking a Fourier transform, spectroscopic quantities can be extracted. There are many publicly available codes implementing rt-TDDFT, which differ in their numeric solution of the KS equations, their available exchange-correlation functionals, and in their analysis capabilities. For users of rt-TDDFT, this is an inconvenient situation because they may need to use a numerical method that is available in one code, but an analysis method available in another. Here, we introduce rhodent, a modular Python package for processing the output of rt-TDDFT calculations. Our package can be used to calculate hot-carrier distributions, energies, induced densities, and dipole moments, and various decompositions thereof. In its current version, rhodent handles calculation results from the gpaw code, but can readily be extended to support other rt-TDDFT codes. Additionally, under the assumption of linear response, rhodent can be used to calculate the response to a narrow-band laser, from the response to a broad-band perturbation, greatly speeding up the analysis of frequency-dependent excitations. We demonstrate the capabilities of rhodent via a set of examples, for systems consisting of Al and Ag clusters and organic molecules.</description>

      <title>Radio-Frequency Method for Detecting Superconductivity Under High Pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a contactless technique for probing superconductivity, metal-insulator transitions, and magnetic ordering in micron-sized samples under extreme pressure. Utilizing a multistage Lenz lens system, directly sputtered onto diamond anvils, we realize a radio-frequency (RF, 50 kHz - 200 MHz) transformer with a sample, of 50-100 microns in diameter, as its core. This configuration enables efficient transfer and focusing of an electromagnetic field within the diamond anvil cell's chamber. Consequently, the transmitted RF signal exhibits high sensitivity to variations in the sample's surface conductivity and magnetic permeability. We validate this method by determining the critical temperatures ($T_{\text{c}}$) of known superconductors, including NbTi, MgB$_2$, Hg-1223, BSCCO, and REBCO in various magnetic fields, as well as the magnetic ordering temperatures of Gd and Tb, and the metal-insulator transition in VO$_2$. Notably, we apply this technique to the (La,Ce)H$_{10-12}$ superhydride at a pressure of about 150 GPa. The observed superconducting transition, at 215-220 K, is noticeably higher than the $T_{\text{c}}$ determined via traditional electrical-resistance measurements (200-205 K), demonstrating the method's enhanced sensitivity. Moreover, we show how multiple repetitions of the RF experiment with the La-Ce superhydride make it possible to detect the increase in $T_{\text{c}}$ over time up to 260-270 K. This finding opens a pathway towards reaching a critical $T_{\text{c}}$ above 0$^\circ$C in the La-based superhydrides.</description>

      <title>Multi-Orbital Charge Transfer into Nonplanar Cycloarenes Revealed with CO-Functionalized Tips</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On-surface synthesis has allowed for the tuneable preparation of numerous molecular systems with variable properties. Recently, we demonstrated the highly selective synthesis of kekulene (&gt;99%) on Cu(111) and isokekulene (92%) on Cu(110) from the same molecular precursor (Ruan et al., Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2025, e202509932). Scanning tunneling microscopy with CO-functionalized tips can identify the single molecules on the basis of their geometric structure at a low coverage on Cu(110), but it also detects complex features due to electronic contributions close to the Fermi energy. Here, we investigate the origin of these features by simulating STM images based on a weighted sum of multiple molecular orbitals, for which we employ weights based on the calculated molecular-orbital projected density of states. This allows for an experimental confirmation of charge transfer from the surface into multiple formerly unoccupied molecular orbitals for single molecules of kekulene as well as isokekulene in its two nonplanar adsorption configurations. In comparison, the area-integrating photoemission orbital tomography technique confirms the charge transfer as well as the high selectivity for the formation of a full monolayer of mainly isokekulene on Cu(110). Our STM-based approach is applicable to a wide range of adsorbed molecular systems and specifically also suited for strongly interacting surfaces, nonplanar molecules, and such molecules which can only be prepared at extremely low yields.</description>

      <title>Aligning Reasoning LLMs for Materials Discovery with Physics-aware Rejection Sampling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AI-driven materials discovery that couples automated experimentation with algorithmic decision-making requires process aware recipe to property predictors that are accurate, calibrated, and physically admissible. We approach this as a reasoning problem with large reasoning models (LRMs). To instill reasoning capability into language models, we curate reasoning traces from a teacher model to train a student model. However, most training pipelines select reasoning traces using binary correctness or learned preference signals that poorly reflect physical admissibility. We introduce Physics-aware Rejection Sampling (PaRS), a training-time trace selection scheme that favors traces consistent with fundamental physics and numerically close to targets, with lightweight halting to control compute. We instantiate our framework with a large student model fine-tuned on traces synthesized by a larger teacher model, and evaluate under matched token budgets against various rejection sampling baselines. Our method improves accuracy and calibration, reduces physics-violation rates, and lowers sampling cost relative to baselines. These results indicate that modest, domain-aware constraints combined with trace-level selection provide a practical path toward reliable, efficient LRMs for process-aware property prediction and closed-loop materials design.</description>

      <title>Topological switching in bilayer magnons via electrical control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological magnons, quantized spin waves featuring nontrivial boundary modes, present a promising route toward lossless information processing. Realizing practical devices typically requires magnons excited in a controlled manner to enable precise manipulation of their topological phases and transport behaviors. However, their inherent charge neutrality and a high frequency nature pose a significant challenge for nonvolatile control, especially via electric means. Herein, we propose a general strategy for electrical control of topological magnons in bilayer ferromagnetic insulators. With strong spin-layer coupling, an applied vertical electric field induces an interlayer potential imbalance that modifies intralayer Heisenberg exchanges between adjacent layers. This electric-field-driven modulation competes with the bilayer's intrinsic Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, enabling the accurate tuning of the band topology and nonreciprocal dynamics of magnons. More importantly, such an electric control mechanism exhibits strong coupling with external magnetic fields, unveiling new perspectives on magnetoelectric coupling in charge-neutral quasiparticles</description>

      <title>Crystal Structure Prediction with a Geometric Permutation-Invariant Loss Function</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Crystalline structure prediction remains an open challenge in materials design. Despite recent advances in computational materials science, accurately predicting the three-dimensional crystal structures of organic materials--an essential first step for designing materials with targeted properties--remains elusive. In this work, we address the problem of molecular assembly, where a set $\mathcal{S}$ of identical rigid molecules is packed to form a crystalline structure. Existing state-of-the-art models typically rely on computationally expensive, iterative flow-matching approaches. We propose a novel loss function that correctly captures key geometric molecular properties while maintaining permutation invariance over $\mathcal{S}$. We achieve this via a differentiable linear assignment scheme based on the Sinkhorn algorithm. Remarkably, we show that even a simple regression using our method {\em SinkFast} significantly outperforms more complex flow-matching approaches on the COD-Cluster17 benchmark, a curated subset of the Crystallography Open Database (COD).</description>

      <title>Observation of moir\'e trapped biexciton through sub-diffraction-limit probing using hetero-bilayer on nanopillar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability to tune the degree of interaction among particles at the nanoscale is highly intriguing. The spectroscopic signature of such interaction is often subtle and requires special probes to observe. To this end, inter-layer excitons trapped in the periodic potential wells of a moir\'e superlattice offer rich interaction physics, specifically due to the presence of both attractive and repulsive components in the interaction. Here we show that the Coulomb force between two inter-layer excitons switches from repulsive to attractive when the length scale reduces from inter-moir\'e-pocket to intra-moir\'e-pocket in a WS$_2$/WSe$_2$ hetero-bilayer - thanks to the complex competition between direct and exchange interaction. The finding is a departure from the usual notion of repelling inter-layer excitons due to layer polarization. This manifests as the simultaneous observation of an anomalous superlinear power-law of moir\'e exciton and a stabilization of moir\'e trapped biexciton. The experimental observation is facilitated by placing the hetero-bilayer on a polymer-nanopillar/gold-film stack which significantly reduces the inhomogeneous spectral broadening by selectively probing a smaller ensemble of moir\'e pockets compared with a flat sample. This creates an interesting platform to explore interaction among moir\'e trapped excitons and higher order quasiparticles.</description>

      <title>Deformation-Driven Enhancement of Spin Defect Emission in Hexagonal Boron Nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The negatively charged boron vacancy (VB-) in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has been extensively investigated as it offers a novel playground for two-dimensional quantum sensing, with ultimate proximity to target samples. However, its practical sensitivity is limited by the intrinsically weak photoluminescence of the spin ensemble. Here, we report a photoluminescence enhancement of up to 30 times from VB- centers in suspended regions of hBN compared to those in substrate-supported areas. The key spin properties, such as the optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) contrast and linewidth, as well as the spin lifetime, of the VB- centers in this region are well preserved. Detailed investigations, including measurements of zero-field ODMR, Raman spectroscopy, and Kelvin probe force microscopy, reveal a correlation between emission enhancement and local deformation in the sample. It is concluded that the suspended regions exhibit higher local deformation compared to the supported areas, breaking the local symmetry and thereby activating otherwise forbidden or weak optical transitions of the VB- centers.</description>

      <title>Calibration-sample free distortion correction of electron diffraction patterns using deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The accuracy of the information that can be extracted from electron diffraction patterns is often limited by the presence of optical distortions. Existing distortion characterization techniques typically require knowledge of the reciprocal lattice of either the sample of interest or a separate calibration sample, the latter of which would need to be swapped in, thus adding time and inconvenience to an experiment. To overcome this limitation, we develop a deep learning (DL) framework for measuring and correcting combinations of different types of optical distortion in CBED patterns. Quantitative performance tests of our DL model are conducted using testing datasets of artificial distorted CBED patterns of molybdenum disulfide on amorphous carbon, with varying sizes of CBED disks, that are generated using multislice simulations. The performance test results of our DL approach are benchmarked against those obtained using a conventional distortion estimation technique that uses the radial gradient maximization (RGM) technique and knowledge of the reciprocal lattice system. While the RGM approach outperforms our DL approach for the CBED patterns with very small disks, our DL approach outperforms the RGM approach for the CBED patterns with medium-sized disks, as well as those with large overlapping disks. The benchmarking results suggest that our DL approach, which does not require knowledge of the sample, achieves a good compromise between convenience and accuracy. We also show how our DL framework can be used to improve experimental ptychographic reconstructions, and to correct optical distortion in experimental selected area electron diffraction patterns.</description>

      <title>Topological Control of Polaritonic Flatbands in Anisotropic van der Waals Metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anisotropic van der Waals (vdW) materials exhibit direction-dependent optical and electronic properties, making them valuable for tailoring directional light-matter interactions. Rhenium disulfide (ReS$_2$) stands out for its strong in-plane anisotropy and its thickness-independent direct-bandgap excitons, which can hybridize with light to form exciton-polaritons. In parallel, metasurfaces, engineered arrays of nanoscale subwavelength resonators, can support ultra-sharp photonic modes in the form of quasi-bound states in the continuum (qBICs). Topological transformations of photonic modes can give rise to flatbands, i.e., dispersionless states with quenched kinetic energy and vanishing group velocity. Intrinsic material anisotropy offers an unexplored route to robust far-field flatband formation and control. Here, we demonstrate how structuring an intrinsically anisotropic excitonic material into a resonant metasurface fundamentally transforms its photonic topological features and light-matter coupling behavior, allowing us to drive and topologically control extended far-field flatband formation. To this end, we fabricate C$_4$-symmetric metasurfaces directly from bulk ReS$_2$. The intrinsic anisotropy lifts the initial double degeneracy of the qBIC mode and yields two distinctly polarized resonances. It also reshapes the topological landscape: the integer topological charge of the qBIC mode splits into momentum-separated half-integer singularities, thereby flattening the far-field photonic dispersion. The resulting topologically-controlled photonic flatbands are then tuned in resonance with the linearly polarized excitonic transitions of ReS$_2$, resulting in two distinct, directionally hybridized exciton-polariton flatband regimes. These findings establish anisotropic vdW metasurfaces as a new platform for topologically engineered flatbands and flatband-driven light-matter coupling.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we compare various models for describing the phase transition of the fluid hydrogen into a conducting state, including both chemical models of plasma and first-principle simulations within the framework of the density functional theory (DFT). The comparison of the results indicates the plasma nature of the phase transition in warm dense hydrogen. We propose a concept of a new class of first-order phase transitions: ionization or dissociation-driven phase transitions, with which the plasma phase transition in fluid hydrogen can be associated.</description>

      <title>CbLDM: A Diffusion Model for recovering nanostructure from pair distribution function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nowadays, the nanostructure inverse problem is an attractive problem that helps researchers to understand the relationship between the properties and the structure of nanomaterials. This article focuses on the problem of using PDF to recover the nanostructure, which this article views as a conditional generation problem. This article propose a deep learning model CbLDM, Condition-based Latent Diffusion Model. Based on the original latent diffusion model, the sampling steps of the diffusion model are reduced and the sample generation efficiency is improved by using the conditional prior to estimate conditional posterior distribution, which is the approximated distribution of p(z|x). In addition, this article uses the Laplacian matrix instead of the distance matrix to recover the nanostructure, which can reduce the reconstruction error. Finally, this article compares CbLDM with existing models which were used to solve the nanostructure inverse problem, and find that CbLDM demonstrates significantly higher prediction accuracy than these models, which reflects the ability of CbLDM to solve the nanostructure inverse problem and the potential to cope with other continuous conditional generation tasks.</description>

      <title>Topological polar textures on CsPbBr3 nanoplatelets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polar topological textures like the bubble domains, flux--closures, and labyrinth etc., unlock functional responses in ferroic systems but are difficult to stabilize and control in chemically simple, solution--grown materials. Here we show that ultra--thin, large--area CsPbBr$_3$ nanoplatelets host room--temperature ferroelectric bubble domains whose characteristic size is tunable by thickness. Using contact--resonance piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) across 125\~nm--2\~$\mu$m, we observe a systematic decrease in domain size with decreasing thickness, consistent with a depolarization--field controlled stability window. Repeated scanning transforms bubbles into labyrinthine patterns, indicating metastability under weak mechanical/electrical perturbations. Upon heating, bubbles evolve into labyrinths and vanish at $T_C\!\approx\!90^\circ$C, with domain nucleation recovered on cooling. These results establish a controllable platform for polar topology in a stable, stochiometric perovskite grown via a solvothermal route, and clarify how electrical boundary conditions (set by thickness and temperature) govern texture selection. The thickness--tunable polar textures identified here offer a route to engineer domain--wall--mediated functionalities in halide perovskites.</description>

      <title>Spin-orbit torque control of topology in intrinsic antiferromagnetic insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic topological insulators host exotic phenomena such as the quantum anomalous Hall effect and quantized magnetoelectric responses, but dynamic electrical control of their topological phases remains elusive. Here we demonstrate from first principles that spin-orbit torque enables direct switching of the topological state in the intrinsic antiferromagnetic bilayer MnBi$_2$Te$_4$. A symmetry-enforced interband (time-reversal even) torque persists inside the bulk gap and deterministically reverses the N\'eel order and layer-resolved Chern number without free carriers. Upon doping, both interband and intraband torques are amplified, lowering the critical electric field for switching by two orders of magnitude. Together, these results establish two complementary regimes of control, dissipationless in-gap torques without Joule heating and enhanced current-induced torques, providing a robust route to manipulate local Chern numbers, quasi-helical edge states, and topological responses in antiferromagnetic topological insulators.</description>

      <title>Magnonic radar for dynamic domain walls in synthetic antiferromagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin wave and magnetic domain wall are two of basic excitations in magnetic systems, and their spatiotemporal interplay encodes rich information of underlying magnetic interactions. In synthetic antiferromagnets, the domain wall acquires an inertia and the spin wave unlocks the full polarization degree of freedom, lays a salient platform for their interplay. Here we show that both the translational and angular velocities of domain wall in synthetic antiferromagnets can be detected via the scattered spin wave, through the synergy of translational and angular Doppler effects. Following the setup of an electromagnetic or acoustic radar, the time evolution of a domain wall state are accessible via a series of spin wave packets, in both non-invasive and invasive fashion. The inspections in frequency domain, offer new paradigms in exploration and exploitation of magnetic excitations.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Raman scattering by fast GaN phonon-polaritons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phonon-polaritons propagating in crystal volume offer the possibility of transferring information throughout matter (via phonons) at high (photon-like) velocity and tunable frequency/wavelength in the far-infrared. However, from the phonon-polariton Raman cross section, the phonon and photon advantages seem mutually exclusive. Either the phonon-polaritons are fast (photon-like) but hardly supported by the lattice (not phonon-like), or they are well supported by the lattice (testified by a high Raman efficiency) but slow (not photon-like). An optimal phonon-photon coupling is currently searched for in hexagonal-GaN by near-forward Raman scattering across parallel crystal faces with in-plane singular c-axis. Two accessible phonons, i.e., the ordinary A1 and E1 ones, plus two refractive indices, i.e., the ordinary and extraordinary ones, generate various phonon-polariton candidates. Notably, in perfect forward Raman scattering and in crossed polarizations of the incident (along c) and scattered lights, which, altogether, maximizes the transferred wavevector to the crystal at minimum scattering angle, a fast phonon-polariton, stemming from the bottleneck of the E1 dispersion on entry to the deep photon-like regime, is activated. It is well supported by the lattice since its Raman signal is strong and sharp, enhanced by multi-reflection of the laser beam between crystal faces at near-normal incidence. This fast Raman-enhanced phonon-polariton is interesting for infrared-photonics in that it cumulates the advantages of a photon (speed) and of a phonon (Raman intensity). Besides, it commutates from a phonon-polariton to a phonon by deviating from normal incidence or by permuting the incident and scattered polarizations, with potential applications as a vibrational/optical switch.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Indium-Arsenide (InAs) nanowire field-effect transistors (NWFETs) are promising platforms for high-speed, low power nanoelectronics operating at cryogenic conditions, relevant for quantum information processing. We present selective area growth (SAG) of nanowires, which enable scalability and planar geometries that are compatible with standard semiconductor processing techniques. NWFETs are fabricated and their low temperature characteristics - including ION/IOFF ratios, threshold voltages, sub-threshold slope, interfacial trap density, hysteresis, and mobility - are characterized. The NWFETs operate successfully in integrated circuitry relying on saturation-mode operation. In sub-threshold applications such as amplifiers, we find bandwidths exceeding our cryostat wiring, but the gate hysteresis presents challenges for precise tuning of the amplifier operating point. We discuss the role of crystal imperfections and fabrication processes on the transistor characteristics and propose strategies for further improvements.</description>

      <title>Impact of early-age exposure to power ultrasound on the micromechanical properties of hardened cement paste</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cement paste serves as the universal binder in concrete, formed by mixing water with Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC). In its fresh state, cement paste is a suspension in which the initial particle inventory continuously dissolves, while simultaneously, a growing population of colloidal calcium silica-hydrate (C-S-H) particles forms and progressively builds a percolated structure that densifies and hardens through hydration. Like most colloidal gels, cement paste is sensitive to external stimuli such as mechanical vibrations and temperature variations. Here, we show that power ultrasound (PUS) applied to OPC paste during the very early stages of hydration significantly alters the mechanical properties of the hardened material. Freshly prepared cement pastes are exposed to PUS at varying durations and intensities before curing for 28 days. Micro-indentation testing at the scale of tens of microns reveals that increasing PUS amplitude and prolonged PUS exposure degrade the micro-mechanical properties of hardened cement paste, making it more ductile. This softening behavior evolves continuously with exposure conditions and is consistent with an increase in porosity, likely caused by micro-cracks induced by PUS. This scenario is further supported by micro-scratch testing, which shows higher levels of acoustic emission in PUS-exposed samples. Finally, nano-indentation confirms that the properties of the individual phases composing the hardened paste -- low-density and high-density C-S-H -- remain largely unaffected. These findings offer valuable experimental insights into novel pathways for modifying the mechanical properties of reactive colloidal gels.</description>

      <title>Nanoscale Dipolar Fields in Artificial Spin Ice Probed by Scanning NV Magnetometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate dipolar coupling fields in two square-lattice artificial spin ice (ASI) systems with different lattice constants using scanning probe microscopy based on a single nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond. This technique offers unprecedented spatial resolution, operates under ambient condition, and provides quantitative stray field measurements, making it uniquely suited for studying nanoscale magnetic textures. Our approach combines fluorescence quenching imaging and continuous-wave optically detected magnetic resonance (cODMR). A comparison of the two ASI samples, which differ in their lattice constants of 1000 nm and 910 nm respectively, reveals differences in the appearance of ice-rule violations - deviations from the lowest energy configuration in ASI vertices. We attribute these variations to varying coupling strengths dictated by the lattice constant. From the cODMR data, we extract both axial and transverse components of the local magnetic field relative to the NV axis. Micromagnetic modeling of these measurements allows for an iterative determination of the external magnetic field orientation, the detection of subtle magnetization tilts induced by weak external fields (well below the nanomagnets' switching threshold), and an estimation of the effective saturation magnetization, thereby accounting for deviations in nanomagnet dimensions. These findings provide crucial insights into the tunable magnetic interactions in ASI, paving the way for the design of advanced magnonic and spintronic devices.</description>

Abstract: Highly coherent quantum emitters operating in the telecommunication C-band (1530 - 1565nm), where ultra-low-loss fibers and photonic circuits are available, are crucial to the development of scalable quantum technologies. In this work, we report on a modified Stranski-Krastanov growth scheme using chemical beam epitaxy to enable the generation of high-quality InAs/InP quantum dots, characterized by near-transform-limited linewidths ($\Gamma_{\mathrm{TL}}$). We demonstrate the growth of highly-symmetric quantum dots with aspect ratios &gt;0.8 and densities ranging from 2 to 22$\,\mu$m$^{-2}$. Optical characterization of these sources reveal fine-structure splittings down to $25\pm4\,\mu$eV and a single-photon purity of $g^{(2)}(0) = 0.012\pm\mathrm{0.007}$, confirming the quality of these dots. Further, using an etalon to measure the linewidth, in combination with rigorous modelling, we find an upper-bound to the mean, low-power linewidths of only $12.1\pm 6.7\,\Gamma_\mathrm{TL}$ and, in the best case, $2.8\pm 1.8\,\Gamma_\mathrm{TL}$. These results represent a significant step in the development of telecom-wavelength quantum light sources which are essential for complex quantum networks and devices.</description>

      <title>Signatures of three-state Potts nematicity in spin excitations of the van der Waals antiferromagnet FePSe$_3$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In two-dimensional (2D) nearly square-lattice quantum materials, electron correlations can induce an electronic nematic phase with twofold rotational ($C_2$) symmetry that profoundly impacts their properties. For 2D materials with threefold rotational ($C_3$) symmetry, such as the honeycomb lattice, a vestigial three-state Potts nematic order has been observed in the van der Waals antiferromagnet (AFM) FePSe$_3$ via optical and thermodynamic methods under uniaxial strain. Here, we use neutron scattering to study the magnetic order and spin excitations of FePSe$_3$ under uniaxial strain. In the AFM ordered state, we find that $\sim$0.6% tensile strain significantly suppresses one zigzag domain and promotes the other two, lowering the AFM order and spin waves to $C_2$ symmetry. The broken $C_3$ symmetry in spin excitations persists slightly above $T_{\rm{N}}\approx 108.6$ K, where the zigzag AFM order is absent. Our results thus provide direct evidence of magnetoelastic coupling and suggest that the three-state Potts nematicity in paramagnetic spin excitations arises from the vestigial order associated with the low-temperature zigzag AFM order.</description>

Abstract: Solids when rapidly and elastically stressed change temperature, the effect proposed by Lord Kelvin is adiabatic thermo-elastic cooling or heating depending on the sign of the stress. A fast sensitive IR camera has measured temperature both decreasing and increasing. Temperature measurements made from the reversible, elastic part of the stress-strain curve during fast uniaxial tensile loading have been investigated. The isentropic temperature cooling from the loading curve is recovered by heating after the specimen fractures when the load is released. These measurements establish for the first time isentropic thermal recovery in two engineering alloys. The materials tested are an AISI 4340 steel and an aluminum 2024 alloy. Measurements of the isentropic thermo-elastic stress cooling are -0.61 K/GPa for steel and -1.7 K/GPa for aluminum alloy. The isentropic thermo-elastic stress heating is -1.16 K/GPa for steel and -1.6 K/GPa for aluminum alloy. The isentropic, elastic part of the temperature is fully recoverable even after extensive plastic deformation upon fracture.</description>

Abstract: Understanding recrystallization boundary migration mechanisms is crucial for materials design. However, the lack of comprehensive mobility data for high-angle grain boundaries in typical polycrystalline samples has impeded gaining insights into the factors that govern boundary migration. Here, we propose an Iterative Mobility Matching (IMM) methodology to determine local mobility values and their spatial variations along recrystallization boundaries in partially recrystallized samples. This method optimizes mobility inputs in a phase field model by matching simulated microstructures with time-series recrystallization experiments. We first validate this method using synthetic data before applying it to real experimental data. For the first time, we reveal a three-order-magnitude variation in local mobility along individual recrystallization boundaries. The results show that local mobility depends strongly on boundary misorientation, and its variation significantly influences boundary dynamics, shedding light on the interplay of factors that impact the observed boundary migration behavior. The IMM methodology offers a new framework for interpreting experimental recrystallization behavior and can be broadly applied to other materials using in situ experiments.</description>

      <title>Observation of Orbital Hall Effect in Si</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14237v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Controlling/storing information carriers, such as electron charge and spin, is key for modern information society, and significant efforts have been paid made to establish novel technologies at the nanoscale. The rise of Si-based semiconductor technology and magnetism-based technology has been motivated by the aforementioned demands. However, both technologies have been individually developed, with little effort in fusing them. Hence, establishing a technology to bridge semiconductor and magnetism-based technologies that would allow realization of a novel information device is strongly awaited. In line with this research strategy, the creation of a magnetic device using semiconductors would enable fundamental innovation. Here, we show that a mother material for modern electronics, Si, gives rise to a room-temperature orbital Hall effect (OHE), enabling the creation of novel energy-efficient magnetic memory via efficient torque generation. The orbital torque efficiency {\xi}JDL of Si largely exceeds that of the archetypal metallic materials used in the OHE. Our achievement overturns the conventional understanding that nonmagnetic semiconductors cannot play a pivotal role in magnetic devices and paves a new avenue for creating novel information devices through the fusion of semiconductor and magnetism-based technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05465v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quest for optimal perovskite for tandem cell configurations is challenging as it involves several factors ranging from device level performance under field conditions to degradation rates and cost. Here, we first highlight the limitations of traditional detailed balance or Shockley-Queisser (SQ) analysis towards the design of Perovskite/Silicon tandem solar cells. Through well-calibrated numerical simulations, we evaluate geographic location-specific annual energy yield (EY) and quantify the influence of temperature-dependent material and transport parameters. Our results indicate that the EY scales in a near-identical manner with the top cell band gap(EgT) for various geographic locations. In comparison to SQ analysis, our simulations predict a twofold relaxation in the target degradation rates at which perovskites over a broad range of band gaps could yield a comparable levelized cost of Energy (LCOE). These insights are of broad interest for the development of perovskite materials, and test protocols to evaluate the stability of Perovskite-Silicon tandem solar cells.</description>

      <title>Effects of altermagnetic order, strain and doping in RuO$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08872v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: RuO$_2$, one of the most widely studied transition metal oxides, was recently predicted to host a novel form of collinear magnetic order referred to as altermagnetism. In this study we combine experiment (reflectance, transmittance, ellipsometry and Raman measurements) and first-principles calculations to elucidate the potential role of altermagnetic order, strain and doping on the optical and vibrational properties of RuO$_2$ grown on TiO$_2$ (001), (101) and (110) substrates. Our combined experimental and theoretical results point toward a nonmagnetic ground state as the most consistent description of the optical and vibrational properties of bulk RuO$_2$. RuO$_2$ strained to TiO$_2$ (001) remains nonmagnetic in our calculations. Straining to TiO$_2$ (110) stabilizes ferromagnetic and altermagnetic states that are nearly degenerate and both lower in energy than the nonmagnetic state. The relative energetic ordering of these states is highly sensitive to the level of strain and the choice of exchange-correlation approximation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21707v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thin film effects on the Magnetocrystalline Anisotropy Energy (MAE) of MnN were studied using density functional theory (DFT). Initially, strain effects on bulk MnN were considered as a proxy for lattice-matching induced strain and a linear relationship between the c/a ratio and the MAE was found. This relationship was explained in terms of underlying point group symmetry. Strain and charge-transfer effects were then considered for an ultra-thin film. It was found that a Ta seed-layer suppresses the net spin moment on the Mn ions, leading to a reduction of the MAE.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07571v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The glass industry has limited options to mitigate its environmental footprint, and the demand for cover glass to produce photovoltaic panels is increasing. Currently, the majority of this special type of glass is not being recycled, and in this work, we propose to reuse it as raw material to obtain oxyfluoride glasses. The incorporation of CaF$_2$ and the increasing Na$_2$CO$_3$ content resulted in a melting temperature of about 1200$^o$C, significantly lower than in soda-lime glasses, which adds up to the environmental benefits of reusing end-of-life cover glass. The obtained samples show high transparency and thermal stability, allowing the cover glass to make up to 80\% of its weight. XRF analysis was employed to determine the elemental composition of the samples, while XRD and Raman indicated that by adding CaF$_2$, the glass network was depolymerized. In situ XRD as a function of temperature showed the formation of a few crystalline phases in these oxyfluoride samples, evidencing that it can be explored as a matrix to obtain different glass-ceramics. The combination of the glass properties indicates that this method and the resulting material can contribute to reducing the environmental impact of the glass industry, by creating new glass or glass-ceramic materials that can be obtained at a reduced temperature compared to the soda-lime glass, while cover glass being the primary raw material could reduce the need to extract minerals from nature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09958v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unraveling collective modes arising from coupled degrees of freedom is crucial for understanding complex interactions in solids and developing new functionalities. Unique collective behaviors emerge when two degrees of freedom, ordered on distinct length scales, interact. Polar skyrmions, three-dimensional electric polarization textures in ferroelectric superlattices, disrupt the lattice continuity at the nanometer scale with nontrivial topology, leading to previously unexplored collective modes. Here, using terahertz-field excitation and femtosecond x-ray diffraction, we discovered subterahertz collective modes, dubbed 'skyrons', which appear as swirling patterns of atomic displacements functioning as atomic-scale gearsets. Momentum-resolved time-domain measurements of diffuse scattering revealed an avoided crossing in the dispersion relation of skyrons. We further demonstrated that the amplitude and dispersion of skyrons can be controlled by sample temperature and electric-field bias. Atomistic simulations and dynamical phase-field modeling provided microscopic insights into the three-dimensional crystallographic and polarization dynamics. The discovery of skyrons and their coupling with terahertz fields opens avenues for ultrafast control of topological polar structures.</description>

Abstract: The calculation of quantum-geometric properties of Bloch electrons -- Berry curvature, quantum metric, orbital magnetic moment and effective mass -- was implemented in a pseudopotential plane-wave code. The starting point was the first derivative of the periodic part of the wavefunction psi_k with respect to the wavevector k. This was evaluated with perturbation theory by solving a Sternheimer equation. Comparison of effective masses obtained from perturbation theory for silicon and gallium arsenide with carefully-converged numerical second derivatives of band energies confirms the high precision of the method. Calculations of quantum-geometric quantities for gapped graphene were performed by adding a bespoke symmetry-breaking potential to first-principles graphene. As the two bands near the opened gap are reasonably isolated, the results could be compared with those obtained from an analytical two-band model, allowing to assess the strengths and limitations of such widely-used models. The final application was trigonal tellurium, where quantum-geometric quantities flip sign with chirality.</description>

Abstract: Using molecular dynamics simulations in a planar graphene sheet, we investigate the temperature dependence of its mechanical behavior under uniaxial tensile stress applied either along the armchair or the zigzag direction. Stress-strain curves are calculated for different temperatures and the corresponding dependence of various elastic parameters, like the Young modulus, the third-order elastic modulus, the tensile strength and failure strain, is presented. Fracture stress and strain, as well as the Young modulus, decrease almost linearly with temperature. The distributions of bond lengths and bond angles at different strains and temperatures are also discussed and approximate analytical expressions are presented. The latter describe accurately the numerically obtained distributions.</description>

Abstract: Charge density is central to density functional theory (DFT), as it fully defines the ground-state properties of a material system. Obtaining it with high accuracy is a computational bottleneck. Existing machine learning models are constrained by trade-offs among accuracy, efficiency, and generalization. Here, we introduce the Equivariant Atomic Contribution Network (EAC-Net), which couples atoms and grids to integrate the strengths of grid-based and basis-function frameworks. EAC-Net achieves high accuracy (typically below 1% error), enhanced efficiency, and strong generalization across complex systems. Building on this framework, we develop EAC-mp, a universal charge density model covering the periodic table. The model demonstrates robust zero-shot performance across diverse systems, and generalizes beyond the training distribution, supporting downstream applications such as band structure calculations. By linking local chemical environments to charge densities, EAC-Net provides a scalable framework for accelerating electronic structure prediction and enabling high-throughput materials discovery.</description>

Abstract: Symmetry is at the heart of material properties. Symmetry of the Bravais lattice defines the degeneracy of planewaves, upon which atomic symmetry determines interaction potentials which may lift such degeneracies. This results in wavefunctions which are single planewaves throughout the Brillouin zone (BZ), except in the vicinity of lifted degeneracies. This great simplification allows for determination of optical properties from a handful of planewaves and a single transition. Further, it reveals that nonlinear optical response arises from higher order degeneracy along lines/points in the BZ.</description>

Abstract: Cadmium telluride (CdTe), lead sulfide (PbS), and indium tin oxide (ITO) play crucial roles in various electronic applications where laser treatment enables precise modification of their distinctive electronic characteristics. This study utilizes the XTANT-3 hybrid/multiscale model to investigate the microscopic response of these materials to ultrafast X-ray irradiation. The model simultaneously traces intertwined processes of non-equilibrium dynamics of both electrons and atoms, nonadiabatic coupling, nonthermal melting, and bond breaking due to electronic excitation. Among the materials studied, CdTe exhibits the highest radiation resistance, similar to CdS. At the respective threshold doses, the melting is primarily thermal, driven by electron-phonon coupling, which is accompanied by the band gap closure. Additionally, all materials exhibit nonthermal melting at higher doses. When accounting for energy dissipation pathways and material recrystallization processes, damage thresholds increase substantially. In CdTe and PbS, below 1.5 eV/atom, the band gap returns to its original value upon recrystallization. As the dose increases, the resulting cooled material becomes increasingly amorphous, progressively reducing the band gap until a stable configuration is reached. Notably, in a narrow window of deposited doses, ITO exhibits transient superionic behavior, with the liquid oxygen but solid In and Sn sublattices. At 0.6 eV/atom in CdTe and 0.4 eV/atom in PbS and ITO, material ablation from the surface occurs. These findings indicate that femtosecond laser technology offers promising opportunities for precise band gap engineering in various photovoltaic semiconductor devices.</description>

Abstract: Time-division multiplexing of cryogenic signals is a promising approach to reduce space requirements, shorten cooldown times, and increase the number of quantum devices measured per cooldown. We demonstrate time-division multiplexing of non-dissipative supercurrents using voltage-controlled hybrid superconducting demultiplexers. These chips integrate superconducting Josephson Field Effect Transistors including Al superconducting electrodes, proximitized semiconducting InAs channels, and hafnium oxide gate insulators. Each transistor fully suppresses the switching current and increases the resistance 20 times under a gate voltage of -4.5 V. A demultiplexer with one input and eight outputs showed a non-dissipative input range of +-2 uA, operating up to 100 MHz in signal frequency and 100 kHz in switching frequency at 50 mK. It achieved near-zero insertion loss in the superconducting state and an ON/OFF ratio of 17.5 dB. By optimizing the signal layout, the operation was extended up to 4 GHz using a demultiplexer with two outputs.</description>

      <title>Reproducibility of fixed-node diffusion Monte Carlo across diverse community codes: The case of water-methane dimer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12950v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fixed-node diffusion quantum Monte Carlo (FN-DMC) is a widely-trusted many-body method for solving the Schr\"{o}dinger equation, known for its reliable predictions of material and molecular properties. Furthermore, its excellent scalability with system complexity and near-perfect utilization of computational power makes FN-DMC ideally positioned to leverage new advances in computing to address increasingly complex scientific problems. Even though the method is widely used as a computational gold standard, reproducibility across the numerous FN-DMC code implementations has yet to be demonstrated. This difficulty stems from the diverse array of DMC algorithms and trial wave functions, compounded by the method's inherent stochastic nature. This study represents a community-wide effort to assess the reproducibility of the method, affirming that: Yes, FN-DMC is reproducible (when handled with care). Using the water-methane dimer as the canonical test case, we compare results from eleven different FN-DMC codes and show that the approximations to treat the non-locality of pseudopotentials are the primary source of the discrepancies between them. In particular, we demonstrate that, for the same choice of determinantal component in the trial wave function, reliable and reproducible predictions can be achieved by employing the T-move (TM), the determinant locality approximation (DLA), or the determinant T-move (DTM) schemes, while the older locality approximation (LA) leads to considerable variability in results. These findings demonstrate that, with appropriate choices of algorithmic details, fixed-node DMC is reproducible across diverse community codes-highlighting the maturity and robustness of the method as a tool for open and reliable computational science.</description>

      <title>Electron Fourier ptychography for phase reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08342v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Phase reconstruction is important in transmission electron microscopy for structural studies. We describe electron Fourier ptychography and its application to phase reconstruction of both radiation-resistant and beam-sensitive materials. We demonstrate that the phase of the exit wave can be reconstructed to high resolution using a modified iterative phase retrieval algorithm using data collected in an alternative optical geometry. This method achieves a spatial resolution of 0.63 nm at a fluence of $4.5 \times 10^2 \, e^-/\text{nm}^2$, as validated on Cry11Aa protein crystals under cryogenic conditions. Notably, this method requires no additional hardware modifications, is straightforward to implement, and can be seamlessly integrated with existing data collection software, providing a broadly accessible alternative approach to structural studies.</description>

      <title>Exciton-Polariton Dynamics in Multilayered Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12933v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coupling excitons with quantized radiation has been shown to enable coherent ballistic transport at room temperature inside optical cavities. Previous theoretical works employ a simple description of the material, depicting it as a one-dimensional single layer placed in the middle of an optical cavity, thereby ignoring the spatial variation of the radiation field. In contrast, in most experiments, the optical cavity is filled with organic molecules or multiple layers of two-dimensional materials. Here, we develop an efficient mixed-quantum-classical approach, introducing a bright layer description, to simulate the exciton-polariton quantum dynamics in three dimensions. Our simulations reveal that, for the same Rabi splitting, a multilayered material extends the quantum coherence lifetime and enhances transport compared to a single-layer material. We find that this enhanced coherence can be traced to a synchronization of phonon fluctuations over multiple layers, wherein the collective light-matter coupling in a multilayered material effectively suppresses the phonon-induced dynamical disorder.</description>

      <title>Strain-Induced Half-Metallicity and Giant Wiedemann-Franz Violation in Monolayer NiI$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06855v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reversible control of spin-dependent thermoelectricity via mechanical strain provides a platform for next-generation energy harvesting and thermal logic circuits. Using first-principles and Boltzmann transport calculations, we demonstrate that monolayer NiI$_2$ undergoes a strain-driven semiconductor-to-half-metal transition, enabled by the selective closure of its spin-down band gap while preserving a robust ferromagnetic ground state. Remarkably, this transition is accompanied by a giant, non-monotonic violation of the Wiedemann-Franz law, with the Lorenz number enhanced up to $7.17\,L_0$. This anomaly arises from a strain-sensitive hybridization between Ni-$d$ and I-$p$ orbitals, leading to spin-polarized transport channels and decoupling of heat and charge currents. These properties make NiI$_2$ a promising candidate for mechanically gated spin-caloritronic devices and thermal logic elements, where reversible control of heat and spin flow is essential. Our findings position NiI$_2$ as a model system for exploring non-Fermi-liquid transport and for realizing strain-tunable, energy-efficient functionalities in low-dimensional platforms.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic theory of square skyrmion lattice in tetragonal frustrated antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08407v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-temperature part of the phase diagram of tetragonal frustrated antiferromagnets is discussed within the framework of the mean-field approach. Based on recent experimental findings, we generalize previous theoretical studies by considering a model that includes frustrated Heisenberg exchange, biquadratic exchange, magnetodipolar interaction, anisotropic exchange, and single-ion anisotropy. It is analytically demonstrated that a subtle interplay among these interactions results in a variety of phase diagrams in the temperature-magnetic field plane. We argue that one of the proposed diagrams reproduces all crucial features of the phase diagram experimentally observed for~\gdru~compound. Besides magnetodipolar interaction and additional easy-axis contribution, it requires moderate biquadratic exchange. We show that despite the remarkable square skyrmion lattice being stable even if only magnetodipolar interaction/compass anisotropy or biquadratic exchange is included, their ``symbiosis'' allows for greatly enhancing its stability region. It is also demonstrated that higher-order harmonics play an important role in the stabilization of the square skyrmion lattice. The developed analytical approach can be useful for the refinement of the microscopic model parameters when comparing its predictions with experimental findings.</description>

      <title>Relaxing Direct Ptychography Sampling Requirements via Parallax Imaging Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18610v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Direct ptychography enables the retrieval of information encoded in the phase of an electron wave passing through a thin sample by deconvolving the interference effects of a converged probe with known aberrations. Under the weak phase object approximation, this permits the optimal transfer of information using non-iterative techniques. However, the achievable resolution of the technique is traditionally limited by the probe step size -- setting stringent Nyquist sampling requirements. At the same time, parallax imaging has emerged as a dose-efficient phase-retrieval technique which relaxes sampling requirements and enables scan-upsampling. Here, we formulate parallax imaging as a quadratic approximation to part of the direct ptychography kernel and use this insight to enable upsampling in direct ptychography. We validate our analytical results numerically using simulated and experimental reconstructions.</description>

      <title>Beyond Contrast Transfer: Spectral SNR as a Dose-Aware Metric for STEM Phase Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19476v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The contrast transfer function (CTF) is widely used to evaluate phase retrieval methods in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), including center-of-mass imaging, parallax imaging, direct ptychography, and iterative ptychography. However, the CTF reflects only the maximum usable signal, neglecting the effects of finite electron fluence and the Poisson-limited nature of detection. As a result, it can significantly overestimate practical performance, especially in low-dose regimes. Here, we employ the spectral signal-to-noise ratio (SSNR), as a dose-aware statistical framework to evaluate the recoverable signal as a function of spatial frequency. Using numerical reconstructions of white-noise objects, we show that center-of-mass, parallax, and direct ptychography exhibit dose-independent SSNRs, with close-form analytic expressions. In contrast, iterative ptychography exhibits a surprising dose dependence: at low fluence, its SSNR converges to that of direct ptychography; at high fluence, it saturates at a value consistent with the maximum detective quantum efficiency predicted by recent quantum Fisher information bounds. The results highlight the limitations of CTF-based evaluation and motivate SSNR as a more accurate, dose-aware metric for assessing STEM phase retrieval methods.</description>

      <title>Microscopic Theory of Light-Induced Coherent Phonons Mediated by Quantum Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03257v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Light-induced coherent phonons provide a powerful platform for ultrafast control of material properties. However, the microscopic theory and quantum geometric nature of this phenomenon remain underexplored. Here, we develop a fully quantum-mechanical framework based on Feynman diagrams to systematically describe the generation of coherent phonons by light. We identify a dominant second-order, double-resonant process in noncentrosymmetric semiconductors that efficiently couples light to both electronic and phononic excitations. Crucially, we uncover the quantum geometric origin, encoded in the electron-phonon coupling (EPC) shift vector and the EPC quantum geometric tensor. Applying our theory to ferroelectric BaTiO$_3$ and SnSe, we demonstrate the potential for light-induced modulation of ferroelectric polarization driven by coherent phonons. This work provides fundamental insights for designing efficient optical control strategies for both coherent phonons and ferroelectric polarization.</description>

      <title>Double excitations in molecules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16262v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Double excitations in organic molecules have garnered significant interest as a result of their importance in singlet fission and photophysics. These excitations play a crucial role in understanding the photoexcitation processes in polyenes. To describe photoexcited states with both single and double excitation character, we use a first-principles many-body theory that combines the GW / Bethe-Salpeter equation and the configuration interaction (CI) methods. Specifically, we develop and employ two CI-based methods: screened configuration interaction singles and doubles (scrCISD) and screened configuration interaction singles with perturbative doubles (scrCIS(D)), applied to an effective many-body Hamiltonian that incorporates screening. We apply these methods to Thiel's set of molecules, which exhibit excited states predominantly characterized by single excitations with a partial double excitation character. Our results indicate that the scrCISD method systematically underestimates the excitation energies compared to the best theoretical estimates, while the scrCIS(D) method shows good agreement with these estimates. Furthermore, we used the scrCISD method to calculate the binding energies of the dominantly doubly excited correlated triplet pair states, $\mathrm{TT^1}$, in pentacene dimers, finding that the $\mathrm{TT^1}$ binding energies agree well with empirical calculations.</description>

      <title>FDTRImageEnhancer: Combining Physics-Informed Deconvolution and Microstructure-Aware Deep Learning to Enhance Thermal Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16590v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present FDTRImageEnhancer, an open-source computational framework that improves thermal conductivity mapping from Frequency Domain ThermoReflectance (FDTR) phase data by integrating a physics-based Gaussian convolution abstraction with microstructure-aware deep learning. The Gaussian kernel models the spatial averaging effects of pump and probe beams, while k-means clustering of high-resolution structural images reduces the parameter space for inverse modeling. A physics-informed neural network jointly minimizes phase-data error and deviation from analytically recovered conductivity maps, enabling the detection of grain boundary thermal conductivity drops visually obscured in conventional FDTR inversions. Demonstrated on finite element-generated synthetic data, the framework recovers bulk values within less than 0.5% error and qualitatively resolves grain boundary effects despite limited image resolution. Full Python code and datasets are provided for reproducibility, with the methodology readily adaptable to other inverse thermal transport problems.</description>
