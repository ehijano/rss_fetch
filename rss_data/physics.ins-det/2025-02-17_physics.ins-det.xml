      <title>Fiber-coupled Digital Photo Sensors for Large Time Projection Chambers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to addressing challenges in neutrino event reconstruction within large Time Projection Chambers (TPCs). By integrating fiber-coupled digital silicon photomultipliers, we propose a design that enhances light detection, improves energy resolution, and enhance event reconstruction. Advancements in power and signal over fiber technologies are leveraged to deploy digital sensors within the TPC bulk volume, enabling precise timing and robust particle identification.</description>

      <title>Scintillation Light Detection in Polycrystalline Diamond Using Single Photon Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the scintillation properties of polycrystalline diamond for particle detection applications, particularly in neutron and alpha radiation environments. Polycrystalline diamonds provide a cost-effective alternative to monocrystalline diamonds while retaining essential detection properties. Photoluminescence measurements were performed to analyze emission spectra, revealing distinct characteristics based on impurity content and crystallinity. Scintillation responses were assessed using Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPMs), demonstrating the capability of polycrystalline diamond powders to respond to alpha irradiation, albeit with reduced resolution compared to traditional scintillators. A prototype neutron detector was developed by combining diamond powder with neutron-sensitive ${}^6$LiF, and its performance was evaluated through experimental testing and Geant4 simulations. The findings indicate that polycrystalline diamond-based detectors can achieve significant detection efficiency while remaining insensitive to gamma radiation, offering potential for portable neutron detection applications.</description>

      <title>Installation and performance of the 3rd Veto plane at the SND@LHC detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During 2022/2023 the optimal inefficiency of the Veto system of the SND@LHC detector was measured to be $(7.8\pm2.8)\times10^{-8}$. To reduce this inefficiency, a third Veto plane was installed during the 2023-2024 Year End Technical Stop. In addition, the Veto system was lowered to cover the target fully, thereby increasing acceptance. This paper describes how the inefficiency of the Veto system was reduced from $7.8\times10^{-8}$ with an acceptance of about $64\%$ of the target area in 2022-2023 to $(8.7\pm3.5)\times10^{-9}$ on the full area in 2024.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing neutrinoless double beta decay event kinematics in a xenon gas detector with vertex tagging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: If neutrinoless double beta decay is discovered, the next natural step would be understanding the lepton number violating physics responsible for it. Several alternatives exist beyond the exchange of light neutrinos. Some of these mechanisms can be distinguished by measuring phase-space observables, namely the opening angle $\cos\theta$ among the two decay electrons, and the electron energy spectra, $T_1$ and $T_2$. In this work, we study the statistical accuracy and precision in measuring these kinematic observables in a future xenon gas detector with the added capability to precisely locate the decay vertex. For realistic detector conditions (a gas pressure of 10 bar and spatial resolution of 4 mm), we find that the average $\overline{\cos\theta}$ and $\overline{T_1}$ values can be reconstructed with a precision of 0.19 and 110 keV, respectively, assuming that only 10 neutrinoless double beta decay events are detected.</description>

      <title>Offset geometry for extended field-of-view in multi-contrast and multi-scale X-ray microtomography of lung cancer lobectomy specimens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: X-ray microtomography is a powerful non-destructive technique allowing 3D virtual histology of resected human tissue. The achievable imaging field-of-view, is however limited by the fixed number of detector elements, enforcing the requirement to sacrifice spatial resolution in order to image larger samples. In applications such as soft-tissue imaging, phase-contrast methods are often employed to enhance image contrast. Some of these methods, especially those suited to laboratory sources, rely on optical elements, the dimensions of which can impose a further limitation on the field-of-view. We describe an efficient method to double the maximum field-of-view of a cone-beam X-ray microtomography system, without sacrificing on spatial resolution, and including multi-contrast capabilities. We demonstrate an experimental realisation of the method, achieving exemplary reconstructions of a resected human lung sample, with a cubic voxel of 10.5 $\mu$m linear dimensions, across a horizontal field-of-view of 4.3 cm. The same concepts are applied to free-space propagation imaging of a 2.7 mm segment of the same sample, achieving a cubic voxel of 450 nm linear dimensions. We show that the methodology can be applied at a range of different length-scales and geometries, and that it is directly compatible with complementary implementations of X-ray phase-contrast imaging.</description>

      <title>Open-Source Benchtop Magnetophotometer (MAP) for Characterizing the Magnetic Susceptibility of Nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01903v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic nanoparticles form the foundation of many biomedical and environmental technologies. Although various methods exist to characterize a subset of physical properties of nanoparticles, measuring their magnetic response remains challenging. This property is defined by magnetic susceptibility, which describes how a material responds to an external magnetic field. However, accurately measuring magnetic susceptibility relies on specialized, high-performance instrumentation which require large quantities of dried sample. Here, we present the design and validation of an open-source benchtop instrument, a magnetophotometer (MAP), which non-destructively measures the magnetic susceptibility of suspended nanoparticles via monochromatic differential optical spectroscopy. To validate the system's accuracy, a series of measurements are performed, and results from a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) serve as a benchmark. First, a series of three iron oxide nanoparticle batches was synthesized with distinctly different susceptibility values, and the MAP successfully differentiates between them in agreement with SQUID results. Notably, in comparison with the SQUID, the MAP requires an order of magnitude less sample and obtains a result 99.8% faster. To demonstrate utility in the biomedical field, the MAP performs non-destructive analysis of bioconjugated magnetic nanoparticles, a measurement that is not possible using currently available commercial systems. The bioactivity of the surface coating is not degraded by the testing, and the susceptibility values are in agreement with the particle material. Thus, the MAP provides a path for in-line rapid quality control assessment of nanoparticles in their final application environment.</description>

      <title>Measurements of proton hardness factors in silicon at energies between 10 MeV and 25 MeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12410v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Silicon detector technologies are often employed for high energy particle physics applications due to their excellent radiation hardness. Radiation damage in the form of bulk or substrate damage is dependent on the incident particle species and energy. The fluence is therefore often quoted as the 1 MeV neutron equivalent fluence, with hardness factors being the scaling quantity. The hardness factor can be determined by analysing the change in the leakage current of silicon pad diodes post-irradiation. Using the MC40 cyclotron facility at the University of Birmingham, n-in-p FZ silicon pad diodes were irradiated to several fluence points at three different proton beam energies. The hardness factors acquired were 3.07 $\pm$ 0.37 for 10.5 MeV protons, 2.73 $\pm$ 0.27 for 16.4 MeV protons and 2.19 $\pm$ 0.22 for 24.3 MeV protons. The value for 16.4 MeV protons agrees with the theoretical predictions, whereas the values for 10.5 MeV and 24.3 MeV are lower than predicted by the same calculations.</description>

      <title>Cosmic muon flux attenuation methods for superconducting qubit experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.04938v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose and demonstrate two practical mitigation methods to attenuate the cosmic muon flux, compatible with experiments involving superconducting qubits: shallow underground sites and specific device orientation. Using a specifically-built cosmic muon detector, we identify underground sites, widely present in urban environments, where significant attenuation of cosmic muon flux, up to a factor 35 for 100-meter depths, can be attained. Furthermore, we employ two germanium wafers in an above-ground laboratory, each equipped with a particle sensor, to show how the orientation of the chip with respect to the sky affects the amount and type of energy deposited on the substrate by ionizing radiation. We observe that the horizontal detector sees more counts at lower energy, while the vertical one is impacted by more particles at higher energy. The methods here described proposed ways to directly understand and reduce the effects of cosmic rays on qubits by attenuating the source of this type of decoherence, complementing existing on-chip mitigation strategies. We expect that both on-chip and off-chip methods combined will become ubiquitous in quantum technologies based on superconducting qubit circuits.</description>
