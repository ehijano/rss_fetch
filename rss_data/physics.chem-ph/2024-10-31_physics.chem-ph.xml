      <title>Canonical-Polyadic-Decomposition of the Potential Energy Surface Fitted by Warm-Started Support Vector Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a decoupled support vector regression (SVR) approach for direct canonical polyadic decomposition (CPD) of a potential energy surface (PES) through a set of discrete training energy data. This approach, denoted by CPD-SVR, is able to directly construct the PES in CPD with a more compressed form than previously developed Gaussian process regression (GPR) for CPD, denoted by CPD-GRP ({\it J. Phys. Chem. Lett.} {\bf 13} (2022), 11128). Similar to CPD-GPR, the present CPD-SVR method requires the multi-dimension kernel function in a product of a series of one-dimensional functions. We shall show that, only a small set of support vectors play a role in SVR prediction making CPD-SVR predict lower-rank CPD than CPD-GPR. To save computational cost in determining support vectors, we propose a warm-started (ws) algorithm where a pre-existed crude PES is employed to classify the training data. With the warm-started algorithm, the present CPD-SVR approach is extended to the CPD-ws-SVR approach. Then, we test CPD-ws-SVR and compare it with CPD-GPR through constructions and applications of the PESs of H + H$_2$, H$_2$ + H$_2$, and H$_2$/Cu(111). To this end, the training data are computed by existed PESs. Calculations on H + H$_2$ predict a good agreement of dynamics results among various CPD forms, which are constructed through different approaches.</description>

      <title>Zwitterionic Polymer Coatings with Compositional Gradient for Stable and Substrate-Independent Biofouling Deterrence via All-Dry Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biofouling represents a critical challenge in marine transportation, healthcare, and food manufacturing, among other industries, as it promotes contamination and increases maintenance costs. Zwitterionic polymers, known for their exceptional antifouling properties, offer a promising solution for biofouling deterrence. Despite the rapid development of zwitterionic polymers in recent years, the design rules, especially concerning the choice of cationic moieties to optimize biofouling deterrence, remain elusive. In this study, we leveraged a versatile all-dry synthesis scheme to achieve a selection of 9 zwitterionic polymers, 5 of which are unprecedented for this synthesis paradigm, thus systematically unraveling that molecular design rule. Notably, we developed a synthesis strategy to enable nanoscale compositional gradient along the coating cross-section, which ensures the robustness of the zwitterionic polymer coatings irrespective of the choice of cation-anion combinations. That robustness is enabled by an organosilicon-based layer at the coating-substrate interface, which simultaneously enhances coating adhesion and chemical stability while ensuring high concentration of zwitterionic moieties at the polymer-liquid interface to maximize biofouling deterrence. The antifouling efficacy was assessed using biofilms of Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Bacillus subtilis. All coatings demonstrated antifouling efficacy, with a novel zwitterionic polymer comprising a combination of imidazolium and carboxyl groups achieving the greatest antibiofilm effects, which we attributed to the strong hydration. This study highlights the coating architecture, i.e., one with nanoscale gradient and varying crosslinking densities, as a valid strategy to render zwitterionic polymers robust coatings and the imidazolium-based carboxybetaine as a promising next-generation antibiofouling chemistry.</description>

Abstract: A model for the bonding of hypervalent molecules containing sulfur is presented using generalized valence bond wavefunctions. To delineate the model from more commonly used DFT and delocalized wavefunctions, we present detailed comparisons to these other methods.

      <title>Quantum dynamics simulation of exciton-polariton transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong coupling between excitons and confined modes of light presents a promising pathway to tunable and enhanced energy transport in organic materials. By forming hybrid light-matter quasiparticles, exciton-polaritons, electronic excitations can traverse long distances at high velocities through ballistic flow. However, transport behavior of exciton-polaritons varies strongly across experiments, spanning both diffusive and ballistic transport regimes. Which properties of the material and light-modes govern the transport behavior of polaritons remains an open question. Through full-quantum dynamical simulations we reveal a strong dependence of polariton transport on vibronic interactions within molecules in both ideal and lossy cavities. Specifically, we show that intramolecular vibrations mediate relaxation processes that alter polariton composition, lifetime and velocity on ultrafast timescales. Analysis of the propagating wavepacket in position and momentum space provides mechanistic insight into the robustness of ballistic flow of exciton-polaritons found experimentally under cryogenic conditions.</description>

      <title>The time-dependent bivariational principle: Theoretical foundation for real-time propagation methods of coupled-cluster type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-time propagation methods for chemistry and physics are invariably formulated using variational techniques. The time-dependent bivariational principle (TD-BIVP) is known to be the proper framework for coupled-cluster type methods, and is here studied from a differential geometric point of view. It is demonstrated how two distinct classical Hamilton's equations of motion arise from considering the real and imaginary parts of the action integral. The latter is new, and can in principle be used to develop novel propagation methods. Conservation laws and Poisson brackets are introduced, completing the analogy with classical mechanics. An overview of established real-time propagation methods is given in the context of our formulation of the TD-BIVP, namely time-dependent traditional coupled-cluster theory, orbital-adaptive coupled-cluster theory, time-dependent orthogonal optimized coupled-cluster theory, and equation-of-motion coupled cluster theory.</description>

      <title>Intensities of all fine-structure resolved rovibrational electric quadrupole absorption lines in $^{16}$O$_2$($X^{3}\Sigma^{-}_{g}$) calculated with a new $\textit{ab initio}$ quadrupole moment curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The intensities of all rovibrational electric quadrupole absorption lines in $^{16}$O$_2$($X^{3}\Sigma^{-}_{g}$), for which the vibrational quantum number is $v \leq 35$ and the total angular momentum quantum number is $J \leq 40$, are calculated in the intermediate coupling using a new $\textit{ab initio}$ quadrupole moment curve of the ground electronic state of O$_2$. The calculated values agree with those available in the HITRAN database, which at present includes only the $1$-$0$ fundamental vibrational band of $^{16}$O$_2$($X^{3}\Sigma^{-}_{g}$). We therefore recommend using the intensities of the vibrational overtones and hot bands reported here in updating the HITRAN database for O$_2$ in the upcoming 2024 edition.</description>

      <title>Neural Network Matrix Product Operator: A Multi-Dimensionally Integrable Machine Learning Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A neural network-based machine learning potential energy surface (PES) expressed in a matrix product operator (NN-MPO) is proposed. The MPO form enables efficient evaluation of high-dimensional integrals that arise in solving the time-dependent and time-independent Schr\"odinger equation and effectively overcomes the so-called curse of dimensionality. This starkly contrasts with other neural network-based machine learning PES methods, such as multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), where evaluating high-dimensional integrals is not straightforward due to the fully connected topology in their backbone architecture. Nevertheless, the NN-MPO retains the high representational capacity of neural networks. NN-MPO can achieve spectroscopic accuracy with a test mean absolute error (MAE) of 3.03 cm$^{-1}$ for a fully coupled six-dimensional ab initio PES, using only 625 training points distributed across a 0 to 17,000 cm$^{-1}$ energy range. Our Python implementation is available at https://github.com/KenHino/Pompon.</description>

      <title>Time evolving matrix product operator (TEMPO) method in a non-diagonal basis set based on derivative of the path integral expression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The time-evolving matrix product operator (TEMPO) method is a powerful tool for simulating open system quantum dynamics. Typically, it is used in problems with diagonal system-bath coupling, where analytical expressions for discretized influence functional are available. In this work, we aim to address issues related to off-diagonal coupling by extending the TEMPO algorithm to accommodate arbitrary basis sets. The proposed approach is based on computing the derivative of the discretized path integral expression of a generalized influence functional when increasing one time step, which yields an equation of motion valid for non-diagonal basis set and arbitrary number of non-commuting baths. The generalized influence functional is then obtained by integrating the resulting differential equation. Applicability of the the new method is then tested by simulating one- and two- qubit systems coupled to both Z- and X-type baths.</description>

      <title>DiffBatt: A Diffusion Model for Battery Degradation Prediction and Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Battery degradation remains a critical challenge in the pursuit of green technologies and sustainable energy solutions. Despite significant research efforts, predicting battery capacity loss accurately remains a formidable task due to its complex nature, influenced by both aging and cycling behaviors. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel general-purpose model for battery degradation prediction and synthesis, DiffBatt. Leveraging an innovative combination of conditional and unconditional diffusion models with classifier-free guidance and transformer architecture, DiffBatt achieves high expressivity and scalability. DiffBatt operates as a probabilistic model to capture uncertainty in aging behaviors and a generative model to simulate battery degradation. The performance of the model excels in prediction tasks while also enabling the generation of synthetic degradation curves, facilitating enhanced model training by data augmentation. In the remaining useful life prediction task, DiffBatt provides accurate results with a mean RMSE of 196 cycles across all datasets, outperforming all other models and demonstrating superior generalizability. This work represents an important step towards developing foundational models for battery degradation.</description>

      <title>Modeling Brownian Motion as a Timelapse of the Physical, Persistent, Trajectory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While it is very common to model diffusion as a random walk by assuming memorylessness of the trajectory and diffusive step lengths, these assumptions can lead to significant errors. This paper describes the extent to which a physical trajectory of a Brownian particle can be described by a random flight. Analysis of simple timelapses of physical trajectories (calculated over collisional timescales using a velocity autocorrelation function that captures the hydrodynamic and acoustic effects induced by the solvent) gave us two observations: (i) subsampled trajectories become genuinely memoryless only when the time step is ~200 times larger than the relaxation time, and (ii) the distribution of the step lengths has variances that remain significantly smaller than 2Dt (usually by a factor of ~2). This last fact is due to the combination of two effects: diffusional MSD is mathematically superballistic at short timescales and subsampled trajectories are moving averages of the underlying physical trajectory. In other words, the MSD of the physical trajectory at long time intervals asymptotically approaches 2Dt, but the MSD of the subsampled steps does not, even when the associated time interval is several hundred times larger than the relaxation time. I discuss how to best account for this effect in computational approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.24150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The water/electrode interface under an applied bias potential is a challenging out-of-equilibrium phenomenon, which is difficult to accurately model at the atomic scale. In this study, we employ a combined approach of Density Functional Theory (DFT) and non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) methods to analyze the influence of an external bias on the properties of water adsorbed on Au(111) and Pd(111) metallic electrodes. Our results demonstrate that while both Au and Pd-electrodes induce qualitatively similar structural responses in adsorbed water molecules, the quantitative differences are substantial, driven by the distinct nature of water-metal bonding. Our findings underscore the necessity of quantum-mechanical modeling for accurately describing electrochemical interfaces.</description>

      <title>Energy-Specific Bethe-Salpeter Equation Implementation for Efficient Optical Spectrum Calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an energy-specific Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) implementation for efficient core and valence optical spectrum calculations. In energy-specific BSE, high-lying excitation energies are obtained by constructing trial vectors and expanding the subspace targeting excitation energies above the predefined energy threshold in the Davidson algorithm. To calculate optical spectra over a wide energy range, energy-specific BSE can be applied to multiple consecutive small energy windows, where trial vectors for each subsequent energy window are made orthogonal to the subspace of preceding windows to accelerate the convergence of the Davidson algorithm. For seven small molecules, energy-specific BSE combined with $G_0W_0$ provides small errors around 0.8 eV for absolute and relative $K$-edge excitation energies when starting from a hybrid PBEh solution with 45\% exact exchange. We further showcase the computational efficiency of this approach by simulating the N $1s$ $K$-edge excitation spectrum of the porphine molecule and the valence optical spectrum of silicon nanoclusters involving 5,000 excited states using $G_0W_0$-BSE. This work expands the applicability of the $GW$-BSE formalism for investigating high-energy excited states of large systems.</description>

      <title>A relativistic third-order algebraic diagrammatic construction theory for electron detachment, attachment and excitation problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08085v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the theory and implementation of a highly efficient relativistic third-order algebraic diagrammatic construction [ADC(3)] method based on a four-component (4c) Dirac-Coulomb (DC) Hamiltonian for the calculation of ionization potentials (IP), electron affinities (EA), and excitation energies (EE). Benchmarking calculations for IP, EA, and EE were performed on both atomic and molecular systems to assess the accuracy of the newly developed four-component relativistic ADC(3) method. The results show good agreement with the available experimental data. The Hermitian nature of the 4c-ADC(3) Hamiltonian, combined with the perturbative truncation of the wave function, offers significant computational advantages over the standard equation-of-motion coupled-cluster approach, particularly for property calculations. The method's suitability for property calculations is further demonstrated by computing oscillator strengths and excited-state dipole moments for heavy elements.</description>

      <title>Simulating real-time molecular electron dynamics efficiently using the time-dependent density matrix renormalization group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05959v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Compared to ground state electronic structure optimizations, accurate simulations of molecular real-time electron dynamics are usually much more difficult to perform. To simulate electron dynamics, the time-dependent density matrix renormalization group (TDDMRG) has been shown to offer an attractive compromise between accuracy and cost. However, many simulation parameters significantly affect the quality and efficiency of a TDDMRG simulation. So far, it is unclear whether common wisdom from ground state DMRG carries over to the TDDMRG, and a guideline on how to choose these parameters is missing. Here, in order to establish such a guideline, we investigate the convergence behavior of the main TDDMRG simulation parameters, such as time integrator, the choice of orbitals, and the choice of MPS representation for complex-valued non-singlet states. In addition, we propose a method to select orbitals that are tailored to optimize the dynamics. Lastly, we showcase the TDDMRG by applying it to charge migration ionization dynamics in furfural, where we reveal a rapid conversion from an ionized state with a $\sigma$ character to one with a $\pi$ character within less than a femtosecond.</description>

Abstract: Vibrational strong light-matter coupling offers a promising approach for controlling chemical reactivity with infrared microcavities. While recent research has examined potential mechanisms for this phenomenon, many important questions remain, including what type of reactions can be modified and to what extent this modification can be achieved. In this study, we explore the dynamics of Blackbody Infrared Radiative Dissociation (BIRD) in microcavities under weak and strong light-matter interaction regimes. Using a Master equation approach, we simulate the effects of infrared field confinement and vibrational strong coupling on BIRD rates for diatomic molecules. We present a framework explaining how infrared microcavities influence BIRD kinetics, highlighting the importance of overtone transitions in the process. Our findings outline the conditions under which significant enhancement or mild suppression of BIRD rates can be achieved, offering insights into the practical limitations and new strategies for controlling chemistry within infrared resonators.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive theory for relativistic polaritonic chemistry: a four components ab initio treatment of molecular systems coupled to quantum fields</title>

Abstract: We present a new ab-initio approach to study molecules containing heavy atoms strongly interacting with quantum fields in optical devices. The relativistic quantum electrodynamics (QED) theory has been rewritten with a formalism close to relativistic quantum chemistry. This general framework represents the ideal starting point to extend the main quantum chemistry methods to relativistic polaritonic. The Polaritonic Dirac Hartree Fock (Pol-DHF) approach is the first method we propose based on this theory. Pol-DHF allows for the simulation of field induced effects on the ground and excited state properties of heavy transition metals molecular complexes. The method is able to include not only the effects of the photons but can be easily extended also to include explicit interactions with positrons. Application of Pol-DHF to three metal hydrides revealed the importance of including relativistic effects to the treatment in strong coupling conditions. Due to an accurate description of spin-orbit coupling, the method is able to reproduce polaritonic effects happening at the crossing between singlet and triplet potential energy surfaces.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of transition rates from nonequilibrium instantons</title>

Abstract: Equilibrium rate theories play a crucial role in understanding rare, reactive events. However, they are inapplicable to a range of irreversible processes in systems driven far from thermodynamic equilibrium like active and biological matter. Here, we develop an efficient numerical method to compute the rate constant of rare nonequilibrium events in the weak-noise limit based on an instanton approximation to the stochastic path integral and illustrate its wide range of application. We demonstrate excellent agreement of the instanton rates with numerically exact results for a particle under a non-conservative force. We also study phase transitions in an active field theory. We elucidate how activity alters the stability of the two phases and their rates of interconversion in a manner that can be well described by modifying classical nucleation theory,</description>

      <title>Neural Pfaffians: Solving Many Many-Electron Schr\"odinger Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14762v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural wave functions accomplished unprecedented accuracies in approximating the ground state of many-electron systems, though at a high computational cost. Recent works proposed amortizing the cost by learning generalized wave functions across different structures and compounds instead of solving each problem independently. Enforcing the permutation antisymmetry of electrons in such generalized neural wave functions remained challenging as existing methods require discrete orbital selection via non-learnable hand-crafted algorithms. This work tackles the problem by defining overparametrized, fully learnable neural wave functions suitable for generalization across molecules. We achieve this by relying on Pfaffians rather than Slater determinants. The Pfaffian allows us to enforce the antisymmetry on arbitrary electronic systems without any constraint on electronic spin configurations or molecular structure. Our empirical evaluation finds that a single neural Pfaffian calculates the ground state and ionization energies with chemical accuracy across various systems. On the TinyMol dataset, we outperform the `gold-standard' CCSD(T) CBS reference energies by 1.9m$E_h$ and reduce energy errors compared to previous generalized neural wave functions by up to an order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Ground-States for Metals from Converged Coupled Cluster Calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14237</link>

Abstract: Many-electron correlation methods offer a systematic approach to predicting material properties with high precision. However, practically attaining accurate ground-state properties for bulk metals presents significant challenges. In this work, we propose a novel scheme to reach the thermodynamic limit of the total ground-state energy of metals using coupled cluster theory. We demonstrate that the coupling between long-range and short-range contributions to the correlation energy is sufficiently weak, enabling us to restrict long-range contributions to low-energy excitations in a controllable way. Leveraging this insight, we calculate the surface energy of aluminum and platinum (111), providing numerical evidence that coupled cluster theory is well-suited for modeling metallic materials, particularly in surface science. Notably, our results exhibit convergence with respect to finite-size effects, basis-set size, and coupled cluster expansion, yielding excellent agreement with experimental data. This paves the way for more efficient coupled cluster calculations for large systems and a broader utilization of the theory in realistic metallic models of materials.</description>
