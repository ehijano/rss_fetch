      <title>On the Work of Cartan and M\"{u}nzner on Isoparametric Hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A hypersurface $M^n$ in a real space form ${\bf R}^{n+1}$, $S^{n+1}$, or $H^{n+1}$ is isoparametric if it has constant principal curvatures. This paper is a survey of the fundamental work of Cartan and M\"{u}nzner on the theory of isoparametric hypersurfaces in real space forms, in particular, spheres. This work is contained in four papers of Cartan published during the period 1938--1940, and two papers of M\"{u}nzner that were published in preprint form in the early 1970's, and as journal articles in 1980--1981. These papers of Cartan and M\"{u}nzner have been the foundation of the extensive field of isoparametric hypersurfaces, and they have all been recently translated into English by the author. The paper concludes with a brief survey of the recently completed classification of isoparametric hypersurfaces in spheres.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Optimization Using Ricci Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a theoretical framework for modeling and optimizing the bounded functions based on the Fourier series approximation and Ricci flow. Specifically, the initial manifold, $\mathcal{M}_0$ is approximated using Fourier series approximation in conjunction with the center and boundary sampling procedure introduced in the paper. The manifold is iteratively evolved using an algorithm that involves sampling along circles defined by the Riemannian metric tensor. Furthermore, the function is optimized by applying inverse Ricci flow i.e. instead of regularizing the manifold, flow allows for the high curvature regions to be accentuated. This allows for the singularities to occur at potential global optima assuming the deviation of the manifold at any point is smaller than the optimum.</description>

      <title>Volume entropy and rigidity for RCD-spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop the barycenter technique of Besson--Courtois--Gallot so that it can be applied on RCD metric measure spaces. Given a continuous map $f$ from a non-collapsed RCD$(-(N-1),N)$ space $X$ without boundary to a locally symmetric $N$-manifold we show a version of BCG's entropy-volume inequality. The lower bound involves homological and homotopical indices which we introduce. We prove that when equality holds and these indices coincide $X$ is a locally symmetric manifold, and $f$ is homotopic to a Riemannian covering whose degree equals the indices. Moreover, we show a measured Gromov--Hausdorff stability of $X$ and $Y$ involving the homotopical invariant. As a byproduct, we extend a Lipschitz volume rigidity result of Li--Wang to RCD$(K,N)$ spaces without boundary. Finally, we include an application of these methods to the study of Einstein metrics on $4$-orbifolds.</description>

      <title>Invariant Hulls and Geometric Variational Principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate functionals defined on manifolds through parameterizations. If they are to be meaningful, from a geometrical viewpoint, they ought to be invariant under reparameterizations. Standard, local, integral functionals with this invariance property are well-known. We would like to focus though on the passage from a given arbitrary functional to its invariant realization or invariant hull through the use of inner-variations, much in the same way as with the convex or quasiconvex hulls of integrands in the vector Calculus of Variations. These two processes are, however, very different in nature. After examining some basic, interesting, general properties about the mutual relationship between a functional and its invariant realization, we deal with the one dimensional case to gain some initial familiarity with such a transformation and calculations, before proceeding to the higher dimensional situation. As one would anticipate, explicit computations in the latter are much harder to perform, if not impossible, as one is to work with vector variational problems. In particular, we are able to reach some modest conclusion about the volume functional of a piece of a manifold in the general $N$-dimensional situation, especially in the two-dimensional case $N=2$. Various problems and conjectures are stated along the way.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We first determine the asymptotic cone of the steady gradient K\"ahler-Ricci soliton of the Taub-NUT type constructed by Apostolov and Cifarell. Then we study a special case and prove that it is an ALF Calabi-Yau metric in a certain sense. Finally we construct new ALF Calabi-Yau metrics on crepant resolution of its quotients modeled on it using the method of Tian-Yau-Hein.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we first prove that a compact K\"ahler manifold is projective if it satisfies certain quasi-positive curvature conditions, including quasi-positive $S_2^\perp,\, S_2^+,\,\mbox{Ric}_3^\perp, \,\mbox{Ric}_3^+$ or $2$-quasi-positive $\mbox{Ric}_k$. Subsequently, we prove that a compact K\"ahler manifold with a restricted holonomy group is both projective and rationally conected if it satisfies some non-negative curvature condition, including non-negative $S_2^\perp,\, S_2^+,\,\mbox{Ric}_3^\perp, \,\mbox{Ric}_3^+$ or $2$-non-negative $\mbox{Ric}_k$.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the Loop Weierstrass Representation for minimal surfaces in Euclidean space and constant mean curvature 1 surfaces in hyperbolic space by applying integral system methods to the Weierstrass and Bryant representations. We unify associated families, dual surfaces and Goursat transformations under the same holomorphic data, we introduce a simple factor dressing for minimal surfaces, and we compute and classify various examples.</description>

      <title>An exploration of connections and curvature in the presence of singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop the notions of connections and curvature for general Lie-Rinehart algebras without using smoothness assumptions on the base space. We present situations when a connection exists. E.g., this is the case when the underlying module is finitely generated. We show how the group of module automorphism acts as gauge transformations on the space of connections. When the underlying module is projective we define a version of the Chern character reproducing results of Hideki Ozeki. We discuss various examples of flat connections and the associated Maurer-Cartan equations. We provide examples of Levi-Civita connections on singular varieties and singular differential spaces with non-zero Riemannian curvature. The main observation is that for quotient singularities, even though the metric degenerates along strata, the poles of the Christoffel symbols are removable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that every Born Lie algebra can be obtained by the bicross product construction starting from two pseudo-Riemannian Lie algebras. We then obtain a classification of all Lie algebras up to dimension four and all six-dimensional nilpotent Lie algebras admitting an integrable Born structure. Finally, we study the curvature properties of the pseudo-Riemannian metrics of the integrable Born structures obtained in our classification results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper studies the $L^2$-torsion of fibrations, focusing on cases that relax acyclicity and the determinant class condition. We prove the sum formula and the product formula for $L^2$-torsion in the extended abelian category. The desired formula for $L^2$-torsion of a simple fibration is obtained under the assumption that the fibers have zero Euler characteristic.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish Morse inequalities for a noncompact manifold with a cocompact and properly discontinuous action of a discrete group, where Morse functions are not necessarily invariant under the group action. The inequalities are given in terms of the $L^2$-Betti numbers and functions on the acting group which describe rough configurations of critical points of a Morse function.</description>

      <title>A generalization of the second Pappus-Guldin theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper deals with the question of how to calculate the volume of a body in the three-dimensional Euclidean space when it is cut into slices perpendicular to a given curve. The answer is provided by a formula that can be considered as a generalized version of the second Pappus-Guldin theorem. It turns out that the computation becomes very simple if the curve passes directly through the centroids of the perpendicular cross-sections. In this context, the question arises whether a curve with this centroid property exists. We investigate this problem for a convex body $K$ by using the volume distance and certain features of the so-called floating bodies of $K$. As an example, we further determine the non-trivial centroid curves of a triaxial ellipsoid, and finally we apply our results to derive a rather simple formula for determining the centroid of a bent rod.</description>

      <title>Closed orbits of MHD equilibria with orientation-reversing symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As a generalisation of the periodic orbit structure often seen in reflection or mirror symmetric MHD equilibria, we consider equilibria with other orientation-reversing symmetries. An example of such a symmetry, which is a not a reflection, is $(x,y,z) \mapsto (-x,-y,-z)$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$. It is shown under any orientation-reversing isometry, that if the pressure function is assumed to have a nested toroidal structure, then all orbits on the tori are necessarily periodic. The techniques involved are almost entirely topological in nature and give rise to a handy index describing how a diffeomorphism of $\mathbb{R}^3$ alters the poloidal and toroidal curves of an invariant embedded 2-torus.</description>

      <title>On the Nonlinear Eshelby Inclusion Problem and its Isomorphic Growth Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the late 1950's, Eshelby's linear solutions for the deformation field inside an ellipsoidal inclusion and, subsequently, the infinite matrix in which it is embedded were published. The solutions' ability to capture the behavior of an orthotropically symmetric shaped inclusion made it invaluable in efforts to understand the behavior of defects within, and the micromechanics of, metals and other stiff materials throughout the rest of the 20th century. Over half a century later, we wish to understand the analogous effects of microstructure on the behavior of soft materials; both organic and synthetic; but in order to do so, we must venture beyond the linear limit, far into the nonlinear regime. However, no solutions to these analogous problems currently exist for non-spherical inclusions. In this work, we present an accurate semi-inverse solution for the elastic field in an isotropically growing spheroidal inclusion embedded in an infinite matrix, both made of the same incompressible neo-Hookean material. We also investigate the behavior of such an inclusion as it grows infinitely large, demonstrating the existence of a non-spherical asymptotic shape and an associated asymptotic pressure. We call this the isomorphic limit, and the associated pressure the isomorphic pressure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove an inequality relating the isoperimetric profile of a graph to the decay of the random walk total variation distance $\sup_{x\sim y} ||P^n(x,\cdot)-P^n(y,\cdot)||_{\mathrm{TV}}$. This inequality implies a quantitative version of a theorem of Salez (GAFA 2022) stating that bounded-degree graphs of non-negative Ollivier-Ricci curvature cannot be expanders. Along the way, we prove universal upper-tail estimates for the random walk displacement $d(X_0,X_n)$ and information $-\log P^n(X_0,X_n)$, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Lie groups with all left-invariant semi-Riemannian metrics complete</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.16513v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For each left-invariant semi-Riemannian metric $g$ on a Lie group $G$, we introduce the class of bi-Lipschitz Riemannian Clairaut metrics, whose completeness implies the completeness of $g$. When the adjoint representation of $G$ satisfies an at most linear growth bound, then all the Clairaut metrics are complete for any $g$. We prove that this bound is satisfied by compact and 2-step nilpotent groups, as well as by semidirect products $K \ltimes_\rho \mathbb{R}^n$ , where $K$ is the direct product of a compact and an abelian Lie group and $\rho(K)$ is pre-compact; they include all the known examples of Lie groups with all left-invariant metrics complete. The affine group of the real line is considered to illustrate how our techniques work even in the the absence of linear growth and suggest new questions.</description>

      <title>Persistent de Rham-Hodge Laplacians in Eulerian representation for manifold topological learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00220v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, topological data analysis has become a trending topic in data science and engineering. However, the key technique of topological data analysis, i.e., persistent homology, is defined on point cloud data, which does not work directly for data on manifolds. Although earlier evolutionary de Rham-Hodge theory deals with data on manifolds, it is inconvenient for machine learning applications because of the numerical inconsistency caused by remeshing the involving manifolds in the Lagrangian representation. In this work, we introduce persistent de Rham-Hodge Laplacian, or persistent Hodge Laplacian (PHL) as an abbreviation, for manifold topological learning. Our PHLs are constructed in the Eulerian representation via structure-persevering Cartesian grids, avoiding the numerical inconsistency over the multiscale manifolds. To facilitate the manifold topological learning, we propose a persistent Hodge Laplacian learning algorithm for data on manifolds or volumetric data. As a proof-of-principle application of the proposed manifold topological learning model, we consider the prediction of protein-ligand binding affinities with two benchmark datasets. Our numerical experiments highlight the power and promise of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Stability of nearly K\"ahler and nearly parallel $G_2$-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21103v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate generalisations of Hitchin's functionals, whose critical points correspond to nearly K\"ahler and nearly parallel $G_2$-structures. Our focus is on the gradient flow of these functionals and the spectral decomposition of their Hessians with respect to natural indefinite inner products.
  We introduce a Morse-like index for these functionals, termed the Hitchin index. We prove this index provides a lower bound for the Einstein co-index and explore its relationship with the deformation theory of $G_2$- and $\operatorname{Spin}(7)$-conifolds.</description>

      <title>The Hitchin index in cohomogeneity one nearly K\"ahler structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21106v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nearly K\"ahler and Einstein structures admit a variational characterization, where the second variation is associated with a strongly elliptic operator. This allows us to associate a Morse-like index to each structure. Our study focuses on how these indices behave under the assumption that the nearly K\"ahler structure admits a cohomogeneity one action. Specifically, we investigate elements of the index that also exhibit cohomogeneity one symmetry, reducing the analysis to an ODE eigenvalue problem.
  We apply our discussion to the two inhomogeneous examples constructed by Foscolo and Haskins. We obtain non-trivial lower bounds on the Hitchin index and Einstein co-index for the inhomogeneous nearly K\"ahler structure on $S^3\times S^3$, answering a question of Karigiannis and Lotay.</description>

      <title>Geodesic flows of compact higher genus surfaces without conjugate points have expansive factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.08091v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we show that a geodesic flow of a compact surface without conjugate points of genus greater than one is time-preserving semi-conjugate to a continuous expansive flow which is topologically mixing and has a local product structure. As an application we show that the geodesic flow of a compact surface without conjugate points of genus greater than one has a unique measure of maximal entropy. This gives an alternative proof of Climenhaga-Knieper-War Theorem.</description>

      <title>Scale-Dependent Poincar\'{e} inequalities and the stability of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle on the hyperbolic space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21039v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a general scale-dependent Poincar\'{e}-Hardy type identity involving a vector field on the hyperbolic space. By choosing suitable parameter, potential and vector field in this identity, we can recover, as well as derive new versions of several Poincar\'{e} type, Hardy type and Poincar\'{e}-Hardy type inequalities in the literature. We also investigate weighted Poincar\'{e} inequalities on hyperbolic space, where the weight functions depend on a scaling parameter. This leads to a new family of scale-dependent Poincar\'{e} inequalities with Gaussian type measure on the hyperbolic space which is of independent interest. As a result, we derive both scale-dependent and scale-invariant $L^{2}$-stability results for the Heisenberg uncertainty principle in this setting.</description>
