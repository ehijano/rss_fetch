      <title>Coordinating "7 Billion Humans" is hard</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the video game "7 Billion Humans", the player is requested to direct a group of workers to various destinations by writing a program that is executed simultaneously on each worker. While the game is quite rich and, indeed, it is considered one of the best games for beginners to learn the basics of programming, we show that even extremely simple versions are already NP-Hard or PSPACE-Hard.</description>

      <title>An algorithmic version of the Hajnal--Szemer\'edi theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.08056v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A $K_r$-factor of a graph $G$ is a collection of vertex disjoint $r$-cliques covering $V(G)$. We prove the following algorithmic version of the classical Hajnal--Szemer\'edi Theorem in graph theory, when $r$ is considered as a constant. Given $r, c, n\in \mathbb{N}$ such that $n\in r\mathbb N$, let $G$ be an $n$-vertex graph with minimum degree at least $(1-1/r)n - c$. Then there is an algorithm with running time $2^{c^{O(1)}} n^{O(1)}$ that outputs either a $K_r$-factor of $G$ or a certificate showing that none exists, namely, this problem is fixed-parameter tractable in $c$. On the other hand, it is known that if $c = n^{\varepsilon}$ for fixed $\varepsilon \in (0,1)$, the problem is \texttt{NP-C}.
  We indeed establish characterization theorems for this problem, showing that the existence of a $K_r$-factor is equivalent to the existence of certain class of $K_r$-tilings of size $o(n)$, whose existence can be searched by the color-coding technique developed by Alon--Yuster--Zwick.</description>

      <title>Optimal Sensor and Actuator Selection for Factored Markov Decision Processes: Complexity, Approximability and Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Factored Markov Decision Processes (fMDPs) are a class of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) in which the states (and actions) can be factored into a set of state (and action) variables. The state space, action space and reward function of a fMDP can be encoded compactly using a factored representation. In this paper, we consider the setting where we have a set of potential sensors to select for the fMDP (at design-time), where each sensor measures a certain state variable and has a selection cost. We formulate the problem of selecting an optimal set of sensors for fMDPs (subject to certain budget constraints) to maximize the expected infinite-horizon discounted return provided by the optimal control policy. We show the fundamental result that it is NP-hard to approximate this optimization problem to within any non-trivial factor. We then study the dual problem of budgeted actuator selection (at design-time) to maximize the expected return under the optimal policy. Again, we show that it is NP-hard to approximate this optimization problem to within any non-trivial factor. Furthermore, with explicit examples, we show the failure of greedy algorithms for both the sensor and actuator selection problems and provide insights into the factors that cause these problems to be challenging. Despite the inapproximability results, through extensive simulations, we show that the greedy algorithm may provide near-optimal performance for actuator and sensor selection in many real-world and randomly generated fMDP instances.</description>

      <title>Low communication protocols for fair allocation of indivisible goods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the multi-party randomized communication complexity of computing a fair allocation of $m$ indivisible goods to $n &lt; m$ equally entitled agents. We first consider MMS allocations, allocations that give every agent at least her maximin share. Such allocations are guaranteed to exist for simple classes of valuation functions. We consider the expected number of bits that each agent needs to transmit, on average over all agents. For unit demand valuations, we show that this number is only $O(1)$ (but $\Theta(\log n)$, if one seeks EF1 allocations instead of MMS allocations), for binary additive valuations we show that it is $\Theta(\log \frac{m}{n})$, and for 2-valued additive valuations we show a lower bound of $\Omega(\frac{m}{n})$.
  For general additive valuations, MMS allocations need not exist. We consider a notion of {\em approximately proportional} (Aprop) allocations, that approximates proportional allocations in two different senses, being both Prop1 (proportional up to one item), and $\frac{n}{2n-1}$-TPS (getting at least a $\frac{n}{2n-1}$ fraction of the {\em truncated proportional share}, and hence also at least a $\frac{n}{2n-1}$ fraction of the MMS). We design randomized protocols that output Aprop allocations, in which the expected average number of bits transmitted per agent is $O(\log m)$. For the stronger notion of MXS ({\em minimum EFX share}) we show a lower bound of $\Omega(\frac{m}{n})$.</description>

      <title>Random unitaries in extremely low depth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that random quantum circuits on any geometry, including a 1D line, can form approximate unitary designs over $n$ qubits in $\log n$ depth. In a similar manner, we construct pseudorandom unitaries (PRUs) in 1D circuits in $\text{poly} \log n $ depth, and in all-to-all-connected circuits in $\text{poly} \log \log n $ depth. In all three cases, the $n$ dependence is optimal and improves exponentially over known results. These shallow quantum circuits have low complexity and create only short-range entanglement, yet are indistinguishable from unitaries with exponential complexity. Our construction glues local random unitaries on $\log n$-sized or $\text{poly} \log n$-sized patches of qubits to form a global random unitary on all $n$ qubits. In the case of designs, the local unitaries are drawn from existing constructions of approximate unitary $k$-designs, and hence also inherit an optimal scaling in $k$. In the case of PRUs, the local unitaries are drawn from existing unitary ensembles conjectured to form PRUs. Applications of our results include proving that classical shadows with 1D log-depth Clifford circuits are as powerful as those with deep circuits, demonstrating superpolynomial quantum advantage in learning low-complexity physical systems, and establishing quantum hardness for recognizing phases of matter with topological order.</description>

      <title>Resolution Over Linear Equations: Combinatorial Games for Tree-like Size and Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08370v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the proof system Res($\oplus$) introduced by Itsykson and Sokolov (Ann. Pure Appl. Log.'20), which is an extension of the resolution proof system and operates with disjunctions of linear equations over $\mathbb{F}_2$.
  We study characterizations of tree-like size and space of Res($\oplus$) refutations using combinatorial games. Namely, we introduce a class of extensible formulas and prove tree-like size lower bounds on it using Prover-Delayer games, as well as space lower bounds. This class is of particular interest since it contains many classical combinatorial principles, including the pigeonhole, ordering, and dense linear ordering principles.
  Furthermore, we present the width-space relation for Res($\oplus$) generalizing the results by Atserias and Dalmau (J. Comput. Syst. Sci.'08) and their variant of Spoiler-Duplicator games.</description>

      <title>On Kolmogorov Structure Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05903v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: All strings with low mutual information with the halting sequence will have flat Kolmogorov Structure Functions, in the context of Algorithmic Statistics. Assuming the Independence Postulate, strings with non-negligible information with the halting sequence are purely mathematical constructions, and cannot be found in nature. Thus Algorithmic Statistics does not study strings in the physical world. This leads to the general thesis that two part codes require limitations as shown in the Minimum Description Length Principle. We also discuss issues with set-restricted Kolmogorov Structure Functions.</description>

      <title>When Do Low-Rate Concatenated Codes Approach The Gilbert-Varshamov Bound?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08584v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Gilbert--Varshamov (GV) bound is a classical existential result in coding theory. It implies that a random linear binary code of rate $\epsilon^2$ has relative distance at least $\frac{1}{2} - O(\epsilon)$ with high probability. However, it is a major challenge to construct explicit codes with similar parameters.
  One hope to derandomize the Gilbert--Varshamov construction is with code concatenation: We begin with a (hopefully explicit) outer code ${C}_\mathrm{out}$ over a large alphabet, and concatenate that with a small binary random linear code ${C}_\mathrm{in}$. It is known that when we use independent small codes for each coordinate, then the result lies on the GV bound with high probability, but this still uses a lot of randomness. In this paper, we consider the question of whether code concatenation with a single random linear inner code ${C}_\mathrm{in}$ can lie on the GV bound; and if so what conditions on ${C}_\mathrm{out}$ are sufficient for this.
  We show that first, there do exist linear outer codes ${C}_\mathrm{out}$ that are "good" for concatenation in this sense (in fact, most linear codes codes are good). We also provide two sufficient conditions for ${C}_\mathrm{out}$, so that if ${C}_\mathrm{out}$ satisfies these, ${C}_\mathrm{out}\circ {C}_\mathrm{in}$ will likely lie on the GV bound. We hope that these conditions may inspire future work towards constructing explicit codes ${C}_\mathrm{out}$.</description>
