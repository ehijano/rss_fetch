      <title>Phase and equation of state of finite density QC$_2$D at lower temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the phase structure and the equation of state (EoS) for dense two-color QCD at low temperatures, $T = 40$ MeV ($32^4$ lattice) and $T = 80$ MeV ($16^4$ lattice). A rich phase structure below the pseudo-critical temperature $T_c$ as a function of quark chemical potential $\mu$ has been revealed. By performing $T = 40$ MeV simulations, essentially similar results to the previous ones at $T = 80$ MeV are obtained, but several finer understandings are achieved. Breaking of the conformal bound is also confirmed thanks to smaller statistical errors. This talk is mainly based on Refs.~\cite{Iida:2022hyy, Iida:2024irv}. It also includes related studies and subsequent developments that were not mentioned in the original papers.</description>

      <title>Stochastic normalizing flows for Effective String Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective String Theory (EST) is a powerful tool used to study confinement in pure gauge theories by modeling the confining flux tube connecting a static quark-anti-quark pair as a thin vibrating string. Recently, flow-based samplers have been applied as an efficient numerical method to study EST regularized on the lattice, opening the route to study observables previously inaccessible to standard analytical methods. Flow-based samplers are a class of algorithms based on Normalizing Flows (NFs), deep generative models recently proposed as a promising alternative to traditional Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods in lattice field theory calculations. By combining NF layers with out-of-equilibrium stochastic updates, we obtain Stochastic Normalizing Flows (SNFs), a scalable class of machine learning algorithms that can be explained in terms of stochastic thermodynamics. In this contribution, we outline EST and SNFs, and report some numerical results for the shape of the flux tube.</description>

      <title>Gauge Covariant Link Formulation of Twisted N=D=4 and N=4 D=5 Super Yang-Mills on a Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a lattice formulation of four dimensional super Yang-Mills model with a twisted N=4 supersymmetry in a manifestly gauge covariant manner. The formulation we employ here is a four dimensional extension of the manifestly gauge covariant method which was developed in our proposals of Dirac-Kahler twisted N=D=2 and N=4 D=3 super Yang-Mills on a lattice. Twisted N=4 supersymmetry algebra is geometrically realized on a four dimensional lattice with link supercharges and the use of link (anti-)commutators. Employing Grassmann parameters with link nature, we explicitly show that the resulting super Yang-Mills action is invariant under all the supercharges on a lattice without chiral fermion problems. As a group and algebraic interpretation of the link approach, we show that promoting bosonic supercovariant derivatives to their exponentials consistently with the lattice Leibniz rule naturally gives rise to the notion of gauge covariant link (anti-)commutators. This can be regarded as a fermionic decomposition of a Lie group element, which may provide a new methodology in super Lie group and super Lie algebra. We also provide a five dimensional lift-up of the formulation with exact N=4 SUSY invariance on a five dimensional lattice.</description>

      <title>A Discrete Formulation of Second Stiefel-Whitney Class for Band Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological invariants in band theory are often formulated assuming that Bloch wave functions are smoothly defined over the Brillouin zone (BZ). However, first-principles band calculations typically provide Bloch states only at discrete points in the BZ, rendering standard continuum-based approaches inapplicable. In this work, we focus on the second Stiefel-Whitney class $w_2$, a key $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariant under PT symmetry that characterizes various higher-order topological insulators and nodal-line semimetals. We develop a fully discrete, gauge-fixing-free formula for $w_2$ which depends solely on the Bloch states sampled at discrete BZ points. Furthermore, we clarify how our discrete construction connects to lattice field theory, providing a unifying perspective that benefits both high-energy and condensed matter approaches.</description>

      <title>Violation of Parity and Flavor Symmetries in a Nambu-Jona-Lasinio Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a lattice Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model with certain continuous chiral and two-flavor symmetries. For the Hamiltonian of the model, we construct a ground state which breaks the parity and flavor symmetries. In our argument, the chiral symmetry plays a crucial role for proving the violation of the parity and flavor symmetries, although the model does not contain the so-called Wilson term.</description>

      <title>Stringy scaling of multi-tensor hard string scattering amplitudes and the K-identities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate n-point hard string scattering amplitudes (HSSA) with n-2 tachyons and 2 tensor states at arbitrary mass levels. We discover the stringy scaling behavior of these HSSA. It is found that for HSSA with more than 2 transverse directions, the degree of stringy scaling dimM2 decreases comparing to the degree of stringy scaling dimM1 of the n-1 tachyons and 1 tensor HSSA calculated previously. Moreover, we propose a set of K-identities which is the key to demonstrate the stringy scaling behavior of HSSA. We explicitly prove both the diagonal and off-diagonal K-identities for the 4-point HSSA and give numerical proofs of these K-identities for some higher point HSSA.</description>

      <title>Non-Scaling Topological Defects and Gravitational Waves in Higgs Portal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the simplest extensions of the Standard Model is the Higgs portal extension involving a dark Higgs. Dark sectors that include dark matter candidates, WIMPs, axions, and dark photons, can naturally have this type of interaction, where the dark Higgs is charged under some symmetry, which may or may not be spontaneous broken by the vacuum expectation value. In this paper, using lattice simulations, I show that if the reheating temperature of the Universe is sufficiently high, topological defects such as domain walls and cosmic strings associated with these symmetries are naturally formed even if the symmetries are never restored due to negative thermal mass squareds. This occurs due to the early Universe's non-adiabatic oscillation of the Higgs around the onset of oscillation, which overshoots the origin, and tachyonic instability that enhances fluctuations. The gravitational waves generated by these topological defects may be very significant due to the energetic processes induced by matter effects in the hot and dense Universe irrelevant to the typical energy scale of the dark sector in the vacuum or whether the symmetry is broken in the vacuum. Alongside earlier studies such as usual phase transition, melting domain walls and melting cosmic strings scenarios that assume a symmetric phase in the early Universe, the Higgs portal models naturally predict local overdensities from topological defects, which may induce miniclusters and primordial black holes, as well as the gravitational waves.These phenomena provide novel opportunities to search for such scenarios. I also perform various numerical simulations for the relevant topic including melting domain walls and cosmic strings with inflationary and Gaussian fluctuations, for comparison--which have not been performed previously.</description>

      <title>Approximate SU(5), Fine Structure Constants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14034v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We fit the three finestructure constants of the Standard Model with three, in first approximation theoretically estimable parameters, 1) a "unifiedscale",turning out not equal to the Planck scale and thus only estimable by a very speculative story, 2) a "number of layers" being a priori the number of families, and 3) a unified coupling related to a critical coupling on a lattice. So formally we postdict the three fine structure constants! In the philosophy of our model there is a physically lattice theory with link variables taking values in a (or in the various) "small" representations of the Standard Model Group. We argue for that these representations functio in first approximation as were the theory a genuine $SU(5)$ theory. Next we take into account fluctuation of the gauge fields in the lattice and obtain a correction to the a priori $SU(5)$ approximation, because of course the link fluctuations not corresponding any Standard model Lie algebra, but only to the SU(5), do not exist. The model is a development of our old anti-grand-unification model having as its genuine gauge group, close to fundamental scale, a cross product of the standard model group S(U(3)x U(2)) with itself, there being one Cartesian product factor for each family. In these old works we included the hypotesis of "multiple point criticallity principle" which here effectively means the coupling constants be critical on the lattice. Counted relative to the Higgs scale we suggest the in our sense "unified scale" (where the deviations between the inverse fine structure constants deviate by quantum fluctuations being only from standard model groups, not SU(5)) makes up the 2/3 th power of the Planck scale relative to the Higgs scale, or better the top quark mass scale.</description>

      <title>Quasifragmentation functions in the massive Schwinger model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01891v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of the quark quasifragmentation function (qFF) using an equal-time and spatially boosted form of the Collins-Soper fragmentation function where the out-meson fragment is replaced by the current asymptotic condition. We derive the qFF for a fermion in two-dimensional quantum electrodynamics (QED2) using the Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonian after a mapping onto spin qubits in a spatial lattice with open boundary conditions. This form is suitable for quantum computations. We compute the qFF by exact diagonalization of the spin Hamiltonian. The results are compared to the qFF following from the Drell-Levy-Yan result for QED2, both at strong and weak coupling, and to two-dimensional quantum chromodynamics in the lowest Fock approximation.</description>

      <title>The higher $\chi_{cJ}(nP)$, $h_c(nP)$ states and the role of the gluon-exchange potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10761v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The masses, the fine-structure splitting, and two-photon decay widths of the higher $nP$-charmonium states are calculated in the relativistic string model, reduced to the spinless Salpeter equation, where the static potential has no fitting parameters and the $c-$quark mass has the physical value. The resulting masses of $h_c(3P)$, $\chi_{c1}(3P)$, $\chi_{c0}(4P)$, $\chi_{c0}(5P)$, $\chi_{c1}(5P)$ are obtained in a good agreement with the experimental masses of the LHCb resonances: $h_c(4300)$, $\chi_{c1}(4274)$, $X(4500)$, $X(4700)$, $X(4685)$. To test sensitivity of results to a chosen gluon-exchange (GE) potential, three types of $V_{ge}(r)$ are considered. In first case the non-screened GE potential with large vector coupling at asymptotic, $\alpha_{\rm V}(\rm asym.)=0.635$, and the $c$-quark mass $m_c=1.430$ GeV are taken; in second case a screened $V_{ge}$ and $m_c=1.385$ are investigated, and in third case the GE potential is totally suppressed, $V_{ge}=0$, and $m_c=1.32$ GeV. The agreement with experiment is reached only if the same (universal) flattened confining potential, introduced in the analysis of the radial Regge trajectories of light mesons, is used. The unobserved $6P,0^+$ resonance with the mass $\cong 4.81$ GeV, near $J/\psi\phi(1680)$ threshold, is predicted. Our analysis shows that the screening of the GE potential is possible but weakly affects the physical results obtained. The calculated two-photon decay widths weakly differ in the three cases but may become an important factor, which distinguishes $c\bar c$ and four-quark states.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic Properties of Double-Strangeness Molecular Tetraquarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15339v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by recent advances in the study of the $K^{(*)} \bar K^{(*)}$ molecular tetraquarks and the $H$-dibaryon, we focus on the spectroscopic properties of the $\bar K^{(*)} \bar K^{(*)}$ systems, which exhibit exotic flavor quantum number of $ss\bar q \bar q$. A dynamical analysis is performed using the one-boson-exchange model to describe the effective interactions for these systems, accounting for both $S$-$D$ wave mixing and coupled-channel effects. By solving the coupled-channel Schr$\ddot{\rm o}$dinger equation, we identify the $I(J^P)=0(1^+)$ $\bar K \bar K^*$ and $I(J^P)=0(1^+)$ $\bar K^* \bar K^*$ states as the most likely candidates for double-strangeness molecular tetraquarks. Furthermore, we estimate their strong decay behaviors based on the effective Lagrangian approach, with several channels exhibiting considerable decay widths. Meanwhile, we investigate their magnetic moments and M1 radiative decay widths, shedding light on their inner structures, within the constituent quark model. Finally, we encourage experimentalists to focus on these predicted double-strangeness molecular tetraquark candidates, particularly in $B$ meson decays. Such efforts could pave the way for establishing the molecular tetraquark states in the light-quark sector.</description>
