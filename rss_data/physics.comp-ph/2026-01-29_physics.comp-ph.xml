      <title>Two-Step Diffusion: Fast Sampling and Reliable Prediction for 3D Keller--Segel and KPP Equations in Fluid Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study fast and reliable generative transport for the 3D KS (Keller-Segel) and KPP (Kolmogorov-Petrovsky-Piskunov) equations in the presence of fluid flows with the goal to approximate the map between initial and terminal distributions for a range of physical parameters $\sigma$ under the Wasserstein metric. To minimize the inaccuracy of direct Wasserstein solver, we propose a two-stage pipeline that retains one-step efficiency while reinstating an explicit $W_2$ objective where it is tractable. In Stage I, a Meanflow-style regressor yields a deterministic, one-step global transport that moves particles close to their terminal states. In Stage II, we freeze this initializer and train a near-identity corrector (Deep Particle, DP) that directly minimizes a mini-batch $W_2$ objective using warm-started optimal transport couplings computed on the Meanflow outputs. Crucially, after the one-step transport (from Stage I) concentrating mass on the approximated correct support, the induced geometry stabilizes high-dimensional $W_2$ computation of the direct Wasserstein solver. We validate our construction in the 3D KS and KPP equations subject to fluid flows with ordered and chaotic streamlines.</description>

      <title>A paradox concerning the numerical simulation of Navier-Stokes turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11220v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional Rayleigh-B\'{e}nard convection governed by the Navier-Stokes (NS) equations is predicted by traditional direct numerical simulation (DNS) using double precision arithmetic and a range of different time-steps. It is found that the the final flow type tends either to vortical flow or zonal flow, whose statistics are completely different. Notably, these two flow types frequently alternate as the time-step is reduced to a very small value, suggesting that the time-step corresponding to each turbulent flow type should be densely distributed. Thus, stochastic numerical noise exerts a huge influence on the final flow type and statistics of numerically simulated NS turbulence (i.e., turbulence governed by the NS equations) because the time-step has a close relationship with numerical noise. However, the NS equations, as a turbulence model per se, require all small stochastic disturbances for $t&gt;0$ to be negligible. This leads to a logical paradox in the underlying theory. Further investigations are recommended to reveal the essential differences between the exact solution of NS turbulence, numerical simulations of such NS turbulence, and the corresponding actual turbulence. It should be emphasized that NS turbulence is closely related to the fourth Millennium problem, and turbulence is an unsolved fundamental problem in classic mechanics. Hopefully this paradox would be helpful to deepen our understandings about the turbulence and the fourth Millennium problem.</description>

      <title>Global Plane Waves From Local Gaussians: Periodic Charge Densities in a Blink</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce ELECTRAFI, a fast, end-to-end differentiable model for predicting periodic charge densities in crystalline materials. ELECTRAFI constructs anisotropic Gaussians in real space and exploits their closed-form Fourier transforms to analytically evaluate plane-wave coefficients via the Poisson summation formula. This formulation delegates non-local and periodic behavior to analytic transforms, enabling reconstruction of the full periodic charge density with a single inverse FFT. By avoiding explicit real-space grid probing, periodic image summation, and spherical harmonic expansions, ELECTRAFI matches or exceeds state-of-the-art accuracy across periodic benchmarks while being up to $633 \times$ faster than the strongest competing method, reconstructing crystal charge densities in a fraction of a second. When used to initialize DFT calculations, ELECTRAFI reduces total DFT compute cost by up to ~20%, whereas slower charge density models negate savings due to high inference times. Our results show that accuracy and inference cost jointly determine end-to-end DFT speedups, and motivate our focus on efficiency.</description>

      <title>A Practical Computational Hemolysis Model Incorporating Biophysical Properties of the Red Blood Cell Membrane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Purpose: Hemolysis is a key issue in the design of blood-handling medical devices. Computational prediction of this phenomenon is challenging due to the complex multiscale nature of blood. As a result, conventional approaches often fail to predict hemolysis accurately, commonly showing deviations of multiple orders of magnitude compared to experimental data. More accurate models are typically computationally expensive and thus impractical for real-world applications. This work aims to fill this gap by presenting accurate yet simple and efficient computational hemolysis models.
  Methods: Hemolysis modeling relies on two key components: a red blood cell model and a hemoglobin release model. In this work, we compare three red blood cell models: a common stress-based model (Bludszuweit), a simple strain-based model based on the Kelvin-Voigt constitutive law, and a more complex tensor-based model (TTM). Further, we compare two hemoglobin release models: the widely used power-law approach and a biophysical pore formation model.
  Results: We evaluate these models in two benchmark cases: the FDA blood pump and the FDA nozzle. In both benchmarks, the simple strain-based model combined with the pore formation model achieves absolute predictions of hemolysis within the standard deviation of experimental measurements. In contrast, stress-based power law models deviate by several orders of magnitude.
  Conclusion: The strain-based pore modeling approach takes into account the biophysical properties of red blood cell membranes, in particular their viscoelastic deformation behavior and hemoglobin release through membrane pores. This leads to significantly improved hemolysis predictions in a framework that can easily be integrated into common CFD workflows.</description>

      <title>Techno-economic optimization of a heat-pipe microreactor, part II: multi-objective optimization analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heat-pipe microreactors (HPMRs) are compact and transportable nuclear power systems exhibiting inherent safety, well-suited for deployment in remote regions where access is limited and reliance on costly fossil fuels is prevalent. In prior work, we developed a design optimization framework that incorporates techno-economic considerations through surrogate modeling and reinforcement learning (RL)-based optimization, focusing solely on minimizing the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) by using a bottom-up cost estimation approach. In this study, we extend that framework to a multi-objective optimization that uses the Pareto Envelope Augmented with Reinforcement Learning (PEARL) algorithm. The objectives include minimizing both the rod-integrated peaking factor ($F_{\Delta h}$) and LCOE -- subject to safety and operational constraints. We evaluate three cost scenarios: (1) a high-cost axial and drum reflectors, (2) a low-cost axial reflector, and (3) low-cost axial and drum reflectors. Our findings indicate that reducing the solid moderator radius, pin pitch, and drum coating angle -- all while increasing the fuel height -- effectively lowers $F_{\Delta h}$. Across all three scenarios, four key strategies consistently emerged for optimizing LCOE: (1) minimizing the axial reflector contribution when costly, (2) reducing control drum reliance, (3) substituting expensive tri-structural isotropic (TRISO) fuel with axial reflector material priced at the level of graphite, and (4) maximizing fuel burnup. While PEARL demonstrates promise in navigating trade-offs across diverse design scenarios, discrepancies between surrogate model predictions and full-order simulations remain. Further improvements are anticipated through constraint relaxation and surrogate development, constituting an ongoing area of investigation.</description>

      <title>A Data-Informed Local Subspaces Method for Error-Bounded Lossy Compression of Large-Scale Scientific Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing volume of scientific simulation data presents a significant challenge for storage and transfer. Error-bounded lossy compression has emerged as a critical solution for mitigating these challenges, providing a means to reduce data size while ensuring that reconstructed data remains valid for scientific analysis. In this paper, we present a data-driven scientific data compressor, called Discontinuous Data-informed Local Subspaces (Discontinuous DLS), to improve compression-to-error ratios over data-agnostic compressors. This error-bounded compressor leverages localized spatial and temporal subspaces, informed by the underlying data structure, to enhance compression efficiency and preserve key features. The presented technique is flexible and applicable to a wide range of scientific data, including fluid dynamics, environmental simulations, and other high-dimensional, time-dependent datasets. We describe the core principles of the method and demonstrate its ability to significantly reduce storage requirements without compromising critical data fidelity. The technique is implemented in a distributed computing environment using MPI, and its performance is evaluated against state-of-the-art error-bounded compression methods in terms of compression ratio and reconstruction accuracy. This study highlights discontinuous DLS as a promising approach for large-scale scientific data compression in high-performance computing environments, providing a robust solution for managing the growing data demands of modern scientific simulations.</description>

      <title>Loss Landscape Geometry and the Learning of Symmetries: Or, What Influence Functions Reveal About Robust Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study how neural emulators of partial differential equation solution operators internalize physical symmetries by introducing an influence-based diagnostic that measures the propagation of parameter updates between symmetry-related states, defined as the metric-weighted overlap of loss gradients evaluated along group orbits. This quantity probes the local geometry of the learned loss landscape and goes beyond forward-pass equivariance tests by directly assessing whether learning dynamics couple physically equivalent configurations. Applying our diagnostic to autoregressive fluid flow emulators, we show that orbit-wise gradient coherence provides the mechanism for learning to generalize over symmetry transformations and indicates when training selects a symmetry compatible basin. The result is a novel technique for evaluating if surrogate models have internalized symmetry properties of the known solution operator.</description>

      <title>Quantum statistics from classical simulations via generative Gibbs sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate simulation of nuclear quantum effects is essential for molecular modeling but expensive using path integral molecular dynamics (PIMD). We present GG-PI, a ring-polymer-based framework that combines generative modeling of the single-bead conditional density with Gibbs sampling to recover quantum statistics from classical simulation data. GG-PI uses inexpensive standard classical simulations or existing data for training and allows transfer across temperatures without retraining. On standard test systems, GG-PI significantly reduces wall clock time compared to PIMD. Our approach extends easily to a wide range of problems with similar Markov structure.</description>

      <title>Numerically Consistent Non-Boussinesq Subgrid-scale Stress Model with Enhanced Convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the data-assimilation approach of Ling and Lozano-Dur\'an (AIAA 2025-1280) to develop machine-learning-based subgrid-scale stress (SGS) models for large-eddy simulation (LES) that are consistent with the numerical scheme of the flow solver. The method accounts for configurations with two inhomogeneous directions and is applied to turbulent boundary layers (TBL) under adverse pressure gradients (APG). To overcome the limitations of linear eddy-viscosity closures in complex flows, we adopt a non-Boussinesq SGS formulation along with a dissipation-matching training loss. A second improvement is the integration of a multi-task learning strategy that explicitly promotes monotonic convergence with grid refinement, a property that is often absent in conventional SGS models. A posteriori tests show that the proposed model improves predictions of the mean velocity and wall-shear stress relative to the Dynamic Smagorinsky model (DSM), while also achieving monotonic convergence with grid refinement.</description>

      <title>CM-GAI: Continuum Mechanistic Generative Artificial Intelligence Theory for Data Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (GAI) plays a fundamental role in high-impact AI-based systems such as SORA and AlphaFold. Currently, GAI shows limited capability in the specialized domains due to data scarcity. In this paper, we develop a continuum mechanics-based theoretical framework to generalize the optimal transport theory from pure mathematics, which can be used to describe the dynamics of data, realizing the generative tasks with a small amount of data. The developed theory is used to solve three typical problem involved in many mechanical designs and engineering applications: at material level, how to generate the stress-strain response outside the range of experimental conditions based on experimentally measured stress-strain data; at structure level, how to generate the temperature-dependent stress fields under the thermal loading; at system level, how to generate the plastic strain fields under transient dynamic loading. Our results show the proposed theory can complete the generation successfully, showing its potential to solve many difficult problems involved in engineering applications, not limited to mechanics problems, such as image generation. The present work shows that mechanics can provide new tools for computer science. The limitation of the proposed theory is also discussed.</description>

      <title>An Empirical Investigation of Neural ODEs and Symbolic Regression for Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately modelling the dynamics of complex systems and discovering their governing differential equations are critical tasks for accelerating scientific discovery. Using noisy, synthetic data from two damped oscillatory systems, we explore the extrapolation capabilities of Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODEs) and the ability of Symbolic Regression (SR) to recover the underlying equations. Our study yields three key insights. First, we demonstrate that NODEs can extrapolate effectively to new boundary conditions, provided the resulting trajectories share dynamic similarity with the training data. Second, SR successfully recovers the equations from noisy ground-truth data, though its performance is contingent on the correct selection of input variables. Finally, we find that SR recovers two out of the three governing equations, along with a good approximation for the third, when using data generated by a NODE trained on just 10% of the full simulation. While this last finding highlights an area for future work, our results suggest that using NODEs to enrich limited data and enable symbolic regression to infer physical laws represents a promising new approach for scientific discovery.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.20763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a comprehensive numerical framework that couples numerical solutions of Maxwell's equations using the Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) approach, Molecular Dynamics (MD), and the Two-Temperature Model (TTM) to describe ultrafast laser-matter interactions in metallic systems at the atomic scale. The proposed Maxwell-Two-Temperature Model-Molecular Dynamics (M-TTM-MD) bridges the gap between electromagnetic field propagation, electron-phonon energy exchange, and atomic motion, allowing for a self-consistent treatment of energy absorption, transport, and structural response within a unified simulation environment. The calculated electromagnetic fields incorporate dispersive dielectric properties derived using the Auxiliary Differential Equation (ADE) technique, while the electronic and lattice subsystems are dynamically coupled through spatially and temporally resolved energy exchange terms. The changes in the material topography are then reflected in the updated grid for the FDTD scheme. The developed M-TTM-MD model provides a self-consistent numerical framework that offers insights into laser-induced phenomena in metals, including energy transport and surface dynamics under extreme nonequilibrium conditions.</description>

      <title>A hybrid electromechanical phase-field and deep learning framework for predicting fracture in dielectric nanocomposites</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07469v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The accurate and efficient prediction of crack propagation in dielectric materials is a critical challenge in structural health monitoring and the design of smart systems. This work presents a hybrid modeling framework that combines an electromechanical phase-field fracture model with deep learning-based surrogate modeling to predict fracture evolution in dielectric nanocomposite plates. The underlying finite element simulations capture the coupling between mechanical deformation and electrical field perturbations caused by cracks, using a variational phase-field formulation. High-fidelity simulation outputs - namely, phase-field damage variables and electric potential fields -- are used to train convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with ResNet-U-Net architectures for pixel-wise segmentation of crack paths. The study systematically compares the performance of CNNs trained on phase-field versus electric potential data across multiple ResNet backbones. The results reveal that electric potential fields, although they encode damage indirectly, offer superior segmentation accuracy, faster convergence, and enhanced generalization, owing to their smoother gradient distribution and global spatial coverage. The proposed framework significantly reduces computational costs while preserving high accuracy, offers potential when appropriately adapted for sensor-based input data.</description>

      <title>AiiDA-TrainsPot: Towards automated training of neural-network interatomic potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11703v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Crafting neural-network interatomic potentials (NNIPs) remains a complex task, demanding specialized expertise in both machine learning and electronic-structure calculations. Here, we introduce AiiDA-TrainsPot, an automated, open-source, and user-friendly workflow that streamlines the creation of accurate NNIPs by orchestrating density-functional-theory calculations, data augmentation strategies, and classical molecular dynamics. Our active-learning strategy leverages on-the-fly calibration of committee disagreement against ab initio reference errors to ensure reliable uncertainty estimates. We use electronic-structure descriptors and dimensionality reduction to analyze the efficiency of this calibrated criterion, and show that it minimizes both false positives and false negatives when deciding what to compute from first principles. AiiDA-TrainsPot has a modular design that supports multiple NNIP backends, enabling both the training of NNIPs from scratch and the fine-tuning of foundation models. We demonstrate its capabilities through automated training campaigns targeting pristine and defective carbon allotropes, including amorphous carbon, as well as structural phase transitions in monolayer $\mathrm{W_xMo_{1-x}Te_2}$ alloys.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal Attosecond Control of Solid-State Harmonics by Optical Waveforms and Quantum Geometry Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13114v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-harmonic generation (HHG) in two-dimensional materials offers a compelling route toward compact extreme ultraviolet sources and probing electron dynamics on the attosecond scale. However, achieving precise control over the emission and disentangling the complex interplay between intraband and interband quantum pathways remains a central challenge. Here, we demonstrate through first-principles simulations that HHG in monolayer WS2 can be subjected to precise, complementary control by combining all-optical two-color laser fields with mechanical strain engineering. This dual-mode strategy provides distinct, orthogonal control over harmonic yield, polarization, and spectral features. We reveal that sculpting the two-color field's relative phase provides a sub-femtosecond switch for the quantum coherence of electron-hole pairs, thereby optimizing harmonic emission. Crucially, we uncover that tensile strain modulates the total harmonic yield and specifically amplifies the perpendicular harmonic component by nearly a factor of two. This enhancement arises through a dual mechanism - while strain-modified band dispersion enhances the intraband current, a significant reshaping of the Berry curvature (BC) substantially increases the anomalous velocity contribution to the interband response. This quantum geometric effect manifests as a robust, monotonic dependence of the harmonic yield on strain and a significant amplification of the perpendicularly polarized harmonics, providing a clear experimental signature for probing quantum geometric effects. Our findings establish a versatile framework for optimizing solid-state HHG and introduce a powerful all-optical method to map strain and quantum geometric properties of materials, positioning monolayer WS2 as a model system for exploring attosecond physics at the nexus of bulk and atomic scales.</description>

      <title>Solving Helmholtz problems with finite elements on a quantum annealer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13740v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solving Helmholtz problems using finite elements leads to the resolution of a linear system which is challenging to solve for classical computers. In this paper, we investigate how quantum annealers could address this challenge. We first express the linear system arising from the Helmholtz problem as a generalized eigenvalue problem (gEVP). The obtained gEVP is mapped into quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problems (QUBOs) which we solve using an adaptive quantum annealing eigensolver (AQAE) and its classical equivalent. We identify two key parameters in the success of AQAE for solving Helmholtz problems: the system condition number and the integrated control errors (ICE) in the quantum hardware. Our results show that a large system condition number implies a finer discretization grid for AQAE to converge, leading to a variable overhead, and that AQAE is either tolerant or not with respect to ICE depending on the gEVP. Finally, we establish lower bounds on the annealing time, narrowing the possibility of a quantum advantage for solving Helmholtz problems.</description>

      <title>Classical and quantum chaos in bean- and peanut-shaped billiards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08839v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The boundary of a billiard system plays a crucial role in shaping its dynamics, which may be integrable, mixed, or fully chaotic. When a boundary has varying curvature, it offers a unique setting to study the relation between classical chaos and quantum behaviour. In this study, we introduce two geometrically distinct billiards: a bean- and a peanut-shaped billiard. These systems incorporate both focusing and defocusing walls with no neutral segments. Our study reveals a strong correlation between classical and quantum dynamics. Analysis of billiard flow diagrams confirms sensitivity to initial conditions-a defining feature of chaos. Poincar\'e maps further show the phase space intricately woven with regions of chaotic motion and stability islands. We employ both statistical and dynamical measures to characterise quantum chaos. Statistical indicator includes nearest-neighbour spacing distribution, level spacing ratios, and spectral staircase function, while dynamical measures includes out-of-time-order correlators and spectral complexity. We also observe eigenfunction scarring in both the billiards.</description>

      <title>Empirical Growing Networks vs Minimal Models: Evidence and Challenges from Software Heritage and APS Citation Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10145v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the evolution rules and degree distribution properties of the Software Heritage dataset, a large-scale growing network linking software source-code versions from open-source communities. The network spans more than 40 years and includes about 6 billion nodes and edges. Our analysis relies on deterministic temporal and topological partitions of nodes and edges, which account for the multilayer and partially timestamped structure of the main graph. We derive a temporal graph that reveals a mesoscale structure and enables the study of edge dynamics--creation, inheritance, and aging--together with comparisons to minimal models using degree distributions and histograms of edge timestamp differences. The temporal graph also exposes regime shifts that correlate with changes in developer practices, as reflected in the average number of edges per new node. We estimate scaling exponents under the scale-free hypothesis and highlight the sensitivity of the estimation method used to both regime shifts and outliers, while showing that partitioning improves regularity and helps disentangle these effects. We extend the analysis to the APS citation network, which also exhibits a major regime shift, with an accelerated growth regime becoming dominant after 1985. Although both datasets are a priori good candidates for advanced quantitative analysis, our results illustrate how structural and dynamical transitions hamper our ability to draw firm conclusions about the existence and observability of a scale-free regime in these empirical networks. These findings underscore the need for refined tools and models to study transient growth regimes, to extend current frameworks toward minimal causal growth models, and to enable robust comparisons between empirical growing networks and minimal models.</description>

      <title>Spin fluctuations steer the electronic behavior in the FeSb$_{3}$ skutterudite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15961v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Skutterudites are promising materials for thermoelectric and spintronics applications. Here we explore spin fluctuations in the FeSb$_{3}$ skutterudite and their effect on its electronic structure using Hubbard-corrected density-functional theory calculations. We identify multiple magnetic and charge-disproportionated configurations, with an antiferromagnetic metallic ground state. Paramagnetic fluctuations modeled through a special quasirandom spin structure open a 61 meV gap, consistent with experiments. This state features non-degenerate spin channels and band-avoided crossings, resembling a Luttinger-compensated ferrimagnet. Mapping the electronic structure to a Heisenberg Hamiltonian fails to explain the low N\'eel temperature ($\lesssim$10 K), suggesting that factors such as stoichiometry and magnetic exchange frustration may play an important role, calling for more detailed experimental investigations.</description>

      <title>Machine learning surrogate models of many-body dispersion interactions in polymer melts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15149v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of many-body dispersion (MBD) interactions is essential for understanding the van der Waals forces that govern the behavior of many complex molecular systems. However, the high computational cost of MBD calculations limits their direct application in large-scale simulations. In this work, we introduce a machine learning surrogate model specifically designed to predict MBD forces in polymer melts, a system that demands accurate MBD description and offers structural advantages for machine learning approaches. Our model is based on a trimmed SchNet architecture that selectively retains the most relevant atomic connections and incorporates trainable radial basis functions for geometric encoding. We validate our surrogate model on datasets from polyethylene, polypropylene, and polyvinyl chloride melts, demonstrating high predictive accuracy and robust generalization across diverse polymer systems. In addition, the model captures key physical features, such as the characteristic decay behavior of MBD interactions, providing valuable insights for optimizing cutoff strategies. Characterized by high computational efficiency, our surrogate model enables practical incorporation of MBD effects into large-scale molecular simulations.</description>

      <title>Loading non-Maxwellian Velocity Distributions in Particle Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11890v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Numerical procedures for generating non-Maxwellian velocity distributions in particle simulations are presented. First, Monte Carlo methods for an $(r,q)$ distribution that generalizes flattop and kappa distributions are discussed. Then, two rejection methods for the regularized kappa distribution are presented, followed by a comparison in the $\kappa$ space. A simple recipe is proposed for the subtracted kappa distribution. Properties and numerical recipes for the ring and shell distributions with a finite Gaussian width are discussed. The ring and shell Maxwellians are further introduced as alternatives to the ring and shell distributions. Finally, methods for the super-Gaussian and the filled-shell distributions are presented.</description>

      <title>Active-Absorbing Phase Transitions in the Parallel Minority Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22826v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Parallel Minority Game (PMG) is a synchronous adaptive multi-agent model that exhibits active-absorbing transitions characteristic of non-equilibrium statistical systems. We perform a comprehensive numerical study of the PMG under two families of microscopic decision rules: (i) agents update their choices based on instantaneous population in their alternative choices, and (ii) threshold-based activation that activates agents movement only after overcrowding density crossing a threshold. We measure time-dependent and steady state limits of activity $A(t)$, overcrowding fraction $F(t)$ as functions of the control parameter $g=N/D$, where $N$ is the number of agents and $D$ is the total number of sites. Instantaneous rules display mean-field directed-percolation (MF-DP) scaling with $\beta\approx1.00$, $\delta\approx0.5$, and $\nu_{\parallel}\approx2.0$. Threshold rules, however, produce a distinct non-mean-field universality class with $\beta\approx0.75$ and a systematic failure of dynamical scaling. We show that thresholding acts as a relevant perturbation to the critical behavior of the model. The results highlight how minimal cognitive features at the agent level fundamentally alter large-scale critical behavior in socio-economic and active systems.</description>
