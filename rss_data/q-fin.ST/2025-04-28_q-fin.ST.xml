      <title>Modeling Regime Structure and Informational Drivers of Stock Market Volatility via the Financial Chaos Index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the structural dynamics of stock market volatility through the Financial Chaos Index, a tensor- and eigenvalue-based measure designed to capture realized volatility via mutual fluctuations among asset prices. Motivated by empirical evidence of regime-dependent volatility behavior and perceptual time dilation during financial crises, we develop a regime-switching framework based on the Modified Lognormal Power-Law distribution. Analysis of the FCIX from January 1990 to December 2023 identifies three distinct market regimes, low-chaos, intermediate-chaos, and high-chaos, each characterized by differing levels of systemic stress, statistical dispersion and persistence characteristics. Building upon the segmented regime structure, we further examine the informational forces that shape forward-looking market expectations. Using sentiment-based predictors derived from the Equity Market Volatility tracker, we employ an elastic net regression model to forecast implied volatility, as proxied by the VIX index. Our findings indicate that shifts in macroeconomic, financial, policy, and geopolitical uncertainty exhibit strong predictive power for volatility dynamics across regimes. Together, these results offer a unified empirical perspective on how systemic uncertainty governs both the realized evolution of financial markets and the anticipatory behavior embedded in implied volatility measures.</description>

      <title>Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the financial market efficiency of price returns, absolute returns, and volatility increment: Evidence from stock and cryptocurrency markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on market efficiency by analyzing three time series -- price returns, absolute returns, and volatility increments -- in stock (Deutscher Aktienindex, Nikkei 225, Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE), and Volatility Index) and cryptocurrency (Bitcoin and Ethereum) markets. The effect is found to vary by asset class and market. In the stock market, while the pandemic did not influence the Hurst exponent of volatility increments, it affected that of returns and absolute returns (except in the SSE, where returns remained unaffected). In the cryptocurrency market, the pandemic did not alter the Hurst exponent for any time series but influenced the strength of multifractality in returns and absolute returns. Some Hurst exponent time series exhibited a gradual decline over time, complicating the assessment of pandemic-related effects. Consequently, segmented analyses by pandemic periods may erroneously suggest an impact, warranting caution in period-based studies.</description>

      <title>On Bitcoin Price Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, cryptocurrencies have attracted growing attention from both private investors and institutions. Among them, Bitcoin stands out for its impressive volatility and widespread influence. This paper explores the predictability of Bitcoin's price movements, drawing a parallel with traditional financial markets. We examine whether the cryptocurrency market operates under the efficient market hypothesis (EMH) or if inefficiencies still allow opportunities for arbitrage. Our methodology combines theoretical reviews, empirical analyses, machine learning approaches, and time series modeling to assess the extent to which Bitcoin's price can be predicted. We find that while, in general, the Bitcoin market tends toward efficiency, specific conditions, including information asymmetries and behavioral anomalies, occasionally create exploitable inefficiencies. However, these opportunities remain difficult to systematically identify and leverage. Our findings have implications for both investors and policymakers, particularly regarding the regulation of cryptocurrency brokers and derivatives markets.</description>

      <title>Phase Transitions in Financial Markets Using the Ising Model: A Statistical Mechanics Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This dissertation investigates the ability of the Ising model to replicate statistical characteristics, or stylized facts, commonly observed in financial assets. The study specifically examines in the S&amp;P500 index the following features: volatility clustering, negative skewness, heavy tails, the absence of autocorrelation in returns, and the presence of autocorrelation in absolute returns. A significant portion of the dissertation is dedicated to Ising model-based simulations. Due to the lack of an analytical or deterministic solution, the Monte Carlo method was employed to explore the model's statistical properties. The results demonstrate that the Ising model is capable of replicating the majority of the statistical features analyzed.</description>

      <title>Multi-Horizon Echo State Network Prediction of Intraday Stock Returns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stock return prediction is a problem that has received much attention in the finance literature. In recent years, sophisticated machine learning methods have been shown to perform significantly better than ''classical'' prediction techniques. One downside of these approaches is that they are often very expensive to implement, for both training and inference, because of their high complexity. We propose a return prediction framework for intraday returns at multiple horizons based on Echo State Network (ESN) models, wherein a large portion of parameters are drawn at random and never trained. We show that this approach enjoys the benefits of recurrent neural network expressivity, inherently efficient implementation, and strong forecasting performance.</description>
