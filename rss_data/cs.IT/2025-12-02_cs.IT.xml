      <title>An Information Geometric Approach to Fairness With Equalized Odds Constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the statistical design of a fair mechanism that attains equalized odds, where an agent uses some useful data (database) $X$ to solve a task $T$. Since both $X$ and $T$ are correlated with some latent sensitive attribute $S$, the agent designs a representation $Y$ that satisfies an equalized odds, that is, such that $I(Y;S|T) =0$. In contrast to our previous work, we assume here that the agent has no direct access to $S$ and $T$; hence, the Markov chains $S - X - Y$ and $T - X - Y$ hold. Furthermore, we impose a geometric structure on the conditional distribution $P_{S|Y}$, allowing $Y$ and $S$ to have a small correlation, bounded by a threshold. When the threshold is small, concepts from information geometry allow us to approximate mutual information and reformulate the fair mechanism design problem as a quadratic program with closed-form solutions under certain constraints. For other cases, we derive simple, low-complexity lower bounds based on the maximum singular value and vector of a matrix. Finally, we compare our designs with the optimal solution in a numerical example.</description>

      <title>Fast list recovery of univariate multiplicity and folded Reed-Solomon codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recent work of Goyal, Harsha, Kumar and Shankar gave nearly linear time algorithms for the list decoding of Folded Reed-Solomon codes (FRS) and univariate multiplicity codes up to list decoding capacity in their natural setting of parameters. A curious aspect of this work was that unlike most list decoding algorithms for codes that also naturally extend to the problem of list recovery, the algorithm in the work of Goyal et al. seemed to be crucially tied to the problem of list decoding. In particular, it wasn't clear if their algorithm could be generalized to solve the problem of list recovery FRS and univariate multiplicity codes in near linear time.
  In this work, we address this question and design $\tilde{O}(n)$-time algorithms for list recovery of Folded Reed-Solomon codes and univariate Multiplicity codes up to capacity, where $n$ is the blocklength of the code. For our proof, we build upon the lattice based ideas crucially used by Goyal et al. with one additional technical ingredient - we show the construction of appropriately structured lattices over the univariate polynomial ring that \emph{capture} the list recovery problem for these codes.</description>

      <title>ORBGRAND Is Exactly Capacity-achieving via Rank Companding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Among guessing random additive noise decoding (GRAND) algorithms, ordered reliability bits GRAND (ORBGRAND) has attracted considerable attention due to its efficient use of soft information and suitability for hardware implementation. It has also been shown that ORBGRAND achieves a rate very close to the capacity over additive white Gaussian noise channels with antipodal inputs. In this work, it is further established that, via suitably companding the ranks in ORBGRAND according to the inverse cumulative distribution function (CDF) of channel reliability, the resulting CDF-ORBGRAND algorithm exactly achieves the mutual information of general binary-input memoryless channels under symmetric input distribution, i.e., the symmetric capacity. This result is then applied to bit-interleaved coded modulation (BICM) systems to handle high-order input constellations. Via considering the effects of mismatched decoding due to both BICM and ORBGRAND, it is shown that CDF-ORBGRAND is capable of achieving the BICM capacity, which was initially derived by treating BICM as a set of independent parallel channels.</description>

      <title>The Information Theory of Similarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a precise mathematical equivalence between witness-based similarity systems (REWA) and Shannon's information theory. We prove that witness overlap is mutual information, that REWA bit complexity bounds arise from channel capacity limitations, and that ranking-preserving encodings obey rate-distortion constraints. This unification reveals that fifty years of similarity search research -- from Bloom filters to locality-sensitive hashing to neural retrieval -- implicitly developed information theory for relational data. We derive fundamental lower bounds showing that REWA's $O(\Delta^{-2} \log N)$ complexity is optimal: no encoding scheme can preserve similarity rankings with fewer bits. The framework establishes that semantic similarity has physical units (bits of mutual information), search is communication (query transmission over a noisy channel), and retrieval systems face fundamental capacity limits analogous to Shannon's channel coding theorem.</description>

      <title>Robust Precoding for Resilient Cell-Free Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a robust precoder design for resilient cell-free massive MIMO (CF-mMIMO) systems that minimizes the weighted sum of desired signal mean square error (MSE) and residual interference leakage power under a total transmit power constraint. The proposed robust precoder incorporates channel state information (CSI) error statistics to enhance resilience against CSI imperfections. We employ an alternating optimization algorithm initialized with a minimum MSE-type solution, which iteratively refines the precoder while maintaining low computational complexity and ensuring fast convergence. Numerical results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms conventional linear precoders, providing an effective balance between performance and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Cross-Domain Federated Semantic Communication with Global Representation Alignment and Domain-Aware Aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic communication can significantly improve bandwidth utilization in wireless systems by exploiting the meaning behind raw data. However, the advancements achieved through semantic communication are closely dependent on the development of deep learning (DL) models for joint source-channel coding (JSCC) encoder/decoder techniques, which require a large amount of data for training. To address this data-intensive nature of DL models, federated learning (FL) has been proposed to train a model in a distributed manner, where the server broadcasts the DL model to clients in the network for training with their local data. However, the conventional FL approaches suffer from catastrophic degradation when client data are from different domains. In contrast, in this paper, a novel FL framework is proposed to address this domain shift by constructing the global representation, which aligns with the local features of the clients to preserve the semantics of different data domains. In addition, the dominance problem of client domains with a large number of samples is identified and, then, addressed with a domain-aware aggregation approach. This work is the first to consider the domain shift in training the semantic communication system for the image reconstruction task. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the model-contrastive FL (MOON) framework by 0.5 for PSNR values under three domains at an SNR of 1 dB, and this gap continues to widen as the channel quality improves.</description>

      <title>Movable Antenna Empowered Near-Field Sensing via Antenna Position Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Movable antenna (MA) technology exhibits great promise for enhancing the sensing capabilities of future sixth-generation (6G) networks due to its capability to alter antenna array geometry. With the growing prevalence of near-field propagation at ultra-high frequencies, this paper focuses on the application of one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) MA arrays for near-field sensing to jointly estimate the angle and distance information about a target. First, for the 1D MA array scenario, to gain insights into MA-enhanced near-field sensing, we investigate two simplified cases with only angle-of-arrival (AoA) or distance estimation, respectively, assuming that the other information is already known. The worst-case Cramer-Rao bounds (CRBs) on the mean square errors (MSEs) of the AoA estimation and the distance estimation are derived in these two cases. Then, we jointly optimize the positions of the MAs within the 1D array to minimize these CRBs and derive their closed-form solutions, which yield an identical array geometry to MA-enhanced far-field sensing. For the more challenging joint AoA and distance estimation, since the associated worst-case CRB is a highly complex and non-convex function with respect to the MA positions, a discrete sampling-based approach is proposed to sequentially update the MA positions and obtain an efficient suboptimal solution. Furthermore, we investigate the worst-case CRB minimization problems for a 2D MA array under various conditions and extend our proposed algorithms to solve them efficiently. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed MA-enhanced near-field sensing scheme dramatically outperforms conventional fixed-position antennas (FPAs). Moreover, the joint angle and distance estimation results in a different array geometry from that in the individual estimation of angle/distance or far-field sensing.</description>

      <title>Rate-Splitting Multiple Access for Secure Near-Field Integrated Sensing and Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Near-field integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) leverages distance-dependent channel variations for joint distance and angle estimation. However, full-digital architectures have prohibitive hardware costs, making hybrid analog-digital (HAD) designs the primary alternative. Nevertheless, such architectures compromise beamfocusing precision and lead to energy leakage, which exacerbates inter-user interference and increases eavesdropping risks. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA)-enhanced secure transmit scheme for near-field ISAC. For the first time, it exploits the common stream in RSMA to concurrently (i) flexibly manage interference, (ii) act as artificial noise to suppress eavesdropping, and (iii) serve as sensing sequences. The objective is to maximize the minimum secrecy rate while satisfying the angle and distance Cramer-Rao Bound (CRB) constraints. This results in a hard, non-convex optimization problem, and we employ block coordinate descent to decompose it into three sub-problems with lower computational complexity. In the first stage of optimizing fully digital beamfocusers, we develop an iterative solution using weighted minimum mean-squared error (WMMSE), quadratic transform, and Taylor expansion methods, thus avoiding conventional semidefinite relaxation. In the second and third stages, the analog and digital beamfocusers are optimized in closed form. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme (1) achieves near full-digital beamfocusing performance with a 16-fold reduction in RF chains, (2) provides superior secrecy performance compared to conventional beamfocusing-only and far-field security schemes, and (3) enables high-accuracy sensing with negligible loss in secrecy performance.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Beamfocusing Design for RSMA-Enhanced Near-Field Secure Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Near-field spherical wavefronts enable spotlight-like beam focusing to mitigate unintended energy leakage, creating new opportunities for physical-layer security (PLS). However, under hybrid analog-digital (HAD) antenna architectures, beamfocusing alone may not provide foolproof privacy protection due to reduced focusing precision. To address this issue, this paper proposes a rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA)-enhanced secure transmit scheme for near-field communications with fully-connected or sub-connected HAD architectures. In the proposed scheme, the common stream is designed for dual purposes, delivering the desired message for legitimate users while acting as artificial noise to disrupt eavesdropping. The primary objective is to maximize the minimum secrecy rate by jointly optimizing the analog beamfocuser, digital beamfocuser, and common secrecy rate allocation. To solve the formulated non-convex problem, we develop a penalty-based alternating optimization algorithm. Specifically, the variables are partitioned into three blocks, where one block is solved via a surrogate optimization method, while the others are updated in closed form. Simulation results reveal that our transmit scheme: (1) approaches fully digital beamfocusing with substantially fewer radio frequency chains, (2) outperforms conventional beamfocusing-only and far-field security schemes, and (3) preserves secrecy without significantly compromising communication rates.</description>

      <title>Age Optimal Sampling and Routing under Intermittent Links and Energy Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Links in practical systems, such as satellite-terrestrial integrated networks, exhibit distinct delay distributions, intermittent availability, and heterogeneous energy costs. These characteristics pose significant challenges to maintaining timely and energy-efficient status updates. While link availability restricts feasible transmission routes, routing decisions determine the actual delay and energy expenditure. This paper tackles these challenges by jointly optimizing sampling and routing decisions to minimize monotonic, nonlinear Age of Information (AoI). The proposed formulation incorporates key system features, including multiple routes with correlated random delays, stochastic link availability, and route-dependent energy consumption. We model the problem as an infinite-horizon constrained semi-Markov decision process (CSMDP) with a hybrid state-action space and develop an efficient nested algorithm, termed Bisec-ReaVI, to solve this problem. We reveal a well-defined jointly optimal policy structure: (i) the optimal routing policy is a monotonic handover policy that adapts to the availability of routes and their mean delays; and (ii) the optimal sampling policy is a piecewise linear waiting policy, with at most "N choose 2 + N" breakpoints given N routes. Numerical experiments in a satellite-terrestrial integrated routing scenario demonstrate that the proposed scheme efficiently balances energy usage and information freshness, and reveal a counter-intuitive insight: even routes with higher average delay, higher delay variance, or lower availability can still play a critical role in minimizing monotonic functions of AoI.</description>

      <title>Value of Communication in Goal-Oriented Semantic Communications: A Pareto Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emerging cyber-physical systems increasingly operate under stringent communication constraints that preclude the reliable transmission of their extensive machine-type data streams. Since raw measurements often contain correlated or redundant components, effective operation depends not on transmitting all available data but on selecting the information that contributes to achieving the objectives of the system. Beyond accuracy, goal-oriented semantic communication assesses the \emph{value of information} and aims to generate and transmit only what is relevant and at the right time. Motivated by this perspective, this work studies the \emph{value of communication} through the canonical setting of remote estimation of Markov sources, where a value-of-information measure quantifies the relevance of information. We investigate how optimal estimation performance varies with the available communication budget and determine the marginal performance gain attributable to additional communication. Our approach is based on a \emph{Pareto analysis} that characterizes the complete set of policies that achieve optimal trade-offs between estimation performance and communication cost. The value of communication is defined as the absolute slope of the resulting Pareto frontier. Although computing this frontier is non-trivial, we demonstrate that in our setting it admits a notably tractable structure: it is strictly decreasing, convex, and piecewise linear, and its slope is governed by a finite collection of constants. Moreover, each Pareto-optimal operating point is realizable as a convex combination of two stationary deterministic policies, enabling practical implementation. Leveraging these structural insights, we introduce SPLIT, an efficient and provably optimal algorithm for constructing the complete Pareto frontier.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the challenge of interactively modeling street networks. In this work, we extend the simple fractal model, which is particularly useful for describing small cities or individual districts, by constructing random cities based on a tiling structure over which hyperfractals are distributed. This approach enables the connection of multiple hyperfractal districts, providing a more comprehensive urban representation. Furthermore, we demonstrate how this decomposition can be used to segment a city into distinct districts through fractal analysis. Finally, we present tools for the numerical generation of random cities following this model.</description>

      <title>Storage capacity of perceptron with variable selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A central challenge in machine learning is to distinguish genuine structure from chance correlations in high-dimensional data. In this work, we address this issue for the perceptron, a foundational model of neural computation. Specifically, we investigate the relationship between the pattern load $\alpha$ and the variable selection ratio $\rho$ for which a simple perceptron can perfectly classify $P = \alpha N$ random patterns by optimally selecting $M = \rho N$ variables out of $N$ variables. While the Cover--Gardner theory establishes that a random subset of $\rho N$ dimensions can separate $\alpha N$ random patterns if and only if $\alpha &lt; 2\rho$, we demonstrate that optimal variable selection can surpass this bound by developing a method, based on the replica method from statistical mechanics, for enumerating the combinations of variables that enable perfect pattern classification. This not only provides a quantitative criterion for distinguishing true structure in the data from spurious regularities, but also yields the storage capacity of associative memory models with sparse asymmetric couplings.</description>

      <title>A Dual Approach for Hierarchical Information-Theoretic Tree Abstractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider establishing a formal connection between two distinct tree-abstraction problems inspired by the information-bottleneck (IB) method. Specifically, we consider the hard- and soft-constrained formulations that have recently appeared in the literature to determine the conditions for which the two approaches are equivalent. Our analysis leverages concepts from Lagrangian relaxation and duality theory to relate the dual function of the hard-constrained problem to the Q-function employed in Q-tree search and shows the connection between tree phase transitions and solutions to the dual problem obtained by exploiting the problem structure. An algorithm is proposed that employs knowledge of the tree phase transitions to find a setting of the dual variable that solves the dual problem. Furthermore, we present an alternative approach to select the dual variable that leverages the integer programming formulation of the hard-constrained problem and the strong duality of linear programming. To obtain a linear program, we establish that a relaxation of the integer programming formulation of the hard-constrained tree-search problem has the integrality property by showing that the program constraint matrix is totally unimodular. Empirical results that corroborate the theoretical developments are presented and discussed throughout.</description>

      <title>Estimation of Industrial Heterogeneity from Maximum Entropy and Zonotopes Using the Enterprise Surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study introduces a novel framework for estimating industrial heterogeneity by integrating maximum entropy (ME) estimation of production functions with Zonotope-based measures. Traditional production function estimations often rely on restrictive parametric models, failing to capture firm behavior under uncertainty. This research addresses these limitations by applying Hang K. Ryu's ME method to estimate production functions using World Bank Enterprise Survey (WBES) data from Bangladesh, Colombia, Egypt, and India. The study normalizes entropy values to quantify heterogeneity and compares these measures with a Zonotope-based Gini index. Results demonstrate the ME method's superiority in capturing nuanced, functional heterogeneity often missed by traditional techniques. Furthermore, the study incorporates a "Tangent Against Input Axes" method to dynamically assess technical change within industries. By integrating information theory with production economics, this unified framework quantifies structural and functional differences across industries using firm-level data, advancing both methodological and empirical understanding of heterogeneity. A numerical simulation confirms the ME regression functions can approximate actual industrial heterogeneity. The research also highlights the superior ability of the ME method to provide a precise and economically meaningful measure of industry heterogeneity, particularly for longitudinal analyses.</description>

      <title>Polynomial Order Selection for Savitzky-Golay Smoothers via N-fold Cross-Validation (extended version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Savitzky-Golay (SG) smoothers are noise suppressing filters operating on the principle of projecting noisy input onto the subspace of polynomials. A poorly selected polynomial order results in over- or under-smoothing which shows as either bias or excessive noise at the output. In this study, we apply the N-fold cross-validation technique (also known as leave-one-out cross-validation) for model order selection and show that the inherent analytical structure of the SG filtering problem, mainly its minimum norm formulation, enables an efficient and effective order selection solution. More specifically, a novel connection between the total prediction error and SG-projection spaces is developed to reduce the implementation complexity of cross-validation method. The suggested solution compares favorably with the state-of-the-art Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) rule in non-asymptotic signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and sample size regimes. MATLAB codes reproducing the numerical results are provided.</description>

      <title>A Unified Framework for Constructing Information-Theoretic Private Information Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrieving up-to-date information from a publicly accessible database poses significant threats to the user's privacy. {\em Private information retrieval} (PIR) protocols allow a user to retrieve any entry from a database, without revealing the identity of the entry being retrieved to the server(s). Such protocols have found numerous applications in both theoretical studies and real-life scenarios. The existing PIR constructions mainly give multi-server {\em information-theoretic} PIR (IT-PIR) protocols or single-server computational PIR (CPIR) protocols. Compared with CPIR, IT-PIR protocols are computationally more efficient and secure in the presence of unbounded servers. The most classical and challenging problem in the realm of IT-PIR is constructing protocols with lower {\em communication complexity}. In this review, we introduce a new discrete structure called {\em families of orthogonal arrays with span capability} (FOASC) and propose a unified framework for constructing IT-PIR protocols. We show how the most influential IT-PIR protocols in the literature can be captured by the framework. We also put forward several interesting open problems concerning FOASC, whose solutions may result in innovative IT-PIR protocols.</description>

      <title>Box Decoding with Low-Complexity Sort-free Candidate Pruning for MIMO Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Box Decoding is a sort-free tree-search MIMO detector whose complexity does not scale with the QAM order, achieved by searching a fixed candidate "box" around a zero-forcing (ZF) estimate. Prior work primarily reports small dimensions (e.g. 2x2), since the search visits an exponentially growing number of nodes as the MIMO order increases when no pruning is applied. This letter introduces three deterministic pruning rules that exploit QAM-grid symmetry and relative displacement between the ZF estimate and the nearby QAM points to eliminate unlikely branches, avoiding metric sorting and reducing full metric distance calculations. Simulations show large complexity savings with only a small impact on error performance. The resulting detector preserves QAM-order independence, scales to larger MIMO sizes, and maps naturally to parallel hardware implementation.</description>

      <title>Infinitely divisible privacy and beyond I: resolution of the $s^2=2k$ conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Differential privacy is increasingly formalized through the lens of hypothesis testing via the robust and interpretable $f$-DP framework, where privacy guarantees are encoded by a baseline Blackwell trade-off function $f_{\infty} = T(P_{\infty}, Q_{\infty})$ involving a pair of distributions $(P_{\infty}, Q_{\infty})$. The problem of choosing the right privacy metric in practice leads to a central question: what is a statistically appropriate baseline $f_{\infty}$ given some prior modeling assumptions? The special case of Gaussian differential privacy (GDP) showed that, under compositions of nearly perfect mechanisms, these trade-off functions exhibit a central limit behavior with a Gaussian limit experiment. Inspired by Le Cam's theory of limits of statistical experiments, we answer this question in full generality in an infinitely divisible setting.
  We show that suitable composition experiments $(P_n^{\otimes n}, Q_n^{\otimes n})$ converge to a binary limit experiment $(P_{\infty}, Q_{\infty})$ whose log-likelihood ratio $L = \log(dQ_{\infty} / dP_{\infty})$ is infinitely divisible under $P_{\infty}$. Thus any limiting trade-off function $f_{\infty}$ is determined by an infinitely divisible law $P_{\infty}$, characterized by its Levy--Khintchine triplet, and its Esscher tilt defined by $dQ_{\infty}(x) = e^{x} dP_{\infty}(x)$. This characterizes all limiting baseline trade-off functions $f_{\infty}$ arising from compositions of nearly perfect differentially private mechanisms. Our framework recovers GDP as the purely Gaussian case and yields explicit non-Gaussian limits, including Poisson examples. It also positively resolves the empirical $s^2 = 2k$ phenomenon observed in the GDP paper and provides an optimal mechanism for count statistics achieving asymmetric Poisson differential privacy.</description>

      <title>Information conservation relations for weak measurement and its reversal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the information distribution among different entities in the weak measurements protocol. Focusing on multilevel, decaying systems under continuous (no-click) monitoring, we derive exact, conservation-type information relations that hold for each outcome in the record. Analogous relations hold when an explicit reversal is applied, with the reversal success probability entering the relation.
  We extend the framework to finite-count outcomes (arbitrary photon numbers) obtaining quantitative trade-offs that link information change in the weak measurement process to the entities to which the information is distributed. These results provide a unified, outcome-resolved account of information flow in monitored open quantum dynamics and provide insight into a deeper understanding of open-system dynamics and its control.</description>

      <title>Planar Diffractive Neural Networks Empowered Communications: A Spatial Modulation Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffractive neural networks, where signal processing is embedded into wave propagation, promise light-speed and energy-efficient computation. However, existing three-dimensional structures, such as stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIMs), face critical challenges in implementation and integration. In contrast, this work pioneers planar diffractive neural networks (PDNNs) empowered communications, a novel architecture that performs signal processing as signals propagate through artificially designed planar circuits. To demonstrate the capability of PDNN, we propose a PDNN-based space-shift-keying (PDNN-SSK) communication system with a single radio-frequency (RF) chain and a maximum power detector. In this system, PDNNs are deployed at both the transmitter and receiver to jointly execute modulation, beamforming, and detection. We conduct theoretical analyses to provide the maximization condition of correct detection probability and derive the closed-form expression of the symbol error rate (SER) for the proposed system. To approach these theoretical benchmarks, the phase shift parameters of PDNNs are optimized using a surrogate model-based training approach, which effectively navigates the high-dimensional, non-convex optimization landscape. Extensive simulations verify the theoretical analysis framework and uncover fundamental design principles for the PDNN architecture, highlighting its potential to revolutionize RF front-ends by replacing conventional digital baseband modules with this integrable RF computing platform.</description>

      <title>Associative Syntax and Maximal Repetitions reveal context-dependent complexity in fruit bat communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents an unsupervised method to infer discreteness, syntax and temporal structures of fruit-bats vocalizations, as a case study of graded vocal systems, and evaluates the complexity of communication patterns in relation with behavioral context. The method improved the baseline for unsupervised labeling of vocal units (i.e. syllables) through manifold learning, by investigating how dimen- sionality reduction on mel-spectrograms affects labeling, and comparing it with unsupervised labels based on acoustic similarity. We then encoded vocalizations as syllabic sequences to analyze the type of syntax, and extracted the Maximal Repetitions (MRs) to evaluate syntactical structures. We found evidence for: i) associative syntax, rather than combinatorial (context classification is unaffected by permutation of sequences, F 1 &gt; 0.9); ii) context-dependent use of syllables (Wilcoxon rank-sum tests, p-value &lt; 0.05); iii) heavy-tail distribution of MRs (truncated power-law, exponent {\alpha} &lt; 2), indicative of mechanism encoding com- binatorial complexity. Analysis of MRs and syllabic transition networks revealed that mother-pupil interactions were characterized by repetitions, while commu- nication in conflict-contexts exhibited higher complexity (longer MRs and more interconnected vocal sequences) than non-agonistic contexts. We propose that communicative complexity is higher in scenarios of disagreement, reflecting lower compressibility of information.</description>

      <title>Q2D2: A Geometry-Aware Audio Codec Leveraging Two-Dimensional Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent neural audio codecs have achieved impressive reconstruction quality, typically relying on quantization methods such as Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ), Vector Quantization (VQ) and Finite Scalar Quantization (FSQ). However, these quantization techniques limit the geometric structure of the latent space, make it harder to capture correlations between features leading to inefficiency in representation learning, codebook utilization and token rate. In this paper we introduce Two Dimensional Quantization (Q2D2), a quantization scheme in which feature pairs are projected onto structured 2D grids such as hexagonal, rhombic, or rectangular tiling and quantized to the nearest grid values, yielding an implicit codebook defined by the product of grid levels, with codebook sizes comparable to conventional methods. Despite its simple geometric formulation, Q2D2 improves audio compression efficiency, with low token rates and high codebook utilization while maintaining state of the art reconstruction quality. Specifically, Q2D2 achieves competitive to superior performance in various objective and subjective reconstruction metrics, across extensive experiments in speech domain compared to state of the art models. Comprehensive ablation studies further confirm the effectiveness of our design choices.</description>

      <title>Secure Over-the-Air Computation Against Multiple Eavesdroppers using Correlated Artificial Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the era of the Internet of Things and massive connectivity, many engineering applications, such as sensor fusion and federated edge learning, rely on efficient data aggregation from geographically distributed users over wireless networks. Over-the-air computation shows promising potential for enhancing resource efficiency and scalability in such scenarios by leveraging the superposition property of wireless channels. However, due to the use of uncoded transmission with linear mapping, it also suffers from security vulnerabilities that must be dealt with to allow widespread adoption. In this work, we consider a scenario where multiple cooperating eavesdroppers attempt to infer information about the aggregation result. We derive the optimal joint estimator for the eavesdroppers and provide bounds on the achievable estimation accuracy for both the eavesdroppers and the intended receiver. We show that significant inherent security exists against individual eavesdroppers due to channel misalignment. However, the security level is greatly compromised when the eavesdroppers can cooperate, motivating the need for deliberate security measures. A common measure is to add carefully calibrated perturbation signals (artificial noise) prior to data transmission to improve the security level. To this end, we propose a zero-forced artificial noise design that achieves a high level of security against cooperative eavesdroppers without compromising the aggregation accuracy.</description>

      <title>Digital Twin Aided Millimeter Wave MIMO: Site-Specific Beam Codebook Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning site-specific beams that adapt to the deployment environment, interference sources, and hardware imperfections can lead to noticeable performance gains in coverage, data rate, and power saving, among other interesting advantages. This learning process, however, typically requires a large number of active interactions/iterations, which limits its practical feasibility and leads to excessive overhead. To address these challenges, we propose a digital twin aided codebook learning framework, where a site-specific digital twin is leveraged to generate synthetic channel data for codebook learning. We also propose to learn separate codebooks for line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight users, leveraging the geometric information provided by the digital twin. Simulation results demonstrate that the codebook learned from the digital twin can adapt to the environment geometry and user distribution, leading to high received signal-to-noise ratio performance. Moreover, we identify the ray-tracing accuracy as the most critical factor in digital twin fidelity that impacts the learned codebook performance.</description>

      <title>A Hands-On Molecular Communication Testbed for Undergraduate Education</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a hands-on molecular communication (MC) testbed developed for the undergraduate \textit{Communication Engineering} lab course at the Institute for Communications Technology (IfN), TU~Braunschweig. The goal of the experiment is to provide students with an intuitive and reproducible introduction to MC concepts using a low-cost and accessible fluidic setup. The system employs a background water flow into which three dye colors are injected and symbols are detected by a multi-wavelength photosensor. A zero-forcing--based estimator is used to separate the spectral components and reliably identify the transmitted colors. The experiment is designed to be completed independently by students within a single laboratory session and requires only basic prior knowledge from introductory communication engineering courses. A detailed script accompanies the experiment, guiding students through channel characterization, color detection, pseudoinverse computation, and simple data transmission using on-off keying. In pilot trials, students successfully reproduced the entire communication chain and achieved stable data rates of up to 0.5~bit/s over a 15~cm channel. The proposed testbed demonstrates that fundamental principles of MC can be taught effectively using a compact and inexpensive experimental setup. The experiment will be integrated into an undergraduate lab course.</description>

Abstract: Quantum sample-to-query lifting, a relation between quantum sample complexity and quantum query complexity presented in Wang and Zhang (SIAM J. Comput. 2025), was significantly strengthened by Tang, Wright, and Zhandry (2025) to the case of state-preparation oracles. In this paper, we compile a list of quantum lower and upper bounds for property testing that are obtained by quantum sample-to-query lifting. The problems of interest include testing properties of probability distributions and quantum states, such as entropy and closeness. This collection contains new results, as well as new proofs of known bounds. In total, we present 49 complexity bounds, where 41 are new and 18 are (near-)optimal.</description>

      <title>Feature-Based Semantics-Aware Scheduling for Energy-Harvesting Federated Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) on resource-constrained edge devices faces a critical challenge: The computational energy required for training Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) often dominates communication costs. However, most existing Energy-Harvesting FL (EHFL) strategies fail to account for this reality, resulting in wasted energy due to redundant local computations. For efficient and proactive resource management, algorithms that predict local update contributions must be devised. We propose a lightweight client scheduling framework using the Version Age of Information (VAoI), a semantics-aware metric that quantifies update timeliness and significance. Crucially, we overcome VAoI's typical prohibitive computational cost, which requires statistical distance over the entire parameter space, by introducing a feature-based proxy. This proxy estimates model redundancy using intermediate-layer extraction from a single forward pass, dramatically reducing computational complexity. Experiments conducted under extreme non-IID data distributions and scarce energy availability demonstrate superior learning performance while achieving energy reduction compared to existing baseline selection policies. Our framework establishes semantics-aware scheduling as a practical and vital solution for EHFL in realistic scenarios where training costs dominate transmission costs.</description>

      <title>Entropy Functions on Two-Dimensional Faces of Polymatroidal Region of Degree Four: Part I: Problem Formulation and More</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.06250v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Characterization of entropy functions is of fundamental importance in information theory. By imposing constraints on their Shannon outer bound, i.e., the polymatroidal region, one obtains the faces of the region and entropy functions on them with special structures. In this series of two papers, we characterize entropy functions on the 2-dimensional faces of the polymatroidal region of degree 4. In Part I, we formulate the problem, enumerate all 59 types of 2-dimensional faces of the region by an algorithm, and fully characterize entropy functions on 49 types of them. Among them, those non-trivial cases are mainly characterized by the graph-coloring technique. The entropy functions on the remaining 10 types of faces will be characterized in Part II, among which 8 types are fully characterized, and 2 types are partially characterized.</description>

      <title>Structural Conditions for Quadratic Degradability in Symmetric Quantum Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16312v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the role of symmetry in determining the low-noise behavior of high-dimensional quantum channels, with a focus on the modified Landau--Streater (MLS) family derived from spin-$j$ representations of $SU(2)$. We show that these channels exhibit a quadratic scaling of the approximate degradability parameter, $\eta = O(p^2)$, for every dimension $d=2j+1$, using an explicit degrading map whose structure is dictated by the $SU(2)$ Casimir operator. We further identify two algebraic features underlying this behavior: the tracelessness of the noise operators, which enforces a geometric orthogonality between signal and noise components, and an eigen-invariance property that preserves this structure under the channel action. These observations lead to a general sufficient condition under which a channel displays quadratic suppression of non-degradability, placing the MLS and generalized Pauli channels within a common analytical framework. Overall, the results clarify why certain symmetric noise models admit tighter low-noise capacity estimates and suggest a structural perspective for analyzing approximate degradability in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>On the Additivity of Optimal Rates for Independent Zero-Error Source and Channel Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02281v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Zero-error coding encompasses a variety of source and channel problems where the probability of error must be exactly zero. This condition is stricter than that of the vanishing error regime, where the error probability goes to zero as the code blocklength goes to infinity. In general, zero-error coding is an open combinatorial question. We investigate two unsolved zero-error problems: the source coding problem with side information and the channel coding problem. We focus our attention on families of independent problems for which the probability distribution decomposes into a product of probability distributions. A crucial step is the additivity property of the optimal rate, which does not always hold in the zero-error regime, unlike in the vanishing error regime. When the additivity holds, the concatenation of optimal codes is optimal. We derive a condition under which the additivity of the complementary graph entropy $\overline{H}$ for the AND product of graphs and for the disjoint union of graphs are equivalent. Then we establish the connection with a recent result obtained by Wigderson and Zuiddam and by Schrijver, for the zero-error capacity $C_0$. As a consequence, we provide new single-letter characterizations of $\overline{H}$ and $C_0$, for example when the graph is a product of perfect graphs, which is not perfect in general, and for the class of graphs obtained by the product of a perfect graph $G$ with the pentagon graph $C_5$. By building on Haemers result for $C_0$, we also show that the additivity of $\overline{H}$ does not hold for the product of the Schl\"{a}fli graph with its complementary graph.</description>

      <title>From AoI to QVAoI: Query-Based Semantics-Aware Scheduling for Energy-Harvesting IoT Status Update Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08587v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study the freshness and significance of information in an IoT status update system where an Energy Harvesting (EH) device samples an information source and forwards the update packets to a destination node through a direct channel. We introduce and optimize a semantics-aware metric, Query Version Age of Information (QVAoI), in the system along with other metrics: Query Age of Information (QAoI), Version Age of Information (VAoI), and Age of Information (AoI). By employing the MDP framework, we formulate the optimization problem and determine the optimal transmission policies at the device, which involve deciding the time slots for updating, subject to the energy limitations imposed by the device's battery and energy arrivals. Through analytical and numerical results, we compare the performance of QVAoI-Optimal, QAoI-Optimal, VoI-Optimal, and AoI-Optimal policies with a baseline greedy policy. All semantics-aware policies show significantly improved performance compared to the greedy policy. The QVAoI-Optimal policy, in particular, demonstrates a significant performance improvement by either providing fresher, more relevant, and valuable updates with the same amount of energy arrivals or reducing the number of transmissions in the system to maintain the same level of freshness and significance of information compared to the QAoI-Optimal and other policies.</description>

Abstract: Error-correcting codes for quantum computing are crucial to address the fundamental problem of communication in the presence of noise and imperfections. Audoux used Khovanov homology to define families of quantum error-correcting codes with desirable properties. We explore Khovanov homology and some of its many extensions, namely reduced, annular, and $\mathfrak{sl}_3$ homology, to generate new families of quantum codes and to establish several properties about codes that arise in this way, such as behavior of distance under Reidemeister moves or connected sums.</description>

      <title>Beamforming Design for Beyond Diagonal RIS-Aided Cell-Free Massive MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07189v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided cell-free (CF) massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) is a promising technology for further improving spectral efficiency (SE) with low cost and power consumption. However, conventional RIS has inevitable limitations due to its diagonal scattering matrix. In contrast, beyond-diagonal RIS (BD-RIS) has gained great attention. This correspondence focuses on integrating a hybrid transmitting and reflecting BD-RIS into CF mMIMO systems to enhance coverage and spatial multiplexing. This requires completing the beamforming design under the transmit power constraints and unitary constraints of the BD-RIS, by optimizing active and passive beamformer simultaneously. To tackle this issue, we introduce an alternating optimization algorithm that decomposes it using fractional programming and solves the subproblems alternatively. Moreover, to address the challenge introduced by the unitary constraint on the beamforming matrix of the BD-RIS, we propose a Riemannian limited-memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (R-L-BFGS) algorithm to solve the problem optimally. Simulation results show that our algorithm achieves faster convergence and finds higher-quality solutions compared with baselines, while also demonstrating a favorable performance-complexity trade-off.</description>

      <title>Multi-Subarray FD-RIS Enhanced Multi-user Wireless Networks: With Joint Distance-Angle Beamforming</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18628v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The concept of the frequency diverse reconfigurable intelligent surface (FD-RIS) technology has been introduced, which can enable simultaneous implementation of distance-angle beamforming in far-field communication scenarios. In order to improve the managing ability on undesired harmonic signals and the diversity of frequency offsets, this paper presents a novel multi-subarray FD-RIS framework. In this framework, the RIS is evenly divided into multiple subarrays, each employing a distinct time-modulation frequency to enable the diversity of frequency offsets. Additionally, to suppress the undesired harmonic signals, a new time-modulation technique is employed to periodically adjust the phase-shift of each element. Based on the proposed multi-subarray FD-RIS, the signal processing model is first analytically derived. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed multi-subarray FD-RIS, we integrate it into a multi-user communication scenario and formulate an optimization problem that aims to maximize the weighted sum rate of all users. This is achieved by jointly optimizing the active beamforming, time delays, and modulation frequencies. Subsequently, a novel iterative algorithm is proposed to effectively solve this problem with low computing complexity. To evaluate the beamforming capability of the proposed multi-subarray FD-RIS,three communication scenarios with varying spatial correlations among users are considered. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed multi-subarray FD-RIS can significantly enhance and sustain the performance of communication networks by leveraging unique distance-angle beamforming, even when users share the same angular position where traditional RIS experiences severe degradation.</description>

      <title>Symbiotic Backscatter Communication: A Design Perspective on the Modulation Scheme of Backscatter Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01782v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Symbiotic Backscatter Communication (SBC) has emerged as a spectrum-efficient and low-power communication technology, where backscatter devices (BDs) modulate and reflect incident radio frequency (RF) signals from primary transmitters (PTs). While previous studies have assumed a circularly symmetric complex Gaussian (CSCG) distribution for the BD's signal, this assumption may not be practical because the high complexity of generating CSCG signals is not supported by the low-cost BD. In this paper, we address this gap by investigating SBC for two low-complexity modulation schemes, i.e., $M$-ary amplitude-shift keying (MASK) and $M$-ary phase-shift keying (MPSK), where BD's signals inherently deviate from CSCG distribution. Our goal is to derive the achievable rate of the PT and BD under the MASK/MPSK and to design MASK/MPSK modulation scheme for maximizing the PT's rate. Towards this end, we first derive the expressions of both the PT's rate and BD's rate. Theoretical results reveal that whether or not the BD improves the PT's rate depends on the phase of MASK/MPSK modulation, while the BD's rate is independent of this phase. We then formulate two optimization problems to maximize the PT's rate by adjusting the phase under the MASK and MPSK modulation schemes, respectively, and derive the optimal phases for each modulation scheme in closed forms. Simulation results demonstrate that the optimal phase of MASK/MPSK can ensure an improvement in the PT's rate, and reveal that a low-order ASK modulation is better than a low-order PSK for the BD in terms of improving PT's rate, especially when the direct link is not significantly weaker than the backscatter link in SBC.</description>

      <title>Information Physics of Intelligence: Unifying Logical Depth and Entropy under Thermodynamic Constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19156v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid scaling of artificial intelligence models has revealed a fundamental tension between model capacity (storage) and inference efficiency (computation). While classical information theory focuses on transmission and storage limits, it lacks a unified physical framework to quantify the thermodynamic costs of generating information from compressed laws versus retrieving it from memory. In this paper, we propose a theoretical framework that treats information processing as an enabling mapping from ontological states to carrier states. We introduce a novel metric, Derivation Entropy, which quantifies the effective work required to compute a target state from a given logical depth. By analyzing the interplay between Shannon entropy (storage) and computational complexity (time/energy), we demonstrate the existence of a critical phase transition point. Below this threshold, memory retrieval is thermodynamically favorable; above it, generative computation becomes the optimal strategy. This "Energy-Time-Space" conservation law provides a physical explanation for the efficiency of generative models and offers a rigorous mathematical bound for designing next-generation, energy-efficient AI architectures. Our findings suggest that the minimization of Derivation Entropy is a governing principle for the evolution of both biological and artificial intelligence.</description>

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a collaborative machine learning (ML) framework that combines on-device training and server-based aggregation to train a common ML model among distributed agents. In this work, we propose an asynchronous FL design with periodic aggregation to tackle the straggler issue in FL systems. Considering limited wireless communication resources, we investigate the effect of different scheduling policies and aggregation designs on the convergence performance. Driven by the importance of reducing the bias and variance of the aggregated model updates, we propose a scheduling policy that jointly considers the channel quality and training data representation of user devices. The effectiveness of our channel-aware data-importance-based scheduling policy, compared with state-of-the-art methods proposed for synchronous FL, is validated through simulations. Moreover, we show that an ``age-aware'' aggregation weighting design can significantly improve the learning performance in an asynchronous FL setting.</description>

      <title>Families of costs with zero and nonnegative MTW tensor in optimal transport and the c-divergences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00953v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the information geometry of $\bcc$-divergences from families of costs of the form $\mathsf{c}(x, \barx) =\mathsf{u}(x^{\mathfrak{t}}\barx)$ through the optimal transport point of view. Here, $\mathsf{u}$ is a scalar function with inverse $\mathsf{s}$, $x^{\ft}\barx$ is a nondegenerate bilinear pairing of vectors $x, \barx$ belonging to an open subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$. We compute explicitly the MTW tensor (or cross curvature) for the optimal transport problem on $\mathbb{R}^n$ with this cost. The condition that the MTW-tensor vanishes on null vectors under the Kim-McCann metric is a fourth-order nonlinear ODE, which could be reduced to a linear ODE of the form $\mathsf{s}^{(2)} - S\mathsf{s}^{(1)} + P\mathsf{s} = 0$ with constant coefficients $P$ and $S$. The resulting inverse functions include {\it Lambert} and {\it generalized inverse hyperbolic\slash trigonometric} functions. The square Euclidean metric and $\log$-type costs are equivalent to instances of these solutions. The optimal map may be written explicitly in terms of the potential function. For cost functions of a similar form on a hyperboloid model of the hyperbolic space and unit sphere, we also express this tensor in terms of algebraic expressions in derivatives of $\mathsf{s}$ using the Gauss-Codazzi equation, obtaining new families of strictly regular costs for these manifolds, including new families of {\it power function costs}. We express the divergence geometry of the $\mathsf{c}$-divergence in terms of the Kim-McCann metric, including a $\mathsf{c}$-Crouzeix identity and a formula for the primal connection. We analyze the $\sinh$-type hyperbolic cost, providing examples of $\mathsf{c}$-convex functions, which are used to construct a new \emph{local form} of the $\alpha$-divergences on probability simplices. We apply the optimal maps to sample the multivariate $t$-distribution.</description>

Abstract: Information is typically understood as a structure that tells something about another structure, yet no widely accepted definition of information has been derived from first physical principles. Here we develop a substrate-agnostic framework that defines information directly from physical dynamics in systems ranging from molecular to neural, cultural, and technological. Persistent physical structures are represented as almost invariant sets of the underlying dynamics, and their structure-creating relations are encoded in a causal structure set whose nodes are long-lived structures and whose edges capture active generative influences. Within this setting we identify specific generative motifs - replication, heritable variation, and translation under shared templates - through which informational relations emerge: a structure carries information about another precisely when they are linked by these hereditary motifs. In this framework, information and evolution are ontologically intertwined: information is the hereditary causal agent in evolution, and evolution is the differential persistence of information variants within a causal structure set. We show how information entropy and information fitness can be constructed directly and algorithmically from the causal structure, providing substrate-independent measures of diversity and evolutionary success. Finally, by analogy with random directed graphs and catalytic networks, we formulate a hypothesis on the generic emergence of information: under broad structural conditions on persistence, generativity, and diversity, hereditary informational motifs should arise generically in sufficiently large causal-physical systems, making information-bearing, life-like processes expected rather than exceptional.</description>

      <title>The Complexity of Testing Message-Passing Concurrency</title>

Abstract: A key computational question underpinning the automated testing and verification of concurrent programs is the consistency question - given a partial execution history, can it be completed in a consistent manner? Due to its importance, consistency testing has been studied extensively for memory models, as well as for database isolation levels. A common theme in all these settings is the use of shared-memory as the primal mode of interthread communication. On the other hand, modern programming languages, such as Go, Rust and Kotlin, advocate a paradigm shift towards channel-based (i.e., message-passing) communication. However, the consistency question for channel-based concurrency is currently poorly understood.
  In this paper we lift the study of fundamental consistency problems to channels, taking into account various input parameters, such as the number of threads executing, the number of channels, and the channel capacities. We draw a rich complexity landscape, including upper bounds that become polynomial when certain input parameters are fixed, as well as hardness lower bounds. Our upper bounds are based on algorithms that can drive the verification of channel consistency in automated verification tools. Our lower bounds characterize minimal input parameters that are sufficient for hardness to arise, and thus shed light on the intricacies of testing channel-based concurrency. In combination, our upper and lower bounds characterize the boundary of tractability/intractability of verifying channel consistency, and imply that our algorithms are often (nearly) optimal.</description>

      <title>Overfitting has a limitation: a model-independent generalization gap bound based on R\'enyi entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00182v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Will further scaling up of machine learning models continue to bring success? A significant challenge in answering this question lies in understanding generalization gap, which is the impact of overfitting. Understanding generalization gap behavior of increasingly large-scale machine learning models remains a significant area of investigation, as conventional analyses often link error bounds to model complexity, failing to fully explain the success of extremely large architectures. This research introduces a novel perspective by establishing a model-independent upper bound for generalization gap applicable to algorithms whose outputs are determined solely by the data's histogram, such as empirical risk minimization or gradient-based methods. Crucially, this bound is shown to depend only on the R\'enyi entropy of the data-generating distribution, suggesting that a small generalization gap can be maintained even with arbitrarily large models, provided the data quantity is sufficient relative to this entropy. This framework offers a direct explanation for the phenomenon where generalization performance degrades significantly upon injecting random noise into data, where the performance degrade is attributed to the consequent increase in the data distribution's R\'enyi entropy. Furthermore, we adapt the no-free-lunch theorem to be data-distribution-dependent, demonstrating that an amount of data corresponding to the R\'enyi entropy is indeed essential for successful learning, thereby highlighting the tightness of our proposed generalization bound.</description>

      <title>Compression of executable QR codes or sQRy for Industry: an example for Wi-Fi access points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06100v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Executable QR codes, or sQRy, is a technology dated 2022 that permits to include a runnable program inside a QR code, enabling interaction with the user even in the absence of an Internet connection. sQRy are enablers for different practical applications, including network equipment configuration, diagnostics, and enhanced smart manuals in industrial contexts. Many other non-industry-related fields can also benefit from this technology. Regardless of where sQRy are used, text strings are among the most commonly embedded data. However, due to strict limitations on the available payload, the occupancy of strings limits the length of the programs that can be embedded. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective strategy that can reduce the space taken by strings, hence broadening sQRy applicability.</description>

      <title>Zero-shot Denoising via Neural Compression: Theoretical and algorithmic framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12693v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Zero-shot denoising aims to denoise observations without access to training samples or clean reference images. This setting is particularly relevant in practical imaging scenarios involving specialized domains such as medical imaging or biology. In this work, we propose the Zero-Shot Neural Compression Denoiser (ZS-NCD), a novel denoising framework based on neural compression. ZS-NCD treats a neural compression network as an untrained model, optimized directly on patches extracted from a single noisy image. The final reconstruction is then obtained by aggregating the outputs of the trained model over overlapping patches. Thanks to the built-in entropy constraints of compression architectures, our method naturally avoids overfitting and does not require manual regularization or early stopping. Through extensive experiments, we show that ZS-NCD achieves state-of-the-art performance among zero-shot denoisers for both Gaussian and Poisson noise, and generalizes well to both natural and non-natural images. Additionally, we provide new finite-sample theoretical results that characterize upper bounds on the achievable reconstruction error of general maximum-likelihood compression-based denoisers. These results further establish the theoretical foundations of compression-based denoising. Our code is available at: https://github.com/Computational-Imaging-RU/ZS-NCDenoiser.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Models are Kelly Gamblers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23937v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We draw a connection between diffusion models and the Kelly criterion for maximizing returns in betting games. A signal that is correlated with the outcome of such a game can be used to focus the bets on a narrow range of high probability predictions. Diffusion models share the same paradigm in that they gradually concentrate the probability mass to fit the training data. We show that the information stored in an unconditional diffusion model captures, in part, the joint correlation between the components of the data variable $X$. Conditional diffusion models store additional information to bind the signal $X$ with the conditioning information $Y$, equal to the mutual information between them. The latter is only a small fraction of the total information in the neural network if the data is low-dimensional. We examine why this does not hinder conditional generation.</description>

      <title>Large Deviations Principle for Isoperimetry and Its Equivalence to Nonlinear Log-Sobolev Inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04030v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the large deviations principle (which concerns sequences of exponentially small sets) for the isoperimetric problem on product Riemannian manifolds $M^{n}$ equipped with product probability measures $\nu^{\otimes n}$, where $M$ is a Riemannian manifold satisfying curvature-dimension bound $\mathrm{CD}(0,\infty)$. When the probability measure ${\nu}$ admits a finite moment generating function for squared distance, we establish an exact characterization of the large deviations asymptotics for the isoperimetric profile, which shows a precise equivalence between these asymptotic isoperimetric inequalities and nonlinear log-Sobolev inequalities. It is observed that the product of two relative entropy typical sets (or empirically typical sets) forms an asymptotically optimal solution to the isoperimetric problem. The proofs in this paper integrate tools from information theory, optimal transport, and geometric measure theory.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Local Combining with Decentralized Decoding for Distributed Massive MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17445v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A major bottleneck in uplink distributed massive multiple-input multiple-output networks is the sub-optimal performance of local combining schemes, coupled with high fronthaul load and computational cost inherent in centralized large scale fading decoding (LSFD) architectures. This paper introduces a decentralized decoding architecture that fundamentally breaks from the LSFD, by allowing each access point (AP) to calculate interference-suppressing local weights independently and apply them to its data estimates before transmission. Furthermore, two generalized local zero-forcing (ZF) frameworks, generalized partial full-pilot ZF (G-PFZF) and generalized protected weak PFZF (G-PWPFZF), are introduced, where each AP adaptively and independently determines its combining strategy through a local sum spectral efficiency (SE) optimization that classifies user equipments (UEs) as strong or weak, eliminating the fixed thresholds used in the PFZF and PWPFZF schemes. To enhance scalability, pilot-dependent combining vectors instead of user-dependent ones are introduced and are shared among users with the same pilot. The closed-form SE expressions corresponding to the proposed schemes are derived. Numerical results show that the proposed schemes consistently outperform fixed-threshold counterparts, while the introduction of local weights yields lower overheads and computation costs with lower performance penalty compared to them.</description>

      <title>Lossy communication constrains iterated learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18220v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Humans' distinctive role in the world can largely be attributed to our capacity for iterated learning, a process by which knowledge is expanded and refined over generations. A range of theories seek to explain why humans are so adept at iterated learning, many positing substantial evolutionary discontinuities in communication or cognition. Is it necessary to posit large differences in abilities between humans and other species, or could small differences in communication ability produce large differences in what a species can learn over generations? We investigate this question through a formal model based on information theory. We manipulate how much information individual learners can send each other and observe the effect on iterated learning performance. Incremental changes to the channel rate can lead to dramatic, non-linear changes to the eventual performance of the population. We complement this model with a theoretical result that describes how individual lossy communications constrain the global performance of iterated learning. Our results demonstrate that incremental, quantitative changes to communication abilities could be sufficient to explain large differences in what can be learned over many generations.</description>

      <title>A Classification of Elements of Sequence Space $Seq(\mathbb{R})$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21751v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The sequence space of all real-valued sequences, denoted $Seq(\mathbb{R})$, is typically investigated through the lens of infinite-dimensional vector spaces, utilizing Banach space norms or Schauder bases. This work proposes a complementary, constructive classification based instead on the asymptotic limit profile encoded by the pair $(\liminf a_n, \limsup a_n)$. We demonstrate that this perspective naturally partitions $Seq(\mathbb{R})$ into seven mutually disjoint macroscale blocks, covering behaviors from finite convergence to bounded and unbounded oscillation. For each block, we provide explicit closed-form representative sequences and establish that every constituent class possesses the cardinality of the continuum. Furthermore, we investigate the structural relationships between these blocks at two distinct levels of granularity. At the macroscale, we employ injective mappings to define an idealized connectivity graph, while at the microscale, we introduce a connection relation governed by the Hadamard (pointwise) product. This dual analysis reveals a rich directed graph structure where the block of finite convergent sequences functions both as the only block subspace and as a global attractor with no outgoing connections. Statistical comparisons between the idealized and realized adjacency matrices indicate that the pointwise product structure realizes approximately two-thirds of the theoretically possible macroscale relations. Ultimately, this partition-based framework endows the seemingly chaotic space $Seq(\mathbb{R})$ with a transparent, geometrically interpretable internal structure.</description>
