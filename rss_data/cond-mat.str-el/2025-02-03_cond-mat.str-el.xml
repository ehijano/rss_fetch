      <title>Quantum Phase Transitions between Symmetry-Enriched Fracton Phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phases with topological order exhibit further complexity in the presence of global symmetries: States with the same topological order are distinguished by how their anyonic excitations transform under these symmetries, leading to a classification in terms of symmetry-enriched topological phases. In this work, we develop a generic scheme to study an analogous situation for three-dimensional fracton phases by means of isometric tensor network states (isoTNS) with finite bond dimension, which allow us to tune between wavefunctions of different symmetry fractionalization. We focus on the X-Cube model, a paradigmatic fracton model hosting two types of excitations: lineons, which are mobile in a single direction only, and fractons that are completely immobile as individual particles. By deforming the local tensors that describe the ground state of the fixed point model, we find a family of exact wavefunctions for which the symmetry fractionalization under an anti-unitary symmetry on both types of excitations is directly visible. These wavefunctions have non-vanishing correlation lengths and are non-stabilizer states. At the critical points between the phases, power-law correlations are supported in certain spatial directions. Furthermore, based on the isoTNS description of the wavefunction, we determine a linear-depth quantum circuit to sequentially realize these states on a quantum processor, including a holographic scheme for which a pair of two-dimensional qubit arrays suffices to encode the three-dimensional state using measurements. Our approach provides a construction to enrich phases with exotic topological or fracton order based on the language of tensor networks and offers a tractable route to implement and characterize fracton order with quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Unconventional high-temperature excitonic insulators in two-dimensional topological materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bound electron-hole pairs in semiconductors known as excitons can form a coherent state at low temperatures akin to a BCS condensate. The resulting phase is known as the excitonic insulator and has superfluid properties. Here we theoretically study the excitonic insulator in a pair of recently proposed two-dimensional candidate materials with nontrivial band topology. Contrary to previous works, we include interaction channels that violate the individual electron and hole number conservations. These are on equal footing with the number-conserving processes due to the substantial overlap of Wannier orbitals of different bands, which cannot be exponentially localized due to the nontrivial Chern numbers of the latter. Their inclusion is crucial to determine the symmetry of the electron-hole pairing, and by performing mean-field calculations at nonzero temperatures we find that the order parameter is a chiral $d$-wave. We discuss the nontrivial topology of this unconventional state and analyze its superfluid properties. In particular, we estimate BKT temperatures between 75 K and 100 K on realistic substrates, over an order of magnitude larger than in the number-conserving approximation where $s$-wave pairing is favored. Our results highlight the interplay between topology at the single-particle level and long-range interactions, motivating further research in systems where both phenomena coexist.</description>

      <title>Pressure induced enhancement of polar distortions in a metal, and implications on the Rashba spin-splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polar metals are an intriguing class of materials in which electric polarisation and metallicity can coexist within a single phase. The unique properties of polar metals challenge expectations, making way for the exploration of exotic phenomena such as unconventional magnetism, hyperferroelectric multiferroicity and developing multifunctional devices that can leverage both the materials electric polarization and its asymmetry in the spin conductivity, that arises due to the Rashba effect. Here, via a high pressure single crystal diffraction study, we report the pressure-induced enhancement of polar distortions in such a metal, Ca$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$. Our DFT calculations highlight that naive assumptions about the linear dependency between polar distortion amplitudes and the magnitude of the Rashba spin splitting may not be generally valid.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Topological Non-Fermi Liquid Phases in a Modified Su-Schrieffer-Heeger Chain with Long-Range Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the emergence of a topological non-Fermi liquid (NFL) phase in a modified Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chain model subjected to long-range interactions characterized by the Hatsugai-Kohmoto (HK) model. While Fermi liquid theory has been instrumental in understanding low temperature properties of metals, it fails to account for the complex behaviors exhibited by strongly correlated systems, where interactions lead to emergent phenomena such as non-Fermi liquid behavior. Our analysis reveals that the SSH-HK model supports a rich ground state phase diagram, exhibiting distinct NFL phases marked by many body Zak phases of $2\pi$ and $0$, corresponding to topological and trivial NFL states, respectively. We demonstrate that the topological NFL state manifests unique electronic polarization characteristics akin to those in the non-interacting SSH model. Through exact diagonalization of the interacting SSH-HK Hamiltonian, we explore the spectral functions and density of states, revealing significant departures from traditional quasiparticle behavior in various particle number sectors. Our findings extend the understanding of topological non-Fermi liquids and their potential implications for high-temperature superconductivity and other correlated electron systems, highlighting the intricate interplay between topology and strong electron correlations.</description>

      <title>Towards numerically exact computation of conductivity in the thermodynamic limit of interacting lattice models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computing dynamical response functions in interacting lattice models is a long standing challenge in condensed matter physics. In view of recent results, the dc resistivity $\rho_\mathrm{dc}$ in the weak coupling regime of the Hubbard model is of great interest, yet it is not fully understood. The challenge lies in having to work with large lattices while avoiding analytical continuation. The weak-coupling $\rho_\mathrm{dc}$ results were so far computed at the level of the Boltzmann theory and at the level of the Kubo bubble approximation, which neglects vertex corrections. Neither theory was so far rigorously proven to give exact results even at infinitesimal coupling, and the respective dc resistivity results differ greatly. In this work we develop, cross-check and apply two state-of-the-art methods for obtaining dynamical response functions. We compute the optical conductivity at weak coupling in the Hubbard model in a fully controlled way, in the thermodynamic limit and without analytical continuation. We show that vertex corrections persist to infinitesimal coupling, with a constant ratio to the Kubo bubble. We connect our methods with the Boltzmann theory, and show that the latter applies additional approximations, which lead to quantitatively incorrect scaling of $\rho_\mathrm{dc}$ with respect to the coupling constant.</description>

      <title>Fractons from covariant higher-rank 3D BF theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the 3D gauge theory of two tensor gauge fields: $a_{\mu\nu}(x)$, which we take symmetric, and $B_{\mu\nu}(x)$, with no symmetry on its indices. The corresponding invariant action is a higher-rank BF-like model, which is first considered from a purely field theoretical point of view, and the propagators with their poles and the degrees of freedom are studied. Once matter is introduced, a fracton behaviour naturally emerges. We show that our theory can be mapped to the low-energy effective field theory describing the Rank-2 Toric Code (R2TC). This relation between our covariant BF-like theory and the R2TC is a higher-rank generalization of the equivalence between the ordinary 3D BF theory and the Kitaev's Toric Code. In the last part of the paper we analyze the case in which the field $B_{\mu\nu}(x)$ is a symmetric tensor. It turns out that the obtained BF-like action can be cast into the sum of two rank-2 Chern-Simons actions, thus generalizing the ordinary abelian case. Therefore, this represents a higher-rank generalization of the ordinary 3D BF theory, which well describes the low-energy physics of quantum spin Hall insulators in two spatial dimensions.</description>

      <title>Signatures of Non-Abelian Kitaev quantum spin liquids in noise magnetormetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identification of isolated Majorana zero modes (MZMs) is a key step towards the realization of fault-tolerant topological quantum computation. Here we show how the $T_1$-based noise magnetormetry of a nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center qubit can reveal the unique signatures of Majorana fermions attached to vacancies in a non-Abelian Kitaev quantum spin liquid (KQSL). The $1/T_1$ of the NV center is found to be increased significantly when the working frequency of the NV center matches the energy difference between a MZM and a low-energy hybridized mode involving dangling Majorana fermions adjacent to vacancies. In experiments, this energy difference can be tuned by an external Zeeman field. Because of the large excitation gap of flipping a local $Z_2$ gauge field, the $1/T_1$ spectrum is robust against other fluctuations in KQSLs. Our study presents a promising pathway for identifying the non-Abelian phase in Kitaev materials.</description>

      <title>Correlations drive the attosecond response of strongly-correlated insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Attosecond spectroscopy of materials has provided invaluable insight into light-driven coherent electron dynamics. However, attosecond spectroscopies have so far been focused on weakly-correlated materials. As a result, the behavior of strongly-correlated systems is largely unknown at sub- to few-femtosecond timescales, even though it is typically the realm at which electron-electron interactions operate. Here we conduct attosecond-resolved experiments on the correlated insulator nickel oxide, and compare its response to a common band insulator, revealing fundamentally different behaviors. The results, together with state-of-the art time-dependent $\textit{ab initio}$ calculations, show that the correlated system response is governed by a laser-driven quench of electron correlations. The evolution of the on-site electronic interaction is measured here at its natural timescale, marking the first direct measurement of Hubbard $U$ renormalization in NiO. It is found to take place within a few femtoseconds, after which structural changes slowly start to take place. The resulting picture sheds light on the entire light-induced response of a strongly-correlated system, from attosecond to long-lived effects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present recommendations for how to improve reproducibility in the field of condensed matter physics. This area of physics has consistently produced both fundamental insights into the functioning of matter as well as transformative inventions. Our recommendations result from a collaboration that includes researchers in academia and government laboratories, scientific journalists, legal professionals, representatives of publishers, professional societies, and other experts. The group met in person in May 2024 at a conference at the University of Pittsburgh to discuss the growing challenges related to research reproducibility in condensed matter physics. We discuss best practices and policies at all stages of the scientific process to safeguard the value condensed matter research brings to society. We look forward to comments and suggestions, especially regarding subfield-specific recommendations, and will incorporate them into the next version of the report.</description>

      <title>Direct Visualization of an Incommensurate Unidirectional Charge Density Wave in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconductivity emerges in both La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ under high pressure by suppressing their density-wave transitions, but critical temperature (Tc) differs significantly between these two compounds. To gain deeper insights into the distinct superconducting states, it is essential to unravel the nature of the density-wave states at ambient pressure, a topic that remains largely unexplored. Here, using scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS), we report the direct visualization of an incommensurate unidirectional charge density wave (CDW) in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ in real space. The density of states (DOS) is strongly depleted near $E_F$, indicating the opening of a CDW gap of $2{\Delta} \approx 71$ meV, which is unfavorable for the formation of superconductivity at ambient pressure. We propose that the CDW arises from Fermi surface nesting, and is likely a subsidiary phase of a spin density wave. Compared to La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, the weaker electronic correlation in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ is likely one reason for the lower $T_c$.</description>

      <title>Auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo method with seniority-zero trial wave function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an approach that uses the doubly occupied configuration interaction (DOCI) wave function as the trial wave functions in phaseless auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (ph-AFQMC). DOCI is a seniority-zero method focused on electron pairs. Although DOCI considers much fewer electron configurations than the complete active space (CAS) configuration interaction method, it efficiently captures the static correlation, while the consequent ph-AFQMC recovers the dynamical correlation across all orbitals. We also explore an orbital-optimized version (OO-DOCI) to further improve accuracy. We test this approach on several chemical systems, including single O-H bond breaking in water and polymer additives. In these cases, OO-DOCI-AFQMC closely matches CAS-based ph-AFQMC and even outperforms coupled-cluster singles, doubles, and perturbative triples. However, for strongly correlated systems, such as the carbon dimer and multi-bond dissociation in hydrogen systems and water, the method's accuracy drops. This suggests that seniority-zero space models may be insufficient as trial wave functions in ph-AFQMC for strongly correlated systems, suggesting the need for trial wave functions in an extended space. Despite such a limitation, our study demonstrates that DOCI- and OO-DOCI-based ph-AFQMC can reduce the steep cost of CAS approaches, offering a path to accurate multi-reference calculations for larger, more complex systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.19130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithm is arguably the most efficient sampling method for general probability distributions of continuous variables. Together with exact Fourier acceleration (EFA) the HMC becomes equivalent to direct sampling for quadratic actions $S(x)=\frac12 x^\mathsf{T} M x$ (i.e. normal distributions $x\sim \mathrm{e}^{-S(x)}$), only perturbatively worse for perturbative deviations of the action from the quadratic case, and it remains viable for arbitrary actions. In this work the most recent improvements of the HMC including EFA and radial updates are collected into a numerical recipe.</description>

      <title>Solid-state Synapse Based on Magnetoelectrically Coupled Memristor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.19304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brain-inspired computing architectures attempt to emulate the computations performed in the neurons and the synapses in human brain. Memristors with continuously tunable resistances are ideal building blocks for artificial synapses. Through investigating the memristor behaviors in a La0.7Sr0.3MnO3/BaTiO3/La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 multiferroic tunnel junction, it was found that the ferroelectric domain dynamics characteristics are influenced by the relative magnetization alignment of the electrodes, and the interfacial spin polarization is manipulated continuously by ferroelectric domain reversal, enriching our understanding of the magnetoelectric coupling fundamentally. This creates a functionality that not only the resistance of the memristor but also the synaptic plasticity form can be further manipulated, as demonstrated by the spike-timing-dependent plasticity investigations. Density functional theory calculations are carried out to describe the obtained magnetoelectric coupling, which is probably related to the Mn-Ti intermixing at the interfaces. The multiple and controllable plasticity characteristic in a single artificial synapse, to resemble the synaptic morphological alteration property in a biological synapse, will be conducive to the development of artificial intelligence.</description>

      <title>A topological theory for qLDPC: non-Clifford gates and magic state fountain on homological product codes with constant rate and beyond the $N^{1/3}$ distance barrier</title>

Abstract: We develop a unified theory for fault-tolerant quantum computation in quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) and topological codes. We show that there exist hidden simplicial complex structures encoding the topological data for all qLDPC and CSS codes obtained from product construction by generalizing the Freedman-Hastings code-to-manifold mapping. This is achieved by building manifolds corresponding to high-dimensional topological expanders from the Tanner graphs of the skeleton classical or quantum codes, which further form a product manifold and an associated thickened product code defined on its triangulation with only a constant qubit overhead. This suggests that qLDPC or more generally CSS codes obtained from product constructions are topological, and hence can admit cohomology operations such as cup products, physically corresponding to higher symmetries in the underlying topological quantum field theory. When applying this mapping to a 3D hypergraph product code obtained from the product of 3 copies of good classical expander codes, we obtain the first non-Clifford logical CCZ gates via constant depth circuits on a code with constant stabilizer weight $w=O(1)$, constant rate $K=\Theta(N)$, and polynomial distance $D=\Omega(N^{1/3})$. When applied to 3D homological product codes consisting of the product of a pair of good quantum and classical LDPC codes, we can further improve the distance to $D=\Omega(\sqrt{N})$ exceeding the $N^{1/3}$ distance barrier implied by the Bravyi-K\"onig bound for conventional topological codes. Our work suggests that it is feasible to apply native logical non-Clifford gates on qLDPC codes or directly inject high-fidelity magic states as resources (`magic state fountain') without the distillation process. For the homological product construction, the fountain can inject $\Theta(\sqrt{N})$ magic states in parallel in a single round.</description>

Abstract: Recent experimental results suggest that a particular hydrodynamic theory describes charge fluctuations at long wavelengths in the square-lattice Hubbard model. Due to the continuity equation, the correlation functions for the charge and the current are directly connected: the parameters of the effective hydrodynamic model thus determine the optical conductivity. Here we investigate the validity of the proposed hydrodynamic theory in the full range of parameters of the Hubbard model. In the non-interacting case, there is no effective hydrodynamics, and the charge fluctuations present a rich variety of non-universal behaviors. At weak coupling, the optical conductivity is consistent with the hydrodynamic theory: at low frequency one observes a Lorentzian-shaped Drude peak, but the high-frequency asymptotics is necessarily different; the high-temperature limit for the product of the two hydrodynamic model parameters is also in agreement with numerical data. At strong coupling, we find that a generalization of the proposed hydrodynamic law is consistent with our quantum Monte Carlo, as well as the finite-temperature Lanczos results from literature. Most importantly, the temperature dependence of the hydrodynamic parameters as well as the dc resistivity are found to be very similar in the weak and the strong-coupling regimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09077v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural networks have shown to be a powerful tool to represent the ground state of quantum many-body systems, including fermionic systems. However, efficiently integrating lattice symmetries into neural representations remains a significant challenge. In this work, we introduce a framework for embedding lattice symmetries in fermionic wavefunctions and demonstrate its ability to target both ground states and low-lying excitations. Using group-equivariant neural backflow transformations, we study the t-V model on a square lattice away from half-filling. Our symmetry-aware backflow significantly improves ground-state energies and yields accurate low-energy excitations for lattices up to 10 x 10. We also compute accurate two-point density-correlation functions and the structure factor to identify phase transitions and critical points. These findings introduce a symmetry-aware framework important for studying quantum materials and phase transitions.</description>

Abstract: We present the results of muon-spin relaxation ($\mu^{+}$SR) measurements of the van der Waals magnet NiI$_2$, which probe magnetic phase transitions at $T_{\mathrm{N1}}=73$~K and $T_{\mathrm{N2}}=60$~K. Supporting density functional theory (DFT) calculations allow the determination of a single muon stopping site whose magnetic environment is consistent with the proposed ground-state magnetic structure. $\mu^{+}$SR measurements of the dynamics reveal behavior consistent with spin-wave excitations below $T_{\mathrm{N2}}$. In the region $T_{\mathrm{N2}}&lt;T&lt;T_{\mathrm{N1}}$ the character of the dynamics changes qualitatively, resulting in an unusual region of temperature-independent fluctuations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09599v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Flatband systems form a new class of materials that challenge the conventional wisdom of transport. The intrinsically strong electronic correlations combined with the vanishing kinetic energy scale suggest a sensitive dependence of transport properties on the flat band states and make interacting flat bands promising candidates for exotic quantum transport. Utilizing the Drude weight, we investigate the low-frequency spectral properties of the electrical conductivity within a controlled analytic treatment of the many-body response at temperatures above the bandwidth and the interaction strength and below the bandgap. Focusing on this new transport regime, we demonstrate the potential of a quantum geometric approach for interacting systems and intermediate temperatures. The derived spectral weight yields unexplored four-point geometric contributions unrelated to the quantum metric, which questions the previously proposed projection methods. For long-ranged interactions, we show that the low-frequency spectral weight reduces to the variance of the Berry curvature.</description>

      <title>Edge-driven transition between extended quantum anomalous Hall crystal and fractional Chern insulator in rhombohedral graphene multilayers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05043v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fractional Chern insulators (FCI) with fractionally quantized Hall conductance at fractional fillings and an extended quantum anomalous Hall (EQAH) crystal with an integer quantized Hall conductance over an extended region of doping were recently observed in pentalayer graphene. One particularly puzzling observation is the transition between the EQAH and FCI regimes, driven either by temperature or electrical current. Here we propose a scenario to understand these transitions based on the topologically protected gapless edge modes that are present in both the FCI and EQAH phases and should be most relevant at temperature scales below the energy gap. Our consideration is based on the simple assumption that the edge velocity in FCI is smaller than that in EQAHE and thus contributes to a higher entropy. We further argue that domains with opposite fractionally quantized Hall conductance are ubiquitous in the devices due to disorder, which gives rise to a network of edge modes. The velocity of the edge modes between domains is further reduced due to edge reconstruction. The edge velocity can also be reduced by current when the occupation of the edge mode approaches the gap edge. The edge entropy therefore drives the transition from EQAH to FCI either by temperature or current at a nonzero temperature.</description>

      <title>Tuning competition between charge order and superconductivity in the square-lattice $t$-$t'$-$J$ model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15270v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, a flurry of works have found strong competition between charge density wave (CDW) and superconductivity (SC) in the doped Hubbard and $t$-$J$ models on the square lattice. Interestingly, some recent results suggest that the electron-phonon coupling may suppress CDW order and enhance SC. In this work, we consider the square-lattice Hubbard model with the Holstein or Su-Schrieffer-Heeger electron-phonon coupling at the large-$U$ and antiadiabatic (infinite phonon frequency) limit, which gives an effective $t$-$J$ model with either a density attractive interaction $V$ or a $J_P$ term that contributes a larger spin exchange and a density repulsive interaction. To explore how these effective couplings may suppress CDW and give a SC, we implement the density matrix renormalization group simulation on the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model with $V$ or $J_P$ coupling. We focus on the {\it six-leg} cylinder system with the next-nearest-neighbor hopping $t'$, which hosts partially filled stripe and $d$-wave SC in phase diagram. By tuning $t'/t &gt; 0$ and $V$ or $J_P$, we establish two quantum phase diagrams. In the SC phases, the increased $V$ or $J_P$ coupling can enhance the quasi-long-range SC order, consistent with some previous findings. Nonetheless, no SC emerges when the partially filled stripe phase disappears with increased $V$ or $J_P$. Instead, the system has a transition to either a phase-separation-like regime or a filled stripe phase. On the other hand, with increased $t'/t$, not only the partially filled stripe but the phase separation and filled stripe can also be tuned to SC phase. Our results suggest that although $V$ and $J_P$ couplings may strengthen hole binding, the hole dynamics controlled by $t'/t$ appears to play more crucial role for obtaining a SC in $t$-$J$ model.</description>

Abstract: Physical quantities with long lifetimes have both theoretical significance in the study of quantum many-body systems and practical implications for quantum technologies. In this manuscript, we investigate the roles played by topological defects in the construction of quasi-conserved quantities, using as a prototypical example the Kramers-Wannier duality defect in a deformed 1d quantum transverse field Ising model. We construct the duality defect Hamiltonian in three different ways: half-chain Kramers-Wannier transformation, utilization of techniques in the Ising fusion category, and defect-modified weak integrability breaking deformation. The third method is also applicable for the study of generic integrable defects under weak integrability breaking deformations. We also work out the deformation of defect-modified higher charges in the model and study their slower decay behavior. Furthermore, we consider the corresponding duality defect twisted deformed Floquet transverse field Ising model, and investigate the stability of the isolated zero mode associated with the duality defect in the integrable Floquet Ising model, under such weak integrability breaking deformation.</description>

Abstract: A theory of the normal and superconducting states of piezomagnetic metals, which are altermagnetic materials, has been developed. This has been done in comparison with the corresponding theoretical description for metals that do not have spatial inversion symmetry. Particular attention has been paid to the problem of the anomalous Hall effect, and its absence has been demonstrated in both altermagnetic and non-centrosymmetric metals. It has been shown that the superconducting state in altermagnets always arises by pairing electrons from zones split by spin-orbit interaction, which makes the existence of such superconductors unlikely.</description>

Abstract: The pseudogap in high-temperature superconducting cuprates is an exotic state of matter, displaying emerging Fermi arcs and a momentum-selective suppression of states upon cooling. We show how these phenomena are originating in the three-band Emery model by performing cutting-edge dynamical vertex approximation calculations for its normal state. For the hole-doped parent compound our results demonstrate the formation of a pseudogap due to short-ranged commensurate antiferromagnetic fluctuations. At larger doping values, progressively, incommensurate correlations and a metallic regime appear. Our results are in qualitative agreement with the normal state of cuprates, and, hence, represent a crucial step towards the uniform description of their phase diagrams within a single theoretical framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02057v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Realizing odd-parity, time-reversal-preserving, non-relativistic spin splitting is a central goal for spintronics applications. We propose a group-theory-based microscopic framework to induce odd-parity spin splitting from coplanar antiferromagnetic (AFM) states without spin-orbit coupling (SOC). We develop phenomenological models for 421 conventional period-doubling AFM systems in non-symmorphic space groups and construct minimal microscopic models for 119 of these. We find that these AFM states can attain three possible competing ground states. These ground states all break symmetries in addition to those broken by the usual AFM order. Specifically, they give rise to either odd-parity spin-splitting, nematic order, or scalar odd-parity order related to multiferroicity. Our microscopic theories reveal that the odd-parity spin-splitting energy scale is generically large and further reveal that the scalar odd-parity order gives a non-zero Berry curvature dipole without SOC. We identify 67 materials in the Magndata database for which our theory applies. We provide DFT calculations on FeSe that reveal an $h$-wave spin splitting consistent with our symmetry arguments and apply our microscopic model to determine the non-relativistic Edelstein response for CeNiAsO.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09728v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a finite one-dimensional non-Hermitian system, the number of zero modes does not necessarily reflect the topology of the system. This is known as the breakdown of the bulk-boundary correspondence and has led to misconceptions about the topological protection of edge modes in such systems. Here we show why this breakdown does occur and that it typically results in hidden zero modes, extremely long-lived zero energy excitations, which are only revealed when considering the singular value instead of the eigenvalue spectrum. We point out, furthermore, that in a finite multiband non-Hermitian system with Hamiltonian $H$, one needs to consider also the reflected Hamiltonian $\tilde H$, which is in general distinct from the adjoint $H^\dagger$, to properly relate the number of protected zeroes to the winding number of $H$.</description>

Abstract: Fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) showing a transport effect with fractionally quantized Hall plateaus emerging under zero magnetic field, provide a radically new opportunity to engineer topological quantum electronics. By construction of topological flat band with moire engineering, intrinsic FCIs have been observed in twisted MoTe2 system and rhombohedral pentalayer graphene/hBN moire superlattices with anomalous Hall resistivity quantization number C &lt;= 2/3 including the gapless composite Fermi-liquid state with C = 1/2. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a new system of rhombohedral hexalayer graphene (RHG)/hBN moire superlattices, which exhibit both integer and fractional quantum anomalous Hall effects with rich tunability including electric displacement field, perpendicular magnetic field and in-plane magnetic field. By tuning the electrical and magnetic fields at 0 &lt; v &lt; 1, we have observed a quantum phase transition showing a sign reversal of the Hall resistivity at finite magnetic fields. Surprisingly, the FCI state at v = 2/3 survives in the phase transitions, exhibiting a robust quantized Hall resistivity across both phases. Finally we have further demonstrated the indispensable role moire potential plays in the formation of the flat Chern band from a theoretical perspective. Our work has established RHG/hBN moire superlattices as a promising platform for exploring quasi-particles with fractional charge and non-Abelian anyons at zero magnetic field.</description>

Abstract: Experiments on chains of Rydberg atoms appear as a new playground to study quantum phase transitions in 1D. As a natural extension, we report a quantitative ground-state phase diagram of Rydberg atoms arranged in a two-leg ladder that interact via van der Waals potential. We address this problem numerically, using the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) algorithm. Our results suggest that, surprisingly enough, $\mathbb{Z}_k$ crystalline phases, with the exception of the checkerboard phase, appear in pairs characterized by the same pattern of occupied rungs but distinguishable by a spontaneously broken $\tilde{\mathbb{Z}}_2$ symmetry between the two legs of the ladder. Within each pair, the two phases are separated by a continuous transition in the Ising universality class, which eventually fuses with the $\mathbb{Z}_k$ transition, whose nature depends on $k$. According to our results, the transition into the $\mathbb{Z}_2\otimes \tilde{\mathbb{Z}}_2$ phase changes its nature multiple of times and, over extended intervals, falls first into the Ashkin-Teller, latter into the $\mathbb{Z}_4$-chiral universality class and finally in a two step-process mediated by a floating phase. The transition into the $\mathbb{Z}_3$ phase with resonant states on the rungs belongs to the three-state Potts universality class at the commensurate point, to the $\mathbb{Z}_3$-chiral Huse-Fisher universality class away from it, and eventually it is through an intermediate floating phase. The Ising transition between $\mathbb{Z}_3$ and $\mathbb{Z}_3\otimes \tilde{\mathbb{Z}}_2$ phases, coming across the floating phase, opens the possibility to realize lattice supersymmetry in Rydberg quantum simulators.</description>

Abstract: The discovery of superconductivity in pressurized bilayer and trilayer nickelates has generated significant interest. However, their superconducting properties are often dependent on sample quality and pressure conditions, complicating the interpretation of the underlying physics. Finding new systems with optimized bulk superconducting properties is therefore important for advancing our understanding of these materials. Unlike cupates, where trilayer compounds typically exhibit the highest transition temperature (Tc), the bilayer nickelate La3Ni2O7 has thus far outperformed the trilayer La4Ni3O10 in reported Tc. Whether the trilayer nickelates have achieved the optimal Tc remains unclear, with various scenarios suggesting different possibilities. Here, we report the discovery of bulk superconductivity in pressurized Pr4Ni3O10 single crystals, achieving a maximum onset Tc of 40.5 K at 80.1 GPa, significantly exceeding the 30 K observed in La4Ni3O10. The bulk nature of superconductivity is confirmed by zero resistance and a strong diamagnetic response below Tc with a superconducting volume fraction exceeding 80%. These findings establish trilayer nickelates as genuine bulk high-temperature superconductors, provide new insights into the mechanisms driving superconductivity, and point to a promising route toward further enhancing superconducting properties in nickelates.</description>
