      <title>Enforcing Equity in Neural Climate Emulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural network emulators have become an invaluable tool for a wide variety of climate and weather prediction tasks. While showing incredibly promising results, these networks do not have an inherent ability to produce equitable predictions. That is, they are not guaranteed to provide a uniform quality of prediction along any particular class or group of people. This potential for inequitable predictions motivates the need for explicit representations of fairness in these neural networks. To that end, we draw on methods for enforcing analytical physical constraints in neural networks to bias networks towards more equitable predictions. We demonstrate the promise of this methodology using the task of climate model emulation. Specifically, we propose a custom loss function which punishes emulators with unequal quality of predictions across any prespecified regions or category, here defined using human development index (HDI). This loss function weighs a standard loss metric such as mean squared error against another metric which captures inequity along the equity category (HDI), allowing us to adjust the priority of each term before training. Importantly, the loss function does not specify a particular definition of equity to bias the neural network towards, opening the door for custom fairness metrics. Our results show that neural climate emulators trained with our loss function provide more equitable predictions and that the equity metric improves with greater weighting in the loss function. We empirically demonstrate that while there is a tradeoff between accuracy and equity when prioritizing the latter during training, an appropriate selection of the equity priority hyperparameter can minimize loss of performance.</description>

      <title>Predictability of climate tipping focusing on the internal variability of the Earth system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prediction of climate tipping is challenging due to the lack of recent observation of actual climate tipping. Despite many previous efforts to accurately predict the existence and timing of climate tippings under specific climate scenarios, the predictability of climate tipping, the necessary conditions under which climate tipping can be predicted, has yet to be explored. In this study, the predictability of climate tipping is analyzed by Observation System Simulation Experiment (OSSE), in which the value of observation for prediction is assessed through the idealized experiment of data assimilation, using a simplified dynamic vegetation model and an Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) two box model. We find that the ratio of internal variability to observation error, or signal-to-noise ratio, should be large enough to accurately predict climate tippings. When observation can accurately resolve the internal variability of the system, assimilating these observations into process-based models can effectively improve the skill of predicting climate tippings. Our quantitative estimation of required observation accuracy to predict climate tipping implies that the existing observation network is not always sufficient to accurately project climate tipping.</description>

      <title>VarteX: Enhancing Weather Forecast through Distributed Variable Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Weather forecasting is essential for various human activities. Recent data-driven models have outperformed numerical weather prediction by utilizing deep learning in forecasting performance. However, challenges remain in efficiently handling multiple meteorological variables. This study proposes a new variable aggregation scheme and an efficient learning framework for that challenge. Experiments show that VarteX outperforms the conventional model in forecast performance, requiring significantly fewer parameters and resources. The effectiveness of learning through multiple aggregations and regional split training is demonstrated, enabling more efficient and accurate deep learning-based weather forecasting.</description>

      <title>AI for Extreme Event Modeling and Understanding: Methodologies and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.20080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has deeply impacted various fields, including Earth system sciences. Here, AI improved weather forecasting, model emulation, parameter estimation, and the prediction of extreme events. However, the latter comes with specific challenges, such as developing accurate predictors from noisy, heterogeneous and limited annotated data. This paper reviews how AI is being used to analyze extreme events (like floods, droughts, wildfires and heatwaves), highlighting the importance of creating accurate, transparent, and reliable AI models. We discuss the hurdles of dealing with limited data, integrating information in real-time, deploying models, and making them understandable, all crucial for gaining the trust of stakeholders and meeting regulatory needs. We provide an overview of how AI can help identify and explain extreme events more effectively, improving disaster response and communication. We emphasize the need for collaboration across different fields to create AI solutions that are practical, understandable, and trustworthy for analyzing and predicting extreme events. Such collaborative efforts aim to enhance disaster readiness and disaster risk reduction.</description>

      <title>Convex Optimization of Initial Perturbations toward Quantitative Weather Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19546v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study proposes introducing convex optimization to find initial perturbations of atmospheric models for realizing specified changes in subsequent forecasts. In the proposed method, we formulate and solve an inverse problem to find effective perturbations in atmospheric variables so that controlled variables satisfy specified changes at a specified time. The proposed method first constructs a sensitivity matrix of controlled variables, such as accumulated precipitation, to the initial atmospheric variables, such as temperature and humidity, through sensitivity analysis using numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. The sensitivity matrix is used to solve the inverse problem as convex optimization, in which a global optimal solution can be found computationally efficiently. The proposed method was validated through a benchmark warm bubble experiment using an NWP model. The experiments showed that identified perturbation successfully realized specified spatial distributions of accumulated precipitation. These results demonstrated the possibility of controlling the real atmosphere by solving inverse problems and adding small perturbations to atmospheric states.</description>

      <title>Earth ECS using Modified Energy Budget Methods and Trend Analyses v.3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11869v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Earth global and regional effective thermal "conductance" G(eff) (in (W/m^2)/C and often labeled lambda in climate research) and the related Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity (ECS) are evaluated by applying a modified version of the Energy Budget method, and using data only after 1970. By removing Periodic Interfering temperature components (using a novel PIR process) and applying high frequency filtering, an extraordinarily near linear temperature response is revealed, enhancing accurate G(eff) calculation and avoiding the pre-1970 aerosol forcing and ocean energy per area (E*) absorption uncertainties. A formal/empirical method is used to determine more reliable values of Q(t)=d[E*(Ocean.energy)]/dt . Using NOAA data, and after PIR, it is shown that: 1) The Energy Budget Method can be realistically applied to the Ocean and Land regions independently, 2) the effective volcanic forcing is &lt;= 1/5 the IPCC AR5 estimate, 3) the "historical" 1980-2020 ECS(eff) values for Global, global Ocean, and global Land regions values are &lt;= 2.16, 1.69, 2.96 C/2xCO2 respectively; where the updated IPCC AR5 orthodox independent global Forcing value of 0.4 (W/m^2)/Decade and F/2xCO2= 3.7 W/m^2 were used. The Global average ECS(true) value of &lt;= 2.10 C is 70% of the IPCC AR6 ECS estimate of 3.0 C, but 127% of the ECS(eff) value reported by Lewis (1.66 C) . The estimated oceans average TCR/ECS ratio = 0.71 and the global average TCR/ECS ratio = 0.83, and ECS(land)/ECS(Ocean) = 1.78 . [Results using HADCRUT temperature data instead are similar, but 6% "cooler" over land, and 8% "warmer" over oceans.] A simplified physically realistic formal/empirical Coarse 2-D Global Climate Model is derived wherein variation of Geff(t) until equilibrium (i.e. "pattern effects") are proven to be negligible or "cooling", using these Methods. And so it is likely ECS(true) &lt;= ECS(eff)....</description>
