      <title>Single-step laser patterning and thinning of biocompatible MEMS flow sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Micro-electro mechanical systems (MEMS) thermal flow sensors are increasingly used for compact, low-power flow monitoring in biomedical applications. However, silicon-based method for sensor fabrication is limited by high cost, rigidity, and multi-step cleanroom processes. This study presents a single-step fiber laser micromachining method for fabricating biocompatible, free-standing MEMS thermal flow sensors from ultrathin titanium foil. The process combines patterning and localized thinning in single-step process, with titanium serving as resistive sensing element. A dual-matrix optimization approach consisting of a Threshold Mapping Matrix (TMM) and Energy Density Matrix (EDM) was used to determine optimized parameters without repeated trial-and-error. For localized thinning, sequential R-T scans with cooling intervals reduced redeposition from the Gaussian beam profile and produced uniform thickness reduction from 50 {\mu}m to 20--30 {\mu}m. The fabricated sensors were evaluated through thermal coefficient resistance (TCR) measurement, Infrared (IR) thermography, and airflow tests under steady and cyclic conditions controlled by artificial ventilation system. The fabricated devices showed a stable TCR of 3278 ppm {\deg}C$^{-1}$, a linear relationship calibration curve between velocity and resistance with $R^2$=0.986 and a 54% improvement in thermal response was achieved with the free-standing structure design compared to substrate-fixed designs. This fabrication approach removes the need for photolithography, wet/dry etching, and wafer bonding, enabling faster and lower-cost production of flexible, biocompatible flow sensors. The method can be applied to other MEMS devices that require compact size, flexibility, localized thinning and free-standing structures.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first operational prototype of a high-purity Germanium (HPGe) detector developed within the framework of the European LEAPS-INNOV project. This prototype features a monolithic, multi-element sensor optimized for high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy in the hard X-ray regime. The study includes a comprehensive laboratory-based characterization of the detector's spectral and spatial performance, and an on-beam evaluation at the BM05 beamline of the ESRF synchrotron facility using monochromatic X-rays in the 20-50 keV energy range. Detailed characterization results are reported, including sensor performance metrics such as energy resolution, count rate, and spatial response uniformity.</description>

      <title>Angular emission of scintillators for nuclear fusion diagnostics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate characterization of fast-ion behavior is essential for the safe and efficient operation of nuclear fusion plasmas, as energetic particle losses can degrade plasma performance and damage reactor components. Scintillator-based detectors are widely employed to monitor fast ions; however, existing studies often assume isotropic light emission, neglecting potential angular dependencies that can compromise the determination of ion fluxes. In this work, we investigate the angular emission properties of two commercial scintillators, TG-Green and b-SiAlON, under irradiation with 3.5 MeV He++ and 1 MeV D+ beams, representative of conditions in future fusion devices such as ITER. A novel experimental setup, combining precise optical alignment, angular scanning, and rigorous calibration, was developed to measure the detection efficiency as a function of observation angle. Prior to the characterization, stability tests demonstrated negligible radiation-induced degradation under the applied fluences, and transmission losses due to optical fiber bending were found to be below 1.5%. The results reveal a pronounced angular anisotropy in scintillation emission for both materials, with intensity decreasing as the detection angle increases, well described by an empirical cosine-based model. Additionally, the normalized response shows minimal dependence on ion species or energy. These findings improve scintillator-based diagnostics, allowing more accurate measurement of fast-ion fluxes in fusion plasmas.</description>

      <title>A journey to ITACA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A unique feature of gas xenon electroluminescent time projection chambers (GXeEL TPCs) in $0\nu\beta\beta$ searches is their ability to reconstruct event topology, in particular to distinguish "single-electron" from "double-electron" tracks, the latter being the signature of a $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay near the decay endpoint $Q_{\beta\beta}$. Together with excellent energy resolution and the t$_0$ provided by primary scintillation, this topological information is key to suppressing backgrounds. Preserving EL, however, requires operating in pure xenon (with helium as the only benign additive), and in pure xenon the diffusion of drifting electrons is large. As a result, the fidelity of reconstructed tracks is limited both by diffusion and by the intrinsic blurring of EL amplification.
  We propose augmenting the detector with the ability to image not only the electron track but also the corresponding mirror ion track. Introducing trace amounts of NH$_3$ ($\sim$100 ppb) converts Xe$^+$ ions into NH$_4^+$ while leaving EL unaffected. For events in the region-of-interest, an ion sensor positioned near the cathode at the projected barycenter captures the NH$_4^+$ ions. Electrons drift rapidly to the anode, producing the standard EL image, whereas the NH$_4^+$ ions drift slowly toward the cathode. Their slow drift provides time to determine the event energy and barycenter. Laser interrogation of the sensor's molecular layer then reveals an ion-track image with sub-millimeter diffusion and no EL-induced smearing.
  The combined electron-ion imaging substantially strengthens topological discrimination, improving background rejection by about an order of magnitude and significantly extending the discovery potential of GXeEL TPCs for very long $0\nu\beta\beta$ lifetimes.</description>

      <title>Study of a small-scale gamma-ray detection system employing Compton scattering with a monolithic CeBr3 crystal and segmented photodetector array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Study of high energy cosmic events in the MeV range requires detector with high efficiency and energy resolution to be constructed. The present setup consisting of scintillator crystals CeBr3 with different thickness, each coupled with 12 x 12 segmented SiPM-based photodetector in a multichannel system represents an initial exploration of a gamma imaging system based on Compton scattering principles. A Monte Carlo simulation was conducted to evaluate the energy deposit and detection efficiency using the 137Cs gamma line. The study reveals a correlation between the relative distance between detector planes and the energy deposition efficiency, providing valuable insights into optimizing the telescope design.</description>

      <title>Pulse Shape Discrimination for Germanium Detectors using Variational Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pulse shape discrimination (PSD) is a critical component in background rejection for neutrinoless double-beta decay and dark matter searches using Broad Energy Germanium (BEGe) detectors. To date, advanced discrimination has relied on Deep Learning approaches employing e.g. Denoising Autoencoders (DAE) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). While effective, these models require tens of thousands of parameters and heavy pre-processing. In this work, we present, to the best of our knowledge, the first application of Quantum Machine Learning (QML) to real, experimental pulse waveforms from a germanium detector. We propose a quantum-classical hybrid approach using Variational Quantum Circuits (VQC) with amplitude encoding. By mapping the 1024-sample waveforms directly into a 10-qubit Hilbert space, we demonstrate that a VQC with only 302 trainable parameters achieves a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area under the curve (AUC) of 0.98 and a global accuracy of 97.1%. This result demonstrates that even in the current Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era, quantum models can match the performance of state-of-the-art classical baselines while reducing model complexity by over two orders of magnitude. Furthermore, we envision a scenario where future quantum sensors transmit quantum states directly to such processing units, exploiting the exponentially large Hilbert space in a natively quantum pipeline.</description>

      <title>The new truly cylindrical tracker for the ALICE ITS3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ALICE collaboration is preparing an upgrade of the three innermost layers of the current Inner Tracking System (ITS) during the next LHC long shutdown (LS3). The new ITS detector will use wafer-scale (up to \SI{27}{cm} in length) Monolithic Active Pixel Sensors with a \SI{65}{nm} CMOS Image Sensor process, thinned to \SI{50}{\micro m} and bent around the beam pipe. The planned upgrade will allow the use of only two sensors per tracker layer, kept in place by just two mechanical supports at the edges and two thin carbon fibre supports at the sensor border. The substitution of water cooling with air cooling will lead to an expected reduction of the material budget per-layer from $\sim$0.36\% $X_0$ of the current detector to 0.09\% $X_0$. The R\&amp;D process also led to the development of a new sensor variant with an additional low dose n-type implant to the previous detector. This improves charge collection speed, confirms a spatial resolution of about \SI{5}{\micro m}, a detection efficiency greater than 99\% and an excellent radiation tolerance. Large area prototypes proved the possibility to have an active area greater than 90\%, and a fake hit rate lower than \SI{e-6}{hits/pixel/event} without loosing detection efficiency. This proceeding will show the above innovations, with particular attention to a small area analogue test structure featuring a front-end which can be monitored via an on-chip Operational Amplifier buffer that preserves the steep signal edge (few hundreds of ps) in order to study the sensor timing performance. The characterization proved a time resolution of \SI{63}{ps} on average and \SI{50}{ps} for signal passing right under the electrode with a detection efficiency above 99\%.</description>

      <title>Commissioning of an experiment for thermodynamic and spectroscopic studies of hydrogen isotopologues at cryogenic conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To study thermodynamic properties and dynamic phase space behavior of hydrogen isotopologues (Q$_2$) at cryogenic temperatures and at high density, the Tritium Absorption InfraRed Spectroscopy 2 (T$_2$ApIR) experiment has been set up and commissioned at Tritium Laboratory Karlsruhe (TLK). In the frame of the experiment, Q$_2$ behavior in different phases, ortho/para states, temperatures (10 K - 300 K) and pressures (up to 2.5 bar a) will be investigated with optical methods, infrared and Raman spectroscopy. The facility consists of a fully tritium compatible cryostat, which includes an optical cell, ortho/para converter and windows for optical and spectroscopic studies. The cryostat can be cooled below the H$_2$ triple point by a two-stage cryocooler and contains openings in the cryogenic shielding for the optical access. The challenge of combining these scientific requirements in a design with high amounts of tritium (14 g), in a limited space, all while maintaining the TLK safety philosophy was solved by the presented design. The experiment is ready to be fully integrated into the TLK closed loop tritium infrastructure. This contribution reports a comprehensive overview of the commissioning phase of the experimental facility and the results of the first commissioning experiments, including cryogenic performance tests, commissioning experiments with non-radioactive gases, and tests of the analytical instruments.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18805v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Soft x-ray ptychography is becoming a key synchrotron microscopy technique in the fields of condensed matter physics, chemistry, and environmental and life sciences. Its attractiveness across broad disciplinary fields is owed to the favorable combination of high spatial resolution and strong contrast mechanisms. The SOft X-ray Ptychography Highly Integrated Endstation (SOPHIE) at the Swiss Light Source (SLS) was developed to accommodate soft x-ray ptychography experiments requiring high spatial resolution, in addition to high chemical and ferroic sensitivities. An introduction to soft x-ray ptychography with SOPHIE aimed at prospective users is provided. Furthermore, an overview of the instrumentation of SOPHIE is given along with an example of the imaging capabilities, which demonstrate the achievement of a sub-10 nm spatial resolution at a photon energy of 706 eV.</description>

      <title>Optimised neural networks for online processing of ATLAS calorimeter data on FPGAs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11469v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A study of neural network architectures for the reconstruction of the energy deposited in the cells of the ATLAS liquid-argon calorimeters under high pile-up conditions expected at the HL-LHC is presented. These networks are designed to run on the FPGA-based readout hardware of the calorimeters under strict size and latency constraints. Several architectures, including Dense, Recurrent (RNN), and Convolutional (CNN) neural networks, are optimised using a Bayesian procedure that balances energy resolution against network size. The optimised Dense, CNN, and combined Dense+RNN architectures achieve a transverse energy resolution of approximately 80 MeV, outperforming both the optimal filtering (OF) method currently in use and RNNs of similar complexity. A detailed comparison across the full dynamic range shows that Dense, CNN, and Dense+RNN accurately reproduce the energy scale, while OF and RNNs underestimate the energy. Deep Evidential Regression is implemented within the Dense architecture to address the need for reliable per-event energy uncertainties. This approach provides predictive uncertainty estimates with minimal increase in network size. The predicted uncertainty is found to be consistent, on average, with the difference between the true deposited energy and the predicted energy.</description>

      <title>A Capacitor Model of the Helical Deflector: Revisiting Shamaev's Proposal and the Model in the Book</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06651v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A RF helical deflector is a type of electron and ion optics device that applies a time-dependent rotating transverse electric or magnetic field by means of time-dependent RF voltage applied on two opposite conducting helical structures (wires, ribbons or other) to deflect charged particles (a single, bunch or beam) in a circular or spiral path. It is a perspective indirect timing system being concurrent for reaching picosecond time resolution, and have promise being excellent candidate for high precision time-of-flight detection. As a timing system, it converts the temporal structure of an electron beam into a spatial pattern -- particularly, an ellipse in the case of a single-frequency RF voltage and continuous electron pencil beam.
  I propose a capacitor model of a RF helical deflector and compare it with the existing model in the Book, interpret it and provide understanding of it. Furthermore, I analyze the latter, finding analytical formulas for the applied electric field, ellipse sizes (semi-axes) and rotation angle, lengths of the ellipse line, corresponding to the duration of electron pencil bunches or beams. The present article touches the topics of getting circle on resonance limit and of deflection sensitivity.</description>
