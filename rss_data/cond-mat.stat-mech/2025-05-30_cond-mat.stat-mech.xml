      <title>Non Markovian electron Brownian motion with radiation reaction force</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study non-Markovian electronic plasma diffusion from a classical point of view, taking into account the effects of the radiation reaction force. The electron Brownian motion is described by a Generalized Langevin Equation (GLE) characterized by an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck-type friction memory kernel. To take into account the effects of the radiation reaction force, an effective memory time which accounts for the thermal interaction of the Brownian particle with its surroundings is proposed. This effective memory time is defined as tauef equal tau minus tau0 less than 0, where the memory time tau accounts for the collision time between electrons in a Brownian motion-like manner, and tau0 is due to the interaction with the radiation reaction force. Under these conditions, the GLE can be transformed into a stochastic Abraham-Lorentz-like equation, which is analytically solved without violation of causality. The theoretical results will be compared with the numerical simulation.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Constraints in DRAM cells: Experimental Verification of Energy Efficiency Limits in Information Erasure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We measured the energy efficiency of information erasure using silicon DRAM cells capable of counting charges on capacitors at the single-electron level. Our measurements revealed that the efficiency decreased as the erasure error rate decreased, and notably, the Landauer limit was not achieved even under effectively infinite-time operation. By comparing the measured efficiency with the Landauer limit, we identified a thermodynamic constraint that prevents DRAM from reaching this limit: the inability to prepare the initial state in thermal equilibrium, which in turn prohibits quasi-static operations. This finding has broad implications for DRAM cells and for many electronic circuits sharing similar structures. Furthermore, it validates our experimental approach to discovering thermodynamic constraints that impose tighter, practically relevant limits, opening a new research direction in information thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH) for off-diagonal matrix elements in integrable spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate off-diagonal matrix elements of local operators in integrable spin chains, focusing on the isotropic spin-$1/2$ Heisenberg chain ($XXX$ chain). We employ state-of-the-art Algebraic Bethe Ansatz results, which allow us to efficiently compute matrix elements of operators with support up to two sites between generic energy eigenstates. We consider both matrix elements between eigenstates that are in the same thermodynamic macrostate, as well as eigenstates that belong to different macrostates. In the former case, focusing on thermal states we numerically show that matrix elements are compatible with the exponential decay as $\exp(-L |{M}^{\scriptscriptstyle{\mathcal{O}}}_{ij}|)$. The probability distribution functions of ${M}_{ij}^{\scriptscriptstyle{\mathcal{O}}}$ depend on the observable and on the macrostate, and are well described by Gumbel distributions. On the other hand, matrix elements between eigenstates in different macrostates decay faster as $\exp(-|{M'}_{ij}^{\scriptscriptstyle{\mathcal{O}}}|L^2)$, with ${M'}_{ij}^{\scriptscriptstyle \mathcal{O}}$, again, compatible with a Gumbel distribution.</description>

      <title>Higher-order Tuning of Interface Physics in Multiphase Lattice Boltzmann</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tuning the interface properties of multiphase models is of paramount importance to the final goal of achieving a one-to-one matching with nucleation and cavitation experiments. The surface tension, at the leading order, and the Tolman length, at higher order, play a crucial role in the estimation of the free-energy barrier determining the experimentally observed nucleation rates. The lattice Boltzmann method allows for a computationally efficient modelling approach of multiphase flows, however, tuning results are concerned with the surface tension and neglect the Tolman length. We present a novel perspective that leverages all the degrees of freedom hidden in the forcing stencil of the Shan-Chen multiphase model. By means of the lattice pressure tensor we determine and tune the coefficients of higher-order derivative terms related to surface tension and Tolman length at constant interface width and density ratio. We test the method by means of both hydrostatic and dynamic simulations and demonstrate the dependence of homogeneous nucleation rates on the value of the Tolman length. This work provides a new tool that can be integrated with previously existing strategies thus marking a step forwards to a high-fidelity modelling of phase-changing fluid dynamics.</description>

      <title>Diffusive noise controls early stages of genetic demixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Theoretical descriptions of the stepping-stone model, a cornerstone of spatial population genetics, have long overlooked diffusive noise arising from migration dynamics. We derive an exact fluctuating hydrodynamic description of this model from microscopic rules, which we then use to demonstrate that diffusive noise significantly alters early-time genetic demixing, which we characterize through heterozygosity, a key measure of diversity. Combining macroscopic fluctuation theory and microscopic simulations, we demonstrate that the scaling of density fluctuations in a spatial domain displays an early-time behaviour dominated by diffusive noise. Our exact results underscore the need for additional terms in existing continuum theories and highlight the necessity of including diffusive noise in models of spatially structured populations.</description>

      <title>Flow to Nishimori universality in weakly monitored quantum circuits with qubit loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In circuit-based quantum state preparation, qubit loss and coherent errors are circuit imperfections that imperil the formation of long-range entanglement beyond a certain threshold. The critical theory at the threshold is a continuous entanglement transition known to be described by a (2+0)-dimensional non-unitary conformal field theory which, for the two types of imperfections of certain circuits, is described by either percolation or Nishimori criticality, respectively. Here we study the threshold behavior when the two types of errors simultaneously occur and show that, when moving away from the Clifford-regime of projective stabilizer measurements, the percolation critical point becomes unstable and the critical theory flows to Nishimori universality. We track this critical renormalization group (RG) crossover flow by mapping out the entanglement phase diagrams, parametrized by the probability and strength of random weak measurements, of two dual protocols preparing surface code or GHZ-class cat states from a parent cluster state via constant-depth circuits. Extensive numerical simulations, using hybrid Gaussian fermion and tensor network / Monte Carlo sampling techniques on systems with more than a million qubits, demonstrate that an infinitesimal deviation from the Clifford regime leads to a sudden, strongly non-monotonic entanglement growth at the incipient non-unitary RG flow. We argue that spectra of scaling dimensions of both the percolation and Nishimori fixed points exhibit multifractality. For percolation, we provide the exact (non-quadratic) multifractal spectrum of exponents, while for the Nishimori fixed point we show high-precision numerical results for five leading exponents characterizing multifractality.</description>

      <title>Exact analysis of AC sensors based on Floquet time crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the behavior of general Floquet Time Crystals (FTCs), including prethermal ones, in closed systems acting as AC sensors. We provide an analytical treatment of their quantum Fisher information (QFI) dynamics, which characterizes the ultimate sensor accuracy. By tuning the direction and frequency of the AC field, we show how to resonantly induce transitions between macroscopic paired cat states in the FTC sensor, allowing a robust Heisenberg scaling precision (QFI $\sim N^2 t^2$) for exponentially long times in the system size. The QFI dynamics exhibit, moreover, a characteristic step-like structure in time due to the eventual dephasing along the cat subspaces. The behavior is discussed for different relevant initial preparations of the sensor, including ground states, low and high correlated states. Furthermore, we examine the performance of the sensor along the FTC phase transition, with the QFI capturing its critical exponents. We present our findings for both linear and nonlinear response regimes, and illustrate them for a specific FTC based on the long-range interacting LMG model.</description>

      <title>Langer's nucleation rate reproduced on the lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that Langer's rate of bubble nucleation is quantitatively correct up to small higher-loop corrections, in comparison to lattice simulations. These results are a significant advancement on decades of lattice studies showing only qualitative trends, and the first showing agreement for any conservative system. We confirm that the failure to fully thermalize the metastable phase explains discrepancies with recent lattice studies that found disagreement with Langer's rate. The key theoretical development is the translation of Langer's perturbative definition of a thermal metastable phase into a nonperturbative statement that can be implemented on the lattice. Our statistical and systematic errors are small enough to allow us to measure on the lattice the coefficient of the two-loop contribution, missing from the perturbative prediction. Our conclusions also exclude a possible systematic uncertainty in $^3$He experiments.</description>

      <title>Provably Efficient Quantum Thermal State Preparation via Local Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Preparing the thermal density matrix $\rho_{\beta}\propto e^{-\beta H}$ corresponding to a given Hamiltonian $H$ is a task of central interest across quantum many-body physics, and is particularly salient when attempting to study it with quantum computers. Although solved {in principle} by recent constructions of efficiently simulable Lindblad master equations -- that provably have $\rho_{\beta}$ as a steady state [C.-F. Chen {\it et al}, arXiv:2311.09207] -- their implementation requires large-scale quantum computational resources and is hence challenging {in practice} on current or even near-term quantum devices. Here, we propose a scheme for approximately preparing quantum thermal states that only requires the [repeated] implementation of three readily available ingredients: (a) analog simulation of $H$; (b) strictly local but time-dependent couplings to ancilla qubits; and (c) reset of the ancillas. We give rigorous performance guarantees independent of detailed physical knowledge of $H$ beyond its locality.</description>

      <title>Emergent universal long-range structure in random-organizing systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-organization through noisy interactions is ubiquitous across physics, mathematics, and machine learning, yet how long-range structure emerges from local noisy dynamics remains poorly understood. Here, we investigate three paradigmatic random-organizing particle systems drawn from distinct domains: models from soft matter physics (random organization, biased random organization) and machine learning (stochastic gradient descent), each characterized by distinct sources of noise. We discover universal long-range behavior across all systems, namely the suppression of long-range density fluctuations, governed solely by the noise correlation between particles. Furthermore, we establish a connection between the emergence of long-range order and the tendency of stochastic gradient descent to favor flat minima -- a phenomenon widely observed in machine learning. To rationalize these findings, we develop a fluctuating hydrodynamic theory that quantitatively captures all observations. Our study resolves long-standing questions about the microscopic origin of noise-induced hyperuniformity, uncovers striking parallels between stochastic gradient descent dynamics on particle system energy landscapes and neural network loss landscapes, and should have wide-ranging applications -- from the self-assembly of hyperuniform materials to ecological population dynamics and the design of generalizable learning algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we use optimal control to generate Discrete Time Crystals (DTC) in generic many-body quantum systems. We define appropriate cost functions, which, when optimized, result in the formation of DTCs. This hitherto unexplored method represents DTCs as an optimization problem, and allows us to find non-trivial realistic periodic control pulses and parameter regimes which result in spontaneous breaking of time-translational symmetry in quantum systems. We exemplify our approach using many-body quantum systems in the presence, as well as absence of dissipation. We also discuss possible experimental realization of the control protocol for generating DTCs.</description>

      <title>On the generic increase of entropy in isolated systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study establishes a universal mechanism for entropy production in isolated quantum systems governed by the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH). By developing a resolvent-based framework, we demonstrate that steady-state entropy generically arises from many-body interactions, independent of specific coupling details. Analytical arguments reveal that entropy generation is driven by two universal pathways: interaction-induced energy broadening and temporal coarse-graining over exponentially small energy gaps. Numerical simulations of nonintegrable Ising spin chains confirm logarithmic entropy scaling, consistent with predictions derived from ETH-governed eigenstate mixing. The derived self-consistent equations for energy shift and broadening parameters agree closely with numerical results. These results unify observational entropy concepts with von Neumann entropy dynamics, providing predictive tools for thermodynamic behavior in quantum many-body systems. Our findings resolve longstanding debates about interaction-dependent entropy scaling and offer pathways for entropy control in quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Burgers rings as topological signatures of Eshelby-like plastic events in glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Eshelby-like quadrupolar structures serve as the fundamental microscopic units for characterizing plastic instabilities in amorphous solids and play a crucial role in explaining their mechanical failure, including the formation of shear bands. However, identifying Eshelby-like plastic events in glasses remains challenging due to their inherent structural and dynamical complexity. In this work, we show that Eshelby-like structures can be precisely identified and localized using a topological invariant known as the continuous Burgers vector. By combining analytical and simulation techniques, we reveal the emergence of a topological Burgers ring around Eshelby plastic events, enabling the precise identification of their center of mass and capturing their orientation as well. This proposed method offers a clear and unambiguous framework to locate and characterize the plastic rearrangements that govern plasticity in glasses.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions in the Prisoner's Dilemma game on the Barab\'asi-Albert graph with participation cost</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the impact of the maintenance cost of social links on cooperative behavior in the Prisoner's Dilemma game on the Barab\'asi-Albert scale-free network with a pairwise stochastic imitation. We show by means of Monte Carlo simulations and pair approximation that the cooperation frequency changes abruptly from an almost full cooperation to a much smaller value when we increase the cost of maintaining links. In the critical region, the stationary distribution is bi-modal and the system oscillates between two states: the state with almost full cooperation and one with coexisting strategies. We show that the critical region shrinks with the increasing size of the population. However, the expected time the system spends in a metastable state before switching to the other one does not change as a function of the system's size, which precludes the existence of two stationary states in the thermodynamic limit of the infinite population.</description>

      <title>Dynamic signature of the thermodynamic transition in a novel mean field system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the connection between thermodynamics and dynamics in glass-forming liquids remains a central challenge in condensed matter physics. In this study, we investigate a novel model system that enables a continuous crossover from a standard three dimensional liquid to a fully connected mean field like system by introducing pseudo neighbours. These pseudo neighbours enhance the effective connectivity of the system without altering its local structure. While their presence slows down the dynamics, they influence thermodynamic properties even more significantly. In particular, the configurational entropy obtained via thermodynamic integration vanishes at a temperature much higher than the temperature where the dynamics begin to slow down, leading to a clear breakdown of the Adam Gibbs relation. To uncover a possible dynamical signature of this thermodynamic transition, we analyse bond breakage dynamics. Unlike real-real bonds, which decay similarly in both the parent Kob Andersen model and its mean field variant, real-pseudo bonds exhibit long lived, persistent behaviour with strong temperature dependence. These bonds do not fully decay over time, leading to a finite saturation value of the bond breakage correlation function. Remarkably, we show that the number of surviving pseudo bonds can be analytically estimated and correlates directly with the thermodynamic transition temperature T_K. We propose a phenomenological relation between T_K and the number of surviving pseudo-bonds, establishing a novel link between thermodynamic and dynamic observables. Our results suggest that these persistent pseudo bonds serve as a robust dynamical signature of the thermodynamic transition, and the system might have properties analogous to those of randomly bonded ultrastable glasses.</description>

      <title>Condensates, crystals, and renormalons in the Gross-Neveu model at finite density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the $O(2N)$ symmetric Gross-Neveu model at finite density in the presence of a $U(1)$ chemical potential $h$ for a generic number $a \leq N-2$ of fermion fields. By combining perturbative QFT, semiclassical large $N$, and Bethe ansatz techniques, we show that at finite $N$ two new dynamically generated scales $\Lambda_\mathrm{n}$ and $\Lambda_\mathrm{c}$ appear in the theory, governing the mass gap of neutral and charged fermions, respectively. Above a certain threshold value for $h$, $a$-fermion bound states condense and form an inhomogeneous configuration, which at infinite $N$ is a crystal spontaneously breaking translations. At large $h$, this crystal has mean $\Lambda_\mathrm{n}$ and spatial oscillations of amplitude $2\Lambda_\mathrm{c}$. The two scales also control the nonperturbative corrections to the free energy, resolving a puzzle concerning fractional-power renormalons and predicting new ones.</description>

      <title>Group Convolutional Neural Network Ground State of the Quantum Dimer Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We estimate the ground state of the square lattice Quantum Dimer Model in a $\rm{p4m}$-symmetric Group Convolutional Neural Network (GCNN) representation and show that results in agreement with exact diagonalization (ED) and quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) can be obtained with a $\mathcal{L}=2$ layer network. In systems of linear size $L=8$ with Hilbert space dimension $3.1\times 10^8$, GCNN shows fidelity as high as $0.99999$ with ED. For $12\leq L\leq 32$, we find excellent agreement with QMC estimates of energy, order parameters and correlation functions. The network is optimized by minimizing the energy estimated from a Metropolis algorithm assisted by a directed loop sampler. We analyze the quantum geometric tensor at the minima for $\mathcal{L}=1,2$ and $3$ and show that the empirical quantum dimension saturates with increasing network complexity due to Metropolis sampling constraints.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2205.07214v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the multiple definitions of the entropy production for discrete-time Markov processes in single systems and composite systems. These definitions have been studied in single systems, but less so in composite systems. With a clear distinction, we review the equivalence condition and the meaning of the multiple definitions and show that all definitions satisfy the important property for the entropy production, such as non-negativity. We also show that the inequalities between total entropy production and marginal entropy production holds for a definition but doesn't for another definition. Furthermore, we verify that fact by calculating entropy productions for Gaussian process and numerically show the result. Finally, we find appropriate use of each definition taking all results into account.</description>

      <title>The XY model with vision cone: non-reciprocal vs. reciprocal interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19297v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the behavior of the classical XY model on a two-dimensional square lattice, with interactions occurring within a vision cone of each spin. Via Monte Carlo simulations, we explore one non-reciprocal and two reciprocal implementations of these interactions. The corresponding energy involves couplings that depend non-trivially on the system's configuration, leading to both long-range and quasi-long-range ordered phases at low temperatures. Our results demonstrate that non-reciprocity is not essential for achieving long-range order at low temperatures. Using symmetry arguments, we provide a theoretical framework to explain these findings, and additionally we uncover an unexpected order-by-disorder transition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14456v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate how varying two microscopic parameters - cell volume and the ratio between repulsion and attraction intensities - affect the phase behavior of a cell model with a Curie-Weiss-type interaction. The analysis is based on an exact solution previously derived for this model in the grand canonical ensemble. At sufficiently low temperatures, the cell model exhibits multiple first-order phase transitions. By varying the cell volume and the repulsion-to-attraction ratio, we represent a quantitative comparison of the chemical potential and pressure isotherms, along with the pressure-temperature and temperature-density phase diagrams. Our results demonstrate that altering these microscopic parameters induces quantitative changes in the phase diagrams of the cell model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22166v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate bond percolation on the Song-Havlin-Makse (SHM) network, a scale-free tree with a tunable degree exponent and dimensionality. Using a generating function approach, we analytically derive the average size and the fractal exponent of the root cluster for deterministic cases. Our analysis reveals that bond percolation on the SHM network remains in a nonpercolating phase for all $p &lt; 1$ when the network is fractal (i.e., finite-dimensional), whereas it exhibits a critical phase, where the cluster size distribution follows a power-law with a $p$-dependent exponent, throughout the entire range of $p$ when the network is small-world (i.e., infinite-dimensional), regardless of the specific dimensionality or degree exponent. The analytical results are in excellent agreement with Monte Carlo simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.00049v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) has been highly influential in explaining thermodynamic behavior of closed quantum systems. As of yet, it is unclear whether and how the ETH applies to non-Hermitian systems. Here, we introduce a framework that extends the ETH to non-Hermitian systems, within which expectation values of local operators reproduce statistical and scaling predictions known from Hermitian ETH. We illustrate the validity of the framework on non-Hermitian random-matrix and Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev models. Further, we show numerically how the static ETH predictions become imprinted onto the dynamics of local observables. Finally, we present a prescription for observing both ETH-obeying and ETH-violating regimes in an optical-lattice experiment that implements a disordered interacting Hatano-Nelson model. Our results generalize the celebrated ETH to the non-Hermitian setting, and they show how it affects the system dynamics, and how the salient signatures can be observed in present-day cold-atom experiments.</description>

      <title>Optimal Protocols for Continual Learning via Statistical Physics and Control Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18061v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Artificial neural networks often struggle with catastrophic forgetting when learning multiple tasks sequentially, as training on new tasks degrades the performance on previously learned tasks. Recent theoretical work has addressed this issue by analysing learning curves in synthetic frameworks under predefined training protocols. However, these protocols relied on heuristics and lacked a solid theoretical foundation assessing their optimality. In this paper, we fill this gap by combining exact equations for training dynamics, derived using statistical physics techniques, with optimal control methods. We apply this approach to teacher-student models for continual learning and multi-task problems, obtaining a theory for task-selection protocols maximising performance while minimising forgetting. Our theoretical analysis offers non-trivial yet interpretable strategies for mitigating catastrophic forgetting, shedding light on how optimal learning protocols modulate established effects, such as the influence of task similarity on forgetting. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings with experiments on real-world data.</description>

      <title>A gradient flow perspective on McKean-Vlasov equations in econophysics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05696v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the Gini coefficient of economic inequality is a Lyapunov functional for a class of nonlinear, nonlocal integro-differential equations arising at the intersection of mathematics, economics, and statistical physics. Next, a novel Riemannian geometry is imposed on a subset of probability densities such that the evolutionary dynamics are formally driven by the Gini coefficient functional as a gradient flow. Thus in the same way that classical 2-Wasserstein theory connects heat flow and the Second Law of Thermodynamics by way of Boltzmann entropy, the work here gives rise to a principle of econophysics that is much of the same flavor but for the Gini coefficient.
  The noncanonical Onsager operators associated to the metric tensors are derived and some transport inequalities proven. The new metric relates to the dual norm of a second-order Sobolev-like factor space, in a similar way to how the classical 2-Wasserstein metric linearizes as the dual norm of a first-order, homogeneous Sobolev space.</description>

      <title>The fundamental localization phases in quasiperiodic systems: A unified framework and exact results</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24380v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The disordered quantum systems host three types of quantum states, the extended, localized, and critical, which bring up seven distinct fundamental phases in nature: three pure phases and four coexisting ones with mobility edges, yet a unified theory with full characterization and realization of all these phases has not been developed. Here we propose a complete and unified framework based on a spinful quasiperiodic (QP) system which realizes all the fundamental localization phases, with the exact and universal results being obtained for their characterization. First, we show that the pure phases are obtained when the chiral symmetry preserves in the proposed spinful QP model, giving a criterion for the emergence of the pure phases and otherwise the coexisting ones. Further, we uncover a novel universal mechanism for the critical states that their emergence is protected by the generalized incommensurate matrix element zeros in the spinful QP model, which considerably broadens the rigorous realizations of the exotic critical states. We then show the criteria of exact solvability for the present spinful QP system, with which we construct various exactly solvable models for all distinct localization phases. In particular, we propose two novel models, dubbed spin-selective QP lattice model and QP optical Raman lattice model, to achieve all basic types of mobility edges and all the seven fundamental phases of Anderson localization physics, respectively. The experimental scheme is proposed and studied in detail to realize these models with high feasibility. This study establishes a complete and profound theoretical framework which enables an in-depth exploration of the broad classes of all fundamental localization phenomena in QP systems, and offers key insights for constructing their exactly solvable models with experimental feasibility.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07655v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We employ the Fuzzy Sphere regulator to study the 3D Lee-Yang CFT. The model is defined by deforming the Ising model on the Fuzzy Sphere via a purely imaginary longitudinal magnetic field. This model undergoes a quantum phase transition, whose critical point we determine and identify with the 3D Lee-Yang CFT. We show how to tune the model and find that the lowest-lying states of the Hamiltonian align well with the expected CFT spectrum. We discuss the Fuzzy Sphere estimates for the scaling dimension $\Delta_\phi$ of the lowest primary operator. Finally, we interpret small deviations from the CFT expectations in terms of the leading irrelevant operators of the Lee-Yang CFT. We show that the Fuzzy Sphere calculations are compatible with the best five-loop $\epsilon$-expansion estimates.</description>

      <title>Learned Free-Energy Functionals from Pair-Correlation Matching for Dynamical Density Functional Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09543v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Classical density functional theory (cDFT) and dynamical density functional theory (DDFT) are modern statistical mechanical theories for modeling many-body colloidal systems at the one-body density level. The theories hinge on knowing the excess free-energy accurately, which is however not feasible for most practical applications. Dijkman et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 056103 (2025)] recently showed how a neural excess free-energy functional for cDFT can be learned from bulk simulations via pair-correlation matching. In this article, we demonstrate how this same functional can be applied to DDFT, without any retraining, to simulate non-equilibrium overdamped dynamics of inhomogeneous densities. We evaluate this on a 3D Lennard-Jones system with planar geometry under various complex external potentials and observe good agreement of the dynamical densities with those from expensive Brownian dynamic simulations, up to the limit of the adiabatic approximation. We further develop and apply an extension of DDFT based on gradient flows, to a grand-canonical system modeled after breakthrough gas adsorption studies, finding similarly good agreement. Our results demonstrate a practical route for leveraging learned free-energy functionals in DDFT, paving the way for accurate and efficient modeling of many-body non-equilibrium systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19998v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Urban-induced changes in local microclimate, such as the urban heat island effect and air pollution, are known to vary with city size, leading to distinctive relations between average climate variables and city-scale quantities (e.g., total population or area). However, these approaches suffer from biases related to the choice of city boundaries and they neglect intra-urban variations of urban characteristics. Here we use high-resolution data of urban temperatures, air quality, population counts, and street intersections from 142 cities worldwide and show that their marginal and joint probability distributions follow universal scaling functions. By using a logarithmic relation between urban spatial features and climate variables, we show that average street network properties are sufficient to characterize the entire variability of the temperature and air pollution fields observed within and across cities. We further demonstrate that traditional models linking climate variables to the distance from the city center fail to reproduce the observed distributions unless the stochasticity of urban structure is fully considered. These findings provide a unified statistical framework for characterizing intra-urban climate variability, with important implications for climate modelling and urban planning.</description>

      <title>On the performance of machine-learning-assisted Monte Carlo in sampling from simple statistical physics models</title>

Abstract: Recent years have seen a rise in the application of machine learning techniques to aid the simulation of hard-to-sample systems that cannot be studied using traditional methods. Despite the introduction of many different architectures and procedures, a wide theoretical understanding is still lacking, with the risk of suboptimal implementations. As a first step to address this gap, we provide here a complete analytic study of the widely-used Sequential Tempering procedure applied to a shallow MADE architecture for the Curie-Weiss model. The contribution of this work is twofold: firstly, we give a description of the optimal weights and of the training under Gradient Descent optimization. Secondly, we compare what happens in Sequential Tempering with and without the addition of local Metropolis Monte Carlo steps. We are thus able to give theoretical predictions on the best procedure to apply in this case. This work establishes a clear theoretical basis for the integration of machine learning techniques into Monte Carlo sampling and optimization.</description>
