      <title>Use of Topological Data Analysis for the Detection of Phenomenological Bifurcations in Stochastic Epidemiological Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate predictions of stochastic compartmental models on the severity of disease outbreaks. The models we consider are the Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) for bacterial infections, and the Susceptible -Infected-Removed (SIR) for airborne diseases. Stochasticity enters the compartmental models as random fluctuations of the contact rate, to account for uncertainties in the disease spread. We consider three types of noise to model the random fluctuations: the Gaussian white and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noises, and the logarithmic Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (logOU). The advantages of logOU noise are its positivity and its ability to model the presence of superspreaders. We utilize homological bifurcation plots from Topological Data Analysis to automatically determine the shape of the long-time distributions of the number of infected for the SIS, and removed for the SIR model, over a range of basic reproduction numbers and relative noise intensities. LogOU noise results in distributions that stay close to the endemic deterministic equilibrium even for high noise intensities. For low reproduction rates and increasing intensity, the distribution peak shifts towards zero, that is, disease eradication, for all three noises; for logOU noise the shift is the slowest. Our study underlines the sensitivity of model predictions to the type of noise considered in contact rate.</description>

      <title>Synaptic Spine Head Morphodynamics from Graph Grammar Rules for Actin Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is a morphodynamic component to synaptic learning by which changes in dendritic spine head size are associated with the strengthening or weakening of the synaptic connection between two neurons, in response to the temporal correlation of local presynaptic and postsynaptic signals. Morphological factors are in turn sculpted by the dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton. We use Dynamical Graph Grammars (DGGs) implemented within a computer algebra system to model how networks of actin filaments can dynamically grow or shrink, reshaping the spine head. DGGs provide a well-defined way to accommodate dynamically changing system structure such as active cytoskeleton represented using dynamic graphs, within nonequilibrium statistical physics under the master equation. We show that DGGs can also incorporate biophysical forces between graph-connected objects at a finer time scale, with specialized DGG kinetic rules obeying biophysical constraints of Galilean invariance, conservation of momentum, and dissipation of conserved global energy. We use graph-local energy functions for cytoskeleton networks interacting with membranes, and derive DGG rules from the specialization of dissipative stochastic dynamics to a mutually exclusive and exhaustive collection of graph-local neighborhood types for the rule left hand sides. Dissipative rules comprise a stochastic version of gradient descent dynamics. Thermal noise rules use a Gaussian approximation of each position coordinate to sample jitter-like displacements. We designed and implemented DGG grammar sub-models including actin network growth, non-equilibrium statistical mechanics, and filament-membrane mechanical interaction to regulate the re-writing of graph objects. From a biological perspective, we observe regulatory effects of three actin-binding proteins on the membrane size and find evidence supporting mechanisms of membrane growth.</description>

      <title>Adaptive modelling of anti-tau treatments for neurodegenerative disorders based on the Bayesian approach with physics-informed neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-beta (A$\beta$) and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) proteins, leading to cognitive decline measured by the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS) score. In this study, we develop and analyze a system of ordinary differential equation models to describe the interactions between A$\beta$, p-tau, and ADAS score, providing a mechanistic understanding of disease progression. To ensure accurate model calibration, we employ Bayesian inference and Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for parameter estimation based on Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative data. The data-driven Bayesian approach enables uncertainty quantification, improving confidence in model predictions, while the PINN framework leverages neural networks to capture complex dynamics directly from data. Furthermore, we implement an optimal control strategy to assess the efficacy of an anti-tau therapeutic intervention aimed at reducing p-tau levels and mitigating cognitive decline. Our data-driven solutions indicate that while optimal drug administration effectively decreases p-tau concentration, its impact on cognitive decline, as reflected in the ADAS score, remains limited. These findings suggest that targeting p-tau alone may not be sufficient for significant cognitive improvement, highlighting the need for multi-target therapeutic strategies. The integration of mechanistic modelling, advanced parameter estimation, and control-based therapeutic optimization provides a comprehensive framework for improving treatment strategies for AD.</description>

      <title>Assessing the Spatial and Temporal Risk of HPAIV Transmission to Danish Cattle via Wild Birds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12432v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) panzootic has severely impacted wild bird populations worldwide, with documented (zoonotic) transmission to mammals, including humans. Ongoing HPAI outbreaks on U.S. cattle farms have raised concerns about potential spillover of virus from birds to cattle in other countries, including Denmark. In the EU, the Bird Flu Radar tool, coordinated by EFSA, monitors the spatio-temporal risk of HPAIV infection in wild bird populations. A preparedness tool to assess the spillover risk to the cattle industry is currently lacking, despite its critical importance. This study aims to assess the temporal and spatial risk of HPAI virus (HPAIV) spillover from wild birds, particularly waterfowl, into cattle populations in Denmark. To support this assessment, a spillover transmission model is developed by integrating two well-established surveillance tools, eBird and Bird Flu Radar, in combination with global cattle density data. The generated quantitative risk maps reveal the heterogeneous temporal and spatial distribution of HPAIV spillover risk from wild birds to cattle across Denmark. The highest risk periods are observed during calendar weeks 50 to 10. The estimated total number of spillover cases nationwide is 1.93 (95% CI: 0.48, 4.98) in 2024, and 0.62 cases (95% CI: 0.15, 1.25) in 2025 (up to April). These risk estimates provide valuable insights to support veterinary contingency planning and enable targeted allocation of resources in highrisk areas for the early detection of HPAIV in cattle.</description>
