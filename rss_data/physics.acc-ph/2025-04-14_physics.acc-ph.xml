      <title>Production and manipulation of stable frozen hydrogen filaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Frozen hydrogen filaments or droplets/pellets in vacuum are of great interest as target for many experiments at hadron and lepton accelerators as well as at high-power laser systems. Especially in case of large distances between the position of target beam generation and the interaction point with an accelerator or laser beam, a high target beam stability in space and time is crucial. Here we present recent results on the long-term stability of frozen hydrogen filaments in vacuum, which have been obtained using a new cryogenic target generator. It could be shown that the trajectory of the frozen hydrogen target beam with a diameter of $10\,\mathrm{\mu m}$ remains stable for over 60 hours, with angular fluctuations below $0.08\,^\circ$. Furthermore, we present a novel strategy for the manipulation of the target beam, named cryobending. Here, the produced hydrogen filament is deflected by helium gas emerging from correction nozzles. We demonstrate the deflection of the hydrogen beam with one and two nozzles, achieving deflection angles up to $(15.7\pm 0.4)\,^\circ$. The presented results open the door for further developments of this beam position system, which enables target beam adjustment without any mechanical movement of the target components itself. Potential applications of these stable hydrogen target filaments are, e.g., the upcoming MAGIX (MAinz Gas Injection target eXperiment) or the planned $\mathrm{\bar{P}ANDA}$ (anti-Proton ANnihilation at DArmstadt) experiment.</description>

      <title>Longitudinal tapering in meter-scale gas jets for increased efficiency of laser plasma accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17028</link>

Abstract: Modern laser plasma accelerators (LPAs) often require plasma waveguides tens of cm long to propagate a high-intensity drive laser pulse. Tapering the longitudinal gas density profile in 10 cm scale gas jets could allow for single stage laser plasma acceleration well beyond 10 GeV with current petawatt-class laser systems. Via simulation and interferometry measurements, we show density control by longitudinally adjusting the throat width and jet angle. Density profiles appropriate for tapering were calculated analytically and via particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations, and were matched experimentally. These simulations show that tapering can increase electron beam energy using 19 J laser energy from ~9 GeV to &gt;12 GeV in a 30 cm plasma, and the accelerated charge by an order of magnitude.

      <title>High-Power Test of a C-band Linear Accelerating Structure with an RFSoC-based LLRF System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10507v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Normal conducting linear particle accelerators consist of multiple rf stations with accelerating structure cavities. Low-level rf (LLRF) systems are employed to set the phase and amplitude of the field in the accelerating structure, and to compensate the pulse-to-pulse fluctuation of the rf field in the accelerating structures with a feedback loop. The LLRF systems are typically implemented with analogue rf mixers, heterodyne based architectures and discrete data converters. There are multiple rf signals from each of rf station, so the number of rf channels required increases rapidly with multiple rf stations. With many rf channels, the footprint, component cost and system complexity of the LLRF hardware increase significantly. To meet the design goals to be compact and affordable for future accelerators, we have designed the next generation LLRF (NG-LLRF) with higher integration level based on RFSoC technology. The NG-LLRF system samples rf signals directly and performs the rf mixing digitally. The NG-LLRF has been characterized in a loopback mode to evaluate the performance of the system and tested with a standing-wave accelerating structure, a prototype for the Cool Copper Collider (C3) with peak rf power up to 16.45 MW. The loopback test demonstrated amplitude fluctuation below 0.15% and phase fluctuation below 0.15 degree, which are considerably better than the requirements of C3. The rf signals from the different stages of accelerating structure at different power levels are measured by the NG-LLRF, which will be critical references for the control algorithm designs. The NG-LLRF also offers flexibility in waveform modulation, so we have used rf pulses with various modulation schemes which could be useful for controlling some of rf stations in accelerators. In this paper, the high-power test results at different stages of the test setup will be summarized, analyzed and discussed.</description>
