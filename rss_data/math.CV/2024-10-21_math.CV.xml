      <title>Hyperbolic distortion and conformality at the boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize two classical types of conformality of a holomorphic self-map of the unit disk at a boundary point - existence of a finite angular derivative in the sense of Carath\'eodory and the weaker property of angle preservation - in terms of the non-tangential asymptotic behaviour of the hyperbolic distortion of the map. These characterizations are given purely with reference to the intrinsic metric geometry of the unit disk. In particular, we relate the classical Julia-Wolff-Carath\'eodory theorem with the case of equality in the Schwarz-Pick lemma at the boundary. We also provide an operator-theoretic characterization of the existence of a finite angular derivative based on Hilbert space methods. As an application we study the backward dynamics of discrete dynamical systems induced by holomorphic self-maps, and characterize the regularity of the associated pre-models in terms of a Blaschke-type condition involving the hyperbolic distortion along regular backward orbits.</description>

      <title>Maximal cusps are not dense</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We proved that the Maximal cusp is not dense on the Bers boundary of the Teichm\"uller space of infinite type Riemann surfaces satisfying some analytic conditions. This is a counterexample to the infinite-type case of the McMullen result for finite-type Riemann surfaces. More precisely, we showed that maximal cusps cannot approach the points on the Bers boundary corresponding to the deformation by the David map, which can be regarded as a degenerate quasiconformal map in the neighborhood of one end. In addition, to prove this, we used quasiconformal deformations in the neighborhood of a fixed end. We then proved that such a subset of the Teichm\"uller space has a manifold structure.</description>

      <title>Conformal weldings in the Loewner equation and Weil--Petersson quasislit-disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A simple arc $\Gamma = \gamma(0, T]$, growing into the unit disk $\mathbb D$ from its boundary, generates a driving term $\xi$ and a conformal welding $\phi$ through the Loewner differential equation. When $\Gamma$ is the slit of a Weil--Petersson quasislit-disk $\mathbb D\setminus\Gamma$, the Loewner transform and its inverse $\Gamma \leftrightarrow \xi$ have been well understood due to Y. Wang's work. We investigate the maps $\Gamma \leftrightarrow \phi$ in this case, giving a description of $\Gamma$ in terms of $\phi$.</description>

      <title>Exponential sums equations and the Exponential Closedness conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12860v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This is an expository paper aiming to introduce Zilber's Exponential Closedness conjecture to a general audience. Exponential Closedness predicts when (systems of) equations involving addition, multiplication, and exponentiation have solutions in the complex numbers. It is a natural statement at the boundary between complex geometry and algebraic geometry. While it is open in full generality, many special cases and variants have been proven in the last two decades.
  In the first part of the paper we give a proof of a special case of the conjecture, namely, we show that exponential sums in a single complex variable, such as $e^{\sqrt{2}z}+3i e^{5z}+\pi$, always have infinitely many zeroes. This follows from well-known results in the literature and can actually be proven by standard complex analytic tools. We present a proof, motivated by the ideas of Zilber and Gallinaro, which uses simplified versions of some ingredients of more advanced techniques in the area, thus allowing the reader to explore these advanced proofs on a simple example. Our approach uses only elementary techniques (from standard undergraduate algebra and complex analysis), and the proofs of some of the main ingredients appear to be new. Moreover, these ingredients come from various areas of mathematics, such as functional transcendence and complex geometry, and are a useful way of introducing some classical concepts in these areas to the reader.
  In the second part we explain the Exponential Closedness conjecture and discuss some known special cases, not least the so-called ``raising to powers'' case (due to Gallinaro) which generalises the above-mentioned result and whose proof uses advanced versions of the tools presented in the first part of the paper.</description>
