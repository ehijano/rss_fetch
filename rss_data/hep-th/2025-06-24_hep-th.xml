      <title>The Bootstrap of Points and Lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study two-dimensional conformal field theories (CFTs) with boundaries via the conformal bootstrap. We derive a positive semi-definite program from crossing symmetry of three observables: the annulus partition function, the two-point function of identical operators in the presence of a boundary, and the four-point function of the same operators on the infinite plane. The mixed-correlator system allows the numerical bootstrap to access new data, like the bulk-to-boundary Operator Product Expansion coefficients, and to strengthen the bounds on observables already contained in the partition function on the annulus, such as the boundary entropy. We test the method on the free boson CFT; then, as a first application, we produce new non-perturbative bounds on the entropy and the gaps in boundary CFTs with central charge $c=3/2,$ with special emphasis on the $\mathfrak{su}(2)_2$ WZW model.</description>

      <title>Schur Connections: Chord Counting, Line Operators, and Indices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, an intriguing correspondence was conjectured in arXiv:2409.11551 between Schur half-indices of pure 4d $SU(2)$ $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills (SYM) theory with line operator insertions and partition functions of the double scaling limit of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model (DSSYK). Motivated by this, we explore a generalization to $SU(N)$ $\mathcal{N}=2$ SYM theories. We begin by deriving the algebra of line operators, $\mathcal{A}_{\text{Schur}}$, representing it both in terms of the $\mathfrak{q}$-Weyl algebra and $\mathfrak{q}$-deformed harmonic oscillators, respectively. In the latter framework, the half-index admits a natural description as an expectation value in the Fock space of the oscillators. This $\mathfrak{q}$-oscillator perspective further suggests an interpretation in terms of generalized colored chord counting, and maps the half-index to a purely combinatorial quantity. Finally, we establish a connection with the quantum Toda chain, which is an integrable model whose commuting Hamiltonians can be identified with the Wilson lines of the $SU(N)$ SYM, and their eigenfunctions correspond to the function basis appearing in the half-index.</description>

      <title>Light and Shadow OPEs: A Carroll Symmetric Approach to Flat Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we fix the leading term in the operator algebra of light-transformed operators in the context of flat space holography. Starting with light-transformed graviton correlators, we show that the OPE obtained by taking the collinear limit satisfies translation symmetry at the leading order not independently but with assistance from the sub-leading order. Motivated by this result, we start with a general CFT-like ansatz for the OPE and, by keeping track of the sub-leading term, derive an expression for the scaling dimension of the operator appearing in the leading term. We further show that we can fix the OPE coefficient corresponding to this term as well. We use this result to find the OPE for well-studied theories like gravity, Yang-Mills and Einstein-Yang-Mills theory, and find that the scaling dimension found from our formula matches with the one obtained by looking at the collinear limit of bulk momentum space vertices. We initiate a similar study for operators in the shadow basis by looking at the OPE of shadow-transformed graviton correlators.</description>

      <title>Localized Towers on the Composite Magnetic Monopole and the Weak Gravity Conjecture$=$Distance Conjecture Connection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the energy spectrum of the composite magnetic monopole (CMM) in the model originally constructed in arXiv:1608.06951 to examine the validity of the weak gravity conjecture within the effective field theory (EFT) framework. This is motivated by the weak gravity conjecture$=$distance conjecture connection suggested in the literature. Assuming that the limits of the model parameters correspond to the boundaries of the moduli space in a UV theory, we showed that the parameter dependence of the energy spectrum of the composite monopole is in accord with the prediction of the weak gravity conjecture$=$distance conjecture connection. However, unlike the original distance conjecture, the low-energy excitations of the CMM are localized on the CMM. This led us to propose an extension of the distance conjecture to include the localized tower of excited states. We discuss the implications of this extension of the distance conjecture to the swampland constraints on EFTs.</description>

      <title>New superparticle models in AdS superspaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, new superparticle models have been proposed in the $\mathcal{N}$-extended four and five-dimensional anti-de Sitter (AdS) superspaces, AdS$^{4|4\mathcal{N}}$ and AdS$^{5|8\mathcal{N}}$, making use of a unique quadratic deformation to the AdS supersymmetric interval. In this paper we extend these considerations to the three and two-dimensional cases, and propose new two-derivative models for superparticles propagating in these AdS superspaces.</description>

      <title>String Integrability on the Coulomb Branch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Coulomb branch of the N = 4 super-Yang-Mills theory is described by a D3-brane in the bulk of AdS_5 x S^5. We show that boundary conditions on this D3-brane preserve integrability of the AdS string. For that matter we construct dynamical and spectral parameter dependent reflection matrix that encodes an infinite number of conserved charges on the worldsheet of an open string ending on the D-brane.</description>

      <title>DSSYK at Infinite Temperature: The Flat-Space Limit and the 't Hooft Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the limit of infinite radius de Sitter space becomes locally flat and the static patch tends to Rindler space. A holographic description of the static patch must result in a holographic description of some flat space theory, expressed in Rindler coordinates. Given such a holographic theory how does one decode the hologram and determine the bulk flat space theory, its particle spectrum, forces, and bulk quantum fields? In this paper we will answer this question for a particular case: DSSYK at infinite temperature and show that the bulk theory is a strongly coupled version of the 't Hooft model, i.e., (1+1)-dimensional QCD, with a single quark flavor. It may also be thought of as an open string theory with mesons lying on a single Regge trajectory.</description>

      <title>On the completeness of contraction map proof method for holographic entropy inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The contraction map proof method is the commonly used method to prove holographic entropy inequalities. Existence of a contraction map corresponding to a holographic entropy inequality is a sufficient condition for its validity. But is it also necessary? In this note, we answer that question in affirmative for all linear holographic entropy inequalities with rational coefficients. We show that, generically, the pre-image of a non-contraction map is not a hypercube, but a proper cubical subgraph, and show that this manifests as alterations to the geodesic structure in the bulk, which leads to the violation of inequalities by holographic geometries obeying the RT formula.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetric Horizons at the Edge of Effective Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: What if supersymmetry is not something to be hidden, but something to be reached? We introduce the Supersymmetric Horizon Stabilization (SHS): a conceptually unified and analytically controlled framework for embedding metastable de Sitter vacua and trans-Planckian inflation within effective $\mathcal{N}=1$ supergravity. Built from a logarithmic K\"ahler potential modified by nilpotent constraints, SHS yields a framework that connects the early universe's inflationary phase, intermediate metastable acceleration, and a final supersymmetric fixed point.
  We classify all viable models by imposing four essential criteria: absence of ghosts, de Sitter metastability, smooth Minkowski transitions, and asymptotic supersymmetry. The resulting scalar dynamics exhibit exponential field-space profiles, $\tau(\varphi) \sim e^{-\Delta\varphi}$, reconciling trans-Planckian excursions with bounded moduli. This structure ensures finite geodesic distance, stabilizes the gravitino mass, and suppresses light towers -- evading both the Gravitino and Swampland Distance Conjectures. Meanwhile, the divergent Euclidean cost of reaching the supersymmetric endpoint realizes the AdS and Generalized Swampland Distance Conjectures, confirming that the infrared boundary lies at infinite dynamical distance despite controlled scalar evolution.
  From this behavior emerges the Supersymmetric Horizon Conjecture: that consistent gravitational EFTs may begin and end with supersymmetry -- both at the origin and the asymptotic edge of cosmic evolution -- not as a fine-tuned remnant, but as a geometric boundary condition. SHS also supports localized features that transiently enhance scalar fluctuations, enabling efficient production of primordial black holes with masses far exceeding those in conventional inflationary scenarios.</description>

      <title>Numerical simulation of the false vacuum decay at finite temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The false vacuum decay rate is of important meaning in understanding the Universe, such as the symmetry breaking process in the early universe and the age of our universe, which is conventionally calculated with the saddle-point approximation in the field theory. Utilizing the extension of the Wigner function in quantum field theory, we numerically calculate the decay rate of the false vacuum through path integral. We study the decay rate for the thermal fluctuation scenarios and its dependence on the potential shape, and found that the false vacuum decay occurs following an exponentially decay rate, and the speed of vacuum decay decreases when the initial energy of the system decreases and the potential height increase. The discrepancy between the simulation results and the theoretical prediction of finite temperature effective field theory is observed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the monodromy group of the differential systems for multiloop integrals. We describe a simple heuristic method to obtain the monodromy matrices as functions of space-time dimension $d$. We observe that in a special basis the elements of these matrices are Laurent polynomials in $z=\exp(i\pi d)$ with integer coefficients, i.e., the monodromy group is a subgroup of $GL(n,\mathbb{Z}[z,1/z])$. We derive bilinear relations for monodromies in $d$ and $-d$ dimensions which follow from the twisted Riemann bilinear relations and check that the found monodromy matrices satisfy them.</description>

      <title>Spin Chain Integrability as a Supersymmetric Gauge Duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a novel correspondence between 4D $\mathcal N=1$ supersymmetric gauge theories on $D^2\times T^2$ and open XYZ spin chains with generalized boundary conditions, extending beyond previous 3D Bethe/gauge duality frameworks. Our primary contribution is the rigorous construction of the first exact duality between 4D BCD-type gauge theories and general-boundary XYZ spin chains governed by elliptic $R$-matrices. This framework provides a universal mechanism for resolving supersymmetric gauge theory/spin-chain duality across dimensional hierarchies: 2D $\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ $\longleftrightarrow$ XXX spin chain, 3D $\mathcal{N}=2$ $\longleftrightarrow$ XXZ spin chain, 4D $\mathcal{N}=1$ $\longleftrightarrow$ XYZ spin chain, mediated through the $\Omega$-deformation parameter $\epsilon$.</description>

      <title>Conformal and pure scale-invariant gravities in d dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider conformal and scale-invariant gravities in d dimensions, with a special focus on pure $R^2$ gravity in the scale-invariant case. In four dimensions, the structure of these theories is well known. However, in dimensions larger than four, the behavior of the modes is so far unclear. In this work, we explore this question, studying the theories in conformally flat spacetimes as well as anisotropic backgrounds. First, we consider the pure theory in d-dimensions. We show that this theory propagates no degrees of freedom for flat space-time. Otherwise, we find the theory in the corresponding Einstein frame and show that it propagates a scalar field and two tensor modes, that arise from Einstein's gravity. We then consider conformal gravity in d dimensions. We argue on the number of degrees of freedom for conformally flat space-times and show that for $d&gt;4$, there exists a frame in which this theory can be written as the Weyl-squared gravity with a cosmological constant, and also generalize this formulation to the $f\left(W^2\right)$ theories. Then, we consider the specific model of conformal gravity in five dimensions. We find the analytical and numerical solutions for the anisotropic Universe for this case, which admits super-Hubble and exponential expansions. Finally, we consider the perturbations around these solutions and study the number of the degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Gauged permutation invariant tensor quantum mechanics, least common multiples and the inclusion-exclusion principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the canonical ensemble partition functions for gauged permutation invariant tensor quantum harmonic oscillator thermodynamics, finding surprisingly simple expressions with number-theoretic characteristics. These systems have a gauged symmetry of $S_N$, the symmetric group of all permutations of a set of $N$ objects. The symmetric group acts on tensor variables $ \Phi_{ i_1, \cdots , i_s } $, where the $s$ indices each range over $ \{ 1, 2, \cdots , N \} $ and have the standard $S_N$ action of permutations. The result is a sum over partitions of $N$ and the summand is a product admitting simple expressions, which depend on the least common multiples (LCMs) of subsets of the parts of the partition. The inclusion-exclusion principle of combinatorics plays a central role in the derivation of these expressions. The behaviour of these partition functions under inversion of the Boltzmann factor $ x = e^{ - \beta } $ is governed by universal sequences associated with invariants of symmetric groups and alternating groups. The partition functions allow the development of a high temperature expansion analogous to the $s=2$ matrix case. The calculation of an $s$-dependent breakdown point leads to a critical Boltzmann factor $ x_c = { \log N \over sN^{ s-1}}$ as the leading large $N$ approximation.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions in a holographic superfluid model with non-linear terms beyond the probe limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the holographic s-wave superfluid model with 4th and 6th power self-interaction terms $\lambda |\psi|^4$ and $\tau |\psi|^6$ with considering the full back-reaction of the matter fields on the metric in the 3+1 dimensional bulk. The self-interaction terms are good at controlling the condensate to realize various phase transitions, such as the zeroth-order, first-order, and second-order phase transitions within the single condensate s-wave superfluid model. Therefore, in this work, we are able to investigate the influence of the back-reaction strength on the various phase transitions, including the zeroth and first order phase transitions. In addition, we confirm that the influence of the 4th and 6th power terms on the superfluid phase transition in the case of finite back-reaction are qualitative the same as in the probe limit, thus present universality. We also plot the special value $\lambda_s$ of the parameter $\lambda$ at different back-reaction strength, below which the condensate grows to an opposite direction and is important in controlling the order of the superfluid phase transitions. Comparing the influence of the back-reaction parameter and that of the higher-order nonlinear coefficients, we see that the back-reaction strength brings in both the effective couplings similar to the 4th power and 6th power terms.</description>

Abstract: Rovelli's relational interpretation of quantum mechanics tells us that the description of a system in the formalism of quantum mechanics is not an absolute, but it is relative to the observer itself. The interpretation goes further and proposes a set of axioms. In standard non relational language, one of them states that an observer can only retrieve finite amount information from a system by means of measurement. Our contribution starts with the observation that quantum mechanics, i.e. quantum field theory (QFT) in dimension 1, radically differs from QFT in higher dimensions. In higher dimensions boundary data (or initial data) cannot be specified by means of finitely many measurements. This calls for a notion of measuring scale, which we provide. At a given measuring scale the observer has partial information about the system. Our notion of measuring scale generalizes the one implicitly used in Wilsonian QFT, where at each measuring scale there are effective theories, which may be corrected, and if the theory turns out to be renormalizable the mentioned corrections converge to determine a completely corrected (or renormalized) theory at the given measuring scale. The notion of a measuring scale is the cornerstone of Wilsonian QFT. This notion tells us that we are not describing a system from an absolute perspective. An effective theory at that scale describes the system with respect to the observer, which may retrieve information from the system by means of measurement in a specific way determined by our notion of measuring scale. We claim that a relational interpretation of quantum physics for spacetimes of dimension greater than 1 is Wilsonian.</description>

      <title>Causality of polarizeable dissipative fluids from Lagrangian hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a causality analysis on the dispersion relation of hydrodynamics with spin well as shear and bulk viscosity, including the relaxation times for all these quantities. We find that the interplay of the three relaxational scales, for shear and bulk viscosity as well as polarization, leads to non-trivial effects on the dispersion relation. Unexpectedly, the presence of polarization leads to lower effective viscosity and a longer relaxation time, and the presence of viscosity leads to lower limits as well as upper ones on the group velocity and constraints relating polarization to viscosity relaxation times. We conclude with a qualitative discussion on how these results impact phenomenology, specifically the low effective viscosity in strongly interacting matter as well as shear-vorticity coupling.</description>

      <title>Durgapal-Fuloria Bose-Einstein condensate stars within $ f(R,T) $ gravity theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This manuscript studies the Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) stars in the light of $ f(R,T) $ gravity here with Durgapal-Fuloria (DP) metric ansatz. The function under this study features as $ f(R,T) = R + 2\eta T $, where $ \eta $ represents the coupling constant. With the help of it, we have formulated a stellar model describing the isotropic matter here within. Our analysis covers energy conditions, equation of state (EoS) parameter and gradients of the energy-momentum tensor components for a valid BEC stellar framework within $ f(R,T) $ gravitational theory with satisfactory results. The model's stability has been validated via multiple stability criteria viz., the velocity of sound, study of adiabetic index and surface redshift where all are found to be lying within the acceptable range for our stellar model. Thus in all the cases we have found our model to be stable and realistic. From the graphical representations the impact of the coupling constant and the parameter of the DP metric potential are clearly visible. Thus we can state that with all the above-mentioned features we have introduced new stellar solutions for BEC stars with enhanced precise results in this modified gravity.</description>

      <title>Qumode Tensor Networks for False Vacuum Decay in Quantum Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: False vacuum decay in scalar quantum field theory (QFT) plays a central role in cosmology and particle physics but has remained intractable for classical simulation due to its non-perturbative, highly entangled dynamics. We present a novel method for Hamiltonian simulation of false-vacuum decay in a self-interacting scalar QFT, based on a spatial discretisation into a lattice of bosonic modes. Each mode has a continuous or quasi-continuous local Hilbert space whose dimension is large enough to capture the self-interactions in the Hamiltonian. We refer to these local modes generically as ``qumodes'', echoing the ideal case in which the lattice would be realised on a continuous-variable quantum computer. Here we show that the same framework can be implemented on a tensor network, in which case the qumodes are quasi-continuous, corresponding to the local sites of the network having a very high dimensional Hilbert space. Using a time-evolving block decimation algorithm with Trotterised time evolution, we capture the real-time dynamics of the scalar field. In (1+1)-dimensions, we initialise a metastable vacuum and observe the coherent entanglement growth that seeds true-vacuum bubble nucleation. Our approach establishes the qumode network as a scalable framework for non-equilibrium scalar QFT phenomena and paves the way for higher-dimensional studies and continuous-variable quantum computing implementations.</description>

      <title>Finite time path field theory and a new type of universal quantum spin chain quench behaviour</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss different quench protocols for Ising and XY spin chains in a transverse magnetic field. With a sudden local magnetic field quench as a starting point, we generalize our approach to a large class of local non-sudden quenches. Using finite time path field theory perturbative methods, we show that the difference between the sudden quench and a class of quenches with non-sudden switching on the perturbation vanishes exponentially with time, apart from non-substantial modifications that are systematically accounted for. As the consequence of causality and analytic properties of functions describing the discussed class of quenches, this is true at any order of perturbation expansion and thus for the resummed perturbation series. The only requirements on functions describing the perturbation strength switched on at a finite time t=0 are: (1) their Fourier transform f(p) is a function that is analytic everywhere in the lower complex semiplane, except at the simple pole at p=0 and possibly others with Im (p) &lt; 0, and (2) that f(p)/p converges to zero at infinity in the lower complex semiplane. Prototypical function of this class is tanh(eta t), to which the perturbation strength is proportional after the switching on time t=0. In the limit of large eta, such a perturbation approaches the case of a sudden quench. It is shown that, because of this new type of universal behaviour of Loschmidt echo that emerges in exponentially short time scale, our previous results (Kui\'c, D. et al. Universe 2024, 10, 384) for the sudden local magnetic field quench of Ising and XY chains, obtained by resummation of the perturbative expansion, extend in the long time limit to all non-sudden quench protocols in this class, with non-substantial modifications systematically taken into account. We also show that analogous universal behaviour exists in disorder quenches, and ultimately global ones.</description>

      <title>Standardizing a larger, higher-quality, homogeneous sample of reverberation-mapped H$\beta$ active galactic nuclei using the broad-line region radius-luminosity relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a high-quality, homogeneous sample of 157 H$\beta$ reverberation-mapped active galactic nuclei (RM AGNs) spanning redshifts $0.00308 \leq z \leq 0.8429$, which is approximately 3.8 times larger than the previously available high-quality homogeneous sample. Using the broad-line region radius$-$luminosity relation ($R-L$), which involves the broad H$\beta$ line time delay and the monochromatic luminosity at 5100\,\AA\,, we show that the sample is standardizable by using six spatially flat and nonflat cosmological models. The inferred cosmological model parameters are consistent within 2$\sigma$ uncertainties with those from better established baryon acoustic oscillation and Hubble parameter measurements, with the exception of two nonflat models that are ruled out by other data. The $R-L$ relation slope is found to be flatter ($\gamma=0.428 \pm 0.025$ in the flat $\Lambda$CDM model) than the slope expected from a simple photoionization model as well as the slope found previously for the smaller homogeneous sample. In addition, we find a mild dependence of H$\beta$ $R-L$ relation parameters as well as its intrinsic scatter on the Eddington ratio by comparing the $R-L$ relations for low- and high-accreting equal-sized subsamples. A future analysis of a larger homogeneous sample containing a broader range of luminosities and Eddington ratios is necessary to confirm the standardizability of H$\beta$ AGNs.</description>

      <title>Berry Phase in Pathangled Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce pathangled quantum states, spatially correlated systems governed via production angles, to achieve geometric control of entanglement beyond spin/polarization constraints. By driving the system through cyclic adiabatic evolution of an external parameter in Mach-Zehnder interferometers, we demonstrate that Berry phases and production angles become additional degrees of freedom for Bell correlations. We identify an approximate critical angle $24.97^\circ$ that geometrically manifests the Bell-limit for certain measurement settings, delineating boundaries between local-hidden-variable theories and quantum mechanics. This framework simplifies state preparation while enabling geometry-driven entanglement control, thus providing distinct experimental advantages.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This review examines data from hadron-nucleus collisions, primarily focusing on hard processes like Drell-Yan, heavy flavor and quarkonium production. It highlights observed modifications of particle yields as functions of momentum and rapidity, aiming to clarify the underlying QCD effects in cold nuclear matter (CNM). The paper outlines strategies for future experiments, including the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC), to distinguish between these effects. Key questions address the universality of suppression mechanisms and the role of non-perturbative physics, providing a road map for upcoming nuclear data.</description>

Abstract: We construct a correspondence between the quantized constrained 3BF theory and the quantized Einstein-Cartan theory with contact spin-spin interaction, both of which describe the Standard Model coupled to Einstein-Cartan gravitational field. First we introduce the expectation values of observables using the path integral formalism for both theories, and then by integrating out some configuration space variables in the quantum 3BF theory we obtain the definition of the corresponding observable in the quantum Einstein-Cartan theory with contact interaction. Finally, we discuss the differences in the predictions of the two theories on the example of the 4-volume density of spacetime, and on the example of gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>Quantum-inspired wormholes from String T-Duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The intrinsic non-perturbative features of string-theoretic corrections, particularly those arising from T-duality, have been shown to naturally introduce an effective ultraviolet (UV) cutoff into the gravitational framework. This cutoff, often referred to as the zero-point length in the context of path integral duality, acts as a fundamental minimal length scale that regulates short-distance divergences. Using the established correspondence between T-duality and path integral duality, it has been shown that the static Newtonian potential becomes regularized at small distances. Building upon this regular behavior, we proceed to construct self-consistent, spherically symmetric, and electrically neutral wormhole solutions, which remain free of curvature singularities and embodies the effects of this duality-induced UV completion. We explore wormhole configurations with the aim of minimizing violations of the null energy condition (NEC). In fact, solutions with a constant redshift function or specific shape functions generally exhibit NEC violations throughout the entire spacetime. To address this, we explore two distinct thin shell constructions: (i) wormholes formed by matching an interior wormhole geometry to an exterior Schwarzschild vacuum spacetime, thereby confining exotic matter to a localized region; and (ii) standard thin-shell wormholes generated by gluing two identical black hole spacetimes across a timelike hypersurface situated outside their event horizons. In both cases, the NEC violations are minimised and restricted to a finite region, improving the physical plausibility and traversability of the resulting configurations.</description>

      <title>Investigating QED Effects on the Thin Accretion Disk Properties Around Rotating Euler-Heisenberg Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Einstein Euler Heisenberg (EEH) black hole model represents an extension of classical black hole solutions in general relativity by incorporating quantum electrodynamic (QED) corrections. These corrections are introduced through the inclusion of the Euler-Heisenberg Lagrangian, which accounts for the nonlinear effects of QED in the presence of strong electromagnetic fields. This study investigates the observational properties of a thin accretion disk surrounding the electrically charged rotating EEH black hole. By exploring the influence of the spin parameter and charge on key dynamical quantities such as the energy, angular momentum, angular velocity, and the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) of a test particle it becomes possible to analyze the radiative flux, temperature distribution, and differential luminosity of the thin accretion disk in the spacetime of the charged rotating EEH black hole. The results are compared to those of Kerr and Kerr Newman black holes in General relativity, revealing that QED corrections are found to increase the ISCO radius. Specifically, for a fixed electric charge, an increasing spin parameter leads to a larger ISCO radius compared to the standard Kerr black holes as a result of additional electromagnetic corrections introduced by the Euler Heisenberg theory. Conversely, when the spin parameter is held constant, an increase in the electric charge reduces the ISCO radius. Additionally, thin accretion disks around charged EEH rotating black holes exhibit higher temperatures and greater efficiency when the spin parameter is fixed and the electric charge is increased.</description>

      <title>The Scotogenic Model with Two Inert Doublets: Parameters Space and Electroweak Precision Tests</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study a scotogenic extension of the Standard Model featuring two inert scalar doublets and three singlet Majorana fermions, where neutrino masses are generated radiatively at one loop. The lightest among the Majorana fermions and neutral scalars can serve as dark matter candidates. We explore the parameter space, considering theoretical constraints (perturbativity, unitarity, vacuum stability) and experimental limits (lepton flavor violation, Higgs measurements, electroweak precision observables). Our analysis identifies regions where sizable Yukawa couplings naturally arise due to constructive interference in the scalar sector. Additionally, we estimate the oblique parameters, finding that only $\Delta T$ is sensitive to charged mass splittings, while $\Delta S$ and $\Delta U$ remain small across the viable parameter space. However, 60\% of the viable parameter space is excluded by the recent CMS measurement of the $W$ boson mass, since the shift $\Delta M_W$ depends on the oblique parameters, particularly $\Delta T$ that is sensitive to scalar mass splittings.</description>

      <title>Measurement induced scrambling and emergent symmetries in random circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement is affected by unitary evolution, which spreads the entanglement through the whole system, and also by measurements, which usually tends to disentangle subsystems from the rest. Their competition has been known to result in the measurement-induced phase transition. But more intriguingly, measurement alone has the ability to drive a system into different entanglement phases. In this work, we map the entanglement evolution under unitaries and/or measurements into a classical spin problem. This framework is used to understand a myriad of random circuit models analytically, including measurement-induced and measurement-only transitions. Regarding many-body joint measurements, a lower bound of measurement range that is necessary for a global scrambled phase is derived. Moreover, emergent continuous symmetries (U(1) or SU(2)) are discovered in some random measurement models in the large-$d$ (qudit dimension) limit. The emergent continuous symmetry allows a variety of spin dynamics phenomena to find their counterparts in random circuit models.</description>

      <title>From Barthel Randers Kropina Geometries to the Accelerating Universe: A Brief Review of Recent Advances in Finslerian Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review recent developments in cosmological models based on Finsler geometry and extensions of general relativity within this framework. Finsler geometry generalizes Riemannian geometry by allowing the metric tensor to depend on position and an additional internal degree of freedom, typically represented by a vector field at each point of the spacetime manifold. We explore whether Finsler-type geometries can describe gravitational interaction and cosmological dynamics. In particular, we examine the Barthel connection and $(\alpha, \beta)$ geometries, where $\alpha$ is a Riemannian metric and $\beta$ is a one-form. For a specific construction of $\beta$, the Barthel connection coincides with the Levi-Civita connection of the associated Riemann metric. We review gravitational field and cosmological evolution in three geometries: Barthel-Randers ($F = \alpha + \beta$), Barthel-Kropina ($F = \alpha^2 \beta$), and the conformally transformed Barthel-Kropina geometry. After presenting the mathematical foundations of Finslerian-type modified gravity theories, we derive generalized Friedmann equations in these geometries assuming a Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker type metric. We also present the matter-energy balance equations, interpreting them from the perspective of thermodynamics with particle creation. The cosmological properties of Barthel-Randers and Barthel-Kropina models are explored in detail. The additional geometric terms in these models can be interpreted as an effective dark energy component, generating an effective cosmological constant. Several cosmological solutions are compared with observational data (Cosmic Chronometers, Type Ia Supernovae, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations) using MCMC analysis. A comparison with the $\Lambda$CDM model shows that Finslerian models fit observational data well, suggesting they offer a viable alternative to general relativity.</description>

      <title>Observational constraints on inflationary models with non-minimally derivative coupling by ACT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The most recent data release from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) reveals a larger value of the scalar spectral tilt $n_s$, ruling out a broad class of inflationary attractors. In this paper, we consider inflationary models including the power law potential, the hilltop model, the polynomial $\alpha$-attractor and exponential $\alpha-$attractor, with non-minimally derivative coupling in the high friction limit, and show how the models can fit ACT data. We also derive constraints on the model parameters using the latest ACT data.</description>

      <title>Observable signatures of Black Holes with Hernquist Dark Matter Halo having a cloud of strings: From Geodesics to Shadow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive theoretical investigation of a novel black hole (BH) spacetime: a Schwarzschild BH embedded in a Hernquist-type dark matter halo (HDMH) and surrounded by a cloud of cosmic strings (CSs) -- collectively termed the Schwarzschild-HDMH with CS (SHDMHCS) configuration. By analyzing the spacetime geometry, we explore how key parameters -- the core radius and halo density of the dark matter, along with the string tension -- affect the geodesic motion of both massless and massive particles. Our results reveal that the combined influence of HDMH and CSs modifies the effective potentials for null and timelike geodesics, leading to distinct dynamical behavior compared to standard Schwarzschild geometry. We perform a perturbative analysis for scalar (spin-0), electromagnetic (spin-1), and Dirac (spin-1/2) fields, deriving the associated effective potentials and showing how both the dark halo and CSs alter field propagation and potential barriers. The shadow of the BH is studied in detail: we derive analytical expressions for photon sphere and shadow radii, finding that CSs tend to enlarge the shadow, while HDMH properties tend to shrink it. The combined effects of these parameters significantly influence the shadow's shape and size, producing potentially observable signatures. Our results establish that the SHDMHCS configuration yields distinct observational imprints detectable by present and forthcoming astrophysical instruments. This framework provides new tools for probing exotic matter distributions via gravitational wave observations, orbital dynamics, and high-resolution black hole imaging, offering a pathway to distinguish such configurations from simpler BH models in realistic environments.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Sign-Reversal: Non-Parametric Reconstruction of Interacting Dark Energy with DESI DR2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A direct interaction between dark energy and dark matter provides a natural and important extension to the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. We perform a non-parametric reconstruction of the vacuum energy ($w=-1$) interacting with cold dark matter using the cosmological data from DESI DR2, Planck CMB, and three SNIa samples (PP, DESY5, and Union3). By discretizing the coupling function $\beta(z)$ into 20 redshift bins and assuming a Gaussian smoothness prior, we reconstruct $\beta(z)$ without assuming any specific parameterization. The mean reconstructed $\beta(z)$ changes sign during cosmic evolution, indicating an energy transfer from cold dark matter to dark energy at early times and a reverse flow at late times. At high redshifts, $\beta(z)$ shows a $\sim 2\sigma$ deviation from $\Lambda$CDM. At low redshifts, the results depend on the SNIa sample: CMB+DESI and CMB+DESI+PP yield $\beta(z)$ consistent with zero within $2\sigma$, while CMB+DESI+DESY5 and CMB+DESI+Union3 prefer negative $\beta$ at $\sim2\sigma$. Both $\chi^2$ tests and Bayesian analyses favor the $\beta(z)$ model, with CMB+DESI DR2+DESY5 showing the most significant support through the largest improvement in goodness of fit ($\Delta\chi^2_{\rm MAP}=-17.76$) and strongest Bayesian evidence ($\ln\mathcal{B} = 5.98 \pm 0.69$). Principal component analysis reveals that the data effectively constrain three additional degrees of freedom in the $\beta(z)$ model, accounting for most of the improvement in goodness of fit. Our results demonstrate that the dynamical dark energy preference in current data can be equally well explained by such a sign-reversal interacting dark energy, highlighting the need for future observations to break this degeneracy.</description>

      <title>Saddle-point method for resummed form factors in QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the form factor appearing in QCD resummation formalism for event shape distributions in the two-jet (or Sudakov) region. We present an analytic formula for the inverse transform of the form factor, namely from the conjugate moment space to the (physical) momentum space, based on the saddle-point method. The saddle-point itself is determined by means of an analytic recursion method as well as by standard numerical methods. The results we have found are in very good agreement with the exact (numerical) evaluation of the inverse transform, while they significantly differ from classical analytical formulations of resummation in momentum space. The latter are based on a Taylor expansion of the form factor around the free-theory saddle point.</description>

      <title>Quasibound states of massive charged scalars around dilaton black holes in $2+1$ dimensions: Exact frequencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate massive charged scalar perturbations in the background of three-dimensional dilaton black holes with a cosmological constant. We demonstrate that the wave equations governing the dynamics of these perturbations are exactly solvable, with the radial part expressible in terms of confluent Heun functions. The quasibound state frequencies are computed analytically, and we examine their dependence on the scalar field's mass and charge, as well as on the black hole's mass and electric charge. Our analysis also underscores the crucial role played by the cosmological constant in shaping the behavior of these perturbations. This specific black hole metric arises as a solution to the low-energy effective action of string theory in $2+1$ dimensions, and it holds potential for experimental realization in analog gravity systems due to the similarity between its surface gravity and that of acoustic analogs. Moreover, the analytic tractability of this system offers a valuable testing ground for exploring aspects of black hole spectroscopy, stability, and quantum field theory in curved spacetime. The exact solvability facilitates deeper insights into the interplay between geometry and matter fields in lower-dimensional gravity, where quantum gravitational effects can be more pronounced. Such studies not only enrich our understanding of dilaton gravity and its string-theoretic implications but also pave the way for potential applications in simulating black hole phenomena in laboratory settings using analog models.</description>

      <title>Identifying multiple images of gravitational-wave sources lensed by elliptical lensing potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real astrophysical lenses typically lack axisymmetry, necessitating the study of gravitational-wave (GW) lensing by elliptical mass distributions to accurately assess detectability and waveform interpretation. We investigate strong lensing using the singular isothermal ellipsoid (SIE) model, which produces two or four images depending on the source's position relative to lens caustics. Employing a quasi-geometrical optics framework, we determine that the geometrical-optics approximation holds reliably for lens masses above approximately $10^5 \, M_\odot$ at GW frequencies relevant for ground-based detectors $(\sim 10^2 \,\text{Hz})$, though wave-optics effects become significant for lower masses or sources near caustics. Our waveform mismatch analysis demonstrates that the use of three-image templates significantly improves our ability to distinguish source signals, reducing mismatches from $O(10^{-1})$ to $O(10^{-2})$, typically by factors between 1.5 and 5 compared to the standard two-image template model. At lens masses above $10^7 \, M_\odot$, diffraction effects become negligible for ground-based detectors, resulting in an additional mismatch reduction by a factor of approximately three. These findings highlight the critical need for multi-image templates in GW searches to enhance detection efficiency and accuracy.</description>

      <title>The gravitational wave echoes from the black hole with three-form fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study of massless three-form black hole, where the three-form fields are higher $p$-form gauge fields with $p=3$. These give rise to the Schwarzschild-de Sitter (Sch-dS)-like solution through an effective cosmological constant represented by $a_1$. We analyze this solution under gravitational perturbations and find that it exhibits a single-peak potential. For this case, no echoes are produced. Furthermore, we consider the massive case of the three-form fields by introducing a Stueckelberg field to restore gauge invariance and to investigate its effect on GWs at late times. In this case, the potential exhibits a double-peak structure, with the modified potential appearing beside the gravitational perturbation potential. We also examine the impact of the relevant parameters as well as the influence of the parameter $c_0$, which arises from the equation of motion of the Stueckelberg field. For a large value of $a_1$, the two peaks of the potentials are close together, while $c_0$ affects the amplitude and decay rate of the time-domain waveform, resulting in no echoes. For small values of $a_1$, the peaks of the potentials are widely separated and $c_0$ influences both the phase and the amplitude of the echoes. In addition, the quasinormal frequencies of the black hole are also calculated using both the WKB and Prony methods. As results, these provide a potential avenue for testing deviations from GR and probing possible signatures of quantum gravity through future GWs observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the longstanding challenge of consistently updating quantum states after selective measurements in a relativistic spacetime. Standard updates along the future lightcones preserve causality but break correlations between causally disconnected parties, whereas updates along the past lightcone either imply retrocausality or do not respect the causal propagation of information. We introduce a minimal extension of multipartite states to encode subsystem-specific contextual information. This "polyperspective" formalism ensures causally consistent covariant state updates, preserves multipartite correlations, and respects conservation laws.</description>

      <title>The Boundary Proposal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18892v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the leading ideas for the beginning of the Universe is the Hartle-Hawking `No-Boundary Proposal.' Since the Cobordism Conjecture claims that any spacetime allows for a dynamical boundary, we suggest that one may equally well consider a `Boundary Proposal'. Specifically, the corresponding euclidean instanton is a sphere with two holes around north and south pole cut out. Analogously to the Hartle-Hawking proposal, the sphere is then cut in two at the equator and half of it is dropped. The equator is glued to an expanding Lorentzian de Sitter space, implementing a beginning of the Universe with a spacelike spherical boundary at its earliest moment. This process is in principle on equal footing with the one based on the no-boundary instanton. In fact, if the Linde-Vilenkin sign choice is used, this `Boundary' creation process may even dominate. An intriguing implication arises if tensionless end-of-the-world branes, as familiar from type-IIA or M-theory, are available: Analogously to the Boundary Proposal, one may then be able to create a compact, flat torus universe from nothing, without any exponential suppression or enhancement factors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08851v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: If a set of massive objects collide in space and the fragments disperse, possibly forming black holes, then this process will emit gravitational waves. Computing the detailed gravitational wave-form associated with this process is a complicated problem, not only due to the non-linearity of gravity but also due to the fact that during the collision and subsequent fragmentation the objects could undergo complicated non-gravitational interactions. Nevertheless the classical soft graviton theorem determines the power law fall-off of the wave-form at late and early times, including logarithmic corrections, in terms of only the momenta of the incoming and outgoing objects without any reference to what transpired during the collision. In this short review I shall explain the results and very briefly outline the derivation of these results.</description>

      <title>Two types of domain walls in $\mathcal{N}=1$ super-QCD: how they are classified and counted</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16845v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study multiplicities and junctions of BPS domain walls interpolating between different chiral vacua in $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetric QCD (SQCD) with the SU$(N)$ gauge group and a varying number of fundamental quarks. Depending on the number of flavors $F$, two distinct classes of {\em degenerate} domain walls emerge: (i) locally distinguishable, i.e., those which differ from each other locally, in local experiments; and (ii) those which have identical local structure and are differentiated only topologically, through judiciously chosen compactifications. In the first class, two-wall junctions exist, while in the second class, such junctions do not exist. Acharya and Vafa counted {\em topologically distinguishable} walls in pure super-Yang-Mills. Ritz, Shifman, and Vainshtein counted the {\em locally distinguishable} walls in $F=N$ SQCD. In both cases, the multiplicity of $k$ walls was the same, $\nu_{N,k}^\text{walls}= N!/\big[(N-k)!k!\big]$. We study the general case $0\leqslant F\leqslant N$, with mixed sets of walls from both classes (i) and (ii) simultaneously, and demonstrate that the above overall multiplicity remains intact. We argue that the growth of the quark masses exhibits no phase transition at any finite mass. The locally distinguishable walls can turn into topologically distinguishable ones only at $m=\infty$. The evolution of the low-energy wall worldsheet theory in the passage from small to large $m$ is briefly discussed. We also propose a candidate for the low-energy description of wall junctions. The tools used are localization of instantons, supersymmetry enhancement on the walls, and circle compactification.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19430v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the Mathieu groups $M_{24}$ and $M_{23}$ in the isometry group of the odd Leech lattice do not lift to subgroups of the automorphism group of its lattice vertex operator (super)algebra. In other words, the subgroups $2^{24}.M_{24}$ and $2^{23}.M_{23}$ of the automorphism group of the odd Leech lattice vertex operator algebra are non-split extensions. Our method can also confirm a similar result for the Conway group $\mathrm{Co}_0$ and the Leech lattice, which was already shown in [Griess 1973]. This study is motivated by the moonshine-type observation on the $\mathcal{N}=2$ extremal elliptic genus of central charge 24 by [Benjamin, Dyer, Fitzpatrick, Kachru arXiv:1507.00004]. We also investigate weight-1 and weight-$\frac{3}{2}$ currents invariant under the subgroup $2^{24}.M_{24}$ or $2^{23}.M_{23}$ of the automorphism group of the odd Leech lattice vertex operator algebra, and revisit an $\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal algebra in it.</description>

      <title>Higher Form and Higher Group Symmetries via Mirror Symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09967v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we uncover a connection that relates the 1-form and the 2-group symmetries of 5D SCFTs derived from geometric engineering methods to monodromies of the corresponding B-models via mirror symmetry. Viewing defects as branes wrapping relative cycles in a non-compact CY3, we find that the defect groups can be read off from the VEVs of the corresponding line operators at the leading order. Via mirror map, we find that both the 1-form and the 2-group symmetries of the SCFT are related to the monodromy at the large radius point in the B-model. Additionally, we recursively obtain closed-form expressions of instanton expansions of the VEV of Wilson lines of certain 5D theories among which some have not been obtained so far using localization methods. We further conjecture that the 2-group symmetry is given by the Mordell-Weil torsion of the universal special geometry associated to the theory, generalizing the conjecture for rank-1 theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01268v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: String compactification in the framework of the low energy effective supergravity requires the perturbative control in both the large volume and the weak coupling expansions. However, the corrected K\"ahler potential generated by the coupling of the complex structure moduli to some lattice structure (which is typical in the presence of a tower of states) may diverge in the large field limit, resulting in the lost of the perturbative control. Such a diverging behavior is allowed by the Sp$(2(h^{2,1}+1))$ symmetry, and can be found in the explicitly calculable models in which a slight modification by the coupling between the lattice and the gauge field does not affect the diverging behavior. This is similar to the large internal volume condition in the Einstein frame, where the SL$(2, \mathbb{Z})$ symmetry of the axio-dilaton looks to allow the correction to the K\"ahler potential to diverge in the weak coupling limit but it just means that the dilaton field value must be bounded from above to keep the internal volume in the string frame sufficiently large. In order to keep the perturbative control, the value of the complex structure moduli also has the upper bound, which is determined by the volume of the internal manifold and the string coupling constant, hence the Kaluza-Klein and the string mass scales. The form and the interpretation of the bounds are quite similar to those of the distance conjecture, preventing the descent of a tower of states by the upper bounds on the moduli values.</description>

      <title>Divergences in the effective interaction between Chern-Simons bosons and fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12550v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the vector extension of the Standard Model (SM) with Chern-Simons type interaction. This extension contains a new massive vector boson (Chern-Simons boson) that does not interact directly with fermions of the SM. We consider the effective loop interaction of a new vector boson with fermions of the SM and its renormalizability in an arbitrary gauge. Our analysis shows that loop divergences cannot be eliminated in the effective interaction between Chern-Simons bosons and fermions of the same flavor, whereas the effective loop interaction with fermions of different flavors remains well-defined. The interaction terms between the Chern-Simons boson and fermions of the same flavor, characterised by divergent prefactors, have been identified. These interactions should be treated within the framework of effective field theory.</description>

      <title>Absolute entropy and the observer's no-boundary state</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14771v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the no-boundary proposal for closed universes with an observer. We argue that the observer's no-boundary state is the identity operator on the physical Hilbert space, i.e., the maximum entropy state and show this explicitly in Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity. Geometrically, the no-boundary state is a bra-ket wormhole. Expectation values in the no-boundary state provide a trace for the observer's algebra, which allows one to define von Neumann entropy for observers in different universes as the relative entropy with respect to the no-boundary state. This result is consistent with all previously discussed cases of traces for invariantly defined regions.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we calculate two-point correlation functions of a massive probe scalar field in the background of the three-dimensional Janus solution. We relate the equation of motion of the scalar to Heun's equation and use the recently obtained expressions for the connection coefficients to obtain the two-point function of operators dual to the probe scalar. From the correlators we obtain the corrections to the spectrum of boundary operators and bulk-boundary operator product coefficients to second order in the Janus deformation parameter.</description>

      <title>Emergent Holographic Spacetime from Quantum Information</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06595v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Holographic duality describes gravitational theories in terms of quantum many-body systems. In holography, quantum information theory provides a crucial tool that directly connects microscopic structures of these systems to the geometries of gravitational spacetimes. One manifestation is that the entanglement entropy in quantum many-body systems can be calculated from the area of an extremal surface in the corresponding gravitational spacetime. This implies that a gravitational spacetime can emerge from an enormous number of entangled qubits. In this Essay, I will discuss open problems in this area of research, considering recent developments and outlining future prospects towards a complete understanding of quantum gravity. The first step in this direction is to understand what kind of quantum circuits each holographic spacetime corresponds to, drawing on recent developments in quantum complexity theories and studying concrete examples of holography in string theory. Next, we should extend the concept of holography to general spacetimes, e.g., those spacetimes which appear in realistic cosmologies, by utilizing the connections between quantum information and holography. To address the fundamental question of how time emerges, I will propose the concepts of pseudo-entropy and time-like entanglement as a useful tool in our exploration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12748v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Dirac equation with mass and axial chemical potential is solved analytically obtaining the mode spinors and corresponding projection operators giving the spectral representations of the principal conserved operators. In this framework, the odd partner of the Pryce spin operator is defined for the first time showing how these operators may be combined for defining the particle and antiparticle spin and polarization operators of Dirac's theory of massive fermions either in the free case or in the presence of the axial chemical potential. The quantization procedure is applied in both these cases obtaining two distinct operator algebras in which the particle and antiparticle spin and polarization operators take canonical forms. In this approach statistical operators with independent particle and antiparticle vortical chemical potentials may be constructed.</description>

      <title>Power-like potentials: from the Bohr-Sommerfeld energies to exact ones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.00327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.00327v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For one-dimensional power-like potentials $|x|^m, m &gt; 0$ the Bohr-Sommerfeld Energies (BSE) extracted explicitly from the Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization condition are compared with the exact energies. It is shown that for the ground state as well as for all positive parity states the BSE are always above the exact ones contrary to the negative parity states where BSE remain above the exact ones for $m&gt;2$ but they are below them for $m &lt; 2$. The ground state BSE as the function of $m$ are of the same order of magnitude as the exact energies for linear $(m=1)$, quartic $(m=4)$ and sextic $(m=6)$ oscillators but relative deviation grows with $m$ reaching the value 4 at $m=\infty$. For physically important cases $m=1,4,6$ for the $100$th excited state BSE coincide with exact ones in 5-6 figures.
  It is demonstrated that modifying the right-hand-side of the Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization condition by introducing the so-called {\it WKB correction} $\gamma$ (coming from the sum of higher order WKB terms taken at the exact energies) to the so-called exact WKB condition one can reproduce the exact energies. It is shown that the WKB correction is small, bounded function $|\gamma| &lt; 1/2$ for all $m \geq 1$, it is slow growing with increase in $m$ for fixed quantum number, while it decays with quantum number growth at fixed $m$. For the first time for quartic and sextic oscillators the WKB correction and energy spectra (and eigenfunctions) are written explicitly in closed analytic form with high relative accuracy $10^{-9 \ -11}$ (and $10^{-6}$).</description>

      <title>Existence and absence of Killing horizons in static solutions with symmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11012v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Without specifying a matter field nor imposing energy conditions, we study Killing horizons in $n(\ge 3)$-dimensional static solutions in general relativity with an $(n-2)$-dimensional Einstein base manifold. Assuming linear relations $p_{\rm r}\simeq\chi_{\rm r} \rho$ and $p_2\simeq\chi_{\rm t} \rho$ near a Killing horizon between the energy density $\rho$, radial pressure $p_{\rm r}$, and tangential pressure $p_2$ of the matter field, we prove that any non-vacuum solution satisfying $\chi_{\rm r}&lt;-1/3$ ($\chi_{\rm r}\ne -1$) or $\chi_{\rm r}&gt;0$ does not admit a horizon as it becomes a curvature singularity. For $\chi_{\rm r}=-1$ and $\chi_{\rm r}\in[-1/3,0)$, non-vacuum solutions admit Killing horizons, on which there exists a matter field only for $\chi_{\rm r}=-1$ and $-1/3$, which are of the Hawking-Ellis type~I and type~II, respectively. Differentiability of the metric on the horizon depends on the value of $\chi_{\rm r}$, and non-analytic extensions beyond the horizon are allowed for $\chi_{\rm r}\in[-1/3,0)$. In particular, solutions can be attached to the Schwarzschild-Tangherlini-type vacuum solution at the Killing horizon in at least a $C^{1,1}$ regular manner without a lightlike thin shell. We generalize some of those results in Lovelock gravity with a maximally symmetric base manifold.</description>

      <title>Fuzzy Dark Matter Less-complex Wormhole Structures in Higher-Order Curvature Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08354v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fuzzy dark matter wormhole solutions coupled with anisotropic matter distribution are explored in higher-order curvature gravity. We derive the shape function for fuzzy wormholes and explore their possible stability. We study the embedding diagrams of the active gravitational mass associated with fuzzy dark matter wormholes by taking a certain shape function. Aiming to highlight the role of higher-order curvature gravity in the modeling of less complex fuzzy wormhole structures, we evaluate the complexity factor, the conservation equation, and null energy conditions. Our study reinforces more importance of uniformly distributed pressure effects throughout the less complex region than the emergence of energy density homogeneity in the stability of fuzzy wormholes. It is shown that the active gravitational mass of the fuzzy wormhole structures varies inversely with the radial distance, thereby suggesting the breaching of energy conditions at some arena of the Einasto index. Furthermore, it is revealed that stable fuzzy dark matter wormhole structures exist in nature in the surroundings of cold dark matter halos and galactic bulges. The important physics understood from our analysis is that in higher-order curvature gravity, feasible geometries of fuzzy dark matter wormholes exist naturally in the environments of different galactic haloes.</description>

      <title>Strong CP and Flavor in Multi-Higgs Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14585v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a class of multi-Higgs doublet extensions of the Standard Model that solves the strong CP problem with profound consequences for the flavor sector. The Yukawa matrices are constrained to have many zero entries by a "Higgs-Flavor" symmetry, $G_{\rm HF}$, that acts on Higgs and quark fields. The violation of both CP and $G_{\rm HF}$ occurs in the Higgs mass matrix so that, for certain choices of $G_{\rm HF}$ charges, the strong CP parameter $\bar{\theta}$ is zero at tree-level. Radiative corrections to $\bar{\theta}$ are computed in this class of theories. They vanish in realistic two-Higgs doublet models with $G_{\rm HF} = \mathbb{Z}_3$. We also construct realistic three-Higgs models with $G_{\rm HF} = \rm U(1)$, where the one-loop results for $\bar{\theta}$ are model-dependent. Requiring $\bar{\theta}&lt; 10^{-10}$ has important implications for the flavor problem by constraining the Yukawa coupling and Higgs mass matrices. Contributions to $\bar{\theta}$ from higher-dimension operators are computed at 1-loop and can also be sufficiently small, although the hierarchy problem of this class of theories is worse than in the Standard Model.</description>

Abstract: This paper mainly aims to solve the Anti deSitter Black Holes (AdS BH) under the Barrow entropy under polytropic gas fluid, especially the Chaplygin Gas. First, we develop this last polytropic model in detail to then obtain the possible solutions and thermodynamic conditions on the Energy-Momentum and the Barrow Entropy for spacetimes of spatial dimension $D&gt;3$. Then, we focus on thermidynamic solutions and the different impacts on the Barrow entropy of the black hole, the temperature profile, the mass and the various physical quantities involved. Afterwards, we focus on the specific cases of the solutions of dimensions $D=4$ and $5$ in order to concretely test the models, especially from the point of view of the thermodynamic topology. Finally, we generalize everything by elaborating and testing the stability of the models to arrive at the thermal geometry of the AdS BH.</description>

      <title>Fast Scrambling in Classically Simulable Quantum Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19614v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study operator scrambling in quantum circuits built from `super-Clifford' gates. For such circuits it was established in arXiv:2002.12824 that the time evolution of operator entanglement for a large class of many-body operators can be efficiently simulated on a classical computer, including for operators with volume-law entanglement. Here we extend the scope of this formalism in two key ways. Firstly we provide evidence that these classically simulable circuits include examples of fast scramblers, by constructing a circuit for which operator entanglement is numerically found to saturate in a time $t_* \sim \mathrm{ln}(N)$ (with $N$ the number of qubits). Secondly we demonstrate that, in addition to operator entanglement, certain out-of-time ordered correlation functions (OTOCs) can be classically simulated within the same formalism. As a consequence such OTOCs can be computed numerically in super-Clifford circuits with thousands of qubits, and we study several explicit examples in the aforementioned fast scrambling circuits.</description>

      <title>Echoes from beyond: Detecting gravitational-wave quantum imprints with LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05645v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We assess the prospects for detecting gravitational wave echoes arising due to the quantum nature of black hole horizons with LISA. In a recent proposal, Bekenstein's black hole area quantization is connected to a discrete absorption spectrum for black holes in the context of gravitational radiation. Consequently, for incoming radiation at the black hole horizon, not all frequencies are absorbed, raising the possibility that the unabsorbed radiation is reflected, producing an echo-like signal closely following the binary coalescence waveform. In this work, we further develop this proposal by introducing a robust, phenomenologically motivated model for black hole reflectivity. Using this model, we calculate the resulting echoes for an ensemble of Numerical Relativity waveforms and examine their detectability with the LISA space-based interferometer. Our analysis demonstrates promising detection prospects and shows that, upon detection, LISA provides a direct probe of the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. In addition, we find that the information extractable from LISA data offers valuable constraints on a wide range of quantum gravity theories.</description>

      <title>An Explicit Categorical Construction of Instanton Density in Lattice Yang-Mills Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07195v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since the inception of lattice QCD, a natural definition for the Yang-Mills instanton on lattice has been long sought for. In a recent work, one of authors showed the natural solution has to be organized in terms of bundle gerbes in higher homotopy theory / higher category theory, and introduced the principles for such a categorical construction. To pave the way towards actual numerical implementation in the near future, nonetheless, an explicit construction is necessary. In this paper we provide such an explicit construction for $SU(2)$ gauge theory, with technical aspects inspired by L\"{u}scher's 1982 geometrical construction. We will see how the latter is in a suitable sense a saddle point approximation to the full categorical construction. The generalization to $SU(N)$ will be discussed.

Abstract: We prove the KP integrability of non-perturbative topological recursion, which can be considered as a formal $\hbar$-deformation of the Krichever construction of algebro-geometric solutions of the KP hierarchy. This property goes back to a 2011 conjecture of Borot and Eynard.</description>

      <title>Theory of Irreversibility in Quantum Many-Body Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06183v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the longstanding challenge in quantum many-body theory of reconciling unitary dynamics with irreversible relaxation. In classical chaos, the unitary evolution operator develops Ruelle-Pollicott (RP) resonances inside the unit circle in the continuum limit, leading to mixing. In the semiclassical limit, chaotic single-particle quantum systems relax with the same RP resonances. In contrast, the theory of quantum many-body RP resonances and their link to irreversibility remain underdeveloped. Here, we relate the spectral form factor to the sum of autocorrelation functions and, in generic many-body lattice systems without conservation laws, argue that all quantum many-body RP resonances converge inside the unit disk, highlighting the role of nonunitary and the thermodynamic limit. While we conjecture this picture to be general, we analytically prove the emergence of irreversibility in the random phase model (RPM), a paradigmatic Floquet quantum circuit model, in the limit of large local Hilbert space dimension. To this end, we couple it to local environments and compute the exact time evolution of autocorrelation functions, the dissipative form factor, and out-of-time-order correlation functions (OTOCs). Although valid for any dissipation strength, we then focus on weak dissipation to clarify the origin of irreversibility in unitary systems. When the dissipationless limit is taken after the thermodynamic limit, the unitary quantum map develops an infinite tower of decaying RP resonances -- chaotic systems display so-called anomalous relaxation. We also show that the OTOC in the RPM can undergo a two-stage relaxation and that during the second stage, the approach to the stationary value is again controlled by the leading RP resonance.

      <title>Achronal localization and representation of the causal logic from a conserved current, application to the massive scalar boson</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12699v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Covariant achronal localizations are gained out of covariant conserved currents computing their flux passing through achronal surfaces. This general method applies to the probability density currents with causal kernel regarding the massive scalar boson. Due to the one-to-one correspondence between (covariant) achronal localizations and (covariant) representations of the causal logic thus, apparently for the first time, a covariant representation of the causal logic for an elementary relativistic quantum mechanical system has been achieved. Similarly one derives the covariant family of representations of the causal logic related to the stress energy tensor of the massive scalar boson. While reaching this result the divergence theorem is proven for open sets with almost Lipschitz boundary.</description>

      <title>Topological Sum Rules and Spectral Flows of Chiral and Gravitational Axion-like Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03182v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine the structure of off-shell effective actions arising from chiral and gravitational anomalies, focusing on the $JJJ_A$ (axial-vector/vector/vector) and $J_A TT $ (axial-vector/stress-energy tensors) correlators, relevant in the analysis of anomaly-driven interactions in perturbation theory. Our approach relies on conformal field theory in momentum space, extended to chiral anomalies. The analysis centers on the presence of both particle poles and anomaly poles within these interactions, characterizing their behavior both in the conformal and non conformal limits. Through explicit computations, we show that universal sum rules in the longitudinal sector regulate these interactions for all kinematic conditions, extending previous analysis, and we discuss the resulting spectral flow, an area law of the absorptive part of the anomaly form factors as one moves away from or returns to the conformal point. These features are absent in the local effective action of anomaly interactions, commonly used in the description of axion-like particles. The spectral densities in both cases are shown to be self-similar. Our results further show that anomaly poles correspond to true particle poles only in the conformal limit, when the interaction describes a massless S-matrix process supported on a null-surface. Under these conditions, they can be effectively described by two kinetically mixed pseudoscalar fields propagating on the light-cone. These studies find application in polarized deeply inelastic scattering, axion-like dark matter and analogue systems such as topological materials.</description>

      <title>Page Curve and Entanglement Dynamics in an Interacting Fermionic Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03563v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generic non-equilibrium many-body systems display a linear growth of bipartite entanglement entropy in time, followed by a volume law saturation. In stark contrast, the Page curve dynamics of black hole physics shows that the entropy peaks at the Page time $t_{\text{Page}}$ and then decreases to zero. Here, we investigate such Page-like behavior of the von Neumann entropy in a model of strongly correlated spinless fermions in a typical system-environment setup, and characterize the properties of the Page curve dynamics in the presence of interactions using numerically exact matrix product states methods. The two phases of growth, namely the linear growth and the bending down, are shown to be separated by a non-analyticity in the min-entropy before $t_{\text{Page}}$, which separates two different quantum phases, realized as the respective ground states of the corresponding entanglement (or equivalently, modular) Hamiltonian. We confirm and generalize, by introducing interactions, the findings of \href{https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.109.224308}{Phys. Rev. B 109, 224308 (2024)} for a free spinless fermionic chain where the corresponding entanglement Hamiltonian undergoes a quantum phase transition at the point of non-analyticity. However, in the presence of interactions, a scaling analysis gives a non-zero critical time for the non-analyticity in the thermodynamic limit only for weak to intermediate interaction strengths, while the dynamics leading to the non-analyticity becomes \textit{instantaneous} for interactions large enough. We present a physical picture explaining these findings.</description>

      <title>Constraining circular polarization of high-frequency gravitational waves with CMB</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12517v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Circular polarization in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) offers a promising probe of the parity-violating physics of the early universe. In this paper, we propose a novel method to constrain the primordial circular polarization of high-frequency gravitational waves (GW) in the GHz range. An efficient conversion of gravitons to photons in a transverse cosmological magnetic field at the epoch of last scattering can generate excess chiral photons if the GW background is chiral in nature. This excess radiation distorts the CMB thermal black-body spectrum, which can be estimated by measuring the V-Stokes parameter in the CMB polarization. Using current upper limits on the angular power spectrum of circular polarization $C_l^{VV}$ from the CLASS, MIPOL, and SPIDER experiments, we obtain the most stringent constraints on the characteristic strain and circular polarization of the isotropic background of stochastic GWs at ${40\,\rm GHz}$ and ${150\,\rm GHz}$, respectively. Our work, therefore, provides an interesting possibility to constrain the circular polarization of high-frequency GWs using the V-mode polarization measurements of CMB.</description>

      <title>Black hole solutions in the revised Deser-Woodard nonlocal theory of gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15460v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the revised Deser-Woodard model of nonlocal gravity by reformulating the related field equations within a suitable tetrad frame. This transformation significantly simplifies the treatment of the ensuing differential problem while preserving the characteristics of the original gravitational theory. We then focus on static and spherically symmetric spacetimes in vacuum. Hence, we demonstrate that the gravitational theory under study admits a class of black hole solutions characterized by an inverse power-law correction to the Schwarzschild $g_{tt}$ metric function and a first-order perturbation of the $g_{rr}$ Schwarzschild component. Then, through a stepwise methodology, we analytically solve the full dynamics of the theory, finally leading to the reconstruction of the nonlocal distortion function, within which the new black hole solutions arise. Furthermore, we analyze the geometric properties of the obtained solutions and quantify the deviations from the Schwarzschild prediction. This work provides new insights into compact object configurations and advances our understanding of nonlocal gravity theories in the strong-field regime at astrophysical scales.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16438v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Assuming that (1) the universe underwent a post-inflationary accelerated expansion phase driven by a fluid with equation of state $P=w\rho$ and $-1&lt;w&lt;-1/3$, that (2) the cosmic horizon in an accelerating, quasi-de Sitter universe has a temperature inversely proportional to the proper size of the horizon, and that (3) we are static observers, we calculate the frozen-in density of a stable particle of mass $m$ produced by the cosmic horizon that does not undergo any number-changing processes in the late universe. We find that, as a function of the equation of state and the temperature when radiation domination starts and the quasi-de Sitter phase ends, the mass of the dark matter producing the observed cosmological abundance via this mechanism ranges from 10 keV up to close to the Planck scale.</description>

      <title>Exact Chiral Symmetries of 3+1D Hamiltonian Lattice Fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07708v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct Hamiltonian models on a 3+1d cubic lattice for a single Weyl fermion and for a single Weyl doublet protected by exact (as opposed to emergent) chiral symmetries. In the former, we find a not-on-site, non-compact chiral symmetry which can be viewed as a Hamiltonian analog of the Ginsparg-Wilson symmetry in Euclidean lattice models of Weyl fermions. In the latter, we combine an on-site $U(1)$ symmetry with a not-on-site $U(1)$ symmetry, which together generate the $SU(2)$ flavor symmetry of the doublet at low energies, while in the UV they generate an algebra known in integrability as the Onsager algebra. This latter model is in fact the celebrated magnetic Weyl semimetal which is known to have a chiral anomaly from the action of $U(1)$ and crystalline translation, that gives rise to an anomalous Hall response - however reinterpreted in our language, it has two exact $U(1)$ symmetries that gives rise to the global $SU(2)$ anomaly which protects the gaplessness even when crystalline translations are broken. We also construct an exact symmetry-protected single Dirac cone in 2+1d with the $U(1) \rtimes T$ parity anomaly. Our constructions evade both old and recently-proven no-go theorems by using not-on-siteness in a crucial way, showing our results are sharp.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00498v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many theories of physical interest, which admit a Hamiltonian description, exhibit symmetries under a particular class of non -strictly conformal transformation, known as dynamical similarities. The presence of such symmetries allows a reduction process to be carried out, eliminating a single degree of freedom from the system, which we associate with an overall scale. This process of `contact reduction' leads to theories of a frictional nature, in which the physically-observable quantities form an autonomous subsystem, that evolves in a predictable manner. We demonstrate that this procedure has a natural generalisation to theories of higher order; detailed examples are provided, and physical implications discussed.</description>

Abstract: Copositive matrices and copositive polynomials are objects from optimization. We connect these to the geometry of Feynman integrals in physics. The integral is guaranteed to converge if its kinematic parameters lie in the copositive cone. P\'olya's method makes this manifest. We study the copositive cone for the second Symanzik polynomial of any Feynman graph. Its algebraic boundary is described by Landau discriminants.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03435v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum observables of generic many-body systems exhibit a universal pattern of growth in the Krylov space of operators. This pattern becomes particularly manifest in the Lanczos basis, where the evolution superoperator assumes the tridiagonal form. According to the universal operator growth hypothesis, the nonzero elements of the superoperator, known as Lanczos coefficients, grow asymptotically linearly. We introduce and explore broad families of Lanczos coefficients that are consistent with the universal operator growth and lead to the exactly solvable dynamics. Within these families, the subleading terms of asymptotic expansion of the Lanczos sequence can be controlled and fine-tuned to produce diverse dynamical patterns. For one of the families, the Krylov complexity is computed exactly.</description>

      <title>Displacement Memory Effect from Supersymmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05043v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explain the recent results on the displacement memory effect (DME) of plane gravitational waves using supersymmetric quantum mechanics. This novel approach stems from that both the geodesic and the Schr\"odinger equations are Sturm-Liouville boundary value problems. Supersymmetry provides a unified framework for the P\"oschl-Teller and the Scarf profiles and yields the critical values of the associated wave amplitudes for DME in a natural way. Within our framework, we obtain a compact formula for DME in terms of the asymptotic values of the superpotential and the geodesics. In addition, this new technique enables us to build plane and gravitational waves with 2-transverse directions using superpartner potentials. Lastly, we study DME within a singular wave profile inspired by supersymmetric quantum mechanics, which demonstrates the broader applicability of our method.</description>

      <title>Analogue of Chern-Simons invariant in non-metricity gravity and axion cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09218v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a pseudo-scalar quantity, which is an analogue of the Chern-Simons invariant, in the framework of non-metricity gravity. By considering the coupling between the pseudo-scalar quantity and the axion, we give scenarios which may solve the problems of the axion misalignment, the $S_8$ problem, and the beginning of inflation. When the phase transition associated with the spontaneous breaking of the gauge symmetry of the electroweak theory or grand unified theories (GUTs) occurs, the pseudo-scalar quantity has a non-trivial value, which induces the misalignment of the axion field and axion particles are produced. If the gradient of the potential is small, the $S_8$ problem might be solved. We also propose a mechanism which induces inflation by the misalignment of the axion field generated by the phase transition of the GUTs.</description>

Abstract: Considering a spacetime foliated by co-dimension-2 hypersurfaces, we find the conditions under which lower-dimensional symmetries of a base space can be lifted up to irreducible Killing tensors of the full spacetime. In this construction, the key ingredient for irreducibility is the non-commutativity of the underlying Killing vectors. It gives rise to a tower of growing rank Killing tensors determined by the structure constants of the corresponding Lie algebra. A canonical example of a metric with such emergent non-trivial hidden symmetries in all dimensions is provided by rotating (off-shell) generalized Lense-Thirring spacetimes, where the irreducible Killing tensors arise from the underlying spherical symmetry of the base space. A physical on-shell realization of this construction in four dimensions is embodied by a rotating black hole in the Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton-Axion theory. Further examples of equal spinning Myers-Perry spacetimes and spacetimes built on planar and Taub-NUT base metrics are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Dark Phases in Scalar Particles within the Schwarzschild-Kiselev-Letelier Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20287v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work focuses on the emergence of dark phases (dark energy imprints) in the radial wave function of scalar particles. We achieve this by presenting novel solutions of the Klein-Gordon equation in a spherically symmetric spacetime, encompassing a black hole, a quintessential fluid, and a cloud of strings. We determine the exact solution for the spacetime metric, analyze the admissible ranges for its physical parameters, and discuss the event horizon formation. Subsequently, we detail the solution of the Klein-Gordon equation and explore three distinct cases of dark phases, corresponding to the quintessence state parameter $\alpha_{Q}$ taking the values $0$, $1/2$, and $1$. Notably, the case where $\alpha_{Q} = 1$ holds particular significance due to current observational constraints on dark energy.</description>

      <title>Scattering Entanglement Entropy and Its Implications for Electroweak Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06001v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the connection between the entanglement entropy in scattering processes and the dynamics of electroweak phase transitions. Recent work has shown that the scattering entanglement entropy can provide new insight into Standard Model parameters. In this study, we propose that the maximum of the entanglement entropy in scattering amplitudes may serve as a diagnostic for first-order electroweak phase transitions in the early universe. We analyze a simplified extension of the Standard Model consisting of the Higgs boson $h$ coupled to $O(N)$ real singlet scalars $S$ via the Higgs portal coupling $\lambda_{hS}$. By explicitly calculating the maximum entanglement entropy, we demonstrate that it grows with increasing $\lambda_{hS}$, and that both first-order and strong first-order electroweak phase transitions are favored in regions of parameter space with large maximum entropy. Our results suggest that entanglement-based observables may encode meaningful information about the underlying dynamics of electroweak symmetry breaking and provide a novel perspective on phase transition phenomena.</description>

      <title>Could Planck Star Remnants be Dark Matter?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03334v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the end state of gravitational collapse under quantum gravity effects and propose that Planck Star Remnants (PSR), formed via nonsingular bounces, could serve as viable dark matter candidates. Within the framework of Loop Quantum Cosmology, we model the collapse of a homogeneous matter distribution and show that the classical singularity is replaced by a quantum bounce at the Planck density. By analytically matching the Friedmann Lemaitre Robertson Walker (FLRW) interior to an exterior Schwarzschild spacetime using the Israel junction conditions, we demonstrate that the bounce remains causally hidden from external observers, avoiding any observable re-expansion. This naturally leads to the formation of stable, non-radiating PSR, whose radius coincides with the Schwarzschild radius when the black hole mass approaches the Planck mass as a result of Hawking evaporation. We suggest that such remnants may originate from evaporating primordial black holes in the early universe, and estimate the relic abundance needed for PSR to account for the observed dark matter density. We also discuss some crucial differences between PSR and previous proposals of Planck mass relics. The scenario is shown to be consistent with existing astrophysical and cosmological constraints, offering a unified framework connecting quantum gravitational collapse, and the nature of dark matter.</description>

      <title>Landau-Ginzburg Paradigm of Topological Phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05319v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topologically ordered matter phases have been regarded as beyond the Landau-Ginzburg symmetry breaking paradigm of matter phases. Recent studies of anyon condensation in topological phases, however, may fit topological phases back in the Landau-Ginzburg paradigm. To truly do so, we realized that the string-net model of topological phases is in fact an effective lattice gauge theory coupled with anyonic matter once two modifications are made: (1) We reinterpret anyons as matter fields coupled to lattice gauge fields, thus extending the HGW model to a genuine Hamiltonian lattice gauge theory. (2) By explicitly incorporating the internal degrees of freedom of anyons, we construct an enlarged Hilbert space that supports well-defined gauge transformations and covariant coupling, restoring the analogy with conventional lattice gauge field theory. In this modified string-net model, topological phase transitions induced by anyon condensation and their consequent phenomena, such as order parameter fields, coherent states, Goldstone modes, and gapping gauge degrees of freedom, can be formulated exactly as Landau's effective theory of the Higgs mechanism. To facilitate the understanding, we also compare anyon condensation to/with the Higgs boson condensation in the electroweak theory and the Cooper pair condensation.</description>

      <title>Butterfly in Spacetime: Inherent Instabilities in Stable Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07562v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper numerically studies if the stability of a stable black hole is robustness against the small perturbation on geometry near its event horizon. As a toy model, it encodes the such perturbation into deformations of Regge-Wheeler potential. It considers three different types of local deformations-the negative static bump potential, the stochastic potential and bump potential modulated by time function in low frequency limit. Our numerical results show that infinitesimal local deformations on Regge-Wheeler potential near the horizon can overturn stability of an arbitrarily strongly stable black hole, implying that late-time behavior of a stable black hole is extremely sensitive to geometry near horizon. Specially, certain deformations that stabilize systems in flat backgrounds can destabilize otherwise stable black holes. It also shows that horizon-induced redshift transforms near-horizon quantum fluctuations into classical-scale stochastic deformations capable of triggering instability, implying that even an isolated black hole cannot keep stable in extended timescales.</description>

      <title>Free Probability in a Minimal Quantum Circuit Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11197v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent experimental and theoretical developments in many-body quantum systems motivate the study of their out-of-equilibrium properties through multi-time correlation functions. We consider the dynamics of higher-order out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs) in a minimal circuit model for quantum dynamics. This model mimics the dynamics of a structured subsystem locally coupled to a maximally random environment. We prove the exponential decay of all higher-order OTOCs and fully characterize the relevant time scales, showing how local operators approach free independence at late times. We show that the effects of the environment on the local subsystem can be captured in a higher-order influence matrix, which allows for a Markovian description of the dynamics provided an auxiliary degree of freedom is introduced. This degree of freedom directly yields a dynamical picture for the OTOCs in terms of free cumulants from free probability, consistent with recent predictions from the full eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH). This approach and the relevant influence matrix are expected to be applicable in more general settings and present a first step to characterizing quantum memory in higher-order OTOCs.</description>

      <title>Emergent quantum field theories on curved spacetimes in spinor Bose-Einstein condensates: from scalar to Proca fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13297v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider excitations of a spin-1 Bose-Einstein-condensate (BEC) in the vicinity of different mean-field configurations and derive mappings to emergent relativistic quantum field theories minimally coupled to curved acoustic spacetimes. The quantum fields are typically identified with Nambu-Goldstone bosons, such that the structure of the analogue quantum field theories on curved spacetimes depends on the (spontaneous) symmetry breaking pattern of the respective ground-state. The emergent spacetime geometries are independent of each other and exhibit bi-metricity in the polar and antiferromagnetic phase, whereas one has tri-metricity in the ferromagnetic phase. Compared to scalar BECs, the spinor degrees of freedom allow to investigate massive vector and scalar fields where the former is a spin-nematic rotation mode in the polar phase which can be cast into a Proca field that is minimally coupled to a curved spacetime that emerges on length scales larger than the spin-healing length. Finally, we specify the Zeeman couplings and the condensate trap to be spacetime-dependent such that a cosmological FLRW-metric can be achieved. This work enables a pathway towards quantum-simulating cosmological particle production of Proca quanta via quenching the quadratic Zeeman-coefficient or via magnetic field ramps, which both result in the creation of spin-nematic squeezed states.</description>

      <title>Einstein causality of quantum measurements in the Tomonaga-Schwinger picture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14693v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When quantum measurements are conducted over spacelike-separated regions of spacetime, a natural and commonly assumed physical postulate, called Einstein causality, asserts that they should commute. In this paper, we provide a generalisation to L\"uders' rule \`a la Aharonov-Albert in those globally hyperbolic spacetimes which allow unitarily equivalent Hilbert spaces to be defined along Cauchy hypersurfaces, thus relying on the existence of an interaction picture \`a la Tomonaga-Schwinger. We show that under this rule, selective quantum measurements satisfy a state-independent anyonic commutation relation over spacelike-separated (pre)compact regions. We highlight that this propagates to positive operator-valued measures (POVMs), where the commutation is necessarily bosonic. In the simplistic scenario where the measurements are assumed to be instantaneous, this implies quantum no-signalling for non-selective measurements. We then examine Sorkin's impossible measurements and show that immediate contradictions can be averted as long as collapse-inducing measurements are irreversible. We finish by discussing the possibility of extending such results beyond the interaction picture.</description>
