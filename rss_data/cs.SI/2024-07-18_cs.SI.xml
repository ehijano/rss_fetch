      <title>Physical partisan proximity outweighs online ties in predicting US voting outcomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Affective polarization and increasing social divisions affect social mixing and the spread of information across online and physical spaces, reinforcing social and electoral cleavages and influencing political outcomes. Here, using aggregated and de-identified co-location and online network data, we investigate the relationship between partisan exposure and voting patterns in the USA by comparing three dimensions of partisan exposure: physical proximity and exposure to the same social contexts, online social ties, and residential sorting. By leveraging various statistical modeling approaches, we consistently find that partisan exposure in the physical space, as captured by co-location patterns, more accurately predicts electoral outcomes in US counties, outperforming online and residential exposures across metropolitan and non-metro areas. Moreover, our results show that physical partisan proximity is the best predictor of voting patterns in swing counties, where the election results are most uncertain. We also estimate county-level experienced partisan segregation and examine its relationship with individuals' demographic and socioeconomic characteristics. Focusing on metropolitan areas, our results confirm the presence of extensive partisan segregation in the US and show that offline partisan isolation, both considering physical encounters or residential sorting, is higher than online segregation and is primarily associated with educational attainment. Our findings emphasize the importance of physical space in understanding the relationship between social networks and political behavior, in contrast to the intense scrutiny focused on online social networks and elections.</description>

      <title>The Role of Network and Identity in the Diffusion of Hashtags</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although the spread of behaviors is influenced by many social factors, existing literature tends to study the effects of single factors -- most often, properties of the social network -- on the final cascade. In order to move towards a more integrated view of cascades, this paper offers the first comprehensive investigation into the role of two social factors in the diffusion of 1,337 popular hashtags representing the production of novel culture on Twitter: 1) the topology of the Twitter social network and 2) performance of each user's probable demographic identity. Here, we show that cascades are best modeled using a combination of network and identity, rather than either factor alone. This combined model best reproduces a composite index of ten cascade properties across all 1,337 hashtags. However, there is important heterogeneity in what social factors are required to reproduce different properties of hashtag cascades. For instance, while a combined network+identity model best predicts the popularity of cascades, a network-only model has better performance in predicting cascade growth and an identity-only model in adopter composition. We are able to predict what type of hashtag is best modeled by each combination of features and use this to further improve performance. Additionally, consistent with prior literature on the combined network+identity model most outperforms the single-factor counterfactuals among hashtags used for expressing racial or regional identity, stance-taking, talking about sports, or variants of existing cultural trends with very slow- or fast-growing communicative need. In sum, our results imply the utility of multi-factor models in predicting cascades, in order to account for the varied ways in which network, identity, and other social factors play a role in the diffusion of hashtags on Twitter.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Scaling Laws in the Regulatory Functions of Reddit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Online platforms like Reddit, Wikipedia, and Facebook are integral to modern life, enabling content creation and sharing through posts, comments, and discussions. Despite their virtual and often anonymous nature, these platforms need rules and oversight to maintain a safe and productive environment. As these communities grow, a key question arises: how does the need for regulatory functions scale? Do larger groups require more regulatory actions and oversight per person, or can they manage with less? Our analysis of Reddit's regulatory functions reveals robust scaling relationships across different subreddits, suggesting universal patterns between community size and the amount of regulation needed. We found that the number of comments and moderator actions, such as comment removals, grew faster than the community size, with superlinear exponents of 1.12 and 1.18, respectively. However, bot-based rule enforcement did not keep pace with community growth, exhibiting a slightly sublinear exponent of 0.95. Further analysis of the residuals from these scaling behaviors identified a 'trade-off axis,' where one-way coordination mechanisms (bots and moderators) counteract two-way interactions (comments) and vice versa. Our findings suggest that a more proactive moderation approach, characterized by increased bot activity and moderator comment removals, tends to result in less user engagement under the scaling framework. Understanding these natural scaling patterns and interactions can help platform administrators and policymakers foster healthy online communities while mitigating harmful behaviors such as harassment, doxxing, and misinformation. Without proper regulation, these negative behaviors can proliferate and cause significant damage. Targeted interventions based on these insights are key to ensuring online platforms remain safe and beneficial spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fairness-aware graph learning has gained increasing attention in recent years. Nevertheless, there lacks a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate and compare different fairness-aware graph learning methods, which blocks practitioners from choosing appropriate ones for broader real-world applications. In this paper, we present an extensive benchmark on ten representative fairness-aware graph learning methods. Specifically, we design a systematic evaluation protocol and conduct experiments on seven real-world datasets to evaluate these methods from multiple perspectives, including group fairness, individual fairness, the balance between different fairness criteria, and computational efficiency. Our in-depth analysis reveals key insights into the strengths and limitations of existing methods. Additionally, we provide practical guidance for applying fairness-aware graph learning methods in applications. To the best of our knowledge, this work serves as an initial step towards comprehensively understanding representative fairness-aware graph learning methods to facilitate future advancements in this area.</description>

      <title>UTG: Towards a Unified View of Snapshot and Event Based Models for Temporal Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Temporal graphs have gained increasing importance due to their ability to model dynamically evolving relationships. These graphs can be represented through either a stream of edge events or a sequence of graph snapshots. Until now, the development of machine learning methods for both types has occurred largely in isolation, resulting in limited experimental comparison and theoretical crosspollination between the two. In this paper, we introduce Unified Temporal Graph (UTG), a framework that unifies snapshot-based and event-based machine learning models under a single umbrella, enabling models developed for one representation to be applied effectively to datasets of the other. We also propose a novel UTG training procedure to boost the performance of snapshot-based models in the streaming setting. We comprehensively evaluate both snapshot and event-based models across both types of temporal graphs on the temporal link prediction task. Our main findings are threefold: first, when combined with UTG training, snapshotbased models can perform competitively with event-based models such as TGN and GraphMixer even on event datasets. Second, snapshot-based models are at least an order of magnitude faster than most event-based models during inference. Third, while event-based methods such as NAT and DyGFormer outperforms snapshotbased methods on both types of temporal graphs, this is because they leverage joint neighborhood structural features thus emphasizing the potential to incorporate these features into snapshot-based models as well. These findings highlight the importance of comparing model architectures independent of the data format and suggest the potential of combining the efficiency of snapshot-based models with the performance of event-based models in the future.</description>

      <title>Across Platforms and Languages: Dutch Influencers and Legal Disclosures on Instagram, YouTube and TikTok</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Content monetization on social media fuels a growing influencer economy. Influencer marketing remains largely undisclosed or inappropriately disclosed on social media. Non-disclosure issues have become a priority for national and supranational authorities worldwide, who are starting to impose increasingly harsher sanctions on them. This paper proposes a transparent methodology for measuring whether and how influencers comply with disclosures based on legal standards. We introduce a novel distinction between disclosures that are legally sufficient (green) and legally insufficient (yellow). We apply this methodology to an original dataset reflecting the content of 150 Dutch influencers publicly registered with the Dutch Media Authority based on recently introduced registration obligations. The dataset consists of 292,315 posts and is multi-language (English and Dutch) and cross-platform (Instagram, YouTube and TikTok). We find that influencer marketing remains generally underdisclosed on social media, and that bigger influencers are not necessarily more compliant with disclosure standards.</description>

      <title>Conspiracy theories and where to find them on TikTok</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: TikTok has skyrocketed in popularity over recent years, especially among younger audiences, thanks to its viral trends and social challenges. However, concerns have been raised about the potential of this platform to promote and amplify online harmful and dangerous content. Leveraging the official TikTok Research API and collecting a longitudinal dataset of 1.5M videos shared in the US over a period of 3 years, our study analyzes the presence of videos promoting conspiracy theories, providing a lower-bound estimate of their prevalence (approximately 0.1% of all videos) and assessing the effects of the new Creator Program, which provides new ways for creators to monetize, on the supply of conspiratorial content. We evaluate the capabilities of state-of-the-art open Large Language Models to identify conspiracy theories after extracting audio transcriptions of videos, finding that they can detect harmful content with high precision but with overall performance comparable to fine-tuned traditional language models such as RoBERTa. Our findings are instrumental for content moderation strategies that aim to understand and mitigate the spread of harmful content on rapidly evolving social media platforms like TikTok.</description>

      <title>Exact Graph Matching in Correlated Gaussian-Attributed Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph matching problem aims to identify node correspondence between two or more correlated graphs. Previous studies have primarily focused on models where only edge information is provided. However, in many social networks, not only the relationships between users, represented by edges, but also their personal information, represented by features, are present. In this paper, we address the challenge of identifying node correspondence in correlated graphs, where additional node features exist, as in many real-world settings. We propose a two-step procedure, where we initially match a subset of nodes only using edge information, and then match the remaining nodes using node features. We derive information-theoretic limits for exact graph matching on this model. Our approach provides a comprehensive solution to the real-world graph matching problem by providing systematic ways to utilize both edge and node information for exact matching of the graphs.</description>

      <title>American cities are defined by isolated rings and pockets characterized by limited socio-economic mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cities generate gains from interaction, but citizens often experience segregation as they move around the urban environment. Using GPS location data, we identify four distinct patterns of experienced segregation across US cities. Most common are affluent or poor neighborhoods where visitors lack diversity and residents have limited exposure to diversity elsewhere. Less frequent are majority-minority areas where residents must travel for diverse encounters, and wealthy urban zones with diverse visitors but where locals sort into homogeneous amenities. By clustering areas with similar mobility signatures, we uncover rings around cities and internal pockets where intergroup interaction is limited. Using a decision tree, we show that demography and location interact to create these zones. Our findings, persistent across time and prevalent across US cities, highlight the importance of considering both who is mixing and where in urban environments. Understanding the mesoscopic patterns that define experienced segregation in America illuminates neighborhood advantage and disadvantage, enabling interventions to foster economic opportunity and urban dynamism.</description>

      <title>The Dual Imperative: Innovation and Regulation in the AI Era</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article addresses the societal costs associated with the lack of regulation in Artificial Intelligence and proposes a framework combining innovation and regulation. Over fifty years of AI research, catalyzed by declining computing costs and the proliferation of data, have propelled AI into the mainstream, promising significant economic benefits. Yet, this rapid adoption underscores risks, from bias amplification and labor disruptions to existential threats posed by autonomous systems. The discourse is polarized between accelerationists, advocating for unfettered technological advancement, and doomers, calling for a slowdown to prevent dystopian outcomes. This piece advocates for a middle path that leverages technical innovation and smart regulation to maximize the benefits of AI while minimizing its risks, offering a pragmatic approach to the responsible progress of AI technology. Technical invention beyond the most capable foundation models is needed to contain catastrophic risks. Regulation is required to create incentives for this research while addressing current issues.</description>

      <title>Exploring the interplay of individual traits and interaction dynamics in preschool social networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Several studies have investigated human interaction using modern tracking techniques for face-to-face encounters across various settings and age groups. However, little attention has been given to understanding how individual characteristics relate to social behavior. This is particularly important in younger age groups due to its potential effects on early childhood development. In this study, conducted during the Complexity 72h Workshop, we analyze human social interactions in a French preschool, where children's face-to-face interactions were monitored using proximity sensors over an academic year. We use metadata from parent surveys and preschool linguistic tests, covering demographic information and home habits, to examine the interplay between individual characteristics and contact patterns. Using a mixture of approaches, from random forest classifiers to network-based metrics at both dyadic and higher-order (group) levels, we identify sex, age, language scores, and number of siblings as the variables displaying the most significant associations with interaction patterns. We explore these variables' relationships to interactions within and outside classrooms and across mixed and single-grade classes. At the group level, we investigate how group affinity affects group persistence. We also find that higher-order network centrality (hypercoreness) is higher among children with siblings, indicating different group embedding despite similar total contact duration. This study aligns with existing literature on early social development and highlights the importance of integrating individual traits into the study of human interactions. Focusing on 2-5-year-olds offers insights into emerging social preferences during critical phases of cognitive development. Future research could use these findings to enhance mechanistic models of complex social systems by incorporating individual traits.</description>

Abstract: Human collective tasks in teams and organizations increasingly require participation of members with diverse backgrounds working in networked social environments. However, little is known about how network structure and the functional diversity of member backgrounds would interact with each other and affect collective processes. Here we conducted three sets of human-subject experiments which involved 617 university students who collaborated anonymously in a collective ideation task on a custom-made online social network platform. We found that spatially clustered collectives with assortative background distribution tended to explore more diverse ideas than in other conditions, whereas collectives with random background distribution consistently generated ideas with the highest utility. We also found that higher network connectivity may improve individuals' overall experience but may not improve the collective performance regarding idea generation, idea diversity, and final idea quality.</description>

      <title>Toxic Bias: Perspective API Misreads German as More Toxic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12651v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Proprietary public APIs play a crucial and growing role as research tools among social scientists. Among such APIs, Google's machine learning-based Perspective API is extensively utilized for assessing the toxicity of social media messages, providing both an important resource for researchers and automatic content moderation. However, this paper exposes an important bias in Perspective API concerning German language text. Through an in-depth examination of several datasets, we uncover intrinsic language biases within the multilingual model of Perspective API. We find that the toxicity assessment of German content produces significantly higher toxicity levels than other languages. This finding is robust across various translations, topics, and data sources, and has significant consequences for both research and moderation strategies that rely on Perspective API. For instance, we show that, on average, four times more tweets and users would be moderated when using the German language compared to their English translation. Our findings point to broader risks associated with the widespread use of proprietary APIs within the computational social sciences.</description>

      <title>Friedkin-Johnsen Model for Opinion Dynamics on Signed Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10680v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A signed graph offers richer information than an unsigned graph, since it describes both collaborative and competitive relationships in social networks. In this paper, we study opinion dynamics on a signed graph, based on the Friedkin-Johnsen model. We first interpret the equilibrium opinion in terms of a defined random walk on an augmented signed graph, by representing the equilibrium opinion of every node as a combination of all nodes' internal opinions, with the coefficient of the internal opinion for each node being the difference of two absorbing probabilities. We then quantify some relevant social phenomena and express them in terms of the $\ell_2$ norms of vectors. We also design a nearly-linear time signed Laplacian solver for assessing these quantities, by establishing a connection between the absorbing probability of random walks on a signed graph and that on an associated unsigned graph. We further study the opinion optimization problem by changing the initial opinions of a fixed number of nodes, which can be optimally solved in cubic time. We provide a nearly-linear time algorithm with error guarantee to approximately solve the problem. Finally, we execute extensive experiments on sixteen real-life signed networks, which show that both of our algorithms are effective and efficient, and are scalable to massive graphs with over 20 million nodes.</description>
