      <title>Connectedness of fibers beyond semitoric systems II: ephemeral singular points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In an earlier paper, we proved the connectedness of the fibers of every $2n$-dimensional integrable system satisfying both: the action extends the action of an $(n-1)$-dimensional torus which has a proper moment map, and every tall singular point is non-degenerate and no such point has a hyperbolic block and connected $T$-stabilizer. Unfortunately, these criteria are fairly restrictive. Our main goal in this paper is to find a larger class of integrable systems that has connected fibers by weakening the non-degeneracy assumption above. To achieve this, we introduce ``ephemeral" degenerate singular points, examples of which have appeared in the literature in the context of $p \! : \! -q$ resonances and special Lagrangian fibrations. Finally, we construct a family of examples that shows that our main theorem meaningfully extends previous results.</description>

      <title>Boundary Depth and Deformations of Symplectic Cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the relation between two versions of symplectic cohomology associated to a Liouville domain $D$ embedded in a symplectic manifold $M$: the ambient version $SC^*_M(D)$ defined over the Novikov field and depending on the embedding, and the intrinsic version $SC^*_{\theta}(D)$ depending on the choice of a local Liouville form and defined over the ground field. We show that when $D$ has sufficiently small boundary depth, the ambient version can be viewed as a deformation of the intrinsic one. This is achieved by constructing a filtration whose associated graded reproduces the intrinsic theory, and developing quantitative tools to control the deformation. We apply our results to constructing local pieces of the SYZ mirror.</description>

      <title>Wild genus-zero quantum de Rham spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The wild de Rham spaces parameterize isomorphism classes of (stable) meromorphic connections, defined on principal bundles over wild Riemann surfaces. Working on the Riemann sphere, we will deformation-quantize the standard open part of de Rham spaces, which corresponds to the moduli of linear partial differential equations with meromorphic coefficients. We treat the general (possibly nongeneric) untwisted/unramified case with semisimple formal residue, for any polar divisor and reductive structure group, but without using parabolic/parahoric structure. The main ingredients are: i) constructing the quantum Hamiltonian reduction of a (tensor) product of quantized coadjoint orbits in dual truncated-current Lie algebras, involving the corresponding category-O Verma modules; and ii) establishing sufficient conditions on the coadjoint orbits, so that generically all meromorphic connections are stable, and the (semiclassical) moment map for the gauge-group action is faithfully flat.</description>

      <title>Constraints on symplectic quasi-states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08014v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that given a closed connected symplectic manifold equipped with a Borel probability measure, an arbitrarily large portion of the measure can be covered by a symplectically embedded polydisk, generalizing a result of Schlenk. We apply this to constraints on symplectic quasi-states. Quasi-states are a certain class of not necessarily linear functionals on the algebra of continuous functions of a compact space. When the space is a symplectic manifold, a more restrictive subclass of symplectic quasi-states was introduced by Entov--Polterovich. We use our embedding result to prove that a certain `soft' construction of quasi-states, which is due to Aarnes, cannot yield nonlinear symplectic quasi-states in dimension at least four.</description>

      <title>Outer symplectic billiards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07990v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A submanifold of the standard symplectic space determines a partially defined, multi-valued symplectic map, the outer symplectic billiard correspondence. Two points are in this correspondence if the midpoint of the segment connecting them is on the submanifold, and this segment is symplectically orthogonal to the tangent space of the submanifold at its midpoint. This is a far-reaching generalization of the outer billiard map in the plane; the particular cases, when the submanifold is a closed convex hypersurface or a Lagrangian submanifold, were considered earlier.
  Using a variational approach, we establish the existence of odd-periodic orbits of the outer symplectic billiard correspondence. On the other hand, we give examples of curves in 4-space which do not admit 4-periodic orbits at all. If the submanifold satisfies certain conditions (which are always satisfied if its dimension is at least half of the ambient dimension) we prove the existence of two $n$-reflection orbits connecting two transverse affine Lagrangian subspaces for every $n\geq1$. In addition, for every immersed closed submanifold, the number of single outer symplectic billiard ``shots" from one affine Lagrangian subspace to another is no less than the number of critical points of a smooth function on this submanifold.
  We study, in detail, the behavior of this correspondence when the submanifold is a curve or a Lagrangian submanifold. For Lagrangian submanifolds in 4-dimensional space we present a criterion for the outer symplectic billiard correspondence to be an actual map. We show, in every dimension, that if a Lagrangian submanifold has a cubic generating function, then the outer symplectic billiard correspondence is completely integrable in the Liouville sense.</description>

      <title>Regular Lagrangians in Lefschetz fibrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12170v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We characterize regularity of Lagrangian submanifolds in Weinstein Lefschetz fibrations, establishing a conjecture of Giroux and Pardon. Our main result is the Weinstein analogue of a closed symplectic Lefschetz pencil result of Auroux, Mu\~noz, and Presas. As an application, given a Legendrian link in tight $S^3$ and an exact filling which is part of an arboreal skeleton for the $4$-ball, we build a Lefschetz fibration such that the image of the filling and all of its mutations are arcs in the base.</description>

      <title>Direct Sampling of Confined Polygons in Linear Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04885v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an algorithm for sampling tightly confined random equilateral closed polygons in three-space which has runtime linear in the number of edges. Using symplectic geometry, sampling such polygons reduces to sampling a moment polytope, and in our confinement model this polytope turns out to be very natural from a combinatorial point of view. This connection to combinatorics yields both our fast sampling algorithm and explicit formulas for the expected distances of vertices to the origin. We use our algorithm to investigate the expected total curvature of confined polygons, leading to a very precise conjecture for the asymptotics of total curvature.</description>

      <title>From Hitchin Systems to Rational Elliptic Surfaces with C*-actions via Orbifold Hilbert Schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14812v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using orbifold Hilbert schemes, we compactify all two-dimensional Hitchin systems corresponding to types A0-tilde, D4-tilde, E6-tilde, E7-tilde, and E8-tilde, thereby obtaining four rational elliptic surfaces with C*-actions. Their singular fibers and relative minimal models are listed in the main table. To this end, we prove that Hilbert schemes of orbifold surfaces are connected smooth projective schemes under suitable conditions, and we use the Hilbert-Chow morphism to construct the minimal resolutions of the coarse moduli spaces.</description>
