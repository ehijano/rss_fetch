      <title>A robust neural determination of the source-count distribution of the Fermi-LAT sky at high latitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past 16 years, the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) has significantly advanced our view of the GeV gamma-ray sky, yet several key questions remain - such as the composition of the isotropic gamma-ray background, the origin of the Fermi Bubbles or the potential presence of signatures from exotic physics like dark matter. Addressing these challenges requires sophisticated astrophysical modeling and robust statistical methods capable of handling high-dimensional parameter spaces. In this work, we analyze 14 years of high-latitude ($|b|\geq30^{\circ}$) Fermi-LAT data in the range from 1 to 10 GeV using simulation-based inference (SBI) via neural ratio estimation. This approach allows us to detect individual gamma-ray sources and derive a list of significant gamma-ray emitters containing more than 98\% of all sources listed in the Fermi-LAT Fourth Source Catalog (4FGL) with a flux $S&gt;3\times10^{-10}\;\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ (about a factor of three larger than the flux above which 4FGL is nearly complete), without any non-4FGL source detected in that flux range. Additionally, we reconstruct the source-count distribution in both parametric and non-parametric forms, achieving large agreement with previous literature results as well as those sources detected by our SBI pipeline. We also quantitatively validate our gamma-ray emission simulator via an anomaly detection technique, demonstrating that the synthetic data closely reproduces the complexity of the real observations.</description>

      <title>Early Shock-Cooling Observations and Progenitor Constraints of Type IIb SN 2024uwq</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present early multi-wavelength photometric and spectroscopic observations of the Type IIb supernova SN 2024uwq, capturing its shock-cooling emission phase and double-peaked light curve evolution. Early spectra reveal broad H-alpha (v ~ 15,500 km s$^{-1}$) and He I P-Cygni profiles of similar strengths. Over time the He I lines increase in strength while the H-alpha decreases, consistent with a hydrogen envelope ($M_{env}$ = 0.7 - 1.35 $M_\odot$ ) overlying helium-rich ejecta. Analytic modeling of early shock cooling emission and bolometric light analysis constrains the progenitor to a partially stripped star with radius R = 10 - 60 $R_\odot$, consistent with a blue/yellow supergiant with an initial ZAMS mass of 12 - 20 $M_\odot$ , likely stripped via binary interaction. SN 2024uwq occupies a transitional position between compact and extended Type IIb supernovae, highlighting the role of binary mass-transfer efficiency in shaping a continuum of stripped-envelope progenitors. Our results underscore the importance of both early UV/optical observations to characterize shock breakout signatures critical to map the diversity in evolutionary pathways of massive stars. Upcoming time domain surveys including Rubin Observatory's LSST and UV missions like ULTRASAT and UVEX will revolutionise our ability to systematically capture these early signatures, probing the full diversity of stripped progenitors and their explosive endpoints.</description>

      <title>Radiative magnetohydrodynamics simulation of minidisks in equal-mass massive black hole binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are on the cusp of detecting gravitational waves (GWs) from individual massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) with the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna and pulsar-timing arrays. These MBHBs may be surrounded by circumbinary disks and minidisks, the electromagnetic emission from which are essential for localizing the MBHBs on the sky. Here we present the first radiative magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD) minidisk simulation that directly solves the radiative transfer equation on discretized grid rays. The simulation examines one of the minidisks in an equal-mass $2\times10^7\,M_\odot$ MBHB separated by 100 gravitational radii. Minidisks simulated with and without radiative effects resemble each other qualitatively but differ in several key aspects. The RMHD minidisk is denser and geometrically thinner than the magnetohydrodynamics minidisk. Furthermore, the RMHD minidisk, with a nonaxisymmetric photosphere and temperature distribution, produces an anisotropic illumination pattern. As a result, the observed radiative flux of two RMHD minidisks orbiting each other varies at half the binary orbital period, a feature independent of relativistic boosting and lensing effects. Such periodic light curves, if identified in upcoming optical transient surveys, could reveal the existence of MBHBs on the way to merger, particularly if they are in a constant phase relation with detected GWs.</description>

      <title>Evidence of a fraction of LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA events coming from active galactic nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation channels of the gravitational-wave (GW) sources detected by LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA (LVK) remain poorly constrained. Active galactic nucleus (AGN) has been proposed as one of the potential hosts but the fraction of GW events originating from AGNs has not been quantified. Here, we constrain the AGN-origin fraction $f_{\rm agn}$ by analyzing the spatial correlation between GW source localizations ($O1\!-\!O4$a) and AGN distributions (SDSS DR16). We find evidence of an excess of low-luminosity ($L_{\rm bol} \le 10^{45}~\!\mathrm{erg~s}^{-1}$) as well as low-Eddington ratio ($\lambda_{\rm Edd} \le 0.05$) AGNs around the LVK events, the explanation of which requires $f_{\rm agn} = 0.39^{+0.41}_{-0.32}$ and $0.29^{+0.40}_{-0.25}$ (90\% confidence level) of the LVK events originating from these respective AGN populations. Monte Carlo simulations confirm that this correlation is unlikely to arise from random coincidence, further supported by anomalous variation of the error of $f_{\rm agn}$ with GW event counts. These results provide the first observational evidence for GW sources coming from either low-luminosity or low-accretion-rate AGNs, offering critical insights into the environmental dependencies of the formation of GW sources.</description>

      <title>Disk-Outflow Symbiosis in GRMHD Simulations: Explaining Hard-State ULXs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) have captivated researchers for decades due to their exceptionally high luminosities and unique spectral characteristics. Some of these sources defy expectations by exhibiting super-Eddington luminosities with respect to stellar mass sources even in their low-hard state. Numerical steady-state calculations suggest that ULXs in this state can be explained as highly magnetized advective accretion sources around stellar-mass black holes. To explore this further, we employ GRMHD simulations using the publicly available code, BHAC (Black Hole Accretion Code), to model the behavior of highly magnetized advective accretion flows around a black hole. Our simulations demonstrate that such systems can indeed produce the intense luminosities observed in ULXs. Additionally, we validate that the magnetic fields required for these high emissions are of the order of $10^7$ Gauss, consistent with previous numerical steady-state findings.</description>

      <title>Photometry and Spectroscopy of SN 2024pxl: A Luminosity Link Among Type Iax Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present extensive ultraviolet to optical photometric and optical to near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopic follow-up observations of the nearby intermediate-luminosity ($M_V = -$16.81$\pm$0.19~mag) Type Iax supernova (SN) 2024pxl in NGC 6384. SN~2024pxl exhibits a faster light curve evolution than the high-luminosity members of this class, and slower than low-luminosity events. The observationally well-constrained rise time of $\sim$10 days and an estimated synthesized $^{56}$Ni mass of 0.03 M$_\odot$, based on analytical modeling of the pseudobolometric light curve, are consistent with models of the weak deflagration of a carbon-oxygen white dwarf. Our optical spectral sequence of SN~2024pxl shows weak \ion{Si}{2} lines and spectral evolution similar to other high-luminosity Type Iax SNe, but also prominent early-time \ion{C}{2} line, like lower-luminosity Type Iax SNe. The late-time optical spectrum of SN~2024pxl closely matches that of SN 2014dt, and its NIR spectral evolution aligns with those of other well-studied, high-luminosity Type Iax SNe. The spectral-line expansion velocities of SN~2024pxl are at the lower end of the Type Iax SN velocity distribution, and the velocity distribution of iron-group elements compared to intermediate-mass elements suggests that the ejecta are mixed on large scales, as expected in pure deflagration models. SN~2024pxl exhibits characteristics intermediate between those of high-luminosity and low-luminosity Type~Iax SNe, further establishing a link across this diverse class.</description>

      <title>JWST and Ground-based Observations of the Type Iax Supernovae SN 2024pxl and SN 2024vjm: Evidence for Weak Deflagration Explosions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present panchromatic optical $+$ near-infrared (NIR) $+$ mid-infrared (MIR) observations of the intermediate-luminosity Type Iax supernova (SN Iax) 2024pxl and the extremely low-luminosity SN Iax 2024vjm. JWST observations provide unprecedented MIR spectroscopy of SN Iax, spanning from $+$11 to $+$42 days past maximum light. We detect forbidden emission lines in the MIR at these early times while the optical and NIR are dominated by permitted lines with an absorption component. Panchromatic spectra at early times can thus simultaneously show nebular and photospheric lines, probing both inner and outer layers of the ejecta. We identify spectral lines not seen before in SN Iax, including [Mg II] 4.76 $\mu$m, [Mg II] 9.71 $\mu$m, [Ne II] 12.81 $\mu$m, and isolated O I 2.76 $\mu$m that traces unburned material. Forbidden emission lines of all species are centrally peaked with similar kinematic distributions, indicating that the ejecta are well mixed in both SN 2024pxl and SN 2024vjm, a hallmark of pure deflagration explosion models. Radiative transfer modeling of SN 2024pxl shows good agreement with a weak deflagration of a near-Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarf, but additional IR flux is needed to match the observations, potentially attributable to a surviving remnant. We favor a weak deflagration origin for SN 2024vjm because of its panchromatic spectral similarity to SN 2024pxl, despite the large difference in luminosity. However, our comparison weak deflagration models are all too luminous and rapidly fading compared to SN 2024vjm; future modeling should push to even weaker explosions and include the contribution of a bound remnant. Our observations demonstrate the diagnostic power of panchromatic spectroscopy for unveiling explosion physics in thermonuclear supernovae.</description>

      <title>Stellar wind parameters of massive stars in accretion-powered High Mass X-ray Binary Pulsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The process of mass-exchange between the components of High Mass X-ray Binary (HMXB) systems with neutron stars undergoing wind-fed accretion is discussed. The X-ray luminosity of these systems allows us to evaluate the mass capture rate by the neutron star from the stellar wind of its massive companion and set limits on the relative velocity between the neutron star and the wind. We find that the upper limit to the wind velocity in the orbital plane during the high state of the X-ray source is in the range 120--1000 km/s, which is by a factor of 2--4 lower than both the terminal wind velocity and the speed of the wind flowing out from the polar regions of massive stars for all the objects under investigation. This finding is valid not only for the systems with Be stars, but also for those system in which the optical components do not exhibit the Be phenomenon. We also show that the lower limit to the radial wind velocity in these systems can unlikely be smaller than a few per cent of the orbital velocity of the neutron star. This provide us with a new constraint on the mass-transfer process in the outflowing disks of Be-type stars.</description>

      <title>Spectral Analysis of Cyg X-3 using simultaneous AstroSat and Insight-HXMT Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results from the spectral analysis of Cygnus X-3 using simultaneous data from AstroSat and Insight-HXMT during its soft state. A pure reflection spectrum, including emission lines of iron, silica, and sulfur, provides a good fit to the spectra. Orbital phase-resolved analysis shows no significant spectral parameter variations, except for the normalization. Leveraging IXPE polarization results, we model the funnel-shaped geometry and estimate scattered flux and observed polarization for various funnel parameters and observer inclinations. We consider two scenarios: reflection from the funnel walls and scattering by gas within the funnel. Our results reconfirm previous findings, showing that reflection can produce a high polarization degree (PD) of 23$\%$, but not a low PD of 12$\%$. Conversely, scattering can produce a PD of 10-12$\%$, but not as high as 23$\%$ for a fixed observer inclination of $30^\circ$. Scattering results align with previous findings without absorption, but with absorption, PD drops significantly with increasing funnel opening angle. Thus, we can identify common funnel parameters that can produce the different observed PDs in the soft and hard states. The intrinsic luminosity of the source was estimated by comparing the results from a plane disk and the funnel model, to be $\sim7$ $\times$ 10$^{40}$ erg/s for 12$\%$ PD (scattering) and $\sim5$ $\times$ 10$^{41}$ erg/s for 23$\%$ PD (reflection). However, for the reflection model, the luminosity may decrease to $\sim$ 10$^{40}$ erg/s when the 23$\%$ PD observed is taken as a lower limit.</description>

      <title>Location of a Sample of GeV and Optical Outbursts in the Jets of Blazars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exact location of the $\gamma$-ray emitting region in blazar jets has long been a matter of debate. However, the location has important implications about the emission processes, geometric and physical parameters of the jet, as well as the nature of interaction of the jet with the interstellar and intergalactic medium. Diverse conclusions have been drawn by various authors based on a variety of methods applied to different data sets of many blazars, e.g., the location is less than 0.1 pc from the central engine within the broad line region (BLR) or a few or tens of pc downstream beyond the dusty torus or at some intermediate distance. Here we use a method, established in a previous work, in which the location of the GeV/optical emission is determined using the ratio of energy dissipated during contemporaneous outbursts at those wave bands. We apply it to a total of 47 multi-wavelength outbursts in 10 blazars. We find that the location of the GeV/optical emission is beyond the BLR for all cases. This result is consistent with other studies, in which the location has been determined for a large sample of blazars. We compare the location determined by our method for several GeV outbursts of multiple blazars to that obtained by other authors using different methods. We find that our results are consistent in such one-to-one comparison in most cases, for which the required data were available.</description>

For temperatures $\gtrsim 7 \times 10^8$K -- characteristic of carbon burning in the massive progenitors of supernovae and ONeMg white dwarfs -- the 440 keV first excited state of $^{23}$Na is thermally populated, with its repeated decays pumping stellar energy into escaping axions. Odd-A nuclear abundances are typically very low in high-temperature stellar environments (or absent entirely due to burn-up). $^{23}$Na is an exception: $\approx 0.1 M_\odot$ of the isotope is synthesized during carbon burning then maintained at $\approx 10^9$K for times ranging up to $6 \times 10^4$y. Using MESA simulations, a galactic model, and sampling over progenitor masses, locations, and evolutionary stages, we find a continuous flux at earth of $\langle \phi_a \rangle \approx 22$/cm$^2$s for $g^\mathrm{eff}_{aNN} = 10^{-9}$. Some fraction of these axions convert to photons as they propagate through the galactic magnetic field, producing a distinctive 440 keV line $\gamma$ ray detectable by all-sky detectors like the Compton Spectrometer and Imager (COSI). Assuming a 1$\mu$G galactic magnetic field and a sufficiently light axion mass, we find that COSI will be able to probe $| g_{aNN}^\mathrm{eff} g_{a \gamma \gamma} | \gtrsim1.8 \times 10^{-22}$ GeV$^{-1}$ at $3\sigma$ after two years of surveying.</description>

      <title>Alien-Type-Ia supernovae from the Milky Way merger history and one possible candidate -- Kepler's supernova</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Milky Way is a dynamic and evolving system shaped by numerous merger events throughout its history. These mergers bring stars with kinematic and dynamic properties differing from the main stellar population. However, it remains uncertain whether any of the Galactic supernova remnants can be attributed to such a merger origin.In this work, we compare the progenitor of Kepler's supernova to its nearby stars, ``alien'' stars, and in-situ Milky Way stellar populations. We uncover the abnormal kinematics and dynamics of Kepler's supernova and propose that its progenitor may have an extragalactic origin. We call the SNe Ia produced by stars accreted into the Milky Way through merger events ``Alien-Type-Ia supernovae'' (Alien-SNe-Ia) since they are cosmic immigrants. We estimate the rate of Alien-SNe-Ia exploded recently, using two methods: through galactic chemical evolution (using GalCEM), and through a method without considering exact star formation history, introduced for the first time in this paper. We consider the past accretion of a few major satellite galaxies -- Kraken, Gaia-Enceladus/Sausage, Helmi streams, Sequoia, Sagittarius, Wukong/LMS-1, and Cetus -- assuming these were dry mergers. The first method yields $1.5\times 10^{-5} - 5.0\times10^{-5}\rm\,yr^{-1}$, while the second method yields a comparable ${3.1}^{+1.8}_{-{1.1}}\times10^{-5}\rm\,yr^{-1}$ as the rate estimates for recent Alien-SNe-Ia. These estimates represent lower bounds because we assumed no post-merger star formation.</description>

      <title>The Frequency-dependent Modulation Features of PSR J1948+3540</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using observations from GMRT and FAST, we conducted multi-wavelength studies on PSR J1948+3540 and analyzed its intensity modulation characteristics in detail. We found that the intensity modulation of this pulsar exhibits broad low-frequency modulation features. The modulation frequency/period is time-dependent, but the dominant modulation component varies with the observing frequency. Specifically, at low frequencies, the modulation is dominated by the first half of the middle component, while at high frequencies, it is dominated by the second half of the middle component. Spectral analysis revealed that the intensities of the leading and trailing components vary with the observing frequency, but the middle component does not change significantly. Besides, the polarization analyses reveal that the peak of the radiation intensity is located in the latter half of the middle component, whereas the linear polarization is dominant in the former half. However, due to the low degree of linear polarization, the change of the dominant modulation component with the observed frequency is not caused by the variation in linear polarization. The phenomenon of the dominant modulation component varying with observing frequency has not been reported before and remains difficult to understand within the current theoretical framework.</description>

      <title>A generalized solution for advection-dominated accretion flow, standard disc, and slim disc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aiming at a general description of four basic solutions describing the accretion processes, i.e., the Shakura-Sunyaev thin disc (SSD), the Shapiro-Lightman-Eardley solution (SLE), the slim disc, and the advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF), we present generalized axisymmetric height-averaged equations, where the entropy advection, the radiation pressure, and photon trapping effect are all included self-consistently. Our generalized solution can reproduce the ADAF, SLE, SSD, and slim disc branches in a wide range of accretion rates from sub- to super-Eddington accretion. An S-curve in the $\dot{m}-\Sigma$ plane is also reproduced, representing the SSD branch, the radiation-pressure-dominant branch, and the slim disc branch. The solution gives a natural transition between SSD and slim disc when photon trapping occurs in the accretion flow, producing a radially hybrid SSD-slim disc structure in a certain range of accretion rates. The coexistence of ADAF and SSD below a critical accretion rate is clearly shown with distinct advection fraction of accretion energy. We also present the luminosity, radiation efficiency, and spectrum from the generalized solutions for a large range of accretion rates in stellar mass black holes.</description>

      <title>Variability of the Faraday Rotation Measure in the Parsec-scale Jet of AGN 1633+382</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Faraday rotation measure (RM) variability of flat spectrum radio quasar 1633+382 on 5 epochs spanning from 2004 to 2008. We used 4 to 43~GHz VLBI polarization data from VLBA. Core RM across 4 to 15 GHz scales with a power index $a\sim2$, for $a$ in RM$\propto \nu^a$. We detected sign changes across epochs, both in the core and in the jet region. RM time variability in the core and jet region are not correlated, hence limiting the size of a possible Faraday screen. We relate the core RM variability to a new component emerging from the core region. For the jet region, we consider the jet-medium interaction to be a less likely cause of the RM variability because of the uniform spectral index distribution. The observed RM value variation requires a huge fluctuation in electron density or magnetic field, hence a foreground Faraday screen is less favoured. We further discuss other possibilities of the RM variability based on jet kinematics.</description>

      <title>A Systematic Search for X-ray Eclipse Events in Active Galactic Nuclei Observed by Swift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nuclear regions of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) likely host clumpy clouds that occasionally obscure the central X-ray source, causing eclipse events. These events offer a unique opportunity to study the properties and origins of such clouds. However, these transient events are rarely reported due to the need for extensive, long-term X-ray monitoring for years. Here, we conduct a systematic search for eclipse events in 40 AGNs well-monitored by the Swift X-ray Telescope (XRT) over the past 20 years, comprising a total of $\sim$11,000 observations. Our selection criteria rely on significant variations in X-ray flux and spectral shape. We identify 3 high-confidence events in 3 AGNs and 8 candidates in 6 AGNs, all in type I AGNs. The observed clouds have column densities of $N_{\rm H}~\sim$ (0.2 $-$ 31.2) $\times$ 10$^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$ and ionization degrees of log $\xi$ $\sim$ (-1.3 $-$ 2.2). For the 5 events with well-constrained duration, their distances from the central black hole range from (2.4 $-$ 179) $\times$ 10$^{4}$ $R_{\rm g}$, with 2 clouds near the dust sublimation zone, 2 farther out. Interestingly, we find tentative correlations between the cloud properties (i.e. ionization state and column density) and the black hole mass and mass accretion rate, implying their strong connection to the accretion process, potentially via outflows. Our study also demonstrates the potential of the new X-ray all-sky monitor, Einstein Probe, in providing more detection and physical constraints for such events.</description>

      <title>Evolution of a black hole cluster in full general relativity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We evolve for the first time in full general relativity a small, collisional N-body black hole cluster of arbitrary total mass M. The bound cluster is initially compact (radius R/M~10), stable, and consists of 25 equal-mass, nonspinning black holes. The dynamical interactions of compact objects in N-body clusters is of great interest for the formation of black holes in the upper mass gap as well as intermediate and supermassive black holes. These are potential sources of gravitational waves that may be detected by both current and future observatories. Unlike previous N-body Newtonian and post-Newtonian simulations, no "subgrid physics" is required to handle collisions and mergers. We can therefore confirm in full general relativity several predictions from these simulations and analytic estimates: the runaway growth of a large black hole via repeated mergers; spindown of the central black hole with increasing captures; the ejection of a black hole with a large asymptotic velocity due to a several-body interaction; and a regime where mergers occur primarily via direct collisions on highly eccentric orbits instead of quasicircular inspirals. We extract the gravitational wave signal and find it has several distinct features associated with the compact cluster regime. Our results suggest the signal is sufficiently loud that next generation observatories would likely be able to detect similar events across most of the observable universe. This work is a preliminary proof-of-principle study that we hope will open up a new arena for numerical relativity and the study of N-body compact systems.</description>

      <title>Probing Boson Clouds with Supermassive Black Hole Binaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rotating black holes can generate boson clouds via superradiance when the boson's Compton wavelength is comparable to the black hole's size. In binary systems, these clouds can produce distinctive observational imprints. Recent studies accounting for nonlinearities induced by orbital backreaction suggest that if the binary forms at a large separation, resonance transitions can significantly deplete the cloud, minimizing later observational consequences except for very specific orbital inclinations. In this paper, we extend this framework to supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs), considering the influence of their astrophysical evolutionary histories. We find that, before entering the gravitational wave (GW) radiation stage, the additional energy loss channels can accelerate orbital evolution. This acceleration makes hyperfine resonant transitions inefficient, allowing a sufficient portion of the cloud to remain for later direct observations. We further discuss the ionization effects and cloud depletion occurring at this stage. Based on these theoretical insights, we explore how multi-messenger observations for SMBHBs can be utilized to detect the ionization effects of boson clouds by examining changes in the orbital period decay rate via electromagnetic measurements and variations in GW strain over a wide frequency band. Our findings reveal a complex dependence on the binary's total mass, mass ratio, and boson mass, emphasizing the significant role of astrophysical evolution histories in detecting boson clouds within binaries.</description>

      <title>Carbon from massive binary-stripped stars over cosmic time: effect of metallicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The origin of carbon in the Universe remains uncertain. At solar metallicity, binary-stripped massive stars -- stars that lost their envelope through stable interaction with a companion -- have been suggested to produce twice as much carbon as their single-star counterparts. However, understanding the chemical evolution of galaxies over cosmic time requires examining stellar yields across a range of metallicities. Using the stellar evolution code MESA, we compute the carbon yields from wind mass loss and supernova explosions of single and binary-stripped stars across a wide range of initial masses ($10$-$46,M_\odot$), metallicities ($Z = 0.0021$, $0.0047$, $0.0142$), and initial orbital periods ($10$-$5000$ days). We find that metallicity is the dominant factor influencing the carbon yields of massive stars, outweighing the effects of binarity and detailed orbital parameters. Since the chemical yields from binary massive stars are highly sensitive to metallicity, we caution that yields predicted at solar metallicity should not be directly extrapolated to lower metallicities. At sub-solar metallicities, particularly below $1/7$ solar, weak stellar winds and inefficient binary stripping result in carbon yields from binary-stripped stars that closely resemble those of single stars. This suggests that binary-stripped massive stars are unlikely to explain the presence of carbon-enhanced metal-poor stars or the carbon enrichment observed in high-redshift galaxies as probed by the James Webb Space Telescope. Our findings only concern the stripped stars in massive binaries. The impact of other outcomes of binary star evolution, in particular stellar mergers and accretors, remains largely unexplored but will be necessary for a full understanding of the role of massive binaries in nucleosynthesis.</description>

      <title>A Quasar Pair Catalog Compiled from DESI DR1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a catalog of quasar pairs (QPs) constructed from the DESI DR1 quasar sample, which includes approximately 1.6 million spectroscopically confirmed quasars. Using a redshift-dependent self-matching procedure and applying physical constraints on projected separation (up to 110 kpc) and line-of-sight velocity difference (up to 2000 km/s), we identified 1,842 candidate quasar pairs. Each pair is spectroscopically confirmed, providing reliable redshift and velocity information. We visually classified these systems using DESI Legacy Imaging and SPARCL spectral data into four categories: QP (quasar pairs), QPC (quasar pair candidates), LQC (lensed quasar candidates), and Uncertain. The redshift distribution peaks at around z = 1 to 2.5, and 64.3 percent of QPs have line-of-sight velocity differences below 600 km/s, suggesting that many systems may be physically associated. This catalog provides a statistically meaningful sample for future studies of dual AGNs, gravitational lensing, and quasar clustering.</description>

      <title>Axion effects on the non-radial oscillations of neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effects of axions on quark matter equation of state (EOS) is studied within the three flavor Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model and its effects on on the non-radial oscillations of neutron stars is investigated. Using such an EOS for quark matter with axions and a EOS for hadronic matter within the relativistic mean field (RMF) theory, we discuss the hadron-quark phase transition (HQPT) using the Gibbs construction. The EOS so obtained is used to investigate the structure of hybrid neutron star (NS)s. It is found that the presence of axions in the core of compact stars stabilizes hybrid NSs in agreement with modern astrophysical constraints. It is further observed that the quadrupolar fundamental modes ($f$-modes) for such hybrid NSs get substantial enhancements both due to a larger quark core in the presence of axions and from the hyperons as compared to a canonical nucleonic neutron stars.</description>

      <title>The long-term optical flux variations of Compact Symmetric Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Compact Symmetric Objects (CSOs) are a distinct category of jetted active galactic nuclei (AGN) whose optical variability characteristics have not been well investigated. We present here the results of our investigation on the optical flux and colour variability properties of a bona fide sample of 38 CSOs. We used the g-, r- and i-bands data from the Zwicky Transient Facility survey that spans a duration of about 5 years. We also considered a comparison sub-sample of blazars that includes 5 flat spectrum radio quasars and 12 BL Lac objects with redshifts and g-band magnitudes similar to the limited sub-sample of 9 CSOs. These two sub-samples of AGN, chosen for this comparative study of their long-term optical variability, represent different orientations of their relativistic jets with respect to the observer. We found that both CSOs and blazars exhibit optical flux variations, although variability of CSOs is lower than that of blazars. The observed variability in both CSOs and blazars is attributed to the relativistic jets and the increased optical variations in blazars relative to CSOs are likely due to beaming effects. CSOs and blazars exhibit similar colour variations, with both of them showing a bluer when brighter trend. Such a colour variability pattern is expected due to processes associated with their relativistic jets.</description>

      <title>Decoding the cosmological baryonic fluctuations using localized fast radio bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aims: The enigma of the missing baryons poses a prominent and unresolved problem in astronomy. Dispersion measures (DM) serve as a distinctive observable of fast radio bursts (FRBs). They quantify the electron column density along each line of sight and reveal the missing baryons that are described in the Macquart (DM-z) relation. The scatter of this relation is anticipated to be caused by the variation in the cosmic structure. This is not yet statistically confirmed, however. We present statistical evidence that the cosmological baryons fluctuate. Methods: We measured the foreground galaxy number densities around 14 and 13 localized FRBs with the WISE-PS1-STRM and WISE x SCOS photometric redshift galaxy catalog, respectively. The foreground galaxy number densities were determined through a comparison with measured random apertures with a radius of 1 Mpc. Results: We found a positive correlation between the excess of DM that is contributed by the medium outside galaxies (DM_cosmic) and the foreground galaxy number density. The correlation is strong and statistically significant, with median Pearson coefficients of 0.6 and 0.6 and median p-values of 0.012 and 0.032 for the galaxy catalogs, respectively, as calculated with Monte Carlo simulations. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that the baryonic matter density outside galaxies exceeds its cosmic average along the line of sight to regions with an excess galaxy density, but there are fewer baryons along the line of sight to low-density regions. This is statistical evidence that the ionized baryons fluctuate cosmologically on a characteristic scale of $\lesssim$6 Mpc.</description>

Abstract: Aether Scalar-Tensor theory is a relativistic alternative gravity model that behaves like cold dark matter on cosmological scales while predicting the MOND force-law in astrophysical systems. The theory correctly predicts the cosmic microwave background and linear matter power spectra, and the mass discrepancies observed across the Universe. We derive and solve the equations governing neutron stars in Aether Scalar Tensor theory at first-order in slow rotation, finding that the theory predicts approximate universal relations between the moment of inertia and the compactness ($I$--$C$ relations) that differ from their general relativity counterparts. These relations may enable tests of Aether Scalar-Tensor theory using X-ray observations of pulsars and gravitational wave observations of binary neutron star mergers.</description>

      <title>Understanding large-scale dynamos in unstratified rotating shear flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We combine simulations with new analyses that overcome previous pitfalls to explicate how nonhelical mean-field dynamos grow and saturate in unstratified, magnetorotationally driven turbulence. Shear of the mean radial magnetic field amplifies the azimuthal component. Radial fields are regenerated by velocity fluctuations that induce shear of radial magnetic fluctuations, followed by Lorentz and Coriolis forces that source a negative off-diagonal component in the turbulent diffusivity tensor. We present a simple schematic to illustrate this dynamo growth. A different part of the Lorentz force forms a third-order correlator in the mean electromotive force that saturates the dynamo.</description>

      <title>Supermassive black hole in NGC 4649 (M60) with a dark matter halo: Impact on shadow measurements and thermodynamic properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate black hole (BH) solutions embedded in a dark matter (DM) halo, modeled as extensions of the Schwarzschild metric. The DM density profile is constrained by Hubble Space Telescope data, stellar dynamics, and globular cluster (GC) measurements of the elliptical galaxy NGC 4649 (M60). Using this profile, we construct two distinct spacetime solutions characterized by the black hole mass ($M$), critical velocity ($V_c$), and core radius ($a$), all reducing to the Schwarzschild case in the limit $V_c=0$ and $a=0$. Our results show that the DM halo modifies essential BH features, such as the event horizon radius and spacetime curvature, as reflected in the Kretschmann scalar. We also derive an approximate analytical expression for the BH shadow radius, which increases slightly due to the halo's influence. Comparisons with two observational datasets further validate the analysis. Thermodynamic properties are examined across the two models. In the first, a generalized Smarr formula is obtained via two additional variables, $\gamma$ and $a$. The second incorporates halo effects through $V_c=0$ and $a=0$. These results underscore the role of DM in shaping both geometric and thermodynamic aspects of BHs.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional simulations of the magnetorotational instability in eccentric disks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.06775v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Previously we demonstrated that the magnetorotational instability (MRI) grows vigorously in eccentric disks, much as it does in circular disks, and we investigated the nonlinear development of the eccentric MRI without vertical gravity. Here we explore how vertical gravity influences the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence stirred by the eccentric MRI. Similar to eccentric disks without vertical gravity, the ratio of Maxwell stress to pressure, or the Shakura--Sunyaev alpha parameter, remains ~0.01, and the local sign flip in the Maxwell stress persists. Vertical gravity also introduces two new effects. Strong vertical compression near pericenter amplifies reconnection and dissipation, weakening the magnetic field. Angular momentum transport by MHD stresses broadens the mass distribution over eccentricity at much faster rates than without vertical gravity; as a result, spatial distributions of mass and eccentricity can be substantially modified in just ~5 to 10 orbits. MHD stresses in the eccentric debris of tidal disruption events may power emission $\gtrsim$1 yr after disruption.</description>

      <title>Gravitational-Wave and Gravitational-Wave Memory Signatures of Core-Collapse Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01525v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we calculate the energy, signal-to-noise ratio, detection range, and angular anisotropy of the matter, matter memory, and neutrino memory gravitational wave (GW) signatures of 21 three-dimensional initially non-rotating core-collapse supernova (CCSN) models carried to late times. We find that inferred energy, signal-to-noise ratio, and detection range are angle-dependent quantities, and that the spread of possible energy, signal-to-noise, and detection ranges across all viewing angles generally increases with progenitor mass. When examining the low-frequency matter memory and neutrino memory components of the signal, we find that the neutrino memory is the most detectable component of a CCSN GW signal, and that DECIGO is best-equipped to detect both matter memory and neutrino memory. Moreover, we find that the polarization angle between the $h_+$ and $h_{\times}$ strains serves as a unique identifier of matter and neutrino memory. Finally, we develop a galactic density- and stellar mass-weighted formalism to calculate the rate at which we can expect to detect CCSN GW signals with Advanced LIGO. When considering only the matter component of the signal, the aLIGO detection rate is around 24$\%$ of the total galactic supernova rate, but increases to 92$\%$ when incorporating the neutrino memory component. We find that all future detectors (ET, CE, DECIGO) will be able to detect CCSN GW signals from the entire galaxy, and for the higher-mass progenitors even into the local group of galaxies.</description>

      <title>Relativistically Magnetized Collisionless Shocks in Pair Plasma: I. Solitons, Chaos, and Thermalization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16484v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, the first in a series, we present a new theoretical model for the global structure and dissipation of relativistically magnetized collisionless shock waves. Quite remarkably, we find that in contrast to unmagnetized shocks, the leading energy dissipation channel does not involve collective plasma interactions. Rather, it is a consequence of nonlinear particle dynamics. We demonstrate that the kinetic-scale shock transition can be modeled as a stationary system consisting of a large set of cold beams coupled through the magnetic field. The fundamental mechanism governing shock dissipation relies on the onset of chaos in orbital dynamics within quasiperiodic solitonic structures. We discuss the impact of upstream temperature and magnetization on the shock profile, recovering the magnetic field compression, downstream velocities, and heating expected from the Rankine-Hugoniot jump conditions. We deduce a rate of entropy generation from the spectrum of Lyapunov exponents and discuss the thermalization of the beam distribution. Our model provides a general framework to study magnetized collisionless shock structures.</description>

      <title>Properties of high-redshift Type II supernovae discovered by the JADES transient survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08969v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we estimate the explosion and progenitor properties of six Type II supernovae (SNe) at 0.675 &lt;= z &lt;= 3.61 discovered by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) transient survey by modeling their light curves. Two Type II SNe are found to have high explosion energies of 3e51 erg, while the other four Type II SNe are estimated to have typical explosion energies found in the local Universe [(0.5-2)e51 erg]. The fraction of Type II SNe with high explosion energies might be higher at high redshifts because of, e.g., lower metallicity, but it is still difficult to draw a firm conclusion because of the small sample size and potential observational biases. We found it difficult to constrain the progenitor masses for Type II SNe in our sample because of the sparse light-curve data. We found two Type II SN light curves can be better reproduced by introducing confined, dense circumstellar matter. Thus, the confined, dense circumstellar matter frequently observed in nearby Type II SNe is likely to exist in Type II SNe at high redshifts as well. Two Type II SNe are estimated to have high host galaxy extinctions, showing the ability of JWST to discover dust-obscured SNe at high redshifts. More high-redshift Type II SNe are required to investigate the differences in the properties of Type II SNe near and far, but here we show the first glimpse into the high-redshift population of Type II SNe.</description>

      <title>Constraints on fast radio burst population from the first CHIME/FRB catalog with the Hierarchical Bayesian Inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15530v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) have emerged as one of the most dynamic areas of research in astronomy and cosmology. Despite increasing number of FRBs have been reported, the exact origin of FRBs remains elusive. Investigating the intrinsic redshift distributions of FRBs could provide valuable insights into their possible origins and enhance the power of FRBs as a cosmological probe. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical Bayesian inference approach combining with several viable models to investigate the redshift distribution of the CHIME/FRB catalog 1. By utilizing this method, we aim to uncover the underlying patterns and characteristics of the FRB population, i.e. intrinsic redshift distribution of FRB. Taking uncertainties within the observational data and selection effects into consideration, we obtained that the redshift distribution of FRBs is significantly delayed with respect to that of the star formation history.</description>

      <title>Constraining first-order phase transition inside neutron stars with application of Bayesian techniques on PSR J0437-4715 NICER data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11976v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the existence of exotic matter phases and phase transitions within the core of neutron stars is crucial to advancing our knowledge of cold-dense matter physics. Recent multi-messenger observations, including gravitational waves from neutron star mergers and precise X-ray data from NASA's Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) mission, have significantly constrained the neutron star equation of state (EOS). This study investigates the effects of phase transitions in neutron stars, focusing on NICER's latest observation of PSR J0437--4715. We employ Bayesian inference techniques to evaluate the presence of first-order phase transitions using a piecewise polytropic EOS model. Our analysis incorporates data from multiple NICER sources, to refine constraints on key phase transition parameters, including critical density and transition depth. We find that including data from PSR J0437--4715 improves the evidence of phase transitions and tightens the EOS constraints, especially at higher densities. However, Bayes factor analysis only indicates a slight preference for models without phase transitions and current observational precision is insufficient to draw definitive conclusions. In particular, this polytropic model identifies the critical phase transition mass of neutron stars as being close to 1.4 solar masses, which coincides with the approximate mass range of PSR J0437--4715. This work emphasizes the importance of precise measurements of PSR J0437--4715 for deepening our understanding of neutron star interiors and exploring potential new physics at extreme densities.</description>

      <title>Radiation Magnetohydrodynamic Simulation of sub-Eddington Circumbinary Disk around an Equal-mass Massive Black Hole Binary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18584v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first three-dimensional radiation magnetohydrodynamic (RMHD) simulation of a sub-Eddington circumbinary disk (CBD) around an equal-mass massive black hole binary (MBHB) with a total mass of $2\,\times\,10^7\,M_{\odot}$ on a circular orbit, separated by 100$\,GM_{\rm tot}/c^2$. The inclusion of radiation leads to a denser, thinner, and more filamentary disk compared to non-radiative magnetohydrodynamic simulation, primarily due to reduced pressure support and an altered equation of state. The RMHD disk also features $\sim 3$ times lower accretion rate ($\approx 0.15\,\dot{M}_{\rm Edd}$), weaker accretion streams and a less pronounced overdensity (a.k.a., ``lump") at the inner edge. Our analysis of the light curves and thermal spectra reveals that the variability induced by the binary-CBD interaction is distinguishable in the optical/UV band, where CBD shines at about $1\%$ of the Eddington luminosity. These findings underscore the crucial role of radiation on the structure and observational properties of CBDs around massive black hole binaries and have implications for detecting electromagnetic counterparts to LISA gravitational wave precursors, and for heavier binaries that are Pulsar Timing Array sources.</description>

      <title>Numerical studies of (in)stabilities of shocks in perturbed advective flows around black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20798v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations, we investigate the stability of shocked accretion flows around black holes under non-axisymmetric perturbations. By systematically exploring the parameter space of specific energy and angular momentum that permits shock formation in advective accretion flows, we demonstrate that quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) naturally emerge in perturbed systems. Our spectral analysis reveals characteristic QPO frequencies spanning 0.44-146.57 Hz, effectively bridging the observed low-frequency (LFQPOs) and high-frequency QPOs (HFQPOs) in black hole X-ray binaries. The quality factors of these oscillations range from 1.66 to 203.58, with multiple Lorentzian components indicating distinct oscillation modes. Through wavelet analysis and cross-validation with recent observations (e.g., Swift J1727.8-1613 and GX 339-4), we establish that shock instabilities driven by acoustic wave interactions between the non-axisymmetric perturbation and the shock location can quantitatively explain the temporal features observed in accreting black hole systems. Furthermore, we characterize the adiabatic index dependence of shock morphology, showing that increasing the adiabatic index from 4/3 to 1.4 changes shock positions outward while maintaining oscillation coherence.</description>

      <title>Detection Prospects of Electromagnetic Signatures from OGLE-2011-BLG-0462</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01172v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stellar-mass isolated black holes (IsoBHs) wandering in interstellar medium (ISM) are expected to be abundant in our Galaxy. Recently, an IsoBH, OGLE-2011-BLG-0462, was unambiguously discovered using astrometric microlensing. We examine prospects for detecting electromagnetic signatures from an accretion flow surrounding the IsoBH. The accretion rate onto the IsoBH should be highly sub-Eddington, which leads to formation of a hot accretion flow. In this paper, we evaluate the detectability of electromagnetic signals from the hot accretion flows in two accretion states: magnetically arrested disk (MAD) and classical radiatively inefficient accretion flows (RIAFs). For the MAD scenario, we find that the optical, infrared, and X-ray signals can be detectable by the current best facilities, such as HST, JWST, and Chandra, if the IsoBH is in a warm neutral medium. In contrast, for the classical RIAF scenario, the optical and X-ray emissions are weaker than MAD scenario, leading to unobservable signals for a typical parameter set. Future follow-up observations of OGLE-2011-BLG-0462 will provide a good test for theories of accretion processes.</description>

      <title>SN 2021hpr: A Normal Type Ia Supernova Showing Excess Emission in the Early Rising Phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02257v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present extensive optical observations of a nearby Type Ia supernova (SN Ia), SN 2021hpr, located in the spiral galaxy NGC 3147 at a distance of $\sim$ 45 Mpc. Our observations cover a phase within $\sim 1-2$ days to $\sim 290$ days after the explosion. SN 2021hpr is found to be a spectroscopically normal SN Ia, with an absolute B-band peak magnitude of $M_{max}(B) \approx -19.16 \pm 0.14$ mag and a post-peak decline rate of $\Delta m_{15}(B)= 1.00 \pm 0.01 $ mag. Early-time light curves showed a $\sim 7.0 \%$ excess emission compared to a homogeneously expanding fireball model, likely due to SN ejecta interacting with a companion or immediate circumstellar matter. The optical spectra of SN 2021hpr are overall similar to those of normal SNe Ia, but characterized by prominent detached high-velocity features (HVFs) of Si {\sc ii} and Ca {\sc ii} in the early phase. After examining a small sample of well-observed normal SNe Ia, we find that the HVFs are likely common for the subgroup with early-excess emission. The association of early bump feature with the HVFs could be attributed to density or abundance enhancement at the outer layer of the exploding star, likely as a result of interactions with companion$/$CSM or experiencing more complete burning. Nevertheless, the redshifted Fe {\sc ii} and Ni {\sc ii} lines in the nebular-phase spectra of SN 2021hpr, contrary to the blueshift trend seen in other SNe Ia showing early bump features, indicate its peculiarity in the explosion that remains to be understood.</description>

      <title>Black holes, fast scrambling and the breakdown of the equivalence principle</title>

Abstract: Under reasonable assumptions, black holes have been argued to form firewalls, burning up anything crossing their horizons. This argument finds that a firewall would appear very late in a black hole's lifetime, when Hawking radiation has caused the horizon to shrink to one-half its original area. For stellar-mass black holes, this process surpasses the universe's current age and so no such black hole would currently possess a firewall. However, black holes have recently been conjectured to scramble their interior degrees-of-freedom, with a scrambling time scale comparable to the time it takes light to travel a Schwartzschild radius' distance. We prove that local observers will already experience a firewall from the scrambling time onwards after the black hole's formation. Here `local' means that the observer couples to fewer than one-half the black hole's total interior `qubits.' Indeed, for observers to fail to be local in this manner, it would mean that they couple to more `qubits' within such black holes than exist in all the stars of the observable universe. Therefore we find that if black holes are indeed fast scramblers, then every astrophysical black hole in the universe will already have a fully developed firewall for any local physical process.</description>

      <title>Superradiant instability of area quantized Kerr black hole with discrete reflectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10742v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultralight bosons can condense to form the so-called bosonic clouds around spinning black holes by superradiance instability. When quantum effects are taken into account, the classical black holes were replaced by exotic compact objects including area quantized black holes. In this work, we consider the superradiant instabilities of massive scalar fields around area quantized Kerr black hole. We introduce the reflectivity of area quantized black hole possesses the distinct discrete feature, and the scalar fields have the superradiant modes solution only within the specific mass range. In addition, the area quantization may terminate the superradiance when the black hole spins down, or even suppress the formation of the bosionic cloud.</description>

      <title>Does Gauss-Bonnet Inflationary Gravitational Waves satisfy the Pulsar Timing Arrays observations?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07949v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The observations from pulsar timing arrays (PTAs), led by the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav), have provided opportunities to constrain primordial gravitational waves at low frequencies. In this paper, we analyze the best-fit parameter values for different Gauss-Bonnet Inflationary Gravitational Wave (GB-IGW) models with the PTArcade program, and we compare the results with the observations of NANOGrav, European Pulsar Timing Array (EPTA), Parkes Pulsar Timing Array (PPTA), and International Pulsar Timing Array (IPTA). We find the potential parameter $n$ derived from the GB-IGW model is not necessarily positive. Instead, PTA data suggest the possibility of new parameter ranges. Meanwhile, the other parameters' results, such as the spectral indices of the scalar and tensor perturbation also have differences with traditional Cosmic Microwave Background analyses from Planck 2018, showing the reason for the different phenomena of Gravitational Wave power spectra expected. Additionally, the GB-IGW models we calculated are closer to the central values of multiple PTA datasets compared to the standard inflation model, making the GB-IGW model more likely to be detected by future space-based gravitational wave observatories.</description>

      <title>In-flight positron annihilation as a probe of feebly interacting particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07725v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Core-collapse supernovae (SNe) provide a unique environment to study Feebly Interacting Particles (FIPs) such as Axion-Like Particles (ALPs), sterile neutrinos, and Dark Photons (DPs). This paper focuses on heavy FIPs produced in SNe, whose decay produces electrons and positrons, generating observable secondary signals during their propagation and annihilation. We focus on the In-flight Annihilation (IA) of positrons, which emerge as the most significant contribution to the resulting gamma-ray spectrum. Using data from COMPTEL and EGRET we derive the most stringent bounds on the FIP-electron couplings for heavy ALPs, sterile neutrinos, and DPs. These results strenghten existing bounds of one or two orders of magnitude, depending on the FIP model.</description>
