      <title>geohabnet: An R package for mapping habitat connectivity for biosecurity and conservation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mapping habitat quality, based on factors like host availability and environmental suitability, is a common approach to determining which locations are important for the spread of a species. Mapping habitat connectivity takes geographic analyses a step further, evaluating the potential roles of locations in biological invasions, pandemics, or species conservation. Locations with high habitat quality may play a minor role in species spread if they are geographically isolated. Yet, a location with lower habitat quality may play a major role in a species' spread if it acts as a bridge between regions that would otherwise be physically fragmented.
  Here we introduce the geohabnet R package, which evaluates the potential importance of locations for the spread of species through habitat landscapes. geohabnet incorporates key factors such as dispersal probabilities and habitat availability in a network framework, for better understanding habitat connectivity for host-dependent species, such as pathogens, arthropod pests, or pollinators.
  geohabnet uses publicly available or user-provided datasets, six network centrality metrics, and a user-selected geographic scale. We provide examples using geohabnet for surveillance prioritization of emerging plant pests in Africa and the Americas. These examples illustrate how users can apply geohabnet for their species of interest and generate maps of the estimated importance of geographic locations for species spread.
  geohabnet provides a quick, open-source, and reproducible baseline to quantify a species' habitat connectivity across a wide range of geographic scales and evaluates potential scenarios for the expansion of a species through habitat landscapes. geohabnet supports biosecurity programs, invasion science, and conservation biology when prioritizing management efforts for transboundary pathogens, pests, or endangered species.</description>

      <title>Explorations of Epidemiological Dynamics across Multiple Population Hubs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the dynamics of the spread of diseases within populations is critical for effective public health interventions. We extend the classical SIR model by incorporating additional complexities such as the introduction of a cure and migration between cities. Our framework leverages a system of differential equations to simulate disease transmission across a network of interconnected cities, capturing more realistic patterns. We present theoretical results on the convergence of population sizes in the migration framework (in the absence of deaths). We also run numerical simulations to understand how the timing of the introduction of the cure affects mortality rates. Our numerical results explain how localized interventions affect the spread of the disease across cities. In summary, this work advances the modeling of epidemics to a more local scope, offering a more expressive tool for epidemiological research and public health planning.</description>

      <title>No sensitivity to functional forms in the Rosenzweig-MacArthur model with strong environmental stochasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.01185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.01185v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The classic Rosenzweig-MacArthur predator-prey model has been shown to exhibit, like other coupled nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs) from ecology, worrying sensitivity to model structure. This sensitivity manifests as markedly different community dynamics arising from saturating functional responses with nearly identical shapes but different mathematical expressions. Using a stochastic differential equation (SDE) version of the Rosenzweig-MacArthur model with the three functional responses considered by Fussman &amp; Blasius (2005), I show that such sensitivity seems to be solely a property of ODEs or stochastic systems with weak noise. SDEs with strong environmental noise have by contrast very similar fluctuation patterns, irrespective of the mathematical formula used. Although eigenvalues of linearised predator-prey models have been used as an argument for structural sensitivity, they can also be an argument against structural sensitivity. While the sign of the eigenvalues' real part is sensitive to model structure, its magnitude and the presence of imaginary parts are not, which suggests noise-driven oscillations for a broad range of carrying capacities. I then discuss multiple ways to evaluate structural sensitivity in a stochastic setting, for predator-prey or other ecological systems.</description>

      <title>The Price equation reveals a universal force-metric-bias law of algorithmic learning and natural selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18549v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diverse learning algorithms, optimization methods, and natural selection share a common mathematical structure, despite their apparent differences. Here I show that a simple notational partitioning of change by the Price equation reveals a universal force-metric-bias (FMB) law: $\Delta\mathbf{\theta} = \mathbf{M}\,\mathbf{f} + \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{\xi}$. The force $\mathbf{f}$ drives improvement in parameters, $\Delta\mathbf{\theta}$, in proportion to the slope of performance with respect to the parameters. The metric $\mathbf{M}$ rescales movement by inverse curvature. The bias $\mathbf{b}$ adds momentum or changes in the frame of reference. The noise $\mathbf{\xi}$ enables exploration. This framework unifies natural selection, Bayesian updating, Newton's method, stochastic gradient descent, stochastic Langevin dynamics, Adam optimization, and most other algorithms as special cases of the same underlying process. The Price equation also reveals why Fisher information, Kullback-Leibler divergence, and d'Alembert's principle arise naturally in learning dynamics. By exposing this common structure, the FMB law provides a principled foundation for understanding, comparing, and designing learning algorithms across disciplines.</description>
