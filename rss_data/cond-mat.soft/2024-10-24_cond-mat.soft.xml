      <title>Drop deformation with soluble surfactants in linear flows: role of adsorption-desorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Drop deformation in shear flow is determined up to second order theory in Ca while considering kinetic effects on surfactants distributions in steady state. Surfactants inside the drop are adsorbed faster than those on the surface leading to an increase in total surfactants concentration on the semi-minor axis of the ellipsoidal droplet. New expressions for Taylor deformation and angle deviation are proposed involving kinetics effects. Theoretical calculations lead to a possibility of lesser deformation than the usual limit condition and a minor correction for the deviation angle.</description>

      <title>Water cavitation results from the kinetic competition of bulk, surface and surface-defect nucleation events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Water at negative pressures can remain in a metastable state for a surprisingly long time before it reaches equilibrium by cavitation, i.e. by the formation of vapor bubbles. The wide spread of experimentally measured cavitation pressures depending on water purity, surface contact angle and surface quality implicates the relevance of water cavitation in bulk, at surfaces and at surface defects for different systems. We formulate a kinetic model that includes all three different cavitation pathways and determine the needed nucleation attempt frequencies in bulk, at surfaces and at defects from atomistic molecular dynamics simulations.
  Our model reveals that cavitation occurs in pure bulk water only for defect-free hydrophilic surfaces with wetting contact angles below 50{\deg} to 60{\deg} and at pressures of the order of $-$100 MPa, depending only slightly on system size and observation time. Cavitation on defect-free surfaces occurs only for higher contact angles, with the typical cavitation pressure rising to about $-$30 MPa for very hydrophobic surfaces. Nanoscopic hydrophobic surface defects act as very efficient cavitation nuclei and can dominate the cavitation kinetics in a macroscopic system. In fact, a nanoscopic defect that hosts a pre-existing vapor bubble can raise the critical cavitation pressure much further. Our results explain the wide variation of experimentally observed cavitation pressures in synthetic and biological systems and highlight the importance of surface and defect mechanisms for the nucleation of metastable systems.</description>

      <title>Scale-free flocking and giant fluctuations in epithelial active solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The collective motion of epithelial cells is a fundamental biological process which plays a significant role in embryogenesis, wound healing and tumor metastasis. While it has been broadly investigated for over a decade both in vivo and in vitro, large scale coherent flocking phases remain underexplored and have so far been mostly described as fluid. In this work, we report a mode of large-scale collective motion for different epithelial cell types in vitro with distinctive new features. By tracking individual cells, we show that cells move over long time scales coherently not as a fluid, but as a polar elastic solid with negligible cell rearrangements. Our analysis reveals that this solid flocking phase exhibits signatures of long-range polar order, unprecedented in cellular systems, such as scale-free correlations, anomalously large density fluctuations, and shear waves. Based on a general theory of active polar solids, we argue that these features result from massless Goldstone modes, which, in contrast to polar fluids where they are generic, require the decoupling of global rotations of the polarity and in-plane elastic deformations in polar solids. We theoretically show and consistently observe in experiments that the fluctuations of elastic deformations diverge for large system size in such polar active solid phases, leading eventually to rupture and thus potentially loss of tissue integrity at large scales.</description>

      <title>Designing complex behaviours using signal-passing allosteric self-assembly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Allosteric effects, where interactions at one part of a complex affect interactions at another part, offer a high degree of control in multi-species processes. These interactions play a crucial role in many natural biological contexts and have also been utilised in artificial nanotechnology systems. Leveraging allosteric principles in synthetic systems holds great potential for designing materials and systems that can autonomously adapt, reconfigure or replicate. In this work, using a simple allosteric model, we design systems to exhibit four different complex behaviours: shape-shifting, fibre growth, sorting and self-replication. As well as showing the design of each behaviour we also calculate and measure key length and time scales, in order to verify that the systems evolve according to the pathways we have developed. Our findings demonstrate that with minimal interaction rules, allosteric systems can be engineered to achieve sophisticated emergent behaviours, opening new avenues for the design of responsive and adaptive materials.</description>

      <title>Selective excitation of work-generating cycles in nonreciprocal living solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emergent nonreciprocity in active matter drives the formation of self-organized states that transcend the behaviors of equilibrium systems. Integrating experiments, theory and simulations, we demonstrate that active solids composed of living starfish embryos spontaneously transition between stable fluctuating and oscillatory steady states. The nonequilibrium steady states arise from two distinct chiral symmetry breaking mechanisms at the microscopic scale: the spinning of individual embryos resulting in a macroscopic odd elastic response, and the precession of their rotation axis, leading to active gyroelasticity. In the oscillatory state, we observe long-wavelength optical vibrational modes that can be excited through mechanical perturbations. Strikingly, these excitable nonreciprocal solids exhibit nonequilibrium work generation without cycling protocols, due to coupled vibrational modes. Our work introduces a novel class of tunable nonequilibrium processes, offering a framework for designing and controlling soft robotic swarms and adaptive active materials, while opening new possibilities for harnessing nonreciprocal interactions in engineered systems.</description>

      <title>Emergence of intermediate range order in jammed packings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a structural analysis of large scale jammed packings of monodisperse, frictionless and frictional spheres to elucidate structural signatures of the static structure factor in the low-to-intermediate wavenumber (q) region. We employ discrete element method simulations containing up to eighty million particles, in which the particle friction coefficient(s), including sliding, rolling, and twisting interactions, are varied. At intermediate q values, corresponding to length scales that lie between that of the nearest neighbor primary peak and the system size, we find the emergence of a prepeak - a signature of intermediate range order - that grows with increasing friction. We correlate the emergence of this peak to real space fluctuations in the local particle coordination number, which exhibits a grainy-like fluctuating field throughout the packing process that is retained in the final, mechanically stable state. While the formation of the prepeak shows varying degrees of robustness to packing protocol changes, our results suggest that preparation history may be used to construct packings with variable large length scale structural properties.</description>

      <title>Local stress in cylindrically curved lipid membrane: insights into local versus global lateral fluidity models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lipid membranes, fundamental to cellular function, undergo various mechanical deformations. Accurate modeling of these processes necessitates a thorough understanding of membrane elasticity. The lateral shear modulus, a critical parameter describing membrane resistance to lateral stresses, remains elusive due to the membrane's fluid nature. Two contrasting hypotheses, local fluidity and global fluidity, have been proposed. While the former suggests a zero local lateral shear modulus anywhere within lipid monolayers, the latter posits that only the integral of this modulus over the monolayer thickness vanishes. These differing models lead to distinct estimations of other elastic moduli and affect the modeling of biological processes, such as membrane fusion/fission and membrane-mediated interactions. Notably, they predict distinct local stress distributions in cylindrically curved membranes. The local fluidity model proposes isotropic local lateral stress, whereas the global fluidity model predicts anisotropy due to anisotropic local lateral stretching of lipid monolayers. Using molecular dynamics simulations, this study directly investigates these models by analyzing local stress in a cylindrically curved membrane. The results conclusively demonstrate the existence of a static local lateral shear stress and anisotropy in local lateral stress within the monolayers of the cylindrical membrane, strongly supporting the global fluidity model. These findings have significant implications for the calculation of surface elastic moduli and offer novel insights into the fundamental principles governing lipid membrane elasticity.</description>

      <title>Electrostatics slows down the breakup of liquid bridges on solid surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We experimentally study the breakup of water-glycerol liquid bridges on non-conductive surfaces and find that spontaneous charge deposition at the receding contact line, slide electrification, can have a substantial influence. Electrostatic forces slow down the dynamics during, and cause spontaneous motion of satellite drops after the bridge breakup. We show that our experimental observations align with slide electrification theory. Our findings demonstrate that slide electrification plays an important role in dewetting beyond drop-related scenarios.</description>

      <title>Direct observation of thermal hysteresis in the molecular dynamics of orientationally disordered barocalorics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Barocalorics (BCs) are emerging as promising alternatives to vapour-phase refrigerants, which are problematic as they exacerbate climate change when they inevitably leak into the atmosphere. However, the commercialisation of BC refrigerants is significantly hindered by hysteresis in the solid-solid phase transition that would be exploited in a refrigeration cycle. Here, we provide new insight into the hysteresis that is a critical step towards the rational design of viable BCs. By studying the archetypal BC plastic crystal, neopentyl glycol (NPG), we observe for the first time the liberation of the hydroxyl rotational modes that unlock the hydrogen bonding network. We use high-resolution inelastic fixed-window neutron scattering studies in combination with quasielastic neutron scattering (QENS) measurements to build a comprehensive microscopic understanding of the NPG phase transition. Hysteresis previously observed in calorimetric studies of NPG is now observed directly as hysteresis in molecular rotational modes, and hence in the formation and disruption of hydrogen bonding. Furthermore, by tracking the thermal activation of three main reorientation modes, we suggest that their fractional excitations may resolve an outstanding discrepancy between measured and calculated entropy change. These results allow for direct study of the molecular dynamics that govern the thermal hysteresis of small molecule energy materials. They will be broadly applicable, as many promising BC material families possess first-order transitions involving molecular reorientations.</description>

      <title>Metastability of a periodic network of threads: what are the shapes of a knitted fabric ?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07811v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Knitted fabrics are metamaterials with remarkable mechanical properties, such as extreme deformability and multiple history-dependent rest shapes. This letter shows that those properties may stem from a continuous set of metastable states for a mechanically relaxed fabric, evidenced through experiments, numerical simulations and analytical developments. Those states arise from the frictional contact forces acting in the braid zone where the threads interlace and follow a line in the configuration space accurately described by a 2D-elastica model. The friction coefficient sets a terminal point along this line, and the continuous set of relaxed states is obtained by varying the braid inclination while contact forces remain on the friction cone.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17602v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the impact of hydrodynamic interactions on the conformational and dynamical properties of wet tangentially-driven active polymers using multiparticle collision dynamics simulations. By analyzing active filaments with varying degrees of flexibility, we find that fluid-mediated interactions significantly influence both their conformation and dynamics. These interactions cause polymer conformations to shrink relative to their dry counterparts, especially for semiflexible polymers at high activity levels, where the average size of wet chains becomes nearly three times smaller, due to local buckling of wet polymers. This hydrodynamic-induced shrinkage is a hallmark of active polymers, as fluid-mediated interactions do not affect conformational properties of passive polymers. Furthermore, for tangentially-driven polymers where activity and conformation are coupled, hydrodynamic interactions significantly enhance the orientational and translational dynamics compared to their dry counterparts.</description>

      <title>Novel stabilization mechanisms for concentrated emulsions with tunable morphology via amphiphilic polymer-grafted nanoparticles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11320v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study explores the stabilization mechanisms of concentrated emulsions with tunable morphology using amphiphilic polymer-grafted nanoparticles (PGNPs). We employ coarse-grained molecular simulations to investigate concentrated oil-in-water emulsions stabilized by partially hydrolyzed poly(vinyl alcohol)-grafted poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) particles. Two grafting architectures were examined: hydrophilic-hydrophobic (AB-type) diblock PGNPs and reverse BA-type diblock PGNPs. Our findings reveal that AB-type diblock PGNPs tend to aggregate, leading to droplet-droplet coalescence. In contrast, BA-type diblock PGNPs disperse effectively in the water phase, stabilizing robust emulsion through a space-filling mechanism. The study further demonstrates that the stability and morphology of the emulsions can be tuned by varying the number of PGNPs. Our results suggest that BA-type diblock PGNPs are more effective in stabilizing concentrated emulsions, offering insights for the design of novel emulsifiers in industrial applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15246v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Liquid crystals are known for their optical birefringence, a property that gives rise to intricate patterns and colors when viewed in a microscope between crossed polarisers. Resulting images are rich in geometric patterns and serve as valuable fingerprints of the liquid crystal's intrinsic properties. By using machine learning techniques, it is possible to extract from the images information about, e.g., liquid crystal elastic constants, the scalar order parameter, local orientation of the director, etc. Machine learning can also be employed to identify phase transitions and classify different liquid crystalline phases and topological defects. In addition to well studied singular defects such as point or line disclinations, liquid crystals can also host non-singular solitonic defects such as skyrmions, hopfions, and torons. The solitons, with their localised and stable configurations, offer an alternative view into material properties and behaviour of liquid crystals. In this study, we demonstrate that the optical signatures of skyrmions can be utilised effectively in machine learning to predict important system parameters. Our method focuses specifically on the skyrmion-localised regions, reducing significantly the computational cost. By training convolutional neural networks on simulated polarised optical microscopy images of liquid crystal skyrmions, we showcase the ability of trained networks to accurately predict several selected parameters such as the free energy, cholesteric pitch, and strength of applied electric fields. This study highlights the importance of localized topologically arrested order parameter configurations for materials characterisation research empowered by state-of-the-art data science methods, and may pave the way for the development of advanced skyrmion-based applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16776v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The diffusion motions of individual polymer aggregates in disordered porous media were visualized using the single particle tracking (SPT) method because the motions inside porous media play important roles in various fields of science and engineering. The aggregates diffused on the surfaces of pores; continuous adsorption and desorption processes were obserbed. The relationship between the size of the aggregates and pore size was analysed based on diffusion coefficients, moment scaling spectrum (MSS) slope, and diffusion anisotropy analyisies. The obtained diffusion coefficients were different for different the aggregate and pore sizes. The MSS Slope analysis indicated that more than 85% of the aggregates were confined diffusion for all the conditions investigated. The diffusion anisotropies analysis suggested that the diffusions of the aggregates were anisotropic. The interactions between the aggregates and the pores were complex and exhibited different motions than surface diffusion of smooth surfaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.01430v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The statics of the Fredrickson-Andersen model (FAM) of the liquid-glass transition is solved on the Bethe lattice (BL). The kinetic constraints of the FAM imply on the BL an ergodicity-breaking transition to a (glassy) phase where a fraction of spins of the system is permanently blocked, and the remaining "free" spins become non-trivially correlated. We compute several observables of the ergodicity-broken phase, such as the self-overlap, the configurational entropy and the spin-glass susceptibility, and we compare the analytical predictions with numerical experiments. The cavity equations that we obtain allow to define algorithms for fast equilibration and accelerated dynamics. We find that at variance with spin-glass models, the correlations inside a state do not exhibit a critical behavior.</description>

Abstract: Characterizing the properties of an extended system driven by active reservoirs is a question of increasing importance. Here we address this question in two steps. We start by investigating the dynamics of a probe particle connected to an `active Rubin bath' -- a linear chain of overdamped run-and-tumble particles. We derive exact analytical expressions for the effective noise and dissipation kernels, acting on the probe, and show that the active nature of the bath leads to a modified fluctuation-dissipation relation. In the next step, we study the properties of an activity-driven system, modeled by a chain of harmonic oscillators connected to two such active reservoirs at the two ends. We show that the system reaches a nonequilibrium stationary state (NESS), remarkably different from that generated due to a thermal gradient. We characterize this NESS by computing the kinetic temperature profile, spatial and temporal velocity correlations of the oscillators, and the average energy current flowing through the system. It turns out that, the activity drive leads to the emergence of two characteristic length scales, proportional to the activities of the reservoirs. Strong signatures of activity are also manifest in the anomalous short-time decay of the velocity autocorrelations. Finally, we find that the energy current shows a non-monotonic dependence on the activity drive and reversal in direction, corroborating previous findings.</description>
