      <description>arXiv:2410.22464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we describe the centres of all Dyer groups. We also give a complete classification of when a Dyer group $D(\Gamma)$ is hyperbolic or acylindricality hyperbolic, with conditions that can easily be read on the Dyer graph $\Gamma$.</description>

      <title>Ultra-Low elements and Join Irreducible gates in Coxeter groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we study the "tight gates" of the cone type partition of a Coxeter group $W$; a partition giving rise to the minimal automaton recognising the language of reduced words of $W$ recently studied by Parkinson and Yau (2022) and Przytycki and Yau (2024). We show that the tight gates are the join-irreducible elements of the smallest Garside shadow of $W$ and more generally, that "tight" elements are the join-irreducibles of convex Garside shadows. We study the properties of the tight gates and show that they also act as a gate of the witnesses of boundary roots of cone types and that they are closed under suffix. As an application of these results, we give a very efficient method of determining whether two elements have the same cone type without having to compute the minimal automaton. We also apply our results to explicitly describe the set of ultra-low elements in some select classes of Coxeter groups, thereby verifying a conjecture of Parkinson and Yau for these groups. Furthermore, we explicitly describe the set of tight gates in these cases.</description>

      <title>On the generalised Saxl graphs of permutation groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A base for a finite permutation group $G \le \mathrm{Sym}(\Omega)$ is a subset of $\Omega$ with trivial pointwise stabiliser in $G$, and the base size of $G$ is the smallest size of a base for $G$. Motivated by the interest in groups of base size two, Burness and Giudici introduced the notion of the Saxl graph. This graph has vertex set $\Omega$, with edges between elements if they form a base for $G$. We define a generalisation of this graph that encodes useful information about $G$ whenever $b(G) \ge 2$: here, the edges are the pairs of elements of $\Omega$ that can be extended to bases of size $b(G)$. In particular, for primitive groups, we investigate the completeness and arc-transitivity of the generalised graph, and the generalisation of Burness and Giudici's Common Neighbour Conjecture on the original Saxl graph.</description>

      <title>Self-similarity of the classical $p$-adic Lie groups and Lie algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We exhibit infinite lists of ramification indices $\delta$ for which the classical Lie groups over the ring of integers of $p$-adic fields admit a faithful self-similar action on a regular rooted $\delta$-ary tree in such a way that the action is transitive on the first level. These results follow from the study of virtual endomorphisms of the classical Lie lattices over the same type of rings. In order to compute the ramification indices for all the types of groups treated in the paper, we compute the indices of principal congruence subgroups of the orthogonal groups for a class of local rings.</description>

      <title>Notes on $B$-groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following Wielandt, a finite group $G$ is called a $B$-group (Burnside group) if every primitive group containing a regular subgroup isomorphic to $G$ is doubly transitive. Using a method of Schur rings, Wielandt proved that every abelian group of composite order which has at least one cyclic Sylow subgroup is a $B$-group. Since then, other infinite families of $B$-groups were found by the same method. A simple analysis of the proofs of these results shows that in all of them a stronger statement was proved for the group $G$ under consideration: every primitive Schur ring over $G$ is trivial. A finite group $G$ possessing the latter property, we call $BS$-group (Burnside-Schur group). In the present note, we give infinitely many examples of $B$-groups which are not $BS$-groups.</description>

      <title>The Conjugacy Ratio of Abelian-by-$\mathbb Z$ Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G = K \rtimes \langle t \rangle $ be a finitely generated group where $K$ is abelian and $\langle t\rangle$ is the infinite cyclic group. Let $ R $ be a finite symmetric subset of $K$ such that $S = \{ (r,1),(0,t^{\pm 1}) \mid r \in R \}$ is a generating set of $G$. We prove that the spherical conjugacy ratio, and hence the conjugacy ratio, of $G$ with respect to $S$ is $0$ unless $G$ is virtually abelian, confirming a conjecture of Ciobanu, Cox and Martino in this case. We also show that the Baumslag--Solitar group $\mathrm{BS}(1,2)$ has a one-sided F{\o}lner sequence $F$ such that the conjugacy ratio with respect to $F$ is non-zero, even though $\mathrm{BS}(1,2)$ is not virtually abelian. This is in contrast to two-sided F{\o}lner sequences, where Tointon showed that the conjugacy ratio with respect to a two-sided F{\o}lner sequence is positive if and only if the group is virtually abelian.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that if all the finite coset spaces of a polycyclic group have diameter bounded uniformly below by a polynomial in their size then the group is virtually nilpotent. We obtain the same conclusion for a finitely generated residually torsion-free nilpotent group under the weaker assumption that the finite quotient groups have diameter bounded uniformly below by a polynomial in their size. This extends work of Khukhro and Valette.</description>

      <title>On the space of subgroups of Baumslag-Solitar groups II: High transitivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We continue our study of the perfect kernel of the space of transitive actions of Baumslag-Solitar groups by investigating high transitivity. We show that actions of finite phenotype are never highly transitive, except when the phenotype is $1$, in which case high transitivity is actually generic. In infinite phenotype, high transitivity is generic, except when |m|=|n|$ where it is empty. We also reinforce the dynamical properties of the action by conjugation on the perfect kernel that we had established in our first paper, replacing topological transitivity by high topological transitivity.</description>

      <title>Path-connectivity of Thick Laminations, and Markov Processes with Thick Limit Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A lamination $\lambda$ is $\epsilon$-thick (with respect to a basepoint $X$), if the Teichm\"uller ray from $X$ in the direction of $\lambda$ stays in the $\epsilon$-thick part. We show that, for surfaces of high enough genus, any two $\epsilon$-thick laminations can be joined by a path of $\delta$-thick laminations. As a consequence, we show that the Morse boundary of the mapping class group is path-connected. Furthermore, we construct a subshift of finite type on the mapping class group, whose limit set consists only of thick laminations and is path-connected.</description>

      <title>On minimal positive heights for blocks of almost quasi-simple groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Eaton--Moret\'o conjecture extends the recently-proven Brauer height zero conjecture to blocks with non-abelian defect group, positing equality between the minimal positive heights of a block of a finite group and its defect group. Here we provide further evidence for the inequality in this conjecture that is not implied by Dade's conjecture. Specifically, we consider minimal counter-examples and show that these cannot be found among almost quasi-simple groups for $p\ge5$. Along the way, we observe that most such blocks have minimal positive height equal to~1.</description>

      <title>On the Tambara Affine Line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tambara functors are the analogue of commutative rings in equivariant algebra. Nakaoka defined ideals in Tambara functors, leading to the definition of the Nakaoka spectrum of prime ideals in a Tambara functor. In this work, we continue the study of the Nakoaka spectra of Tambara functors. We describe, in terms of the Zariski spectra of ordinary commutative rings, the Nakaoka spectra of many Tambara functors. In particular: we identify the Nakaoka spectrum of the fixed point Tambara functor of any $G$-ring with the GIT quotient of its classical Zariski spectrum; we describe the Nakaoka spectrum of the complex representation ring Tambara functor over a cyclic group of prime order $p$; we describe the affine line (the Nakaoka spectra of free Tambara functors on one generator) over a cyclic group of prime order $p$ in terms of the Zariski spectra of $\mathbb{Z}[x]$, $\mathbb{Z}[x,y]$, and the ring of cyclic polynomials $\mathbb{Z}[x_0,\ldots,x_{p-1}]^{C_p}$. To obtain these results, we introduce a "ghost construction" which produces an integral extension of any $C_p$-Tambara functor, the Nakaoka spectrum of which is describable. To relate the Nakaoka spectrum of a Tambara functor to that of its ghost, we prove several new results in equivariant commutative algebra, including a weak form of the Hilbert basis theorem, going up, lying over, and levelwise radicality of prime ideals in Tambara functors. These results also allow us to compute the Krull dimensions of many Tambara functors.</description>

Abstract: Let $\ell$ be a prime number and consider the group $\pi=\langle a,b\ \vert\ a^{\ell(\ell-1)}ba^{-\ell}b^{-2}\rangle$. We prove that $\Gamma_{\ell}$ is not $\mathrm{SL}_2$-weakly integral with obstruction at exactly the prime $\ell$. We also give a general description of the character varieties of $2$-generated groups with a relation of the form $a^{n_1} b^{m_1} a^{n_2} b^{m_1} = 1$.</description>

Abstract: We show that for a large class of Artin groups with Dynkin diagrams being a tree, the $K(\pi,1)$-conjecture holds. We also establish the $K(\pi,1)$-conjecture for another class of Artin groups whose Dynkin diagrams contain a cycle, which applies to some hyperbolic type Artin groups. This is based on a new approach to the $K(\pi,1)$-conjecture for Artin groups.</description>

Abstract: Given a finitely presented group $G$ and a surjective homomorphism $G\to \mathbb{Z}^n$ with finitely presented kernel $K$, we give an upper bound on the Dehn function of $K$ in terms of an area-radius pair for $G$. As a consequence we obtain that finitely presented coabelian subgroups of hyperbolic groups have polynomially bounded Dehn function. This generalises results of Gersten and Short and our proof can be viewed as a quantified version of results from Renz' thesis on the second BNSR invariant.</description>

Abstract: We show that the Fr\'echet--Lie groups of the form $C^{\infty}(M)\rtimes \mathbb{R}$ resulting from smooth flows on compact manifolds $M$ fail to be locally exponential in several cases: when at least one non-periodic orbit is locally closed, or when the flow restricts to a linear one on an orbit closure diffeomorphic to a torus. As an application, we prove that the Bondi--Metzner--Sachs group of symmetries of an asymptotically flat space-time is not locally exponential.</description>

This implies that for $N$ as above, the group $\operatorname{SL}_{N}(\mathbb{Z})$ does not have property $(T_{N-1})$ of Bader-Sauer and therefore is not $(N-1)$-Kazhdan in the sense of De Chiffre-Glebsky-Lubotzky-Thom, both being higher versions of Kazhdan's property $T$.</description>

We prove that the ray $[\chi]$ does not belong to the BNS set $\Sigma(\Gamma)$ if and only if it comes as a pullback along an algebraic fibration $f \colon X \to \mathcal{C}$ over a quasi-projective hyperbolic orbicurve $\mathcal{C}$. We also prove that if $\pi_1(X)$ admits a solvable quotient which is not virtually nilpotent, there exists a finite \'etale cover $X_1 \to X$ and a fibration $f \colon X_1 \to \mathcal{C}$ over a quasi-projective hyperbolic orbicurve $\mathcal{C}$. Both of these results were proved by Delzant in the case when $X$ is a compact K\"ahler manifold. We deduce that $\Gamma$ is virtually solvable if and only if it is virtually nilpotent, generalising the theorems of Delzant and Arapura-Nori. As a byproduct, we prove a version of Simpson's Lefschetz Theorem for the integral leaves of logarithmic $1$-forms that do not extend to any partial compactification. We give two applications of our results. First, we strengthen the recent theorem of Cadorel-Deng-Yamanoi on virtual nilpotency of fundamental groups of quasi-projective $h$-special and weakly special manifolds. Second, we prove the sharpness of Suciu's tropical bound for the fundamental groups of smooth quasi-projective varieties and answer a question of Suciu on the topology of hyperplane arrangements.</description>

Abstract: In this research, we introduce an algorithm that produces what appears to be a new mathematical object as a consequence of projecting the \( n \)-dimensional \( Z \)-curve onto an \( n \)-dimensional sphere. The first part presents the algorithm that enables this transformation, and the second part focuses on studying its properties.</description>
