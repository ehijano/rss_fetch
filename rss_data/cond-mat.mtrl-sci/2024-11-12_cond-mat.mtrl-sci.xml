      <title>A note on thermomechanical coupling effects in the indentation of pseudoelastic shape memory alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While macroscopic experiments on polycrystalline shape memory alloys (SMAs) reveal significant thermomechanical coupling effects arising from the latent heat of transformation, the relevance of thermomechanical couplings in indentation tests remains ambiguous. This ambiguity is further emphasized by the rate effects observed in a number of micro/nano-indentation experiments, thus highlighting the need for a more careful investigation of the thermomechanical interactions at such small scales. With this in mind, the present study aims to demonstrate the role of thermomechanical couplings in indentation-induced martensitic transformation in SMAs. To this end, a simple phenomenological model of pseudoelasticity is employed and finite-element simulations are performed to address two key questions. (1) At which spatial and temporal scales do the thermomechanical couplings arising from the latent heat become effective? (2) To what extent do these couplings influence the indentation response? In connection with the latter, our analysis quantifies the maximal thermal effects that emerge during adiabatic indentation and compares them with those of isothermal indentation.</description>

      <title>First principles approaches and concepts for electrochemical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ab initio techniques have revolutionized the way how theory can help practitioners to explore critical mechanisms and devise new strategies in discovering and designing materials. Yet, their application to electrochemical systems is still limited. A well known example how novel concepts can boost our ability to perform such studies is the introduction of temperature control into ab initio simulations. The analogous technique to model electrochemical systems -- potential control -- is just emerging.
  In this review, we critically discuss state-of-the-art approaches to describe electrified interfaces between a solid electrode and a liquid electrolyte in realistic environments. By exchanging energy, electronic charge and ions with their environment, electrochemical interfaces are thermodynamically open systems. In addition, on the time and length scales relevant for chemical reactions, large fluctuations of the electrostatic potential and field occur. We systematically discuss the key challenges in including these features in realistic ab initio simulations, as well as the available techniques and approaches to overcome them, in order to facilitate the development and use of these novel techniques to the wider community. These methodological developments provide researchers with a new level of realism to explore fundamental electrochemical mechanisms and reactions from first principles.</description>

      <title>6 -- X-ray absorption spectroscopy in high-entropy material research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This chapter introduces the use of X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) in studying the local electronic and atomic structure of high-entropy materials. The element selectivity of XAS makes it particularly suitable to address the challenges posed by the study of multicomponent compounds. By analysing different parts of the X-ray absorption spectra for each element, one can obtain information on its chemical state from the X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and its local environment, distortions, and lattice dynamics from the extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS). The theoretical background underlying X-ray absorption spectra and existing data analysis procedures are briefly described, with particular emphasis on advanced atomistic modelling techniques that enable more reliable extraction of structural information. Finally, an overview of the applications of the XAS technique in studying high-entropy materials is presented.</description>

      <title>A Powder Diffraction-AI Solution for Crystalline Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Determining the atomic-level structure of crystalline solids is critically important across a wide array of scientific disciplines. The challenges associated with obtaining samples suitable for single-crystal diffraction, coupled with the limitations inherent in classical structure determination methods that primarily utilize powder diffraction for most polycrystalline materials, underscore an urgent need to develop alternative approaches for elucidating the structures of commonly encountered crystalline compounds. In this work, we present an artificial intelligence-directed leapfrog model capable of accurately determining the structures of both organic and inorganic-organic hybrid crystalline solids through direct analysis of powder X-ray diffraction data. This model not only offers a comprehensive solution that effectively circumvents issues related to insoluble challenges in conventional structure solution methodologies but also demonstrates applicability to crystal structures across all conceivable space groups. Furthermore, it exhibits notable compatibility with routine powder diffraction data typically generated by standard instruments, featuring rapid data collection and normal resolution levels.</description>

      <title>Magnetic properties of frustrated spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ capped-kagome antiferromagnet (CsBr)Cu$_5$V$_2$O$_{10}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The structural and magnetic properties of a spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ averievite (CsBr)Cu$_5$V$_2$O$_{10}$ are investigated by means of temperature-dependent x-ray diffraction, magnetization, heat capacity, and $^{51}$V nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements. The crystal structure (trigonal, $P\bar{3}$) features a frustrated capped-kagome lattice of the magnetic Cu$^{2+}$ ions. Magnetic susceptibility analysis indicates a large Curie-Weiss temperature of $\theta_{\rm CW} \simeq-175$ K. Heat capacity signals the onset of a magnetic long-range-order (LRO) at $T_{\rm N}\simeq 21.5$ K at zero magnetic field due to the presence of significant inter-planer coupling in this system. The magnetic LRO below 27 K is further evident from the drastic change in the $^{51}$V NMR signal intensity and rapid enhancement in the $^{51}$V spin-lattice relaxation rate in a magnetic field of 6.3 T. The frustration index $f=|\theta_{\rm CW}|/T_{\rm N} \simeq 8$ ascertains strong magnetic frustration in this compound. From the high-temperature value of the $^{51}$V NMR spin-lattice relaxation rate, the leading antiferromagnetic exchange interaction between the Cu$^{2+}$ ions is calculated to be $J/k_{\rm B}\simeq 136$ K.</description>

      <title>Existence of dual topological phases in Sn-based ternary chalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is quite intriguing to investigate the transition from a topological insulator (TI) phase to topological crystalline insulator (TCI) phase in a material as the latter has an advantage over the former in controlled device applications. This work investigates the existence of this dual topological behavior in Sn-based ternary chalcogenides family PbSnX2 (X=S, Se, Te) under the hydrostatic pressure using first-principles approach. These materials are dynamically sTABLE at ambient and elevated pressure conditions up to which the topological phase transitions (TPTs) are studied. This family have a topologically trivial ground state with direct band gap values 0.338 eV, 0.183 eV and 0.217 eV for PbSnS2, PbSnSe2 and PbSnTe2, respectively. The first TPT i.e., TI phase for these materials is observed, under the effect of external pressure of 5 GPa, 2.5 GPa and 3.5 GPa, with a single band inversion at F-point in the bulk band structure and an odd number of Dirac cones along the (111) surface. A further increase in pressure to 5.5 GPa, 3 GPa and 4 GPa results in another band inversion at {\Gamma}-point and an even number of Dirac cones along the (111) plane. These even number of band inversions suggest that (\(\bar{1}2\bar{1}\)) surface has mirror symmetry around (\(\bar{1}0\bar{1}\)) plane and hence, the TCI phase is obtained. This TCI phase is further corroborated with even value of mirror Chern number calculated using winding of Wannier charge centers.</description>

      <title>Observing a quantum magnetic effect in CaYAl3O7-X particles (X=Ni, Fe, Co)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Yttrium calcium aluminate, with the formula CaYAl3O7, has been extensively researched due to its remarkable luminescent properties when doped or co-doped. Additionally, it exhibits exceptional piezoelectric properties at high temperatures. However, the potential magnetic properties this material can acquire through doping or co-doping have largely gone unexplored until now. In this innovative study, we investigate the quantum magnetic characteristics of yttrium calcium aluminate particles doped with transition metals such as cobalt, iron, and nickel. Our magnetic measurements of hysteresis curves in the macroscopic regime reveal intriguing magnetic characteristics that have not been documented in the literature. Given the high applicability of this material in biological microelectromechanical systems, we conducted a detailed study to demonstrate these findings.</description>

      <title>Defect Engineering in Two-Dimensional Pentagonal PdTe$_{2}$: Tuning Electronic, Optical, and Magnetic Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the successful synthesis of the pentagonal form of PdTe$_{2}$ monolayer (\emph{p}-PdTe$_{2}$) was reported [Liu~\emph{et al.}, Nature Materials \textbf{23}, 1339 (2024)]. In this work, we present an extensive first-principles density-functional theory (DFT) based computational study of vacancies in this material. Our study covers the evolution of the electronic, optical, and magnetic properties of various defect configurations and compares those to the pristine monolayer (\emph{p}-PdTe$_{2}$). We find that V$_{Pd}$ (V$_{Te}$) is the most stable defect in the~\emph{p}-PdTe$_{2}$ monolayer in the Te-rich (Pd-rich) limit. The defects alter the electronic properties of the monolayer significantly, leading to changes in their magnetic and optical properties due to the emergence of midgap impurity states. The defect complex V$_{Pd+4Te}$ is found to induce spin-polarization in the system with a total magnetic moment of 1.87 $\mu_{B}$. The obtained low diffusion energy barriers of 1.13 eV (in-plane) and 0.063 eV (top-bottom) corresponding to V$_{Te}$ indicates its facile migration probability is higher in the top-bottom direction at room temperature, as revealed by AIMD simulations as well. In order to guide the experimentalists, we also simulated the scanning-tunneling microscope (STM) images corresponding to all the defect configurations. Moreover, we also computed the electron-beam energies required for creating mono-vacancies. In the optical absorption spectra of the defective configurations, finite peaks appear below the band edge that are unique to the respective defective configuration. We have also computed the excess polarizability of the defective configurations with respect to the pristine one and found that maximum changes occur in the infrared and visible regions, providing insights into the change in their optical response as compared to the pristine monolayer.</description>

      <title>Billion-Fold Enhancement of Room-Temperature Ionic Conductivity in h-RMnO3/YSZ Heterostructures via Electric-Field-Assisted Oxygen Deficiency Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Oxide heterostructures provide versatile platforms for manipulating electronic and ionic conductive states. In this study, we demonstrate a remarkable billion-fold enhancement in room-temperature ionic conductivity within h-RMnO3/YSZ heterostructures, achieved through electric-field-assisted oxygen deficiency engineering. This enhancement is closely linked to substantial oxygen depletion in YSZ and is tunable by varying the thickness of the h-RMnO3 film layer and the applied voltage bias. Our findings underscore the critical importance of interfacial design and vacancy control in enhancing ionic transport capabilities, paving the way for advanced applications in low-temperature energy harvesting, storage, and conversion technologies.</description>

      <title>Terahertz-permittivity of Carbon Nitrides: Revealing humidity-enhanced dielectric properties on the picosecond timescales relevant for charge carrier photogeneration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Organic based semiconductor materials offer emerging and sustainable solutions for solar energy conversion technologies and electronics. However, knowledge of their intrinsic (photo)physical properties and light-matter interactions is often limited, especially with respect to the frequency dependent dielectric properties on the relevant timescales of exciton separation and charge generation (fs-ps). By using terahertz-time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS), we show that the complex permittivity and THz conductivity of different polymer materials and graphitic carbon nitrides - melon and poly(heptazine imides) (K-PHI) - can be measured directly and accurately in different environmental humidities. Its effects are most strongly observed in the ionic and 2D carbon nitride, K-PHI, where both real permittivity and THz conductivity double from dry to humid conditions (~4-8 and 75-150 S/m, respectively) surpassing the intrinsic dielectric response from water or K-PHI through synergistic effects. Our findings are backed by fs-ps transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS), confirming the impact of humidity on light conversion behaviour on the ps-timescale in K-PHI. We highlight the importance of dielectric property characterization at THz frequencies as critical for understanding photophysical behaviour at exciton or charge separation time scales, especially in the presence of water and hydrated ions, which may also be beneficial for computation, exploring next generation photocatalysts, electronics or ionotronics.</description>

      <title>Tuning the band topology and topological Hall effect in skyrmion crystals via the spin-orbit coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The topological Hall effect (THE) is the result of spin-asymmetric deflection of charge carriers flowing through a non-collinear spin system. Effective manipulation of the topological Hall conductivity (THC) in skyrmions is currently a vigorous area of research with an eye towards potential spintronics application. Here, we show that the band topology and the THC in a skyrmion crystal can be tuned by changing the strength of the Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC), which can be accomplished via a perpendicular electric field. This results in the change of the subband Chern numbers and a transition between ordinary insulator and Chern insulator as the Rashba SOC is varied. For partially filled subbands, the Rashba SOC can tune the THC and reverse its sign, so that the direction of the Hall current is flipped. The critical Rashba strength for this depends on the skyrmion type and the carrier density. We extend our analysis to the cases of Dresselhaus and Weyl SOC as well, and show that they can be directly mapped to the Rashba SOC case and therefore lead to similar results. Our work suggests new avenues for the control of charge transport in skyrmion crystals.</description>

      <title>Proposal of a general scheme: valley polarization in antiferromagnetic bilayer systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superior to ferromagnetic (FM) valleytronics, antiferromagnetic (AFM) counterpart exhibits ultradense and ultrafast potential due to their intrinsic advantages of zero stray field, terahertz dynamics, and compensated moment of antiferromagnets. However, the physics of spontaneous valley polarization is mainly rooted in FM hexagonal lattices and is rarely used to explore the simultaneous spin and valley polarizations in AFM materials. Here, we propose a general stacking way to achieve valley polarization in AFM bilayer systems. The hexagonal ferrovalley material is used as the basic building unit, and then the space-inversion centrosymmetric bilayer system with interlayer AFM ordering is constructed by horizontal mirror and 2-fold rotational operations, which can exhibit spontaneous valley polarization. In this construction process, the rarely explored \textit{layer-locked hidden valley polarization}, hidden Berry curvature and layer Hall effect are involved, and an out-of-plane electric field can be used to detect hidden valley polarization and to realize layer-locked anomalous valley Hall effect. We use three examples to illustrate our proposal. Firstly, the Janus GdBrI is used to prove concepts and effects involved in our design process. Secondly, the $\mathrm{RuBr_2}$ is used to demonstrate other phenomena, including valley polarization transition and \textit{near-ideal quantum spin Hall insulator}. Finally, we use our design principles to understand the valley polarization of experimentally synthesized MnSe from a new perspective. Our works establish a robust general scheme to achieve valley polarization in AFM bilayer systems, thereby opening up new avenues for AFM valleytronics.</description>

      <title>Effect of the Lattice-distortion on the Electronic Structure and Magnetic Anisotropy of the CoFeCrGa Spin Gapless Semiconductor: A First Principal Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The impact of uniform lattice strain (with lattice parameter (LP), $a = 5.62$-$5.83$ \r{A}) and tetragonal lattice distortion (with $0.8 \leq c/a \leq1.2$ and $V_0$ volume; resulting LP: $a = 5.38$-$5.92$ \r{A}, $c = 5.33$-$6.45$ \r{A}) on the structural, electronic, and magnetic properties of CoFeCrGa SGS alloy (optimized LP: $a = 5.72$ \r{A}) has been investigated. The SGS nature of CoFeCrGa remains robust under uniform strain; however, the tetragonal lattice distortion has a detrimental impact on the SGS nature, and even a small distortions lead to metallic nature for CoFeCrGa. Despite this, the tetragonally distorted structures maintain high spin polarization (SP $\geq 60\% $); except for the structure with $c/a = 0.8$, for which SP significantly decreases to $\sim 25\%$. The lattice deformation-induced magnetic anisotropy (MA) is also explored by considering the magnetocrystalline anisotropy (MCA) and the magnetic shape anisotropy (MSA). Both MCA and MSA eliminate for the Y-I ordered and uniformly strained structures, resulting in a magnetic isotropic nature for them. Conversely, the tetragonally distorted structures with $c/a &lt; 1.0$ and $c/a &gt; 1.0$ exhibit very high in-plane magnetic anisotropy and perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, respectively; with magnitudes of $\sim 10^5$-$10^6$ J/m$^3$. For tetragonally deformed structures, MSA contribution to MA is negligible, and thus, MCA dictates the total MA. In summary, the isotropically strained structures show SGS nature, while the tetragonally distorted structures exhibit the high MA along with high SP.</description>

      <title>Quantum Calculations of Hydrogen Absorption and Diffusivity in Bulk $\mathrm{CeO_2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CeO$_2$ (ceria) is an attractive material for heterogeneous catalysis applications involving hydrogen due to its favorable redox activity combined with its relative impermeability to hydrogen ions and molecules. However, to date, many bulk ceria/hydrogen properties remain unresolved in part due to a scarcity of experimental data combined with quantum calculation results that vary according to the approach used. In this regard, we have conducted a series of Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations utilizing generalized gradient (GGA), meta-GGA, and hybrid functionals as well as several corrections for electronic correlations, applied to a number of properties regarding hydrogen in bulk stoichiometic $\mathrm{CeO_2}$. Our calculations place reasonable bounds on the lattice constants, band gaps, hydrogen absorption energies, and O-H bond vibrational frequencies that can be determined by DFT. In addition, our results indicate that the activation energy barriers for hydrogen bulk diffusion are uniformly low ($ &lt; 0.15 \ \mathrm{eV} $) for the calculation parameters probed here and that, in general, the effect of hydrogen tunneling is small at ambient temperatures. Our study provides a recipe to determine fundamental physical chemical properties of Ce-O-H interactions while also determining realistic ranges for diffusion kinetics. This can facilitate the determination of future coarse-grained models that will be able to guide and elucidate experimental efforts in this area.</description>

      <title>Ab initio investigation of layered TMGeTe3 alloys for phase-change applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chalcogenide phase-change materials (PCMs) are one of the most mature candidates for next-generation memory technology. Recently, CrGeTe3 (CrGT) emerged as a promising PCM due to its enhanced amorphous stability and fast crystallization for embedded memory applications. The amorphous stability of CrGT was attributed to the complex layered structure of the crystalline motifs needed to initiate crystallization. A subsequent computational screening work identified several similar compounds with good thermal stability, such as InGeTe3, CrSiTe3 and BiSiTe3. Here, we explore substitution of Cr in CrGT with other 3d metals, and predict four additional layered alloys to be dynamically stable, namely, ScGeTe3, TiGeTe3, ZnGeTe3 and MnGeTe3. Thorough ab initio simulations performed on both crystalline and amorphous models of these materials indicate the former three alloys to be potential PCMs with sizable resistance contrast. Furthermore, we find that crystalline MnGeTe3 exhibits ferromagnetic behavior, whereas the amorphous state probably forms a spin-glass phase. This makes MnGeTe3 a promising candidate for magnetic phase-change applications.</description>

      <title>Multifield tunable valley splitting and anomalous valley Hall effect in two-dimensional antiferromagnetic MnBr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compared to the ferromagnetic materials that realize the anomalous valley Hall effect by breaking time-reversal symmetry and spin-orbit coupling, the antiferromagnetic materials with the joint spatial inversion and time-reversal (PT) symmetry are rarely reported that achieve the anomalous valley Hall effect. Here, we predict that the antiferromagnetic monolayer MnBr possesses spontaneous valley polarization. The valley splitting of valence band maximum is 21.55 meV at K and K' points, which is originated from Mn-dx2-y2 orbital by analyzing the effective Hamiltonian. Importantly, monolayer MnBr has zero Berry curvature in the entire momentum space but non-zero spin-layer locked Berry curvature, which offers the condition for the anomalous valley Hall effect. In addition, the magnitude of valley splitting can be signally tuned by the onsite correlation, strain, magnetization rotation, electric field, and built-in electric field. The electric field and built-in electric field induce spin splitting due to breaking the P symmetry. Therefore, the spin-layer locked anomalous valley Hall effect can be observed in MnBr. More remarkably, the ferroelectric substrate Sc2CO2 can tune monolayer MnBr to realize the transition from metal to valley polarization semiconductor. Our findings not only extend the implementation of the anomalous valley Hall effect, but also provides a platform for designing low-power and non-volatile valleytronics devices.</description>

      <title>Predicting ionic conductivity in solids from the machine-learned potential energy landscape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discovering new superionic materials is essential for advancing solid-state batteries, which offer improved energy density and safety compared to the traditional lithium-ion batteries with liquid electrolytes. Conventional computational methods for identifying such materials are resource-intensive and not easily scalable. Recently, universal interatomic potential models have been developed using equivariant graph neural networks. These models are trained on extensive datasets of first-principles force and energy calculations. One can achieve significant computational advantages by leveraging them as the foundation for traditional methods of assessing the ionic conductivity, such as molecular dynamics or nudged elastic band techniques. However, the generalization error from model inference on diverse atomic structures arising in such calculations can compromise the reliability of the results. In this work, we propose an approach for the quick and reliable evaluation of ionic conductivity through the analysis of a universal interatomic potential. Our method incorporates a set of heuristic structure descriptors that effectively employ the rich knowledge of the underlying model while requiring minimal generalization capabilities. Using our descriptors, we rank lithium-containing materials in the Materials Project database according to their expected ionic conductivity. Eight out of the ten highest-ranked materials are confirmed to be superionic at room temperature in first-principles calculations. Notably, our method achieves a speed-up factor of approximately 50 compared to molecular dynamics driven by a machine-learning potential, and is at least 3,000 times faster compared to first-principles molecular dynamics.</description>

      <title>Autonomous robotic mechanical exfoliation of two-dimensional semiconductors combined with Bayesian optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simple mechanical exfoliation of layered materials is the most frequently employed method for producing high-quality monolayers of two-dimensional semiconducting materials. However, the mechanical exfoliation by human hands is a microscopically sophisticated process with a large number of microscopic parameters, which requires significant operator efforts and limits the reproducibility in achieving high-quality and large-area monolayer semiconducting materials. Herein, we have proposed a new strategy for the mechanical exfoliation by combining a developed robotic system and Bayesian optimization. We have demonstrated that it is possible to explore the optimized experimental conditions among a large number of parameter combinations for mechanical exfoliation in a relatively small number of experimental trials. Moreover, the entire mechanical exfoliation process from preparation to detection of monolayer semiconductors was performed by the developed autonomous robotic system. The optimized experimental condition was determined through only 30 trials of mechanical exfoliation experiments, representing 2.5% of all experimental parameter conditions. As a result, the critical parameters for the efficient fabrication of large-area monolayer WSe$_2$ were elucidated.</description>

      <title>Universally optimizable strategy for magnetic gaps towards high-temperature quantum anomalous Hall states via magnetic-insulator/topological-insulator building-blocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimizing the magnetic Zeeman-splitting term, specifically the magnetic gap of the topological surface states (TSSs), is a crucial issue and central challenge in advancing higher-temperature quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) states. In this work, we demonstrate a counterintuitive, nonmonotonic relationship between the magnetic gap and the hybridization strength in ferromagnetic-insulator (FMI)/topological-insulator (TI) sandwich structures. Concretely, insufficient hybridization strength fails to induce a substantial magnetic gap; while excessive hybridization incandesces the competition between kinetic and Coulomb exchange interactions, thereby reducing the gap. Strong hybridization strength also spatially delocalizes the TSSs, diminishing the effective orbital coupling between TSS-based p and magnetic d orbitals, which further weakens kinetic and Coulomb exchange interaction strength. Moreover, modifying the stacking order offers an experimentally viable approach to optimizing magnetic gaps, enabling the tunability of Chern numbers, chirality and maximizing global gaps. These findings unveil a universal guiding principle for optimizing magnetic gaps in FMI-TI proximity-based QAH systems, offering valuable insights for advancing experimental implementations in this field.</description>

      <title>Gate-Controllable Quadri-Layertronics in 2D Multiferroic Antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Layertronics that manifests layer Hall effect is typically considered to intrinsically possess binary physics. Using symmetry arguments and a low-energy kp model, we show that the layer physics in layertronics can be engineered into quaternary mode, giving rise to the concept of quadri-layertronics. The mechanism correlates to the interplay between out-of-plane ferroelectricity and valley physics in antiferromagnetic multiferroic quadrilayer, which enables the layer-locked Berry curvature and Hall effect, i.e., deflecting the carriers with four different layer physics to move in specific directions. More importantly, the quadri-layertronics can be generated and manipulated by controlling the interlayer dipole arrangements via a gate voltage, allowing for the selective induction and detection of layer Hall effect in specific layers. Using first principles calculations, we further demonstrate the gate control of quadri-layertronics in multiferroic antiferromagnet of quadrilayer OsCl2. These explored phenomena and insights greatly enrich the research on layertronics.</description>

      <title>Non-reciprocity in magnon mediated charge-spin-orbital current interconversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In magnetic systems, angular momentum is carried by the spin and orbital degrees of freedom. Non-local devices can be used to study angular momentum transport. They consist of parallel heavy-metal nanowires placed on top of magnetic insulators like yttrium iron garnet (YIG), facilitating the transmission of information by magnons, generated by the accumulation of spin at the interface, created via the Spin Hall Effect (SHE) and detected via the inverse SHE (iSHE). It has been demonstrated that these processes have comparable efficiencies when the role of the detector and injector is reversed, which points to reciprocity of the processes. However, we show that by adding Ru as a source of direct and inverse orbital Hall effect (OHE), the system no longer exhibits this reciprocity. Specifically, the generation of magnons via the combination of SHE and OHE and detection via the iSHE is found to be about 35% more efficient than the inverse process for our system.</description>

      <title>Inverse spillover and dimensionality effects on interstitial hydrogen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanoscaling interstitial metal hydrides offers opportunities for hydrogenation applications by enhancing kinetics, increasing surface area, and allowing for tunable properties. The introduction of interfaces impacts hydrogen absorption properties and distribution heterogeneously, making it however challenging to examine the multiple concurrent mechanisms, especially at the atomic level. Here we demonstrate the effect of proximity on interstitial hydrogen in ultrathin single crystalline vanadium films, by comparing hydride formation in identically strained Fe/V- and Cr/V-superlattices. Pressure concentration and excess resistivity isotherms show higher absolute solubility of hydrogen, higher critical temperature and concentration in the Cr/V-superlattice. Direct measurements of hydrogen site location and thermal vibrations show identical occupation of octahedral z sites at room temperature with a vibrational amplitude of 0.20-0.25 {\AA} over a wide range of hydrogen concentrations. Our findings are consistent with a more extended region of hydrogen depletion in the vicinity of Fe compared to Cr, which showcases an inverse of the hydrogen spillover effect. Advancing the understanding of interface effects resolves previously puzzling differences in the hydrogen loading of Fe/V- and Cr/V-superlattices and is relevant for advancing both catalysis and storage.</description>

      <title>Magnetic and Magnetocaloric Properties of a C$_{20}$ Fullerene Structure: Monte Carlo Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the most active classes of nanostructures is Fullerene C$_{20}$, which has been exploited as an active component in significant applications. In this investigation, we used Monte Carlo simulations to investigate the magnetic and magnetocaloric properties of the mixed spins 2 and 3/2 Fullerene C$_{20}$ system. Ferrimagnetic and ferromagnetic phases are stable, according to the ground state phase diagrams that have been constructed. The behavior of the magnetizations and the derivative of magnetization, in particular, have shown the impact of rising temperature. Additionally, we found an increase of the reduced Curie temperature to reach $t_C = 3$, when the interactions between the spins S are increased. For numerous reduced external magnetic fields and reduced temperatures, the magnetic entropy variations are studied. The Relative Cooling Power (RCP) is calculated. It is demonstrated that the reduced exchange coupling interactions p and r lead to an increase in the lowered magnetic coercive field.</description>

      <title>Multifunctional spintronic transistors: Sub-60 mV/dec switching, non-local GMR, and NDR in spin gapless semiconductor and/or spin gapped metal FETs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-gapless semiconductors (SGSs) are a promising class of materials for spintronic applications, enabling functions beyond conventional electronics. This study introduces a novel design for multifunctional spintronic field-effect transistors (FETs) using SGSs and/or spin-gapped metals (SGMs) as source and drain electrodes. These devices operate similarly to metal-semiconductor Schottky barrier FETs, where a potential barrier forms between the SGS (or SGM) electrode and the semiconducting channel. Unlike traditional Schottky barrier FETs, these devices utilize the unique spin-dependent transport properties of SGS/SGM electrodes to achieve sub-60 mV/dec switching, overcoming the 60 mV/dec sub-threshold swing limit in MOSFETs for low-voltage operation. Additionally, SGMs contribute a negative differential resistance (NDR) effect with an ultra-high peak-to-valley current ratio. The proposed spintronic FETs combine sub-60 mV/dec switching, non-local giant magnetoresistance (GMR), and NDR, making them suitable for applications like logic-in-memory computing and multivalued logic. These properties support computing architectures beyond the von-Neumann model, enabling efficient data processing. Two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials provide a promising platform for these multifunctional FETs. We screen a computational 2D materials database to identify suitable SGS and SGM materials, selecting VS$2$ as the SGS for simulations. Using a non-equilibrium Green's function method with density functional theory, we simulate transfer ($I{\mathrm{D}}$-$V_{\mathrm{G}}$) and output ($I_{\mathrm{D}}$-$V_{\mathrm{D}}$) characteristics of a VS$_2$/Ga$_2$O$_2$ FET based on 2D type-II SGS VS$_2$, predicting a sub-threshold swing of 20 mV/dec, a high on/off ratio of 10$^8$, and a notable non-local GMR effect, demonstrating potential for low-power, high-performance applications.</description>

      <title>Exploring Ground States of Fermi-Hubbard Model on Honeycomb Lattices with Counterdiabaticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exploring the ground state properties of many-body quantum systems conventionally involves adiabatic processes, alongside exact diagonalization, in the context of quantum annealing or adiabatic quantum computation. Shortcuts to adiabaticity by counter-diabatic driving serve to accelerate these processes by suppressing energy excitations. Motivated by this, we develop variational quantum algorithms incorporating the auxiliary counterdiabatic interactions, comparing them with digitized adiabatic algorithms. These algorithms are then implemented on gate-based quantum circuits to explore the ground states of the Fermi-Hubbard model on honeycomb lattices, utilizing systems with up to 26 qubits. The comparison reveals that the counter-diabatic inspired ansatz is superior to traditional Hamiltonian variational ansatz. Furthermore, the number and duration of Trotter steps are analyzed to understand and mitigate errors. Given the model's relevance to materials in condensed matter, our study paves the way for using variational quantum algorithms with counterdiabaticity to explore quantum materials in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Glucose monitoring plays a critical role in managing diabetes, one of the most prevalent diseases globally. The development of fast-responsive, cost-effective, and biocompatible glucose sensors is essential for improving patient care. In this study, a comparative analysis is conducted between pristine and Co-doped hematite samples, synthesized via the hydrothermal method, to evaluate their structural, morphological, and optical properties. The glucose sensing performance of both samples is assessed using a fiber-optic evanescent wave (FOEW) setup. While the sensitivity remains comparable for both pristine and Co-doped hematite, a reduction in the Limit of Detection (LoD) is observed in the Co-doped sample, suggesting enhanced interactions with glucose molecules at the surface. To gain further insights into the glucose adsorption mechanisms, Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations are performed, revealing key details regarding charge transfer, electronic delocalization, and glucose binding on the hematite surfaces. These findings highlight the potential of Co-doped hematite for advanced glucose sensing applications, offering a valuable synergy between experimental and theoretical approaches for further exploration in biosensing technologies.</description>

      <title>Solid-liquid interfacial free energy from computer simulations: Challenges and recent advances</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The theory of interfacial properties in liquid-liquid or liquid-vapour systems is nearly 200 years old. The advent of computational tools has greatly advanced the field, mainly through the use of Molecular Dynamics simulations. Despite the successes and advances in the theory of interfacial phenomena for liquid-liquid systems, the study of solid-liquid interfaces remains a challenge both theoretically and experimentally. The main reason why the treatment of solid-liquid systems has fallen behind that of liquid-liquid systems is that there are complications that arise whenever an interface involving solid systems is considered involving both theory of the solid-liquid interface and the calculations using MD simulations. An example of the former is that, contrary to the liquid-liquid case, the interfacial properties of solids depend on the lattice orientation. The main complications in these calculations arise from the fact that for solids the ``mechanical route'' cannot be used. To overcome this problem, several numerical approaches were proposed. The main purpose of this review is to provide an overview of these different methodologies and to discuss their strengths and weaknesses. We classify these methodologies into two main groups: direct and indirect methods. Direct methods are those that can calculate directly the properties of interfaces, while in indirect approaches the properties of the interface are not the primary result of the simulations. We also included a discussion on the origin of the difficulties in considering solid interfaces from a thermodynamic point of view. In the second part of the review, we discuss two key related topics: nucleation theory and curved interfaces. They both represent an important problem in the study of interfaces and in the context of solid-liquid ones for which the research is still extremely active.</description>

      <title>A Finite-Element Model Showing Increased Carrier Mobility in Downscaled Amorphous Semiconductors for Flexible Microprocessors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is shown that the carrier mobilities of amorphous semiconductors can be significantly increased through device downscaling without material-level optimization. This is based on a recently published scalable finite-element model for amorphous semiconductors. Using hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) in an ideal field effect transistor (FET) as an example, the intrinsic DC electron mobility at room temperature is estimated to increase by a factor of at least 8.33 when the channel length is decreased to 10 nm. Keeping a sufficient channel width ensures device-to-device (D2D) uniformity. The simulation is based on the multiple trapping and release (MTR) theory in combination with statistical equivalent analyses. The increased mobility is attributed to the short channel length relative to the characteristic length scale of band fluctuation that is determined by the medium-range order of the material. This paper may inspire the development of next-generation high-density, high-speed, flexible microprocessors based on low-cost amorphous semiconductors for Internet of Things devices.</description>

      <title>A fast transferable method for predicting the glass transition temperature of polymers from chemical structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new method that successfully predicts the glass transition temperature $T_{\! \textrm{g}}$ of polymers based on their monomer structure. The model combines ideas from Group Additive Properties (GAP) and Quantitative Structure Property Relationship (QSPR) methods, where GAP (or Group Contributions) assumes that sub-monomer motifs contribute additively to $T_{\! \textrm{g}}$, and QSPR links $T_{\! \textrm{g}}$ to the physico-chemical properties of the structure through a set of molecular descriptors. This method yields fast and accurate predictions of $T_{\! \textrm{g}}$ for polymers based on chemical motifs outside the data sample, which resolves the main limitation of the GAP approach. Using a genetic algorithm, we show that only two molecular descriptors are necessary to predict $T_{\! \textrm{g}}$ for PAEK polymers. Our QSPR-GAP method is readily transferred to other physical properties, to measures of activity (QSAR), or to different classes of polymers such as conjugated or bio-polymers.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamically-Informed Iterative Neural Operators for Heterogeneous Elastic Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Engineering problems frequently require solution of governing equations with spatially-varying discontinuous coefficients. Even for linear elliptic problems, mapping large ensembles of coefficient fields to solutions can become a major computational bottleneck using traditional numerical solvers. Furthermore, machine learning methods such as neural operators struggle to fit these maps due to sharp transitions and high contrast in the coefficient fields and a scarcity of informative training data. In this work, we focus on a canonical problem in computational mechanics: prediction of local elastic deformation fields over heterogeneous material structures subjected to periodic boundary conditions. We construct a hybrid approximation for the coefficient-to-solution map using a Thermodynamically-informed Iterative Neural Operator (TherINO). Rather than using coefficient fields as direct inputs and iterating over a learned latent space, we employ thermodynamic encodings -- drawn from the constitutive equations -- and iterate over the solution space itself. Through an extensive series of case studies, we elucidate the advantages of these design choices in terms of efficiency, accuracy, and flexibility. We also analyze the model's stability and extrapolation properties on out-of-distribution coefficient fields and demonstrate an improved speed-accuracy tradeoff for predicting elastic quantities of interest.</description>

      <title>Noise Spectroscopy and Electrical Transport in NbO2 Memristors with Dual Resistive Switching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Negative differential resistance (NDR) behavior observed in several transition metal oxides is crucial for developing next-generation memory devices and neuromorphic computing systems. NbO2-based memristors exhibit two regions of NDR at room temperature, making them promising candidates for such applications. Despite this potential, the physical mechanisms behind the onset and the ability to engineer these NDR regions remain unclear, hindering further development of these devices for applications. This study employed electrical transport and ultra-low frequency noise spectroscopy measurements to investigate two distinct NDR phenomena in nanoscale thin films of NbO2. By analyzing the residual current fluctuations as a function of time, we find spatially inhomogeneous and non-linear conduction near NDR-1 and a two-state switching near NDR-2, leading to an insulator-to-metal (IMT) transition. The power spectral density of the residual fluctuations exhibits significantly elevated noise magnitudes around both NDR regions, providing insights into physical mechanisms and device size scaling for electronic applications. A simple theoretical model, based on the dimerization of correlated insulators, offers a comprehensive explanation of observed transport and noise behaviors near NDRs, affirming the presence of non-linear conduction followed by an IMT connecting macroscopic device response to transport signatures at atomic level.</description>

      <title>MolMiner: Transformer architecture for fragment-based autoregressive generation of molecular stories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep generative models for molecular discovery have become a very popular choice in new high-throughput screening paradigms. These models have been developed inheriting from the advances in natural language processing and computer vision, achieving ever greater results. However, generative molecular modelling has unique challenges that are often overlooked. Chemical validity, interpretability of the generation process and flexibility to variable molecular sizes are among some of the remaining challenges for generative models in computational materials design. In this work, we propose an autoregressive approach that decomposes molecular generation into a sequence of discrete and interpretable steps using molecular fragments as units, a 'molecular story'. Enforcing chemical rules in the stories guarantees the chemical validity of the generated molecules, the discrete sequential steps of a molecular story makes the process transparent improving interpretability, and the autoregressive nature of the approach allows the size of the molecule to be a decision of the model. We demonstrate the validity of the approach in a multi-target inverse design of electroactive organic compounds, focusing on the target properties of solubility, redox potential, and synthetic accessibility. Our results show that the model can effectively bias the generation distribution according to the prompted multi-target objective.</description>

      <title>Non-Abelian charge conversion in bilayer binary honeycomb lattice systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In two-dimensional systems with space-time inversion symmetry, Dirac nodes (DNs) carry non-Abelian topological charges which induce intriguing momentum space braiding phenomenon. Although the original idea was proposed in condensed matter setup, the experimental verification of non-Abelian charge conversion has been limited to artificial metamaterials because of the difficulty in identifying suitable materials in which controlled tuning of DN positions is possible. In this work, we propose bilayer binary honeycomb lattices (BBHL) as a new material platform to study the non-Abelian charge conversion phenomenon in which DN positions in momentum space can be manipulated. More explicitly, we demonstrate that layer sliding and vertical pressure serve as tunable braiding parameters controlling the non-Abelian charge conversion process which is crucial to understand the stacking-dependent electronic properties of BBHL systems. We show that the BBHL systems are a promising candidate for the experimental realization of non-Abelian phenomena of DNs in condensed matter.</description>

      <title>Cocktail effect on superconductivity in hexagonal high-entropy alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the study of the cocktail effect on superconductivity in high-entropy alloys (HEAs),using hexagonal close-packed HEAs as a prototype system. Compared with the compositional averages of the constituent elements, the superconducting transition temperature Tc is enhanced by from a factor of about 2 to over one order of magnitude. This Tc enhancement correlates with the reduction in the Debye temperature, underlining the importance of phonon softening in triggering the cocktail effect. Furthermore, we show that the Tc in these HEAs is governed by the average phonon frequency and electron-phonon coupling strength, the latter of which scales linearly with the inverse HEA molecular weight and is progressively weakened with increasing mixing entropy. Our study paves the way toward quantitative understanding of the superconductivity in HEAs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We employ Monte Carlo techniques, utilizing the Metropolis and Wolff algorithms, to investigate phase behavior and phase transitions in anisotropic Ising models. Our study encompasses the thermodynamic properties, evaluating energy, magnetization, specific heat, magnetic susceptibility, magnetic entropy, and the Binder cumulant. Additionally, we examine the impact of external fields on these thermodynamic quantities at different externally applied field values. We accurately determine the critical temperature for various model scenarios by analyzing the Binder cumulant. Our investigations also include an analysis of the hysteresis loop for the model for different an-isotropic cases. In particular, our study presents the magnetocaloric effect, which is the change in temperature of magnetic material when exposed to a changing magnetic field, in the different anisotropic cases of the Ising model.</description>

      <title>Focused ion beam polishing based optimization of high-Q silica microdisk resonators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Whispering gallery mode (WGM) microdisk resonators are promising optical devices that confine light efficiently and enable enhanced nonlinear optical effects. This work presents a novel approach to reduce sidewall roughness in SiO\textsubscript{2} microdisk resonators using focused ion beam (FIB) polishing. The microdisks, with varying diameter ranging from 5 to 20 $\mu$m are fabricated using a multi-step fabrication scheme. However, the etching process introduces significant sidewall roughness, which increases with decreasing microdisk radius, degrading the resonators' quality. To address this issue, a FIB system is employed to polish the sidewalls, using optimized process parameters to minimize Ga ion implantation. White light interferometry measurements reveal a significant reduction in surface roughness from 7 nm to 20 nm for a 5 $\mu$m diameter microdisk, leading to a substantial enhancement in the scattering quality factor (Qss) from $3\times 10^2$ to $2\times 10^6$. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of FIB polishing in improving the quality of microdisk resonators and open up new possibilities for the fabrication of advanced photonic devices.</description>

Abstract: In recent years, there has been a growing interest in accelerated materials innovation in the context of the process-structure-property chain. In this regard, it is essential to take into account manufacturing processes and tailor materials design approaches to support downstream process design approaches. As a major step into this direction, we present a holistic and generic optimization approach that covers the entire process-structure-property chain in materials engineering. Our approach specifically employs machine learning to address two critical identification problems: a materials design problem, which involves identifying near-optimal material microstructures that exhibit desired properties, and a process design problem that is to find an optimal processing path to manufacture these microstructures. Both identification problems are typically ill-posed, which presents a significant challenge for solution approaches. However, the non-unique nature of these problems offers an important advantage for processing: By having several target microstructures that perform similarly well, processes can be efficiently guided towards manufacturing the best reachable microstructure. The functionality of the approach is demonstrated at manufacturing crystallographic textures with desired properties in a simulated metal forming process.</description>

Abstract: High-entropy alloys (HEAs) refer to alloys composed of five or more elements in equal or near-equal amounts or in an atomic concentration range of 5 to 35 atomic percent (at%). Different elemental ratios will affect the microstructures of HEAs and provide them with unique properties. Based on past research, HEAs have exhibited superior performance, relative to most conventional alloys, with respect to many properties, such as strength, toughness, corrosion resistance, magnetic behavior, etc. Among them, fatigue behavior has been a topic of focus, due to its importance in industrial applications. In this article, we summarized the research progress in the HEA-fatigue behavior in the past ten years, including experimental results and theoretical studies in subdivisions, such as high-cycle fatigue, low-cycle fatigue, fatigue-crack growth, fatigue mechanisms, etc. The influence of the processing and test methods on HEAs is described. The accuracy of several commonly used prediction models is also outlined. Finally, unresolved issues and suggestions on the direction of future research efforts are presented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13908v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A static peridynamic (proposed by Silling, see J. Mech. Phys. Solids 2000; 48:175--209) composite materials (CMs) of the random and periodic structures are considered. In the framework of the second background of micromechanics (also called computational analytical micromechanics, CAM), one proved that local micromechanics (LM) and peridynamic micromechanics (PM) are formally similar to each other for CM of both random and periodic structures. It allows straightforward generalization of LM methods to their PM counterparts. It turns out that a plurality of micromechanics phenomena [e.g. statistically homogeneous and inhomogeneous media, inhomogeneous loading (inhomogeneous body force is included), nonlinear and nonlocal constitutive laws of phases, and coupled physical phenomena] can be analyzed by one universal tool (called CAM), which is sufficiently flexible and based on physically clear hypotheses that can be modified and improved if necessary (up to abandonment of these hypotheses) in the framework of a unique scheme for analyses of a wide class of mentioned problems. The schemes of these approaches are considered in the current paper.</description>

      <title>Impacts of Point Defects on Shallow Doping in Cubic Boron Arsenide: A First Principles Study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09013v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cubic boron arsenide (BAs) stands out as a promising material for advanced electronics, thanks to its exceptional thermal conductivity and ambipolar mobility. However, effective control of p- and n-type doping in BAs poses a significant challenge, mostly as a result of the influence of defects. In the present study, we employed density functional theory (DFT) to explore the impacts of the common point defects and impurities on p-type doping of Be$_\text{B}$ and Si$_\text{As}$, and on n-type doping of Si$_\text{B}$ and Se$_\text{As}$. We found that the most favorable point defects formed by C, O, and Si are C$_\text{As}$, O$_\text{B}$O$_\text{As}$, Si$_\text{As}$, C$_\text{As}$Si$_\text{B}$, and O$_\text{B}$Si$_\text{As}$, which have formation energies of less than $1.5$ eV. While the O impurity detrimentally affects both n- and p-type dopings, C and Si impurities are harmful for n-type dopings. Interestingly, the antisite defect pair As$_\text{B}$B$_\text{As}$ benefits both p- and n-type doping. The doping limitation analysis presented in this study can potentially pave the way for strategic development in the area of BAs-based electronics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11765v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Amidst the growing importance of hydrogen in a sustainable future, it is crucial to develop coatings that can protect hydrogen-sensitive system components in reactive hydrogen environments. However, the prediction of the chemical stability of materials in hydrogen is not fully understood. In this study, we show that the work function is a key parameter determining the reducibility (i.e., de-nitridation) of transition metal nitrides (TMNs) in hydrogen radicals (H*) at elevated temperatures. We demonstrate that when the work function of a TMN system drops below a threshold limit, its reduction effectively stops. We propose that this is due to the preferential binding of H* to TM-atoms rather than N-atoms, which makes the formation of volatile species (NHx) unfavourable. This finding provides a novel perspective for comprehending the interaction of hydrogen with transition metal compounds and allows predicting the chemical stability of hydrogen-protective coatings.</description>

Abstract: Hydrogen is playing a crucial role in the green energy transition. Yet, its tendency to react with and diffuse into surrounding materials poses a challenge. Therefore, it is critical to develop coatings that protect hydrogen-sensitive system components in reactive-hydrogen environments. In this work, we report group IV-V transition metal carbide (TMC) thin films as potential candidates for hydrogen-protective coatings in hydrogen radical (H*) environments at elevated temperatures. We identify three classes of TMCs based on the reduction of carbides and surface oxides (TMOx). HfC, ZrC, TiC, TaC, NbC, and VC (class A) are found to have a stable carbidic-C (TM-C) content, with a further sub-division into partial (class A1: HfC, ZrC, and TiC) and strong (class A2: TaC, NbC, and VC) surface TMOx reduction. In contrast to class A, a strong carbide reduction is observed in Co2C (class B), along with a strong surface TMOx reduction. The H*-TMC/TMOx interaction is hypothesized to entail three processes: (i) hydrogenation of surface C/O-atoms, (ii) formation of CHx/OHx species, and (iii) subsurface C/O-atoms diffusion to the surface vacancies. The number of adsorbed H-atoms required to form CHx/OHx species (i), and the corresponding energy barriers (ii) are estimated based on the change in the Gibbs free energy (DeltaG) for the reduction reactions of TMCs and TMOx. Hydrogenation of surface carbidic-C-atoms is proposed to limit the reduction of TMCs, whereas the reduction of surface TMOx is governed by the thermodynamic barrier for forming H2O.</description>

      <title>Formation of Iron-Helium Compounds under High Pressure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11810v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the formations of fcc and distorted hcp iron-helium compounds with x in FeHex up to 0.13 and 0.48, respectively, based on experiments at 5-54 GPa and ~1000-2820 K. Upon releasing pressure under room temperature, these fcc and distorted hcp FeHex were still observed by XRD and SIMS measurements. Our first-principles calculations indicate that fcc and hcp FeHex, with helium atoms occupying the tetrahedral and trigonal-planar interstitial sites (instead of the octahedral sites), are dynamically stable throughout 0-50 GPa. These results support that the Earth's core can be a large reservoir of primordial 3He.</description>

      <title>Dark-Field X-Ray Microscopy with Structured Illumination for Three-Dimensional Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12799v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a structured illumination technique for dark-field x-ray microscopy optimized for three-dimensional imaging of ordered materials at sub-micrometer length scales. Our method utilizes a coded aperture to spatially modulate the incident x-ray beam on the sample, enabling the reconstruction of the sample's 3D structure from images captured at various aperture positions. Unlike common volumetric imaging techniques such as tomography, our approach casts a scanning x-ray silhouette of a coded aperture for depth resolution along the axis of diffraction, eliminating any need for sample rotation or rastering, leading to a highly stable imaging modality. This modification provides robustness against geometric uncertainties during data acquisition, particularly for achieving sub-micrometer resolutions where geometric uncertainties typically limit resolution. We introduce the image reconstruction model and validate our results with experimental data on an isolated twin domain within a bulk single crystal of an iron pnictide obtained using a dark-field x-ray microscope. This timely advancement aligns with the enhanced brightness upgrade of the world's synchrotron radiation facilities, opening unprecedented opportunities in imaging.</description>

      <title>Exciton dissociation in organic solar cells: An embedded charge transfer state model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20839v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Organic solar cells are a promising avenue for renewable energy, and our study introduces a comprehensive model to investigate exciton dissociation processes at the donor-acceptor interface. Examining quantum efficiency and emitted phonons in the charge transfer state (CTS), we explore scenarios like variations of the environment beyond the CTS and repulsive/attractive potentials. The donor-acceptor interface significantly influences the injection process, with minimal impact from the environment beyond the CTS. Attractive potentials can create localized electron states at the interface, below the acceptor band, without necessarily hampering a good injection at higher energies. Exploring different recombination processes, including acceptor-side and donor-side recombination, presents distinct phases for the injection process versus the initial energy of the electron and the recombination rate. Our study highlights the important role of the type of recombination in determining the quantum efficiency and the existence of hot or cold charge transfer states. Finally, depending on the initial energy of the electron on the donor side, three distinct injection regimes are exhibited. The present model should be helpful for optimizing organic photovoltaic cell interfaces, highlighting the critical parameter interplay for enhanced performance.</description>

      <title>Creation of an Fe$_3$P Schreibersite Density Functional Tight Binding Model for Astrobiological Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01884v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mineral schreibersite, e.g., Fe$_3$P, is commonly found in iron-rich meteorites and could have served as an abiotic phosphorus source for prebiotic chemistry. However, atomistic calculations of its degradation chemistry generally require quantum simulation approaches, which can be too computationally cumbersome to study sufficient time and length scales for this process. In this regard, we have created a computationally efficient semi-empirical quantum Density Functional Tight Binding (DFTB) model for iron and phosphorus-containing materials by adopting an existing semi-automated workflow that represents many-body interactions by linear combinations of Chebyshev polynomials. We have utilized a relatively small training set to optimize a DFTB model that is accurate for schreibersite physical and chemical properties, including its bulk properties, surface energies, and water absorption. We then show that our model shows strong transferability to several iron phosphide solids as well as multiple allotropes of iron metal. Our resulting DFTB parameterization will allow us to interrogate schreibersite aqueous decomposition at longer time and length scales than standard quantum approaches, allowing for investigations of its role in prebiotic chemistry on early Earth.</description>

      <title>Material-realistic modelling of quantum many-body effects in a monolayer TMDC nanolaser device</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17857v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The efficient light-matter interaction in combination with the small volume occupied by monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) makes this material class a notable option as gain layer in future opto-electronic devices. Many-body effects of excited carriers influence the emission dynamics due to the introduction of optical non-linearities following excitation, but the exact mechanisms remain unexamined from a theoretical point of view. In this paper, we present a material-realistic microscopic theory of a device based on an MoS2-monolayer, which demonstrates stimulated emission activity at room temperature. The modelling procedure combines Coulomb and light-matter interaction matrix elements with doublet-level Quantum Laser Equations (QLEs). These give access to the dynamics of the photon-assisted polarisation, populations, and photon number while allowing the solution of a multi-scale problem ranging from femto- to nanoseconds. The input-output curve, hole burning and spectral clamping obtained from this theory present strong indications of electron-hole-plasma-based lasing occurring at densities above $5 \cdot 10^{13}\,\text{cm}^{-2}$ in this device.</description>

Abstract: With the rapid advance of high-performance computing and electronic technologies, understanding thermal conductivity in materials has become increasingly important. This study presents a novel method: the Site-projected Thermal Conductivity (SPTC) that quantitatively estimates the local (atomic) contribution to heat transport, leveraging the Green-Kubo thermal transport equations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on disordered and amorphous graphene, amorphous silicon, and grain boundaries in silicon-germanium alloys. Amorphous graphene reveals a percolation behavior for thermal transport. The results highlight the potential of our method to provide new insights into the thermal behavior of materials, offering a promising avenue for materials design and performance optimization.</description>

      <title>Transverse Bending Mimicry of Longitudinal Piezoelectricity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02880v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The origin of frequently observed ultrahigh electric-induced longitudinal strain, ranging from 1% to 26%, remains an open question. Recent evidence suggests that this phenomenon is linked to the bending deformation of samples, but the mechanisms driving this bending and the strong dependence of nominal strain on sample thickness have yet to be fully understood. Here, we demonstrate that the bending in piezoceramics can be induced by non-zero gradient of d31 acrcoss thickness direction. Our calculations show that in standard perovskite piezoceramics, such as KNbO3, a 0.69% concentration of oxygen vacancies results in a 6.3 pC/N change in d31 by inhibiting polarization rotation, which is sufficient to produce ultrahigh nominal strain in thin samples. The gradients of defect concentration, composition, and stress can all cause sufficient inhomogeneity in the distribution of d31, leading to the bending effect. We propose several approaches to distinguish true electric-induced strain from bending-induced effects. Our work provides clarity on the origin of nominal ultrahigh electricinduced strain and offers valuable insights for advancing piezoelectric materials.</description>

Abstract: Clarifying the physical origin of valley polarization and exploring promising ferrovalley materials are conducive to the application of valley degrees of freedom in the field of information storage. Here, we explore two novel altermagnetic semiconductors (monolayers Nb2Se2O and Nb2SeTeO) with N\'eel temperature above room temperature based on first-principles calculations. It reveals that uniaxial strain induces valley polarization without spin-orbital coupling (SOC) in altermagnets owing to the piezovalley effect, while uniaxial compressive strain transforms the intrinsic ferrovalley semiconductor into a semimetal, half metal and metal. Moreover, moderate biaxial strain renders Janus monolayer Nb2SeTeO to robust Dirac-like band dispersion. The SOC and intrinsic in-plane magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy induce Dirac-like altermagnets to generate apparent valley polarization through magnetovalley coupling. In terms of SOC perturbation, we elucidate the physical mechanism behind in-plane-magnetization induced valley polarization and demonstrate the magnitude of valley polarization is positively correlated with the square of SOC strength and negatively correlated with the bandgap. The present work reveals the physical origin of valley polarization in altermagnets and expands the application of ferrovalley at room temperature in valleytronics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.04574v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A fundamental requirement for photonic technologies is the ability to control the confinement and propagation of light. Widely utilized platforms include two-dimensional (2D) optical microcavities in which electromagnetic waves are confined between either metallic or distributed Bragg reflectors. Recently, transition metal dichalcogenides hosting tightly bound excitons with high optical quality have emerged as promising atomically thin mirrors. In this work, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a sub-wavelength 2D nano-cavity using two atomically thin mirrors with degenerate resonances. Angle-resolved measurements show a flat band, which sets this system apart from conventional photonic cavities. Remarkably, we demonstrate how the excitonic nature of the mirrors enables the formation of chiral and tunable optical modes upon the application of an external magnetic field. Moreover, we show the electrical tunability of the confined mode. Our work demonstrates a mechanism for confining light with high-quality excitonic materials, opening perspectives for spin-photon interfaces, and chiral cavity electrodynamics.</description>

Abstract: Magnetic droplets are nanoscale, non-topological, dynamical solitons that can be nucleated in different spintronic devices, such as spin torque nano-oscillators (STNOs) and spin Hall nano-oscillators (SHNOs). This chapter first briefly discusses the theory of spin current driven dissipative magnetic droplets in ferromagnetic thin films with uniaxial anisotropy. We then thoroughly review the research literature on magnetic droplets and their salient features, as measured using electrical, microwave, and synchrotron techniques, and as envisaged by micromagnetic simulations. We also touch upon a closely related soliton, the dynamical skyrmion. Finally, we present an outlook of new routes in droplet science.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17690v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear Hall effect arises in materials without inversion symmetry, and the intrinsic contribution is typically from Berry curvature dipole of non-universal Fermi pockets. Here we propose that nonlinear Hall effect can reach quantization in chiral Weyl semimetals without mirror symmetries. The energy shift between a pair of Weyl nodes leads to chirally asymmetric intra-node relaxation, and the net trace of nonlinear Hall conductivity is thus quantized in units of $e^3/\hbar^2$ and determined by sum of monopole charge weighted by the transport relaxation time. Our theory also applies to mirror symmetric Weyl/Dirac semimetals with chiral anomaly. Additionally, besides DC transport probes, we anticipate that nonlinear circular dichroism measurements could detect chiral asymmetry-induced currents.</description>

      <title>Enabling Efficient Equivariant Operations in the Fourier Basis via Gaunt Tensor Products</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10216v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Developing equivariant neural networks for the E(3) group plays an important role in modeling 3D data across real-world applications. Enforcing this equivariance primarily involves the tensor products of irreducible representations (irreps). However, the computational complexity of such operations increases significantly as higher-order tensors are used. In this work, we propose a systematic approach to substantially accelerate the computation of the tensor products of irreps. We mathematically connect the commonly used Clebsch-Gordan coefficients to the Gaunt coefficients, which are integrals of products of three spherical harmonics. Through Gaunt coefficients, the tensor product of irreps becomes equivalent to the multiplication between spherical functions represented by spherical harmonics. This perspective further allows us to change the basis for the equivariant operations from spherical harmonics to a 2D Fourier basis. Consequently, the multiplication between spherical functions represented by a 2D Fourier basis can be efficiently computed via the convolution theorem and Fast Fourier Transforms. This transformation reduces the complexity of full tensor products of irreps from $\mathcal{O}(L^6)$ to $\mathcal{O}(L^3)$, where $L$ is the max degree of irreps. Leveraging this approach, we introduce the Gaunt Tensor Product, which serves as a new method to construct efficient equivariant operations across different model architectures. Our experiments on the Open Catalyst Project and 3BPA datasets demonstrate both the increased efficiency and improved performance of our approach.</description>

      <title>Optimisation of ultrafast singlet fission in 1D rings towards unit efficiency</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09847v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Singlet fission (SF) is an electronic transition that in the last decade has been under the spotlight for its applications in optoelectronics, from photovoltaics to spintronics. Despite considerable experimental and theoretical advancements, optimising SF in materials like multichromophoric systems and molecular crystals remains a challenge, due to the complexity of its analysis beyond perturbative methods. Here, we tackle the case of 1D rings, aiming to promote singlet fission and prevent its back-reaction. We study ultrafast SF non-perturbatively, by numerically solving a spin-boson model, via exact propagation and tensor network methods. By optimising over a parameter space relevant to organic molecular materials, we identify two classes of solutions that can take SF efficiency beyond 85% in the non-dissipative (coherent) regime, and to 99% when exciton-phonon interactions can be tuned. After discussing the experimental feasibility of the optimised solutions, we conclude by proposing that this approach can be extended to a wider class of optoelectronic optimisation problems.</description>

Abstract: We derive a minimal low-energy model for Bernal bilayer graphene and related rhombohedral graphene multilayers at low electronic densities by constructing Wannier orbitals defined in real-space supercells of the original primitive cell. Starting from an ab-initio electronic structure theory comprising the atomic carbon $p_z$-orbitals, momentum locality of the Fermi surface pockets around $K,K'$ is circumvented by backfolding the $\pi$-bands to the concomitant mini-Brillouin zone of the supercell, reminiscent of their (twisted) moir\'e counterparts. The supercell Wannier functions reproduce the spectral weight and Berry curvature of the microscopic model and offer an intuitive real-space picture of the emergent physics at low electronic densities being shaped by flavor-polarized wave packets with mesoscopic extent. By projecting an orbital-resolved, dual-gated Coulomb interaction to the effective Wannier basis, we find that the low-energy physics of Bernal bilayer graphene is governed by weak electron-electron interactions. Our study bridges between existing continuum theories and ab-initio studies of small Fermi pocket systems like rhombohedral graphene stacks by providing a symmetric lattice description of their low-energy physics.</description>

      <title>Stability-superconductivity map for compressed Na-intercalated graphite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16056v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A recent ab initio investigation of Na-C binary compounds under moderate pressures has uncovered a possible stable NaC$_4$ superconductor with an estimated critical temperature up to 41K. We revisit this promising binary system by performing a more focused exploration of Na-intercalated graphite configurations, assessing the sensitivity of their thermodynamic stability to density functional approximations at different (T,P) conditions, and examining their superconducting properties with the anisotropic Migdal-Eliashberg formalism. The combinatorial screening of possible Na arrangements reveals additional stable stoichiometries, i.e., Na$_3$C$_{10}$, NaC$_8$, NaC$_{10}$, and NaC$_{12}$, that redefine the previously proposed convex hulls for pressures up to 10 GPa. The evaluation of formation enthalpies with different van der Waals functionals indicates that the proposed compounds might not be thermodynamically stable at zero temperature but some of them could stabilize due to the vibrational entropy or form via cold compression if graphite is used as a starting material. Our more rigorous modeling of the electron-phonon coupling in NaC$_4$ confirms the material's potential for high-temperature superconductivity, with a critical temperature reaching 48 K at 10 GPa, and reveals a well-defined two-gap structure unusual for an electron-doped compound. By tracking the position of the intercalant nearly free electron states with respect to the Fermi level in viable Na-C compounds, we map out the range of pressures and compositions needed for strong electron-phonon coupling and identify Na$_3$C$_{10}$ as an equally promising superconductor.</description>

      <title>Nodal higher-order topological superconductivity from C6-symmetric Dirac semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09541v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Three-dimensional Dirac semimetals (DSMs) have been shown to exhibit one-dimensional hinge modes which are termed the higher-order hinge Fermi-arc (HOFA) states. They are the topological consequences of Dirac points. Superconducting states from Dirac semimetals can inherit the Dirac points to form nodal Dirac superconducting states, raising a question of whether there exists a topological superconducting bulk-hinge correspondence similar to DSMs. In this work, we discuss the nodal superconducting states from half-filled DSMs respecting non-magnetic (Type-II) Shubnikov space group (SSG) $P6/mmm1'$. We find that the BdG Dirac points can lead to higher-order topological Dirac superconducting (HOTDSC) states instead of the expected higher-order Majorana-arc (HOMA) states. The HOTDSC states can be regarded as a crossing between the HOFAs in normal states and the BdG shadow states. We demonstrate that HOTDSC states can be indicated by relative topologies of BdG Dirac points by utilizing the theory of magnetic topological quantum chemistry (MTQC).</description>

      <title>Unraveling Complex Relationships in Thermoreflectance Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08480v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thermoreflectance techniques, such as time-domain thermoreflectance (TDTR), frequency-domain thermoreflectance (FDTR), and the square-pulsed source (SPS) method, are essential for characterizing the thermal properties of bulk and thin-film materials. However, interpreting the signals of these techniques is often complicated by the intricate interdependencies of experimental variables. In this study, we introduce a novel framework based on singular value decomposition (SVD) to systematically unravel these complex relationships. By applying SVD to the sensitivity matrix, we identify critical combined parameters that define the maximum number of reliably extractable variables in thermoreflectance experiments. We validate our approach through measurements on a GaN/Si heterostructure, comparing the performance of TDTR, FDTR, and SPS in extracting key thermal properties. Our results demonstrate that the SPS method offers superior decoupling of parameters, allowing for more accurate simultaneous determination of thermal conductivity, heat capacity, and interfacial thermal conductance. This work provides a deeper understanding of heat transfer in multilayer systems and offers a robust methodology for improving the precision of thermal property measurements across a wide range of materials, paving the way for advancements in both fundamental research and industrial applications.</description>

      <title>Resolving thermal gradients and solidification velocities during laser melting of a refractory alloy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22496v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Metal additive manufacturing (AM) processes, such as laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF), can yield high-value parts with unique geometries and features, substantially reducing costs and enhancing performance. However, the material properties from L-PBF processes are highly sensitive to the laser processing conditions and the resulting dynamic temperature fields around the melt pool. In this study, we develop a methodology to measure thermal gradients, cooling rates, and solidification velocities during solidification of refractory alloy C103 using in situ high-speed infrared (IR) imaging with a high frame rate of approximately 15,000 frames per second (fps). Radiation intensity maps are converted to temperature maps by integrating thermal radiation over the wavelength range of the camera detector while also considering signal attenuation caused by optical parts. Using a simple method that assigns the liquidus temperature to the melt pool boundary identified ex situ, a scaling relationship between temperature and the IR signal was obtained. The spatial temperature gradients (dT/dx), heating/cooling rates (dT/dt), and solidification velocities (R) are resolved with sufficient temporal resolution under various laser processing conditions, and the resulting microstructures are analyzed, revealing epitaxial growth and nucleated grain growth. Thermal data shows that a decreasing temperature gradient and increasing solidification velocity from the edge to the center of the melt pool can induce a transition from epitaxial to equiaxed grain morphology, consistent with the previously reported columnar to equiaxed transition (CET) trend. The methodology presented can reduce the uncertainty and variability in AM and guide microstructure control during AM of metallic alloys.</description>

      <title>Coulomb interactions in systems of generalized semi-Dirac fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22572v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interactions have strong effects in systems with flat bands. We examine the role of Coulomb interactions in two dimensional chiral anisotropic quasiparticles that disperse linearly in one direction and have relatively flat bands near the neutrality point in the other direction, dispersing with an arbitrary positive even power law $2n\geq 2$. As in the conventional semi-Dirac case ($n = 1$), we show using renormalization group that strong logarithmic divergences in the self-energy of generalized semi-Dirac fermions resum and lead to a restoration of the linearity of the spectrum for arbitrary n over a sizable energy window in the perturbative regime. We discuss those results in light of previous non-perturbative large $N_f$ results and address the implications for physical observables.</description>

      <title>The effects of fibre spatial distribution and relative orientation on the percolation and mechanics of stochastic fibre networks: A model of peptide hydrogels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03894v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The structures of fibre networks can vary greatly due to fibre interactions during formation. We have modified the steps of generating Mikado networks to create two new model classes by altering the spatial distribution and relative orientation of their fibres to mimic the structures of self-assembling peptide hydrogels (SAPHs), whose physical properties depend strongly on their fibres' interactions. The results of our models and experiments on a set of beta-sheet forming SAPHs show that modifying a network's structure affects the percolation threshold and the mechanical behaviour of the material, both near percolation and at higher densities.</description>
