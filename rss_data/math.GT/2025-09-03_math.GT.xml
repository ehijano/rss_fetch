      <title>Obstruction to Equivariant Ribbon Concordance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A periodic link, is link in $S^3$ with action of $\mathbb{Z}_p$ by rotation with $2\pi/p$ around a fixed unknot $U$. The equivariant Khovanov homology of periodic links has been studied in \cite{BP17}. We prove that the equivariant Khovanov homology for periodic links is functorial under equivariant cobordisms. Furthere more, we show that equivariant ribbon concordances induce a split injection on equivariant Khovanov homology.</description>

      <title>On Systole, Kissing Number and Volume of Arithmetic Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this expository article is to give a down-to-hearth introduction to the notion of an arithmetic group and arithmetic manifold. To achieve this we have decided to bring two geometrical questions relating the growth of systole and kissing number in hyperbolic manifolds, as a motivational guide, whose answers so far are given by the use of arithmetic manifolds. As a consequence, we answer these questions in detail for dimension 2, we mention was is known for hyperbolic manifolds of higher dimension, and also for other locally symmetric spaces. We end the exposition with some open questions.</description>

      <title>On Isolated Geometric Triangulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Work of Kalelkar, Schleimer, and Segerman shows that, with some exceptions, the set of essential ideal triangulations of an orientable cusped hyperbolic 3-manifold is connected via 2-3 and 3-2 moves. It is natural to ask if the subgraph consisting of only those triangulations that are geometric is connected. Hoffman gives the first two examples of geometric triangulations with the property that no 2-3 or 3-2 move results in a geometric triangulation. In this paper, we introduce these as isolated geometric triangulations and show that this is not a property of small manifolds by exhibiting an infinite family of once-punctured torus bundles whose monodromy ideal triangulation is isolated.</description>

      <title>Liftability of periodic mapping classes under alternating covers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $S_g$ be the closed orientable surface of genus $g \geq 2$, and let $\mathrm{Mod}(S_g)$ be the mapping class group of $S_g$. Let $A_n$ denote the alternating group on $n$ letters. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions under which a periodic mapping class has a conjugate that lifts under the branched cover $S_g \to S_g/A_n$ induced by an action of $A_n$ on $S_g$. This provides a classification of the subgroups of $\mathrm{Mod}(S_g)$ that are isomorphic to $A_n \rtimes \mathbb{Z}_m$, up to a certain equivalence that we call weak conjugacy. As an application, we show that for $n \geq 7$, such a subgroup of $\mathrm{Mod}(S_g)$ cannot have an irreducible periodic mapping class. Furthermore, we show that for $n \geq 5$ and $n \neq 6$, if the order of such a subgroup is greater than $5g-5$, then $m \leq 26$. Moreover, for $g \geq 2$ and $n \geq 5$, we establish that there exists no subgroup of $\mathrm{Mod}(S_g)$ that is isomorphic to $A_n \rtimes \mathbb{Z}$, where the $\mathbb{Z}$-component is generated by a power of a Dehn twist. Finally, we provide a complete classification of the weak conjugacy classes of such subgroups in $\mathrm{Mod}(S_{10})$ and $\mathrm{Mod}(S_{11})$.</description>

Abstract: We describe the lower algebraic $K$-theory of the integral group ring of both the pure and full braid groups of the real projective plane $\mathbb{R}P^2$ with $3$ strings, as well as that of the integral group ring of the mapping class group of $\mathbb{R}P^2$ with $3$ marked points. In addition, we give a general formula for the algebraic $K$-theory groups of the group ring of the mapping class group of non-orientable surfaces with k marked points, where $k \geq 3$.</description>

      <title>Minimal surface entropy and applications of Ricci flow on finite-volume hyperbolic 3-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies minimal surface entropy (the exponential asymptotic growth of the number of minimal surfaces up to a given value of area) for negatively curved metrics on hyperbolic $3$-manifolds of finite volume, particularly its comparison to the hyperbolic minimal surface entropy in terms of sectional and scalar curvature.
  On one hand, for metrics that are bilipschitz equivalent to the hyperbolic metric and have sectional curvature bounded above by $-1$ and uniformly bounded below, we show that the entropy achieves its minimum if and only if the metric is hyperbolic.
  On the other hand, by analyzing the convergence rate of the Ricci flow toward the hyperbolic metric, we prove that among all metrics with scalar curvature bounded below by $-6$ and with non-positive sectional curvature on the cusps, the entropy is maximized at the hyperbolic metric, provided that it is infinitesimally rigid. Furthermore, if the metrics are uniformly $C^0$-close to the hyperbolic metric and asymptotically cusped, then the entropy associated with the Lebesgue measure is uniquely maximized at the hyperbolic metric.</description>

      <title>The $K(\pi, 1)$ conjecture for affine Artin groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this summary paper, we present the key ideas behind the recent proof of the $K(\pi, 1)$ conjecture for affine Artin groups, which states that complements of locally finite affine hyperplane arrangements with real equations and stable under orthogonal reflections are aspherical. We survey three facets of the argument: the combinatorics of noncrossing partition posets associated with Coxeter groups; the appearance of dual Artin groups and the question of their isomorphism with standard Artin groups; the topological models and their interplay in the proof.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give some simple conditions under which a group acting on a bifoliated plane comes from the induced action of a pseudo-Anosov flow on its orbit space. An application of the strategy is a less technical proof of a result of Barbot that the induced action of an Anosov flow on its orbit space uniquely determines the flow up to orbit equivalence. In another application, we recover an expansive flow on a 3-manifold from the action of a group on a \emph{loom space} as defined by Schleimer and Segerman.</description>

      <title>A quantization of the $\operatorname{SL}_2(\mathbb{C})$-Chern-Simons invariant of tangle exteriors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Previous work of the author and Reshetikhin shows how to use modules over the unrestricted quantum group (at a root of unity) to define quantum representations of a groupoid of braids with flat $\mathfrak{sl}_{2}$ connections on their complements, equivalently $\operatorname{SL}_{2}(\mathbb{C})$ representations or hyperbolic structures. In this article we explain how to use these representations to define quantum invariants $\mathcal{Z}_{N}$ of tangles and links with such geometric structures. Unlike previous constructions of geometric quantum invariants $\mathcal{Z}_{N}$ is defined without any phase ambiguity. We interpret $\mathcal{Z}_{N}$ as a quantization of the $\operatorname{SL}_{2}(\mathbb{C})$-Chern-Simons invariant $\mathcal{I}$. It is natural to conjecture that $\mathcal{Z}_{N}$ is related to the quantization of Chern-Simons theory with complex, noncompact gauge group $\operatorname{SL}_{2}(\mathbb{C})$ and we discuss how to interpret our results in this context.</description>

      <title>Open 2D TFTs admit initial open-closed extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that any open 2-dimensional topological field theory valued in a symmetric monoidal $\infty$-category (with suitable colimits) extends canonically to an open-closed field theory whose value at the circle is the Hochschild homology object of its value at the disk. As a corollary, we obtain an action of the moduli spaces of surfaces on the Hochschild homology object of $E_1$-Calabi-Yau algebras. This provides a space level refinement of previous work of Costello over $\mathbb{Q}$ and Wahl-Westerland and Wahl over $\mathbb{Z}$, and serves as a crucial ingredient to Lurie's "non-compact cobordism hypothesis" in dimension 2. As part of the proof we also give a description of slice categories of the d-dimensional bordism category with boundary, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Inertia groups of $(n-1)$-connected $2n$-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.00782v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we compute the inertia groups of $(n-1)$-connected, smooth, closed, oriented $2n$-manifolds where $n \geq 3$. As a consequence, we complete the diffeomorphism classification of such manifolds, finishing a program initiated by Wall sixty years ago, with the exception of the $126$-dimensional case of the Kervaire invariant one problem.
  In particular, we find that the inertia group always vanishes for $n \neq 4,8,9$ -- for $n \gg 0$, this was known by the work of several previous authors, including Wall, Stolz, and Burklund and Hahn with the first named author. When $n = 4,8,9$, we apply Kreck's modified surgery and a special case of Crowley's $Q$-form conjecture, proven by Nagy, to compute the inertia groups of these manifolds. In the cases $n=4,8$, our results recover unpublished work of Crowley--Nagy and Crowley--Olbermann.
  In contrast, we show that the homotopy and concordance inertia groups of $(n-1)$-connected, smooth, closed, oriented $2n$-manifolds with $n \geq 3$ always vanish.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.13272v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wajnryb proved that the mapping class group of a closed oriented surface is generated by two elements. We proved that the mapping class group is generated by two pseudo-Anosov elements. In particular, if the genus is greater than or equal to nine, we can take the generators to two conjugate pseudo-Anosov elements with arbitrarily large dilatations. Another result we prove is that the mapping class group is generated by two conjugate reducible but not periodic elements if the genus is greater than or equal to eight. We also give similar results to the first and third results for the hyperelliptic mapping class group when the genus is greater than or equal to one.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13242v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the density of the Burau representation from the perspective of a non-semisimple TQFT at a fourth root of unity. This gives a TQFT construction of Squier's Hermitian form on the Burau representation with possibly mixed signature. We prove that the image of the braid group in the space of possibly indefinite unitary representations is dense. We also argue for the potential applications of non-semisimple TQFTs toward topological quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Profinite almost rigidity in 3-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16002v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that any compact, orientable 3-manifold with empty or toral boundary is profinitely almost rigid among all compact, orientable 3-manifolds. In other words, the profinite completion of its fundamental group determines its homeomorphism type to finitely many possibilities. Moreover, the profinite completion of the fundamental group of a mixed 3-manifold, together with the peripheral structure, uniquely determines the homeomorphism type of its Seifert part, i.e. the maximal graph manifold components in the JSJ-decomposition. On the other hand, without assigning the peripheral structure, the profinite completion of a mixed 3-manifold group may not uniquely determine the fundamental group of its Seifert part. The proof is based on JSJ-decomposition.</description>

      <title>Free ribbon lemma for surface-link</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09281v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A free surface-link is a surface-link whose fundamental group is a free group not necessarily meridian-based. Free ribbon lemma says that every free sphere-link in the 4-sphere is a ribbon sphere-link. Four different proofs of Free ribbon lemma are explained. The first proof is done in an earlier paper. The second proof is done by showing that there is an O2-handle basis of a ribbon surface-link. The third proof is done by removing the commuter relations from a Wirtinger presentation of a free group, which a paper on another proof of Free ribbon lemma complements. The fourth proof is given by the special case of the proof of the result that every free surface-link is a ribbon surface-link which is a stabilization of a free ribbon sphere-link. As a consequence, it is shown that a surface-link is a sublink of a free surface-link if and only if it is a stabilization of a ribbon sphere-link.</description>

      <title>Revised note on surface-link of trivial components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05151v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is shown that a surface-link of ribbon surface-knot components is a ribbon surface-link if and only if it is a surface-link producing a ribbon surface-link by surgery along a self-trivial 1-handle system. This corrects an earlier statement. This result makes a corrected proof for the claim that every surface-link of trivial surface-knot components with at most one aspheric component is a ribbon surface-link. For non-ribbon surface-links of trivial components with at least two aspheric components constructed in a previous note, it adds the new property that non-ribbonability continues through surgery along any self-trivial 1-handle system.</description>

      <title>Ribbonness on boundary surface-link</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18154v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is shown that a boundary surface-link in the 4-sphere is a ribbon surface-link if the surface-knot obtained from it by surgery along a pairwise nontrivial 1-handle system is a ribbon surface-link. As a corollary, the surface-knot obtained from the anti-parallel surface-link of a non-ribbon surface-knot by surgery along a nontrivial fusion 1-handle is a non-ribbon surface-knot. This result answers Cochran's conjecture on non-ribbon sphere-knots in the affirmative.</description>

      <title>Closed Formulas for $\eta$-Corrections in the Once Punctured Torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18334v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study $\eta$-correction terms in the Kauffman bracket skein algebra of the once-punctured torus $K_t(\Sigma_{1,1})$. While the Frohman-Gelca product-to-sum rule is explicit on the closed torus, punctures introduce correction terms in the ideal $(\eta)$ whose structure has resisted systematic description beyond low-determinant cases. We give a closed form for the family $P_n=(1,0)\cdot T_n((1,2))$: the correction $\epsilon_n$ has an explicit Chebyshev expansion with coefficients that factor as geometric sums in $t^{\pm4}$ governed by parity. Tracking creation and cancellation of $\eta$ through the Chebyshev recurrence, and using diffeomorphism invariance, the formula transports to all products $C_1\cdot T_k(C_2)$ with $|\det(C_1,C_2)|=2$.
  We further treat the \emph{primitive maximal-thread} regime, where one Frohman-Gelca summand is fully threaded and the other is simple or doubly covered. In this case we obtain a closed form for the discrepancy: an $\eta$-linear cascade with Chebyshev $S$-coefficients that lowers the thread degree by two at each step. Equivalently, in this maximal-thread regime we solve the specialized Wang-Wong recursion in closed form; the coefficients match their fast algorithm term-by-term (up to the $T_0$ normalization) and subsume Cho's $|\det|=2$ case. The resulting rules give compact, scalable formulas for symbolic multiplication in $K_t(\Sigma_{1,1})$.</description>

      <title>Mapping classes of Real Rational Surface Automorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15075v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\{F_n, n\ge 8\}$ be a family of diffeomorphisms on real rational surfaces that are birationally equivalent to birational maps on $\mathbf{P}^2(\mathbb{R})$. In this article, we investigate the mapping classes of the diffeomorphisms $F_n, n\ge 8$. These diffeomorphisms are reducible with unique invariant irreducible curves, and we determine the mapping classes of their restrictions, $\hat F_n, n \ge 8$, on the cut surfaces, showing that they are pseudo-Anosov and do not arise from Penner's construction. For $n=8$, Lehmer's number is realized as the stretch factor of $\hat F_8$, a pseudo-Anosov map on a once-punctured genus $5$ orientable surface. The diffeomorphism $\hat F_8$ is a new geometric realization of a Lehmer's number.</description>

      <title>Elementary equivalence and diffeomorphism groups of smooth manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07427v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $M$ and $N$ be smooth manifolds, with $M$ closed and connected. If the $C^r$--diffeomorphism group of $M$ is elementarily equivalent to the $C^s$--diffeomorphism group of $N$ for some $r,s\in[1,\infty)\cup\{0,\infty\}$, then $r=s$ and $M$ and $N$ are $C^r$--diffeomorphic. This strengthens a previously known result by Takens and Filipkiewicz, which asserts that for integer regularities, a group isomorphism between diffeomorphism groups of closed manifolds necessarily arises from a diffeomorphism of the underlying manifolds. We prove an analogous result for groups of diffeomorphisms preserving smooth volume forms, in dimension at least two.</description>
