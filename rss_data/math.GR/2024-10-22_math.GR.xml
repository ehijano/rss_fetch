      <title>Finite matrix multiplication algorithms from infinite groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Cohn-Umans (FOCS '03) group-theoretic framework for matrix multiplication produces fast matrix multiplication algorithms from three subsets of a finite group $G$ satisfying a simple combinatorial condition (the Triple Product Property). The complexity of such an algorithm then depends on the representation theory of $G$. In this paper we extend the group-theoretic framework to the setting of infinite groups. In particular, this allows us to obtain constructions in Lie groups, with favorable parameters, that are provably impossible in finite groups of Lie type (Blasiak, Cohn, Grochow, Pratt, and Umans, ITCS '23). Previously the Lie group setting was investigated purely as an analogue of the finite group case; a key contribution in this paper is a fully developed framework for obtaining bona fide matrix multiplication algorithms directly from Lie group constructions.</description>

      <title>On the Nilpotency of Locally Pro-p Contraction Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: H. Gl\"ockner and G. A. Willis have recently shown that locally pro-p contraction groups are nilpotent. The proof hinges on a fixed-point result: if the local field $\mathbb{F}_{p}(\!(t)\!)$ acts on its $d$-th power $\mathbb{F}_{p}(\!(t)\!)^{d}$ additively, continuously, and in an appropriately equivariant manner, then the action has a non-zero fixed point. We provide a short proof of this theorem.</description>

      <title>Deformations of nearby subgroups and approximate Jordan constants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb{U}$ be a Banach Lie group and $S\subseteq \mathbb{U}$ an ad-bounded subset thereof, in the sense that there is a uniform bound on the adjoint operators induced by elements of $S$ on the Lie algebra of $\mathbb{U}$. We prove that (1) $S$-valued continuous maps from compact groups to $\mathbb{U}$ sufficiently close to being morphisms are uniformly close to morphisms; and (2) for any Lie subgroup $\mathbb{G}\le \mathbb{U}$ there is an identity neighborhood $U\ni 1\in \mathbb{U}$ so that $\mathbb{G}\cdot U\cap S$-valued morphisms (embeddings) from compact groups into $\mathbb{U}$ are close to morphisms (respectively embeddings) into $\mathbb{G}$.
  This recovers and generalizes results of Turing's to the effect that (a) Lie groups arbitrarily approximable by finite subgroups have abelian identity component and (b) if a Lie group is approximable in this fashion and has a faithful $d$-dimensional representation then it is also so approximable by finite groups with the same property. Another consequence is a strengthening of a prior result stating that finite subgroups in a Banach Lie group sufficiently close to a given compact subgroup thereof admit a finite upper bound on the smallest indices of their normal abelian subgroups (an approximate version of Jordan's theorem on finite subgroups of linear groups).</description>

      <title>The Pants Graph of a Rose</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of a pants decomposition for a rose, where a rose is defined as a wedge sum of finitely many circles, and construct the corresponding pants graph of a rose. A pants decomposition of a rose leads to the formation of a simplicial graph, referred to as the pants graph of a rose, consisting of all possible pants decompositions. Recall that the outer automorphism group of a free group is isomorphic to the group of homotopy classes of homotopy equivalences of a rose. The natural isometric action of this group on the pants graph induces a coarsely Lipschitz orbit map. Additionally, we construct a coarsely Lipschitz map from the pants graph to the free splitting complex. These results imply that the pants graph of a rose is both connected and unbounded.</description>

      <title>Locally approximating groups of homeomorphisms of manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a compact, connected manifold of positive dimension and let $\mathcal G\leq\textrm{Homeo}(M)$ be \emph{locally approximating} in the sense that for all open $U\subseteq M$ compactly contained in a single Euclidean chart of $M$, the subgroup $\mathcal G[U]$ consisting of elements of $\mathcal G$ supported in $U$ is dense in the full group of homeomorphisms supported in $U$. We prove that $\mathcal G$ interprets first order arithmetic, as well as a first order predicate that encodes membership in finitely generated subgroups of $\mathcal G$. As a consequence, we show that if $\mathcal G$ is not finitely generated, then no group elementarily equivalent to $\mathcal G$ can be finitely generated. We show that many finitely generated locally approximating groups of homeomorphisms $\mathcal G$ of a manifold are prime models of their theories, and give conditions that guarantee any finitely presented group $G$ that is elementarily equivalent to $\mathcal G$ is isomorphic to $\mathcal G$. We thus recover some results of Lasserre about the model theory of Thompson's groups $F$ and $T$. Finally, we obtain several action rigidity result for locally approximating groups of homeomorphisms. If $\mathcal G$ acts in a locally approximating way on a compact, connected manifold $M$ then the dimension of $M$ is uniquely determined by the elementary equivalence class of $\mathcal G$. Moreover, if $\dim M\leq 3$ then $M$ is uniquely determined up to homeomorphism. In for general closed smooth manifolds, the homotopy type of $M$ is uniquely determined. In this way, we obtain a generalization of a well-known result of Rubin.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define an independence system associated with simple graphs. We prove that the independence system is a matroid for certain families of graphs, including trees, with bases as minimal resolving sets. Consequently, the greedy algorithm on the matroid can be used to find the minimum-cost resolving set of weighted graphs, wherein the independent system is a matroid. We also characterize hyperplanes of the matroid for trees and prove that its dual matroid is loop-free.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we prove a sharp defective log-Sobolev inequality on H-type groups. Then we use such an inequality to show exponential integrability of Lipschitz functions with respect to the heat kernel measure. A defective log-Sobolev-type inequality for the Gaussian-like measure with respect to the sub-Riemannian distance is also proved on arbitrary H-type groups.</description>

      <title>Profinite almost rigidity in 3-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that any compact, orientable 3-manifold with empty or incompressible toral boundary is profinitely almost rigid among all compact, orientable, boundary-incompressible 3-manifolds, i.e. the profinite completion of its fundamental group determines its homeomorphism type up to finitely many possibilities. Moreover, the profinite completion of the fundamental group of a mixed 3-manifold, together with the peripheral structure, uniquely determines the homeomorphism type of its Seifert part (i.e. the maximal graph manifold components in the JSJ-decomposition). On the other hand, without assigning the peripheral structure, the profinite completion of a mixed 3- manifold group may not even determine the fundamental group of its Seifert part. The proof is based on JSJ-decomposition.</description>

We also show that if $G$ is a countably infinite abelian group, then there exists a (not necessarily ergodic) measure preserving system $(X,\mathscr{B},\mu,\{T_g\}_{g \in G})$ and a function $f \in L^2(X,\mu)$ with $|f| = \phi(0)$ and $\phi(g) = \langle T_gf,f\rangle$.</description>

Abstract: We compute the abelianization of the Jennings group $\mathcal{J}_k(\mathbb{Z})$ of powers series with constant coefficient $0$, linear coefficent equal to $1$ and vanishing coefficients in orders greater or equal than $2$ and less than $k$, where $k\geqslant2$. This is accomplished by directly dealing with the equivalence classes in the corresponding abelianizations, in contrast with the work of I. K. Babenko and S. A. Bogatyy, who give an explicit abelianization morphism for the case $k=2$.</description>

      <title>On good $A_1$ subgroups, Springer maps, and overgroups of distinguished unipotent elements in reductive groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16379v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Suppose $G$ is a simple algebraic group defined over an algebraically closed field of good characteristic $p$. In 2018 Korhonen showed that if $H$ is a connected reductive subgroup of $G$ which contains a distinguished unipotent element $u$ of $G$ of order $p$, then $H$ is $G$-irreducible in the sense of Serre. We present a short and uniform proof of this result under an extra hypothesis using so-called good $A_1$ subgroups of $G$, introduced by Seitz. In the process we prove some new results about good $A_1$ subgroups of $G$ and their properties. We also formulate a counterpart of Korhonen's theorem for overgroups of $u$ which are finite groups of Lie type. Moreover, we generalize both results above by removing the restriction on the order of $u$ under a mild condition on $p$ depending on the rank of $G$, and we present an analogue of Korhonen's theorem for Lie algebras.</description>

      <title>Permutation groups, partition lattices and block structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10461v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a transitive permutation group on $\Omega$. The $G$-invariant partitions form a sublattice of the lattice of all partitions of $\Omega$, having the further property that all its elements are uniform (that is, have all parts of the same size). If, in addition, all the equivalence relations defining the partitions commute, then the relations form an \emph{orthogonal block structure}, a concept from statistics; in this case the lattice is modular. If it is distributive, then we have a \emph{poset block structure}, whose automorphism group is a \emph{generalised wreath product}. We examine permutation groups with these properties, which we call the \emph{OB property} and \emph{PB property} respectively, and in particular investigate when direct and wreath products of groups with these properties also have these properties.
  A famous theorem on permutation groups asserts that a transitive imprimitive group $G$ is embeddable in the wreath product of two factors obtained from the group (the group induced on a block by its setwise stabiliser, and the group induced on the set of blocks by~$G$). We extend this theorem to groups with the PB property, embeddng them into generalised wreath products. We show that the map from posets to generalised wreath products preserves intersections and inclusions.
  We have included background and historical material on these concepts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11754v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be a countable group that admits an essential measurable splitting (for instance, any group measure equivalent to a free product of nontrivial groups).
  We show: (1) for any two nontrivial countable groups $A$ and $B$ that are measure equivalent, the wreath product groups $A\wr\Gamma$ and $B\wr\Gamma$ are measure equivalent (in fact, orbit equivalent) -- this is interesting even in the case when the groups $A$ and $B$ are finite; and (2) the groups $A\wr \Gamma$ and $(A\times\mathbf{Z})\wr\Gamma$ are measure equivalent (in fact, orbit equivalent) for every nontrivial countable group $A$.
  On the other hand, we show that certain wreath product actions are not even stably orbit equivalent if $\Gamma$ is instead assumed to be a sofic icc group that is Bernoulli superrigid, and $A$ and $B$ have different cardinalities.</description>

      <title>A universal Kaluzhnin--Krasner embedding theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.15458v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given two groups $A$ and $B$, the Kaluzhnin--Krasner universal embedding theorem states that the wreath product $A\wr B$ acts as a universal receptacle for extensions from $A$ to $B$. For a split extension, this embedding is compatible with the canonical splitting of the wreath product, which is further universal in a precise sense. This result was recently extended to Lie algebras and to cocommutative Hopf algebras.
  The aim of the present article is to explore the feasibility of adapting the theorem to other types of algebraic structures. By explaining the underlying unity of the three known cases, our analysis gives necessary and sufficient conditions for this to happen.
  From those we may for instance conclude that a version for crossed modules can indeed be attained, while the theorem cannot be adapted to, say, associative algebras, Jordan algebras or Leibniz algebras, when working over an infinite field: we prove that then, amongst non-associative algebras, only Lie algebras admit a universal Kaluzhnin--Krasner embedding theorem.</description>

Abstract: We present a characterization of simple finite non-degenerate bijective set-theoretic solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation in terms of the algebraic structure of the associated permutation skew left braces.
  In particular, we prove that they need to have a unique minimal non-zero ideal and modulo this ideal one obtains a trivial skew left brace of cyclic type.</description>

      <title>Solid lines in axial algebras of Jordan type $\tfrac{1}{2}$ and Jordan algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18808v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that a primitive axial algebra of Jordan type $\eta = \tfrac{1}{2}$ is a Jordan algebra if and only if every $2$-generated subalgebra is \emph{solid}, a notion introduced recently by Ilya Gorshkov, Sergey Shpectorov and Alexei Staroletov.
  As a byproduct, we show that a subalgebra generated by axes $a,b$ is solid if and only if the associator $[L_a,L_b]$ is a derivation. Moreover, we show that $2$-generated subalgebras that are not solid contain precisely $3$ axes.</description>

      <title>Optimal s-boxes against alternative operations and linear propagation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.20059v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Civino et al.~(2019) have shown how some diffusion layers can expose a Substitution-Permutation Network to vulnerability from differential cryptanalysis when employing alternative operations coming from groups isomorphic to the translation group on the message space. In this study, we present a classification of diffusion layers that exhibit linearity in parallel alternative operations for ciphers with 4-bit s-boxes, enabling the possibility of an alternative differential attack simultaneously targeting all the s-boxes within the block. Furthermore, we investigate the differential behaviour with respect to alternative operations for all classes of optimal 4-bit s-boxes, as defined by Leander and Poschmann (2007). Our examination reveals that certain classes contain weak permutations w.r.t. alternative differential attacks, and we leverage these vulnerabilities to execute a series of experiments.</description>

      <title>Classification of the types for which every Hopf--Galois correspondence is bijective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15800v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $L/K$ be any finite Galois extension with Galois group $G$. It is known by Chase and Sweedler that the Hopf--Galois correspondence is injective for every Hopf--Galois structure on $L/K$, but it need not be bijective in general. Hopf--Galois structures are known to be related to skew braces, and recently, the first-named author and Trappeniers proposed a new version of this connection with the property that the intermediate fields of $L/K$ in the image of the Hopf--Galois correspondence are in bijection with the left ideals of the associated skew brace. As an application, they classified the groups $G$ for which the Hopf--Galois correspondence is bijective for every Hopf--Galois structure on any $G$-Galois extension. In this paper, using a similar approach, we shall classify the groups $N$ for which the Hopf--Galois correspondence is bijective for every Hopf--Galois structure of type $N$ on any Galois extension.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic dynamics on amenable groups and van der Corput sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00806v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We answer a question of Bergelson and Lesigne by showing that the notion of van der Corput set does not depend on the F\o lner sequence used to define it. This result has been discovered independently by Sa\'ul Rodr\'iguez Mart\'in. Both ours and Rodr\'iguez's proofs proceed by first establishing a converse to the Furstenberg Correspondence Principle for amenable groups.
  This involves studying the distributions of Reiter sequences over congruent sequences of tilings of the group.
  Lastly, we show that many of the equivalent characterizations of van der Corput sets in $\mathbb{N}$ that do not involve F\o lner sequences remain equivalent for arbitrary countably infinite groups.</description>
