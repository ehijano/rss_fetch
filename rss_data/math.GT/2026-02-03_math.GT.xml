      <title>A differential topology proof that the $SU(2)$ character variety of the genus two surface is homeomorphic to ${\mathbb C} P^3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a proof that the $SU(2)$ character variety of a genus two surface, $\chi(F_2)$, is a closed compact manifold, and a proof of the Narasimhan-Ramanan theorem that $\chi(F_2)$ is
  homeomorphic to ${\mathbb C} P^3$. This is done entirely in the language of $SU(2)$ representations, differential topology and elementary algebraic topology. It avoids the Narasimhan-Seshadri correspondence, clarifying the nature of Lagrangian immersions into $\chi(F_2)$ induced by 3-manifolds with genus two boundary. We give examples of such Lagrangian immersions and describe a correspondence from multicurves in the pillowcase to Lagrangian immersions in $\chi(F_2)$, induced by a 2-stranded tangle in a punctured genus 2 handlebody. We give an example of a non-transverse pair of smooth Lagrangians in $\chi(F_2)$ induced by a genus 2 Heegaard splitting of $(S^3,W)$ for the ``linked eyeglasses" web $W$, which are made transverse, and hence the corresponding Chern-Simons function Morse, using Goldman flows/holonomy perturbations along embedded curves in the Heegaard surface.</description>

      <title>Knots with large character varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study knots whose $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{C})$-character varieties have a component of dimension greater than one. We call such knots $\mathcal{X}$-large and introduce two diagrammatic constructions that produce $\mathcal{X}$-large knots. The first construction uses split link diagrams and rational tangle replacements, providing a topological explanation for most $\mathcal{X}$-large knots observed in knot tables. The second construction is based on braids and orientation-reversing involutions, and is motivated by a detailed analysis of the knot $10_{123}$, also known as the Turk's head knot $Th(3,5)$. In particular, this approach applies to Turk's head knots $Th(p,q)$ with $p$ and $q$ odd, leading us to conjecture that all such knots are $\mathcal{X}$-large. In doing so, we also present a non-orientable analogue of Thurston's theorem giving a lower bound on the dimension of character varieties of non-orientable 3-manifolds.</description>

      <title>The generalized volume conjecture for the figure-eight knot parametrized by a complex number with small imaginary part</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic behavior, as $N$ tends to infinity, of the $N$-dimensional colored Jones polynomial of the figure-eight knot, evaluated at $\exp(\xi/N)$ for a complex parameter $\xi$ with $0&lt;\mathrm{Im}\xi&lt;\pi/2$. We prove that if $\mathrm{Re}{\xi}$ is large the colored Jones polynomial grows exponentially with growth rate expressed by the Chern--Simons invariant, and that if $\mathrm{Re}{\xi}$ is small it converges to the reciprocal of the Alexander polynomial evaluated at $\exp\xi$.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal 2-sphere basis of stable 4-sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known by Wall that any two orthogonal bases of every stable 4-sphere are transformed into each other by an orientation-preserving diffeomorphism of the stable 4-sphere. In this paper another proof of Wall's result is presented, strengthened in the sense that the diffeomorphism is taken as the lift of an equivalence of a trivial surface-knot space to the double branched covering space identified with the stable 4-sphere.</description>

      <title>Optimizing the Upper-Bound Constant for the Crossing Number of Polynomial Curve Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Baader, J\"org, and Parlier recently established an upper bound for the crossing number of curve systems of size $m\asymp g^{1+\alpha}$ on a genus $g$ surface, obtaining a leading coefficient of $9/4=2.25$. Their construction relies on fibre surfaces associated with complete bipartite graphs and uses a symmetric parameter choice corresponding to the central binomial coefficient. In this note, we optimize their construction by relaxing the parameter symmetry and solving the resulting entropy balance problem. We show that for every $\alpha&gt;0$ and every $\varepsilon&gt;0$, \[ \mathrm{Cr}\bigl(g,\lfloor g^{1+\alpha}\rfloor\bigr) \ \le\ (C_\star+\varepsilon)\,\alpha^2\, g^{1+2\alpha}(\log g)^2 \qquad (g\ \text{sufficiently large}), \] where \[ C_\star\ =\ \inf_{0&lt;x\le 1/2}\ \frac{2x}{H(x)^2} \ \approx\ 1.5805443269, \qquad H(x)=-x\log x-(1-x)\log(1-x). \] This reduces the previous constant by about $30\%$ while staying within the same topological framework.</description>

      <title>Random Groups at Density $d&lt;1/2$: Sharp Length Inequalities for Generalized Torsion and a Fixed-width Exclusion via First-order Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a random group in Gromov's density model $G(m,d,L)$ with $d&lt;\tfrac12$. We prove a sharp quantitative constraint on products of conjugates equal to the identity: for every $n\ge1$ and $\varepsilon&gt;0$, with overwhelming probability as $L\to\infty$, any tight word \[ W=\prod_{i=1}^n h_i^{-1} g h_i =1 \quad\text{in } G \] (with $g\neq 1$ as a word) satisfies the inequality \[ \sum_{i=1}^n \len{h_i} \;&gt;\; \frac{1-2d-\varepsilon}{2}\,L \;-\; \frac{n}{2}\,\len{g}. \] The proof is a short van Kampen diagram argument: Ollivier's sharp isoperimetric inequality forces a 2-cell contributing a large portion of its boundary to the outer boundary, and a simple boundary block-counting estimate yields this corridor-type lower bound. As consequences we obtain uniform short-witness exclusions and width--length tradeoffs for generalized torsion at every density $d&lt;\tfrac12$. We also deduce that random groups have no generalized torsion of any fixed width as a corollary of the recent first-order transfer theorem of Kharlampovich, Miasnikov, and Sklinos.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.01705v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a polynomial factorization problem that naturally arises from Hartley's factorization condition on the Alexander polynomial of freely periodic knots. We give a number-theoretic interpretation of this factorization condition, which allows for efficient computation. As an application, we prove that any polynomial which is not a product of cyclotomic polynomials can be the Alexander polynomial of a freely p-periodic knot for only finitely many p. As a demonstration of the computational efficiency of these methods, we also show that the Alexander polynomial of any freely-periodic L-space knot with genus at most 16 must be a product of cyclotomic polynomials. We conjecture that any periodic or freely periodic L-space knot must be an iterated torus knot.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-isotopies of simply connected 4-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11196v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Perron and Quinn gave independent proofs in 1986 that every topological pseudo-isotopy of a simply-connected, compact topological 4-manifold is isotopic to the identity. Another result of Quinn is that every smooth pseudo-isotopy of a simply-connected, compact, smooth 4-manifold is smoothly stably isotopic to the identity. From this he deduced that $\pi_4(\operatorname{TOP}(4)/\operatorname{O}(4)) =0$. A replacement criterion is used at a key juncture in Quinn's proofs, but the justification given for it is incorrect. We provide different arguments that bypass the replacement criterion, thus completing Quinn's proofs of both the topological and the stable smooth pseudo-isotopy theorems. We discuss the replacement criterion and state it as an open problem.</description>

Abstract: We consider a generalization of the Kauffman bracket skein algebra of a surface that is generated by loops and arcs between marked points on the interior or boundary, up to skein relations defined by Muller and Roger-Yang. We compute the center of this Muller-Roger-Yang skein algebra and show that it is almost Azumaya when the quantum parameter $q$ is a primitive $n$-th root of unity with odd $n$. We also discuss the implications on the representation theory of the Muller-Roger-Yang generalized skein algebra.</description>

      <title>Dax invariants, light bulbs, and isotopies of symplectic structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16083v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses several isotopy problems on $4$-manifolds. First, we classify the isotopy classes of embeddings of $\Sigma$ in $\Sigma\times S^2$ that are geometrically dual to $\{\mbox{pt}\}\times S^2$, where $\Sigma$ is a closed oriented surface with a positive genus, and show that there exist infinitely many such embeddings that are homotopic to each other but mutually non-isotopic, thereby answering a question of Gabai.
  By combining this construction with techniques from symplectic topology, we also answer Problem 2(a) in McDuff-Salamon's problem list and a question of Cieliebak-Eliashberg-Mishachev, which concern the uniqueness and $h$-principle of symplectic structures on closed $4$-manifolds. We answer these questions by establishing the following results: (1) The space of symplectic forms on every irrational ruled surface homologous to a fixed symplectic form has infinitely many connected components; (2) There exist infinitely many symplectic forms on every irrational ruled surface that are formally homotopic, cohomologous, but not homotopic to each other. Both are the first such examples for closed $4$-manifolds.
  The proofs are based on a generalization of the Dax invariant to embedded closed surfaces. In the course of the proof, we obtain several properties of the smooth mapping class group of $\Sigma\times S^2$, which may be of independent interest. For example, we show that there exists a surjective homomorphism from $\pi_0\operatorname{Diff}(\Sigma\times S^2)$ to $\mathbb{Z}^\infty$, such that its restriction to the subgroup of elements pseudo-isotopic to the identity is of infinite rank.</description>

      <title>Measuring the entanglement complexity of 3-periodic networks through the untangling number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15252v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Periodic networks serve as models for the structural organisation of biological and chemical crystalline systems. Single or multiple networks can have different configurations in space, where entanglement may arise due to the way the (possibly curvilinear) edges weave around each other. This entanglement influences the functional, physical, and chemical properties of the materials modelled by the networks, which highlights the need to quantify its complexity. In this paper, we define the least tangled embeddings of 3-periodic networks that we call ground states, through the use of knot-theoretic crossing diagrams. The concept of a ground state permits the definition of a measure of entanglement complexity called the untangling number that quantifies the distance between a given 3-periodic structure and its least tangled version.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07211v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we use new results together with established facts about Thurston's compactification of Teichm\"uller space to address the geometric P=W conjecture for $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})$, which concerns projective compactifications of character varieties of closed surfaces. In particular, we construct a projective compactification of the $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})$-character variety of any closed surface of genus $g&gt;1$, in which the boundary divisors are toric varieties and the dual intersection complex is a sphere. A main technical step, of independent interest, is the derivation of an explicit formula for a well-known embedding of the set of isotopy classes of multicurves on a closed surface of genus $g$ into $\mathbb{N}^{9g-9}$.</description>

Abstract: We introduce boundary special generic maps, a class of submersions from manifolds with boundary to Euclidean spaces whose restriction to the boundary has only boundary definite fold points as its singular points. We derive the differential-topological restrictions imposed by the existence of such maps on the global structure of the source manifolds. Furthermore, we apply our results to the non-singular extension problem, which asks when a map on a closed manifold extends to a non-singular map on a manifold with boundary, and obtain new results on non-singular extensions of special generic maps.</description>

Abstract: We prove that any arithmetic locally symmetric space is homotopy equivalent to a simplicial complex where the number of simplices is bounded linearly in the volume of the space. This settles a well-known conjecture of Gelander. The main technical ingredient, which is of independent interest, is a strengthened version of the Margulis' collar lemma for arithmetic locally symmetric spaces based on the height gap theorem of Breuillard, in which the Margulis constant is made linear in the degree of the trace field of the lattice.</description>

Abstract: We study certain orientation-preserving involutions on three-dimensional small covers. We prove that the quotient space of an orientable three-dimensional small cover by such an involution in $\mathbb{Z}_2^3$ is homeomorphic to a connected sum of copies of $S^2 \times S^1$. If this quotient space is a 3-sphere, then the corresponding small cover is a two-fold branched covering of the 3-sphere along a link. We provide a description of this link in terms of the polytope and the characteristic function.</description>

This leads to a notion of a harmonic analog $\Theta$ of the Bowen-Margulis-Sullivan measure on $\partial^2 G$. We provide three different but related constructions of $\Theta$: 1) by moving the base-point along a quasigeodesic ray 2) by moving the base-point along random walk trajectories 3) directly as a push-forward under the boundary map to $\partial^2 G$ of a measure inherited from studying all bi-infinite random walk trajectories (with no restriction on base-point) on $G^\mathbb{Z}$. Of these, the third construction is the most involved and needs new techniques. It relies on developing a framework where we can treat bi-infinite random walk trajectories as analogs of bi-infinite geodesics on complete simply connected negatively curved manifolds. Geodesic flow on a hyperbolic group is typically not well-defined due to non-uniqueness of geodesics. We circumvent this problem in the random walk setup by considering \emph{all} trajectories. We thus get a well-defined discrete flow that we call the \emph{randomized geodesic flow}, given by the $\mathbb{Z}-$shift on bi-infinite random walk trajectories. The $\mathbb{Z}-$shift is the random analog of the time one map of the geodesic flow. As an analog of ergodicity of the geodesic flow on a closed negatively curved manifold, we establish ergodicity of the $G$-action on $(\partial^2G, \Theta)$. As a consequence of our construction, we prove that the randomized geodesic flow is exponentially mixing of all orders and establish a functional CLT.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic Solutions of the Haydys-Witten Equations and Symplectic Khovanov Homology</title>

Abstract: An influential conjecture by Witten states that there is an instanton Floer homology of four-manifolds with corners that in certain situations is isomorphic to Khovanov homology of a given knot $K$. The Floer chain complex is generated by Nahm pole solutions of the Kapustin-Witten equations on $\mathbb{R}^3 \times \mathbb{R}^+_y$ with an additional monopole-like singular behaviour along the knot $K$ inside the three-dimensional boundary at $y=0$. The Floer differential is given by counting solutions of the Haydys-Witten equations that interpolate between Kapustin-Witten solutions along an additional flow direction $\mathbb{R}_s$. This article investigates solutions of a decoupled version of the Haydys-Witten equations on $\mathbb{R}_s \times \mathbb{R}^3 \times \mathbb{R}^+_y$, which in contrast to the full equations exhibit a Hermitian Yang-Mills structure and can be viewed as a lift of the extended Bogomolny equations (EBE) from three to five dimensions. Inspired by Gaiotto-Witten's approach of adiabatically braiding EBE-solutions to obtain generators of the Floer homology, we propose that there is an equivalence between adiabatic solutions of the decoupled Haydys-Witten equations and non-vertical paths in the moduli space of EBE-solutions fibered over the space of monopole positions. Moreover, we argue that the Grothendieck-Springer resolution of the Lie algebra of the gauge group provides a finite-dimensional model of this moduli space of monopole solutions. These considerations suggest an intriguing similarity between Haydys-Witten instanton Floer homology and symplectic Khovanov homology and provide a novel approach towards a proof of Witten's gauge-theoretic interpretations of Khovanov homology.</description>

Abstract: This is an expository/teaser version of [arXiv:2601.22668] for a very special case of products of $\mathrm{CAT}(-1)$ spaces. We keep this on arXiv as many parts of the argument of [arXiv:2601.22668] are simplified in this special case.</description>

      <title>Epstein-Poincar\'e surfaces for $G-$opers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09936v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a complex, simple Lie group $G$ of adjoint type, we introduce the notion of an Epstein-Poincar\'e surface associated to a $G$-oper. These surfaces generalize Epstein's classical construction for $G=PGL_2 (\mathbb{C})$. As an application, we provide a criterion that ensures that the holonomy of the oper is $\Delta-$Anosov. Finally, we discuss how the developing map of the oper interacts with domains of discontinuity of the holonomy (whenever Anosov) and the transversality properties it satisfies. Along the way, we provide a quick review of opers that we hope serves as a self-contained introduction.</description>
