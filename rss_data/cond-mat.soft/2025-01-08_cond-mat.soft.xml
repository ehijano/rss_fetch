      <title>Critical-like phenomenon in scraping of jamming systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In jamming systems like colloids, emulsions, foams, and biological tissues, significant deformation is essential for processes such as material scraping or wound self-healing. To adequately spread a foam or cream over a surface, external force must be applied to artificially scrape it. The scraping of foam using a rigid plate has been observed to exhibit complex behavior distinct from that of simple liquids. In this study, we quantitatively analyzed the transition between partial and slender scraping regimes by examining changes in internal structure and partial spreading lengths. Our findings reveal that the sequential propagation of bubble rearrangement in the foam's internal structure leads to the partial scraping. Moreover, the scraping length in the partial scraping regime shows divergence near the transition point, characterized by a critical exponent of approximately 0.61. These results imply that foam scraping is governed by directional percolation theory, supported by the agreement between the experimentally observed critical exponent and theoretical predictions. This research significantly advances the understanding of macroscopic kinetics and rheological behavior in jamming systems, including foams, colloids, emulsions, and biological tissues.</description>

      <title>On the addition of micron-size intruders in a shear-thickening suspension of nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the rheological behavior of shear-thickening suspensions made of different types of nanoparticles upon the addition of large intruders referred to as granules. The size ratio ranges from 20 to 120. We examine the effects of granule size, volume fraction, and surface properties on shear-thickening characteristics. Starting with a fumed silica suspension exhibiting discontinuous shear thickening (DST) without granules, the addition of granules at different volume fractions, shifts the onset of thickening to lower shear rates. Concomitantly, the strength of the thickening, quantified by the thickening index, decreases, transitioning from DST to continuous shear thickening (CST). Comparison with suspensions of nanosilica spheres reveals a similar trend, suggesting generality across different systems. However, these results contrast with cornstarch-based suspensions, where granule addition enhances thickening. This difference is attributed to the large size ratio studied here: When the granules are much larger than the particles in the interstitial suspension, the granules introduce a spread in the local shear rate and disrupt the particles' ability to form an extended fabric of force chains. The findings highlight the critical role of particle size ratio in determining the rheology of complex suspensions, paving the way for tailoring material properties in industrial and scientific applications.</description>

      <title>Confinement and Activity-Driven Dynamics of Semiflexible Polymers in Motility Assays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of semiflexible polymers in a motility assay, where motor proteins (MPs) stochastically bind, unbind, and walk along the polymer, under the influence of harmonic confinement. Using Langevin dynamics simulations, we explore the interplay between the polymer's rigidity, activity in the form of attachment/detachment of MPs and subsequent movement of attached MPs, and trap strength, revealing a two-state transition from a trapped to a free polymer, with an intermediate coexistence region. Rigidity significantly impacts the trapping behaviour, with flexible polymers remaining trapped at the higher activity. Attachment/detachment of MPs can also induce a change in the effective rigidity of the polymer and, therefore, influence confinement by the trap.The polymer undergoes spiral and open-chain conformations, with the turning number serving as a key order parameter to quantify spiral formation. We show that confinement stabilizes spiral structures and suppresses open-chain motion, especially at higher activity. The centre of mass (COM) dynamics are analyzed through the mean square displacement (MSD), showing diffusive, ballistic, and diffusive regimes that depend on the trap strength and activity. Negative excess kurtosis indicates nonequilibrium behaviour, which saturates with increasing confinement, reflecting the dominance of the trap over the activity.</description>

      <title>Influence of the dividing surface notion on the formulation of Tolman's law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The influence of the surface curvature on the surface tension of small droplets at equilibrium with a surrounding vapour, or small bubbles at equilibrium with a surrounding liquid, can be expanded as {\gamma}(R) = {\gamma}(planar) - .../R + O(1/R^2). According to Tolman's law, the first-order coefficient in this expansion is obtained from the planar limit of the Tolman length, i.e., the deviation between the equimolar radius and the Laplace radius. Here, Tolman's law is generalized such that it can be applied to any notion of the dividing surface, beside the Laplace radius, on the basis of a generalization of the Gibbs adsorption equation which consistently takes the size dependence of interfacial properties into account.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work thoroughly examines several analytical tools, each possessing a different level of mathematical intricacy, for the purpose of characterizing the orientation distribution function of elongated objects under flow. Our investigation places an emphasis on connecting the orientation distribution to the small angle scattering spectra measured experimentally. The diverse range of mathematical approaches investigated herein provides insights into the flow behavior of elongated particles from different perspectives and serves as powerful tools for elucidating the complex interplay between flow dynamics and the orientation distribution function.</description>

Abstract: Neural networks based on soft and biological matter constitute an interesting potential alternative to traditional implementations based on electric circuits. DNA is a particularly promising system in this context due its natural ability to store information. In recent years, researchers have started to construct neural networks that are based on DNA. In this chapter, I provide a very basic introduction to the concept of DNA neural networks, aiming at an audience that is not familiar with biochemistry.</description>

      <title>The dipolar Aleppo lattice: Ground state ordering and ergodic dynamics in the absence of vertex frustration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Aleppo spin ice geometry, another variation of decimated square ice patterns, which in contrast to similar systems previously studied, does not exhibit vertex frustration. Using synchrotron-based photoemission electron microscopy, we directly visualize low-energy states achieved after thermal annealing, in addition to temperature-dependent moment fluctuations. The results reveal the observation of ground state patterns and the absence of ergodicity-breaking dynamics. Our observations further confirm vertex frustration to be an important criterion for the emergence of ergodicity transitions.</description>

      <title>Energy injection in an epithelial cell monolayer via negative viscosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active fluids are driven out of thermodynamic equilibrium by internally generated forces, causing complex patterns of motion. Even when both the forces and motion are measurable, it is not yet possible to relate the two, because the sources of energy injection and dissipation are often unclear. Here, we study how energy is transferred by developing a method to measure viscosity from the shear stresses and strain rates within an epithelial cell monolayer. Surprisingly, there emerged multicellular regions in which the relationship between shear stress and shear strain rate was negatively proportional, indicating a negative viscosity. We provide direct experimental evidence that the negative viscosity results from cells aligning their stresses with the orientation of the flow. Regions of negative viscosity consistently exhibited greater cell speed and vorticity, and the cells had elevated metabolic activity, indicating that negative viscosity is a mechanism for injection of surplus energy. More broadly, our study shows that negative viscosity is a useful means of quantifying the flow of energy in active materials.</description>

      <title>Patterns robust to Disorder in spatially-interacting Generalized Lotka-Volterra Ecosystems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How do interactions between species influence their spatial distribution in an ecosystem? To answer this question, we introduce a spatially-extended ecosystem of Generalized Lotka-Volterra type, where species can diffuse and interactions are nonlocal. We compute the criterion for the loss of stability of the spatially homogeneous ecosystem, and we show that the stability of the uniform state crucially depends on the most abundant species, and on the interplay between space exploration during one species generation and the interaction range. Focusing on the spectrum of the interaction matrix weighted by the species abundances, we identify a Baik-Ben Arous-P\'ech\'e transition that translates into a transition in the final patterns of the species repartition. Finally assuming that the disorder is small, we exhibit an explicit solution of the dynamical mean-field equation for the species density, obtained as the fixed point of a nonlocal Fisher-Kolmogorov-Petrovski-Piskounov equation. Our work paves the way of future combined approaches at the frontier of active matter and disordered systems, with the hope of better understanding complex ecosystems like bacterial communities.</description>

      <title>Concentration of Empirical First-Passage Times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: First-passage properties are central to the kinetics of target-search processes. Theoretical approaches so far primarily focused on predicting first-passage statistics for a given process or model. In practice, however, one faces the reverse problem of inferring first-passage statistics from, typically sub-sampled, experimental or simulation data. Obtaining trustworthy estimates from under-sampled data and unknown underlying dynamics remains a daunting task, and the assessment of the uncertainty is imperative. In this chapter, we highlight recent progress in understanding and controlling finite-sample effects in empirical first-passage times of reversible Markov processes. Precisely, we present concentration inequalities bounding from above the deviations of the sample mean for any sample size from the true mean first-passage time and construct non-asymptotic confidence intervals. Moreover, we present two-sided bounds on the range of fluctuations, i.e, deviations of the expected maximum and minimum from the mean in any given sample, which control uncertainty even in situations where the mean is a priori not a sufficient statistic.</description>

      <title>Red blood cells aggregates transport for finite concentration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Red blood cells (RBCs) are responsible for transporting oxygen and various metabolites to tissues and organs, as well as removing waste. Several cardiovascular diseases can impair these functions. For instance, in diabetes, increased RBC aggregation can lead to blood occlusion, thereby depriving tissues of efficient oxygen delivery. Interestingly, RBC adhesion occurs not only in disease states but also under physiological conditions, with the key difference being that adhesion is reversible in healthy situations. This paper focuses on numerical simulations in 2D, exploring different adhesion energies (both physiological and pathological) alongside varying flow strengths and hematocrit levels. A systematic analysis of RBC flux and viscosity is conducted. A remarkable finding is that moderate adhesion energy (within the physiological range) enhances RBC transport, thereby improving oxygen delivery to tissues. This provides insight into why RBC adhesion is present under normal conditions. Conversely, increasing adhesion energy beyond a certain point causes a collapse in RBC flux, thus reducing oxygen transport. We provide a basic explanation for the non-monotonic effect of adhesion energy on blood flow efficiency. This finding serves as an initial step in understanding the impact (both positive and negative) of RBC adhesion before addressing this issue in complex networks inspired by realistic microvasculatures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Smart active matter describes agents which can process information according to their individual policy to solve predefined tasks. We introduce a theoretical framework to study a decentralized learning process in which agents can locally exchange their policy to optimize their reward and thus attain target macroscopic states. We use our formalism to derive explicit hydrodynamic equations for the policy dynamics. We apply the theory to two different microscopic models where policies correspond either to fixed parameters similar to evolutionary dynamics, or to state-dependent controllers known from the field of robotics. We find good agreement between theoretical predictions and agent-based simulations. By deriving fundamental control parameters and uncertainty relations, our work lays the foundations for a statistical physics analysis of decentralized learning.</description>

      <title>Shapiro Steps Observed in a Two-Dimensional Yukawa Solid Modulated by a One-Dimensional Vibrational Periodic Substrate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Depinning dynamics of a two-dimensional (2D) solid dusty plasma modulated by a one-dimensional (1D) vibrational periodic substrate are investigated using Langevin dynamical simulations. As the uniform driving force increases gradually, from the overall drift velocity varying with the driving force, four significant Shapiro steps are discovered. The data analysis indicate that, when the ratio of the frequency from the drift motion over potential wells to the external frequency from the modulation substrate is close to integers, dynamic mode locking occurs, corresponding to the discovered Shapiro steps. Around both termini of the first and fourth Shapiro steps, the transitions are found to be always continuous, however, the transition between the second and third Shapiro steps is discontinuous, probably due to the different arrangements of particles.</description>

      <title>Parsimonious inertial cavitation rheometry via bubble collapse time</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.04227v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid and accurate characterization of soft, viscoelastic materials at high strain rates is of interest in biological and engineering applications such as assessing the extent of non-invasive tissue surgery completion and developing injury criteria for the mitigation of blast injuries. The inertial microcavitation rheometry technique (IMR, Estrada et al. 2018) allows for the minimally invasive characterization of local viscoelastic properties at strain rates up to 1E8 per second. However, IMR relies on bright-field videography of a sufficiently translucent sample at approximately 1 million frames per second and a simulation-dependent fit optimization process that can require hours of post-processing. We present an IMR-style technique that parsimoniously characterizes viscoelastic models. The approach uses experimental advancements to accurately estimate the time to first collapse of the laser-induced cavity. A theoretical energy balance analysis yields an approximate collapse time based on the material viscoelasticity parameters. The method closely matches the accuracy of the original IMR procedure while decreasing the computational cost from hours to seconds for the Kelvin--Voigt model and potentially reducing dependence on high-speed videography. This technique can enable nearly real-time characterization of a broader range of soft, viscoelastic hydrogels and biological materials.</description>

      <title>Mechanical hysterons with tunable interactions of general sign</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07726v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hysterons are elementary units of hysteresis that underlie many complex behaviors of non-equilibrium matter. Because models of interacting hysterons can describe disordered matter, this suggests that artificial systems could respond to mechanical inputs in precise and targeted ways. Specifying the properties of hysterons and their interactions could thus be a general method for realizing arbitrary non-equilibrium behaviors. Elastic structures including slender beams, creased sheets, and shells are clear candidates for artificial hysterons, but complete control of their interactions has seemed impractical or impossible. Here we report a mechanical hysteron composed of rigid bars and linear springs, which has controllable properties and tunable interactions of general sign that can be reciprocal or non-reciprocal. We derive a mapping from the system parameters to the hysteron properties, and we show how collective behaviors of multiple hysterons can be targeted by adjusting geometric parameters on the fly. By transforming an abstract hysteron model into a physical design platform, our work demonstrates a route toward designed materials that can sense, compute, and respond to their mechanical environment.</description>

Abstract: Models based on spins or hysterons with appropriately chosen interactions can capture advanced memory effects in complex materials, such as transients in repeatedly compressed crumpled sheets or sequential computing in driven metamaterials. However, unphysical self-loops dominate the response when interactions are chosen randomly, undermining statistical approaches. Here, we uncover the origin of self-loop proliferation in randomly coupled models. We introduce the weakly asymmetric ensemble to suppress self-loops and then develop interaction ensembles to strictly eliminate these. Finally, we use these ensembles to explore the statistics of large systems. Our work highlights the subtle role of interaction symmetries and paves the way for statistical studies of the sequential response and memory effects in complex, multistable materials.</description>

      <title>Damage and recovery of flagella in soil bacteria exposed to shear within long microchannels</title>

Abstract: The swimming motility of bacteria is driven by the action of bacterial flagellar motors, whose outermost structure is a long and thin helicoidal filament. When rotated, the fluid medium exerts an anisotropic viscous drag on the flagellar filaments, ultimately leading to bacterial propulsion. The flagellar filaments are protein-based flexible structures that can break due to interactions with fluid flows. Here, we study the evolution of flagellar filaments in the soil bacterium $\textit{Bradyrhizobium diazoefficiens}$ after being exposed to shear flows created in long microchannels, for shear rates between $1$ s$^{-1}$ and $10^5$ s$^{-1}$, and for durations between tens of milliseconds and minutes. We demonstrate that the average swimming speed and fraction of swimming cells decrease after exposition to shear, but both parameters can recover, at least partially, with time. These observations support the hypothesis that shear flows cut flagellar filaments but that reversibly damaged bacterial flagellar motors can be restored thanks to filament regeneration. By fitting our observations with phenomenological expressions, we obtain the individual growth rates of the two different flagellar filaments that $\textit{B. diazoefficiens}$ possesses, showing that the lateral filaments have a recovery time of about 40 min while the subpolar one requires more than 4.5 h to regrow. Our work demonstrates that simple monitoring of bacterial motility after exposition to shear can be used to characterize the process of flagellar filament breakup and growth, a phenomenon widely present in bacteria swimming in porous soil and exposed to shear flows due to rainfall and watering systems.</description>
