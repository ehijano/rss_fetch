      <title>Automated Parking Trajectory Generation Using Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous parking is a key technology in modern autonomous driving systems, requiring high precision, strong adaptability, and efficiency in complex environments. This paper proposes a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) framework based on the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm to optimize autonomous parking tasks. SAC, an off-policy method with entropy regularization, is particularly well-suited for continuous action spaces, enabling fine-grained vehicle control. We model the parking task as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and train an agent to maximize cumulative rewards while balancing exploration and exploitation through entropy maximization. The proposed system integrates multiple sensor inputs into a high-dimensional state space and leverages SAC's dual critic networks and policy network to achieve stable learning. Simulation results show that the SAC-based approach delivers high parking success rates, reduced maneuver times, and robust handling of dynamic obstacles, outperforming traditional rule-based methods and other DRL algorithms. This study demonstrates SAC's potential in autonomous parking and lays the foundation for real-world applications.</description>

      <title>How to Coordinate UAVs and UGVs for Efficient Mission Planning? Optimizing Energy-Constrained Cooperative Routing with a DRL Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient mission planning for cooperative systems involving Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) requires addressing energy constraints, scalability, and coordination challenges between agents. UAVs excel in rapidly covering large areas but are constrained by limited battery life, while UGVs, with their extended operational range and capability to serve as mobile recharging stations, are hindered by slower speeds. This heterogeneity makes coordination between UAVs and UGVs critical for achieving optimal mission outcomes. In this work, we propose a scalable deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework to address the energy-constrained cooperative routing problem for multi-agent UAV-UGV teams, aiming to visit a set of task points in minimal time with UAVs relying on UGVs for recharging during the mission. The framework incorporates sortie-wise agent switching to efficiently manage multiple agents, by allocating task points and coordinating actions. Using an encoder-decoder transformer architecture, it optimizes routes and recharging rendezvous for the UAV-UGV team in the task scenario. Extensive computational experiments demonstrate the framework's superior performance over heuristic methods and a DRL baseline, delivering significant improvements in solution quality and runtime efficiency across diverse scenarios. Generalization studies validate its robustness, while dynamic scenario highlights its adaptability to real-time changes with a case study. This work advances UAV-UGV cooperative routing by providing a scalable, efficient, and robust solution for multi-agent mission planning.</description>

      <title>Composite Safety Potential Field for Highway Driving Risk Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the era of rapid advancements in vehicle safety technologies, driving risk assessment has become a focal point of attention. Technologies such as collision warning systems, advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), and autonomous driving require driving risks to be evaluated proactively and in real time. To be effective, driving risk assessment metrics must not only accurately identify potential collisions but also exhibit human-like reasoning to enable safe and seamless interactions between vehicles. Existing safety potential field models assess driving risks by considering both objective and subjective safety factors. However, their practical applicability in real-world risk assessment tasks is limited. These models are often challenging to calibrate due to the arbitrary nature of their structures, and calibration can be inefficient because of the scarcity of accident statistics. Additionally, they struggle to generalize across both longitudinal and lateral risks. To address these challenges, we propose a composite safety potential field framework, namely C-SPF, involving a subjective field to capture drivers' risk perception about spatial proximity and an objective field to quantify the imminent collision probability, to comprehensively evaluate driving risks. The C-SPF is calibrated using abundant two-dimensional spacing data from trajectory datasets, enabling it to effectively capture drivers' proximity risk perception and provide a more realistic explanation of driving behaviors. Analysis of a naturalistic driving dataset demonstrates that the C-SPF can capture both longitudinal and lateral risks that trigger drivers' safety maneuvers. Further case studies highlight the C-SPF's ability to explain lateral driver behaviors, such as abandoning lane changes or adjusting lateral position relative to adjacent vehicles, which are capabilities that existing models fail to achieve.</description>

      <title>Task and Joint Space Dual-Arm Compliant Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robots that interact with humans or perform delicate manipulation tasks must exhibit compliance. However, most commercial manipulators are rigid and suffer from significant friction, limiting end-effector tracking accuracy in torque-controlled modes. To address this, we present a real-time, open-source impedance controller that smoothly interpolates between joint-space and task-space compliance. This hybrid approach ensures safe interaction and precise task execution, such as sub-centimetre pin insertions. We deploy our controller on Frank, a dual-arm platform with two Kinova Gen3 arms, and compensate for modelled friction dynamics using a model-free observer. The system is real-time capable and integrates with standard ROS tools like MoveIt!. It also supports high-frequency trajectory streaming, enabling closed-loop execution of trajectories generated by learning-based methods, optimal control, or teleoperation. Our results demonstrate robust tracking and compliant behaviour even under high-friction conditions. The complete system is available open-source at https://github.com/applied-ai-lab/compliant_controllers.</description>

      <title>A Koopman Operator-based NMPC Framework for Mobile Robot Navigation under Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mobile robot navigation can be challenged by system uncertainty. For example, ground friction may vary abruptly causing slipping, and noisy sensor data can lead to inaccurate feedback control. Traditional model-based methods may be limited when considering such variations, making them fragile to varying types of uncertainty. One way to address this is by leveraging learned prediction models by means of the Koopman operator into nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC). This paper describes the formulation of, and provides the solution to, an NMPC problem using a lifted bilinear model that can accurately predict affine input systems with stochastic perturbations. System constraints are defined in the Koopman space, while the optimization problem is solved in the state space to reduce computational complexity. Training data to estimate the Koopman operator for the system are given via randomized control inputs. The output of the developed method enables closed-loop navigation control over environments populated with obstacles. The effectiveness of the proposed method has been tested through numerical simulations using a wheeled robot with additive stochastic velocity perturbations, Gazebo simulations with a realistic digital twin robot, and physical hardware experiments without knowledge of the true dynamics.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a simulation tool for evaluating team formation in autonomous multi-UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) missions that operate Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS). The tool models UAV collaboration and mission execution in dynamic and adversarial conditions, where Byzantine UAVs attempt to disrupt operations. Our tool allows researchers to integrate and compare various team formation strategies in a controlled environment with configurable mission parameters and adversarial behaviors. The log of each simulation run is stored in a structured way along with performance metrics so that statistical analysis could be done straightforwardly. The tool is versatile for testing and improving UAV coordination strategies in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>UAV-VLN: End-to-End Vision Language guided Navigation for UAVs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A core challenge in AI-guided autonomy is enabling agents to navigate realistically and effectively in previously unseen environments based on natural language commands. We propose UAV-VLN, a novel end-to-end Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) framework for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) that seamlessly integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with visual perception to facilitate human-interactive navigation. Our system interprets free-form natural language instructions, grounds them into visual observations, and plans feasible aerial trajectories in diverse environments.
  UAV-VLN leverages the common-sense reasoning capabilities of LLMs to parse high-level semantic goals, while a vision model detects and localizes semantically relevant objects in the environment. By fusing these modalities, the UAV can reason about spatial relationships, disambiguate references in human instructions, and plan context-aware behaviors with minimal task-specific supervision. To ensure robust and interpretable decision-making, the framework includes a cross-modal grounding mechanism that aligns linguistic intent with visual context.
  We evaluate UAV-VLN across diverse indoor and outdoor navigation scenarios, demonstrating its ability to generalize to novel instructions and environments with minimal task-specific training. Our results show significant improvements in instruction-following accuracy and trajectory efficiency, highlighting the potential of LLM-driven vision-language interfaces for safe, intuitive, and generalizable UAV autonomy.</description>

      <title>SimPRIVE: a Simulation framework for Physical Robot Interaction with Virtual Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of machine learning in cyber-physical systems has attracted the interest of both industry and academia. However, no general solution has yet been found against the unpredictable behavior of neural networks and reinforcement learning agents. Nevertheless, the improvements of photo-realistic simulators have paved the way towards extensive testing of complex algorithms in different virtual scenarios, which would be expensive and dangerous to implement in the real world.
  This paper presents SimPRIVE, a simulation framework for physical robot interaction with virtual environments, which operates as a vehicle-in-the-loop platform, rendering a virtual world while operating the vehicle in the real world.
  Using SimPRIVE, any physical mobile robot running on ROS 2 can easily be configured to move its digital twin in a virtual world built with the Unreal Engine 5 graphic engine, which can be populated with objects, people, or other vehicles with programmable behavior.
  SimPRIVE has been designed to accommodate custom or pre-built virtual worlds while being light-weight to contain execution times and allow fast rendering. Its main advantage lies in the possibility of testing complex algorithms on the full software and hardware stack while minimizing the risks and costs of a test campaign. The framework has been validated by testing a reinforcement learning agent trained for obstacle avoidance on an AgileX Scout Mini rover that navigates a virtual office environment where everyday objects and people are placed as obstacles. The physical rover moves with no collision in an indoor limited space, thanks to a LiDAR-based heuristic.</description>

      <title>Provably-Safe, Online System Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise manipulation tasks require accurate knowledge of payload inertial parameters. Unfortunately, identifying these parameters for unknown payloads while ensuring that the robotic system satisfies its input and state constraints while avoiding collisions with the environment remains a significant challenge. This paper presents an integrated framework that enables robotic manipulators to safely and automatically identify payload parameters while maintaining operational safety guarantees. The framework consists of two synergistic components: an online trajectory planning and control framework that generates provably-safe exciting trajectories for system identification that can be tracked while respecting robot constraints and avoiding obstacles and a robust system identification method that computes rigorous overapproximative bounds on end-effector inertial parameters assuming bounded sensor noise. Experimental validation on a robotic manipulator performing challenging tasks with various unknown payloads demonstrates the framework's effectiveness in establishing accurate parameter bounds while maintaining safety throughout the identification process. The code is available at our project webpage: https://roahmlab.github.io/OnlineSafeSysID/.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in robotic manipulation have highlighted the potential of intermediate representations for improving policy generalization. In this work, we explore grounding masks as an effective intermediate representation, balancing two key advantages: (1) effective spatial guidance that specifies target objects and placement areas while also conveying information about object shape and size, and (2) broad generalization potential driven by large-scale vision-language models pretrained on diverse grounding datasets. We introduce RoboGround, a grounding-aware robotic manipulation system that leverages grounding masks as an intermediate representation to guide policy networks in object manipulation tasks. To further explore and enhance generalization, we propose an automated pipeline for generating large-scale, simulated data with a diverse set of objects and instructions. Extensive experiments show the value of our dataset and the effectiveness of grounding masks as intermediate guidance, significantly enhancing the generalization abilities of robot policies.</description>

      <title>Multi-Goal Dexterous Hand Manipulation using Probabilistic Model-based Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper tackles the challenge of learning multi-goal dexterous hand manipulation tasks using model-based Reinforcement Learning. We propose Goal-Conditioned Probabilistic Model Predictive Control (GC-PMPC) by designing probabilistic neural network ensembles to describe the high-dimensional dexterous hand dynamics and introducing an asynchronous MPC policy to meet the control frequency requirements in real-world dexterous hand systems. Extensive evaluations on four simulated Shadow Hand manipulation scenarios with randomly generated goals demonstrate GC-PMPC's superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines. It successfully drives a cable-driven Dexterous hand, DexHand 021 with 12 Active DOFs and 5 tactile sensors, to learn manipulating a cubic die to three goal poses within approximately 80 minutes of interactions, demonstrating exceptional learning efficiency and control performance on a cost-effective dexterous hand platform.</description>

      <title>One Net to Rule Them All: Domain Randomization in Quadcopter Racing Across Different Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In high-speed quadcopter racing, finding a single controller that works well across different platforms remains challenging. This work presents the first neural network controller for drone racing that generalizes across physically distinct quadcopters. We demonstrate that a single network, trained with domain randomization, can robustly control various types of quadcopters. The network relies solely on the current state to directly compute motor commands. The effectiveness of this generalized controller is validated through real-world tests on two substantially different crafts (3-inch and 5-inch race quadcopters). We further compare the performance of this generalized controller with controllers specifically trained for the 3-inch and 5-inch drone, using their identified model parameters with varying levels of domain randomization (0%, 10%, 20%, 30%). While the generalized controller shows slightly slower speeds compared to the fine-tuned models, it excels in adaptability across different platforms. Our results show that no randomization fails sim-to-real transfer while increasing randomization improves robustness but reduces speed. Despite this trade-off, our findings highlight the potential of domain randomization for generalizing controllers, paving the way for universal AI controllers that can adapt to any platform.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Pre-trained Large Language Models with Refined Prompting for Online Task and Motion Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence, there is an increasing demand for intelligent robots capable of assisting humans in daily tasks and performing complex operations. Such robots not only require task planning capabilities but must also execute tasks with stability and robustness. In this paper, we present a closed-loop task planning and acting system, LLM-PAS, which is assisted by a pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM). While LLM-PAS plans long-horizon tasks in a manner similar to traditional task and motion planners, it also emphasizes the execution phase of the task. By transferring part of the constraint-checking process from the planning phase to the execution phase, LLM-PAS enables exploration of the constraint space and delivers more accurate feedback on environmental anomalies during execution. The reasoning capabilities of the LLM allow it to handle anomalies that cannot be addressed by the robust executor. To further enhance the system's ability to assist the planner during replanning, we propose the First Look Prompting (FLP) method, which induces LLM to generate effective PDDL goals. Through comparative prompting experiments and systematic experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of LLM-PAS in handling anomalous conditions during task execution.</description>

      <title>Real Time Semantic Segmentation of High Resolution Automotive LiDAR Scans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent studies, numerous previous works emphasize the importance of semantic segmentation of LiDAR data as a critical component to the development of driver-assistance systems and autonomous vehicles. However, many state-of-the-art methods are tested on outdated, lower-resolution LiDAR sensors and struggle with real-time constraints. This study introduces a novel semantic segmentation framework tailored for modern high-resolution LiDAR sensors that addresses both accuracy and real-time processing demands. We propose a novel LiDAR dataset collected by a cutting-edge automotive 128 layer LiDAR in urban traffic scenes. Furthermore, we propose a semantic segmentation method utilizing surface normals as strong input features. Our approach is bridging the gap between cutting-edge research and practical automotive applications. Additionaly, we provide a Robot Operating System (ROS2) implementation that we operate on our research vehicle. Our dataset and code are publicly available: https://github.com/kav-institute/SemanticLiDAR.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hand-eye calibration is a common problem in the field of collaborative robotics, involving the determination of the transformation matrix between the visual sensor and the robot flange to enable vision-based robotic tasks. However, this process typically requires multiple movements of the robot arm and an external calibration object, making it both time-consuming and inconvenient, especially in scenarios where frequent recalibration is necessary. In this work, we extend our previous method, Look at Robot Base Once (LRBO), which eliminates the need for external calibration objects such as a chessboard. We propose a generic dataset generation approach for point cloud registration, focusing on aligning the robot base point cloud with the scanned data. Furthermore, a more detailed simulation study is conducted involving several different collaborative robot arms, followed by real-world experiments in an industrial setting. Our improved method is simulated and evaluated using a total of 14 robotic arms from 9 different brands, including KUKA, Universal Robots, UFACTORY, and Franka Emika, all of which are widely used in the field of collaborative robotics. Physical experiments demonstrate that our extended approach achieves performance comparable to existing commercial hand-eye calibration solutions, while completing the entire calibration procedure in just a few seconds. In addition, we provide a user-friendly hand-eye calibration solution, with the code publicly available at github.com/leihui6/LRBO2.</description>

      <title>Path Planning on Multi-level Point Cloud with a Weighted Traversability Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article proposes a new path planning method for addressing multi-level terrain situations. The proposed method includes innovations in three aspects: 1) the pre-processing of point cloud maps with a multi-level skip-list structure and data-slimming algorithm for well-organized and simplified map formalization and management, 2) the direct acquisition of local traversability indexes through vehicle and point cloud interaction analysis, which saves work in surface fitting, and 3) the assignment of traversability indexes on a multi-level connectivity graph to generate a weighted traversability graph for generally search-based path planning. The A* algorithm is modified to utilize the traversability graph to generate a short and safe path. The effectiveness and reliability of the proposed method are verified through indoor and outdoor experiments conducted in various environments, including multi-floor buildings, woodland, and rugged mountainous regions. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can properly address 3D path planning problems for ground vehicles in a wide range of situations.</description>

      <title>Self-Supervised Monocular Visual Drone Model Identification through Improved Occlusion Handling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ego-motion estimation is vital for drones when flying in GPS-denied environments. Vision-based methods struggle when flight speed increases and close-by objects lead to difficult visual conditions with considerable motion blur and large occlusions. To tackle this, vision is typically complemented by state estimation filters that combine a drone model with inertial measurements. However, these drone models are currently learned in a supervised manner with ground-truth data from external motion capture systems, limiting scalability to different environments and drones. In this work, we propose a self-supervised learning scheme to train a neural-network-based drone model using only onboard monocular video and flight controller data (IMU and motor feedback). We achieve this by first training a self-supervised relative pose estimation model, which then serves as a teacher for the drone model. To allow this to work at high speed close to obstacles, we propose an improved occlusion handling method for training self-supervised pose estimation models. Due to this method, the root mean squared error of resulting odometry estimates is reduced by an average of 15%. Moreover, the student neural drone model can be successfully obtained from the onboard data. It even becomes more accurate at higher speeds compared to its teacher, the self-supervised vision-based model. We demonstrate the value of the neural drone model by integrating it into a traditional filter-based VIO system (ROVIO), resulting in superior odometry accuracy on aggressive 3D racing trajectories near obstacles. Self-supervised learning of ego-motion estimation represents a significant step toward bridging the gap between flying in controlled, expensive lab environments and real-world drone applications. The fusion of vision and drone models will enable higher-speed flight and improve state estimation, on any drone in any environment.</description>

      <title>LLM-Empowered Embodied Agent for Memory-Augmented Task Planning in Household Robotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an embodied robotic system with an LLM-driven agent-orchestration architecture for autonomous household object management. The system integrates memory-augmented task planning, enabling robots to execute high-level user commands while tracking past actions. It employs three specialized agents: a routing agent, a task planning agent, and a knowledge base agent, each powered by task-specific LLMs. By leveraging in-context learning, our system avoids the need for explicit model training. RAG enables the system to retrieve context from past interactions, enhancing long-term object tracking. A combination of Grounded SAM and LLaMa3.2-Vision provides robust object detection, facilitating semantic scene understanding for task planning. Evaluation across three household scenarios demonstrates high task planning accuracy and an improvement in memory recall due to RAG. Specifically, Qwen2.5 yields best performance for specialized agents, while LLaMA3.1 excels in routing tasks. The source code is available at: https://github.com/marc1198/chat-hsr.</description>

      <title>LangWBC: Language-directed Humanoid Whole-Body Control via End-to-end Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: General-purpose humanoid robots are expected to interact intuitively with humans, enabling seamless integration into daily life. Natural language provides the most accessible medium for this purpose. However, translating language into humanoid whole-body motion remains a significant challenge, primarily due to the gap between linguistic understanding and physical actions. In this work, we present an end-to-end, language-directed policy for real-world humanoid whole-body control. Our approach combines reinforcement learning with policy distillation, allowing a single neural network to interpret language commands and execute corresponding physical actions directly. To enhance motion diversity and compositionality, we incorporate a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) structure. The resulting policy achieves agile and versatile whole-body behaviors conditioned on language inputs, with smooth transitions between various motions, enabling adaptation to linguistic variations and the emergence of novel motions. We validate the efficacy and generalizability of our method through extensive simulations and real-world experiments, demonstrating robust whole-body control.

      <title>Whleaper: A 10-DOF Flexible Bipedal Wheeled Robot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wheel-legged robots combine the advantages of both wheeled robots and legged robots, offering versatile locomotion capabilities with excellent stability on challenging terrains and high efficiency on flat surfaces. However, existing wheel-legged robots typically have limited hip joint mobility compared to humans, while hip joint plays a crucial role in locomotion. In this paper, we introduce Whleaper, a novel 10-degree-of-freedom (DOF) bipedal wheeled robot, with 3 DOFs at the hip of each leg. Its humanoid joint design enables adaptable motion in complex scenarios, ensuring stability and flexibility. This paper introduces the details of Whleaper, with a focus on innovative mechanical design, control algorithms and system implementation. Firstly, stability stems from the increased DOFs at the hip, which expand the range of possible postures and improve the robot's foot-ground contact. Secondly, the extra DOFs also augment its mobility. During walking or sliding, more complex movements can be adopted to execute obstacle avoidance tasks. Thirdly, we utilize two control algorithms to implement multimodal motion for walking and sliding. By controlling specific DOFs of the robot, we conducted a series of simulations and practical experiments, demonstrating that a high-DOF hip joint design can effectively enhance the stability and flexibility of wheel-legged robots. Whleaper shows its capability to perform actions such as squatting, obstacle avoidance sliding, and rapid turning in real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>LLM-based Interactive Imitation Learning for Robotic Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in machine learning provide methods to train autonomous agents capable of handling the increasing complexity of sequential decision-making in robotics. Imitation Learning (IL) is a prominent approach, where agents learn to control robots based on human demonstrations. However, IL commonly suffers from violating the independent and identically distributed (i.i.d) assumption in robotic tasks. Interactive Imitation Learning (IIL) achieves improved performance by allowing agents to learn from interactive feedback from human teachers. Despite these improvements, both approaches come with significant costs due to the necessity of human involvement. Leveraging the emergent capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in reasoning and generating human-like responses, we introduce LLM-iTeach -- a novel IIL framework that utilizes an LLM as an interactive teacher to enhance agent performance while alleviating the dependence on human resources. Firstly, LLM-iTeach uses a hierarchical prompting strategy that guides the LLM in generating a policy in Python code. Then, with a designed similarity-based feedback mechanism, LLM-iTeach provides corrective and evaluative feedback interactively during the agent's training. We evaluate LLM-iTeach against baseline methods such as Behavior Cloning (BC), an IL method, and CEILing, a state-of-the-art IIL method using a human teacher, on various robotic manipulation tasks. Our results demonstrate that LLM-iTeach surpasses BC in the success rate and achieves or even outscores that of CEILing, highlighting the potential of LLMs as cost-effective, human-like teachers in interactive learning environments. We further demonstrate the method's potential for generalization by evaluating it on additional tasks. The code and prompts are provided at: https://github.com/Tubicor/LLM-iTeach.</description>

      <title>An Underwater, Fault-Tolerant, Laser-Aided Robotic Multi-Modal Dense SLAM System for Continuous Underwater In-Situ Observation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing underwater SLAM systems are difficult to work effectively in texture-sparse and geometrically degraded underwater environments, resulting in intermittent tracking and sparse mapping. Therefore, we present Water-DSLAM, a novel laser-aided multi-sensor fusion system that can achieve uninterrupted, fault-tolerant dense SLAM capable of continuous in-situ observation in diverse complex underwater scenarios through three key innovations: Firstly, we develop Water-Scanner, a multi-sensor fusion robotic platform featuring a self-designed Underwater Binocular Structured Light (UBSL) module that enables high-precision 3D perception. Secondly, we propose a fault-tolerant triple-subsystem architecture combining: 1) DP-INS (DVL- and Pressure-aided Inertial Navigation System): fusing inertial measurement unit, doppler velocity log, and pressure sensor based Error-State Kalman Filter (ESKF) to provide high-frequency absolute odometry 2) Water-UBSL: a novel Iterated ESKF (IESKF)-based tight coupling between UBSL and DP-INS to mitigate UBSL's degeneration issues 3) Water-Stereo: a fusion of DP-INS and stereo camera for accurate initialization and tracking. Thirdly, we introduce a multi-modal factor graph back-end that dynamically fuses heterogeneous sensor data. The proposed multi-sensor factor graph maintenance strategy efficiently addresses issues caused by asynchronous sensor frequencies and partial data loss. Experimental results demonstrate Water-DSLAM achieves superior robustness (0.039 m trajectory RMSE and 100\% continuity ratio during partial sensor dropout) and dense mapping (6922.4 points/m^3 in 750 m^3 water volume, approximately 10 times denser than existing methods) in various challenging environments, including pools, dark underwater scenes, 16-meter-deep sinkholes, and field rivers.

      <title>Neuro-Symbolic Generation of Explanations for Robot Policies with Weighted Signal Temporal Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural network-based policies have demonstrated success in many robotic applications, but often lack human-explanability, which poses challenges in safety-critical deployments. To address this, we propose a neuro-symbolic explanation framework that generates a weighted signal temporal logic (wSTL) specification to describe a robot policy in a interpretable form. Existing methods typically produce explanations that are verbose and inconsistent, which hinders explainability, and loose, which do not give meaningful insights into the underlying policy. We address these issues by introducing a simplification process consisting of predicate filtering, regularization, and iterative pruning. We also introduce three novel explainability evaluation metrics -- conciseness, consistency, and strictness -- to assess explanation quality beyond conventional classification metrics. Our method is validated in three simulated robotic environments, where it outperforms baselines in generating concise, consistent, and strict wSTL explanations without sacrificing classification accuracy. This work bridges policy learning with formal methods, contributing to safer and more transparent decision-making in robotics.</description>

      <title>ConformalNL2LTL: Translating Natural Language Instructions into Temporal Logic Formulas with Conformal Correctness Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) has become a prevalent specification language for robotic tasks. To mitigate the significant manual effort and expertise required to define LTL-encoded tasks, several methods have been proposed for translating Natural Language (NL) instructions into LTL formulas, which, however, lack correctness guarantees. To address this, we introduce a new NL-to-LTL translation method, called ConformalNL2LTL, that can achieve user-defined translation success rates over unseen NL commands. Our method constructs LTL formulas iteratively by addressing a sequence of open-vocabulary Question-Answering (QA) problems with LLMs. To enable uncertainty-aware translation, we leverage conformal prediction (CP), a distribution-free uncertainty quantification tool for black-box models. CP enables our method to assess the uncertainty in LLM-generated answers, allowing it to proceed with translation when sufficiently confident and request help otherwise. We provide both theoretical and empirical results demonstrating that ConformalNL2LTL achieves user-specified translation accuracy while minimizing help rates.</description>

      <title>GauSS-MI: Gaussian Splatting Shannon Mutual Information for Active 3D Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This research tackles the challenge of real-time active view selection and uncertainty quantification on visual quality for active 3D reconstruction. Visual quality is a critical aspect of 3D reconstruction. Recent advancements such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have notably enhanced the image rendering quality of reconstruction models. Nonetheless, the efficient and effective acquisition of input images for reconstruction-specifically, the selection of the most informative viewpoint-remains an open challenge, which is crucial for active reconstruction. Existing studies have primarily focused on evaluating geometric completeness and exploring unobserved or unknown regions, without direct evaluation of the visual uncertainty within the reconstruction model. To address this gap, this paper introduces a probabilistic model that quantifies visual uncertainty for each Gaussian. Leveraging Shannon Mutual Information, we formulate a criterion, Gaussian Splatting Shannon Mutual Information (GauSS-MI), for real-time assessment of visual mutual information from novel viewpoints, facilitating the selection of next best view. GauSS-MI is implemented within an active reconstruction system integrated with a view and motion planner. Extensive experiments across various simulated and real-world scenes showcase the superior visual quality and reconstruction efficiency performance of the proposed system.</description>

      <title>NavEX: A Multi-Agent Coverage in Non-Convex and Uneven Environments via Exemplar-Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses multi-agent deployment in non-convex and uneven environments. To overcome the limitations of traditional approaches, we introduce Navigable Exemplar-Based Dispatch Coverage (NavEX), a novel dispatch coverage framework that combines exemplar-clustering with obstacle-aware and traversability-aware shortest distances, offering a deployment framework based on submodular optimization. NavEX provides a unified approach to solve two critical coverage tasks: (a) fair-access deployment, aiming to provide equitable service by minimizing agent-target distances, and (b) hotspot deployment, prioritizing high-density target regions. A key feature of NavEX is the use of exemplar-clustering for the coverage utility measure, which provides the flexibility to employ non-Euclidean distance metrics that do not necessarily conform to the triangle inequality. This allows NavEX to incorporate visibility graphs for shortest-path computation in environments with planar obstacles, and traversability-aware RRT* for complex, rugged terrains. By leveraging submodular optimization, the NavEX framework enables efficient, near-optimal solutions with provable performance guarantees for multi-agent deployment in realistic and complex settings, as demonstrated by our simulations.</description>

      <title>PhysicsFC: Learning User-Controlled Skills for a Physics-Based Football Player Controller</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose PhysicsFC, a method for controlling physically simulated football player characters to perform a variety of football skills--such as dribbling, trapping, moving, and kicking--based on user input, while seamlessly transitioning between these skills. Our skill-specific policies, which generate latent variables for each football skill, are trained using an existing physics-based motion embedding model that serves as a foundation for reproducing football motions. Key features include a tailored reward design for the Dribble policy, a two-phase reward structure combined with projectile dynamics-based initialization for the Trap policy, and a Data-Embedded Goal-Conditioned Latent Guidance (DEGCL) method for the Move policy. Using the trained skill policies, the proposed football player finite state machine (PhysicsFC FSM) allows users to interactively control the character. To ensure smooth and agile transitions between skill policies, as defined in the FSM, we introduce the Skill Transition-Based Initialization (STI), which is applied during the training of each skill policy. We develop several interactive scenarios to showcase PhysicsFC's effectiveness, including competitive trapping and dribbling, give-and-go plays, and 11v11 football games, where multiple PhysicsFC agents produce natural and controllable physics-based football player behaviors. Quantitative evaluations further validate the performance of individual skill policies and the transitions between them, using the presented metrics and experimental designs.</description>

      <title>CMD: Constraining Multimodal Distribution for Domain Adaptation in Stereo Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, learning-based stereo matching methods have achieved great improvement in public benchmarks, where soft argmin and smooth L1 loss play a core contribution to their success. However, in unsupervised domain adaptation scenarios, we observe that these two operations often yield multimodal disparity probability distributions in target domains, resulting in degraded generalization. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, Constrain Multi-modal Distribution (CMD), to address this issue. Specifically, we introduce \textit{uncertainty-regularized minimization} and \textit{anisotropic soft argmin} to encourage the network to produce predominantly unimodal disparity distributions in the target domain, thereby improving prediction accuracy. Experimentally, we apply the proposed method to multiple representative stereo-matching networks and conduct domain adaptation from synthetic data to unlabeled real-world scenes. Results consistently demonstrate improved generalization in both top-performing and domain-adaptable stereo-matching models.

      <title>Leveraging Systems and Control Theory for Social Robotics: A Model-Based Behavioral Control Approach to Human-Robot Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21548</link>

Abstract: Social robots (SRs) should autonomously interact with humans, while exhibiting proper social behaviors associated to their role. By contributing to health-care, education, and companionship, SRs will enhance life quality. However, personalization and sustaining user engagement remain a challenge for SRs, due to their limited understanding of human mental states. Accordingly, we leverage a recently introduced mathematical dynamic model of human perception, cognition, and decision-making for SRs. Identifying the parameters of this model and deploying it in behavioral steering system of SRs allows to effectively personalize the responses of SRs to evolving mental states of their users, enhancing long-term engagement and personalization. Our approach uniquely enables autonomous adaptability of SRs by modeling the dynamics of invisible mental states, significantly contributing to the transparency and awareness of SRs. We validated our model-based control system in experiments with 10 participants who interacted with a Nao robot over three chess puzzle sessions, 45 - 90 minutes each. The identified model achieved a mean squared error (MSE) of 0.067 (i.e., 1.675% of the maximum possible MSE) in tracking beliefs, goals, and emotions of participants. Compared to a model-free controller that did not track mental states of participants, our approach increased engagement by 16% on average. Post-interaction feedback of participants (provided via dedicated questionnaires) further confirmed the perceived engagement and awareness of the model-driven robot. These results highlight the unique potential of model-based approaches and control theory in advancing human-SR interactions.</description>

      <title>Designing Control Barrier Function via Probabilistic Enumeration for Safe Reinforcement Learning Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Achieving safe autonomous navigation systems is critical for deploying robots in dynamic and uncertain real-world environments. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical control framework leveraging neural network verification techniques to design control barrier functions (CBFs) and policy correction mechanisms that ensure safe reinforcement learning navigation policies. Our approach relies on probabilistic enumeration to identify unsafe regions of operation, which are then used to construct a safe CBF-based control layer applicable to arbitrary policies. We validate our framework both in simulation and on a real robot, using a standard mobile robot benchmark and a highly dynamic aquatic environmental monitoring task. These experiments demonstrate the ability of the proposed solution to correct unsafe actions while preserving efficient navigation behavior. Our results show the promise of developing hierarchical verification-based systems to enable safe and robust navigation behaviors in complex scenarios.</description>

      <title>REHEARSE-3D: A Multi-modal Emulated Rain Dataset for 3D Point Cloud De-raining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sensor degradation poses a significant challenge in autonomous driving. During heavy rainfall, the interference from raindrops can adversely affect the quality of LiDAR point clouds, resulting in, for instance, inaccurate point measurements. This, in turn, can potentially lead to safety concerns if autonomous driving systems are not weather-aware, i.e., if they are unable to discern such changes. In this study, we release a new, large-scale, multi-modal emulated rain dataset, REHEARSE-3D, to promote research advancements in 3D point cloud de-raining. Distinct from the most relevant competitors, our dataset is unique in several respects. First, it is the largest point-wise annotated dataset, and second, it is the only one with high-resolution LiDAR data (LiDAR-256) enriched with 4D Radar point clouds logged in both daytime and nighttime conditions in a controlled weather environment. Furthermore, REHEARSE-3D involves rain-characteristic information, which is of significant value not only for sensor noise modeling but also for analyzing the impact of weather at a point level. Leveraging REHEARSE-3D, we benchmark raindrop detection and removal in fused LiDAR and 4D Radar point clouds. Our comprehensive study further evaluates the performance of various statistical and deep-learning models. Upon publication, the dataset and benchmark models will be made publicly available at: https://sporsho.github.io/REHEARSE3D.</description>

      <title>Learning 6-DoF Fine-grained Grasp Detection Based on Part Affordance Grounding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.11564v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Robotic grasping is a fundamental ability for a robot to interact with the environment. Current methods focus on how to obtain a stable and reliable grasping pose in object level, while little work has been studied on part (shape)-wise grasping which is related to fine-grained grasping and robotic affordance. Parts can be seen as atomic elements to compose an object, which contains rich semantic knowledge and a strong correlation with affordance. However, lacking a large part-wise 3D robotic dataset limits the development of part representation learning and downstream applications. In this paper, we propose a new large Language-guided SHape grAsPing datasEt (named LangSHAPE) to promote 3D part-level affordance and grasping ability learning. From the perspective of robotic cognition, we design a two-stage fine-grained robotic grasping framework (named LangPartGPD), including a novel 3D part language grounding model and a part-aware grasp pose detection model, in which explicit language input from human or large language models (LLMs) could guide a robot to generate part-level 6-DoF grasping pose with textual explanation. Our method combines the advantages of human-robot collaboration and LLMs' planning ability using explicit language as a symbolic intermediate. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method, we perform 3D part grounding and fine-grained grasp detection experiments on both simulation and physical robot settings, following language instructions across different degrees of textual complexity. Results show our method achieves competitive performance in 3D geometry fine-grained grounding, object affordance inference, and 3D part-aware grasping tasks. Our dataset and code are available on our project website https://sites.google.com/view/lang-shape</description>

      <title>Simultaneous System Identification and Model Predictive Control with No Dynamic Regret</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04143v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide an algorithm for the simultaneous system identification and model predictive control of nonlinear systems. The algorithm has finite-time near-optimality guarantees and asymptotically converges to the optimal (non-causal) controller. Particularly, the algorithm enjoys sublinear dynamic regret, defined herein as the suboptimality against an optimal clairvoyant controller that knows how the unknown disturbances and system dynamics will adapt to its actions. The algorithm is self-supervised and applies to control-affine systems with unknown dynamics and disturbances that can be expressed in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. Such spaces can model external disturbances and modeling errors that can even be adaptive to the system's state and control input. For example, they can model wind and wave disturbances to aerial and marine vehicles, or inaccurate model parameters such as inertia of mechanical systems. The algorithm first generates random Fourier features that are used to approximate the unknown dynamics or disturbances. Then, it employs model predictive control based on the current learned model of the unknown dynamics (or disturbances). The model of the unknown dynamics is updated online using least squares based on the data collected while controlling the system. We validate our algorithm in both hardware experiments and physics-based simulations. The simulations include (i) a cart-pole aiming to maintain the pole upright despite inaccurate model parameters, and (ii) a quadrotor aiming to track reference trajectories despite unmodeled aerodynamic drag effects. The hardware experiments include a quadrotor aiming to track a circular trajectory despite unmodeled aerodynamic drag effects, ground effects, and wind disturbances.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08261v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The increasing complexity of urban environments has underscored the potential of effective collective perception systems. To address these challenges, we present the CoopScenes dataset, a large-scale, multi-scene dataset that provides synchronized sensor data from both the ego-vehicle and the supporting infrastructure.The dataset provides 104 minutes of spatially and temporally synchronized data at 10 Hz, resulting in 62,000 frames. It achieves competitive synchronization with a mean deviation of only 2.3 ms. Additionally the dataset includes a novel procedure for precise registration of point cloud data from the ego-vehicle and infrastructure sensors, automated annotation pipelines, and an open-source anonymization pipeline for faces and license plates. Covering nine diverse scenes with 100 maneuvers, the dataset features scenarios such as public transport hubs, city construction sites, and high-speed rural roads across three cities in the Stuttgart region, Germany. The full dataset amounts to 527 GB of data and is provided in the .4mse format, making it easily accessible through our comprehensive development kit. By providing precise, large-scale data, CoopScenes facilitates research in collective perception, real-time sensor registration, and cooperative intelligent systems for urban mobility, including machine learning-based approaches.</description>

      <title>Conformalized Interactive Imitation Learning: Handling Expert Shift and Intermittent Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08852v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In interactive imitation learning (IL), uncertainty quantification offers a way for the learner (i.e. robot) to contend with distribution shifts encountered during deployment by actively seeking additional feedback from an expert (i.e. human) online. Prior works use mechanisms like ensemble disagreement or Monte Carlo dropout to quantify when black-box IL policies are uncertain; however, these approaches can lead to overconfident estimates when faced with deployment-time distribution shifts. Instead, we contend that we need uncertainty quantification algorithms that can leverage the expert human feedback received during deployment time to adapt the robot's uncertainty online. To tackle this, we draw upon online conformal prediction, a distribution-free method for constructing prediction intervals online given a stream of ground-truth labels. Human labels, however, are intermittent in the interactive IL setting. Thus, from the conformal prediction side, we introduce a novel uncertainty quantification algorithm called intermittent quantile tracking (IQT) that leverages a probabilistic model of intermittent labels, maintains asymptotic coverage guarantees, and empirically achieves desired coverage levels. From the interactive IL side, we develop ConformalDAgger, a new approach wherein the robot uses prediction intervals calibrated by IQT as a reliable measure of deployment-time uncertainty to actively query for more expert feedback. We compare ConformalDAgger to prior uncertainty-aware DAgger methods in scenarios where the distribution shift is (and isn't) present because of changes in the expert's policy. We find that in simulated and hardware deployments on a 7DOF robotic manipulator, ConformalDAgger detects high uncertainty when the expert shifts and increases the number of interventions compared to baselines, allowing the robot to more quickly learn the new behavior.</description>

      <title>When to Localize? A Risk-Constrained Reinforcement Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02788v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a standard navigation pipeline, a robot localizes at every time step to lower navigational errors. However, in some scenarios, a robot needs to selectively localize when it is expensive to obtain observations. For example, an underwater robot surfacing to localize too often hinders it from searching for critical items underwater, such as black boxes from crashed aircraft. On the other hand, if the robot never localizes, poor state estimates cause failure to find the items due to inadvertently leaving the search area or entering hazardous, restricted areas. Motivated by these scenarios, we investigate approaches to help a robot determine "when to localize?" We formulate this as a bi-criteria optimization problem: minimize the number of localization actions while ensuring the probability of failure (due to collision or not reaching a desired goal) remains bounded. In recent work, we showed how to formulate this active localization problem as a constrained Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), which was solved using an online POMDP solver. However, this approach is too slow and requires full knowledge of the robot transition and observation models. In this paper, we present RiskRL, a constrained Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework that overcomes these limitations. RiskRL uses particle filtering and recurrent Soft Actor-Critic network to learn a policy that minimizes the number of localizations while ensuring the probability of failure constraint is met. Our numerical experiments show that RiskRL learns a robust policy that leads to at least a 26% increase in success rates when traversing unseen test environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03928v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Event cameras show great potential for visual odometry (VO) in handling challenging situations, such as fast motion and high dynamic range. Despite this promise, the sparse and motion-dependent characteristics of event data continue to limit the performance of feature-based or direct-based data association methods in practical applications. To address these limitations, we propose Deep Event Inertial Odometry (DEIO), the first monocular learning-based event-inertial framework, which combines a learning-based method with traditional nonlinear graph-based optimization. Specifically, an event-based recurrent network is adopted to provide accurate and sparse associations of event patches over time. DEIO further integrates it with the IMU to recover up-to-scale pose and provide robust state estimation. The Hessian information derived from the learned differentiable bundle adjustment (DBA) is utilized to optimize the co-visibility factor graph, which tightly incorporates event patch correspondences and IMU pre-integration within a keyframe-based sliding window. Comprehensive validations demonstrate that DEIO achieves superior performance on \textit{10} challenging public benchmarks compared with more than 20 state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Path Planning and Optimization for Cuspidal 6R Manipulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18505v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A cuspidal robot can move from one inverse kinematics (IK) solution to another without crossing a singularity. Multiple industrial robots are cuspidal. They tend to have a beautiful mechanical design, but they pose path planning challenges. A task-space path may have a valid IK solution for each point along the path, but a continuous joint-space path may depend on the choice of the IK solution or even be infeasible. This paper presents new analysis, path planning, and optimization methods to enhance the utility of cuspidal robots. We first demonstrate an efficient method to identify cuspidal robots and show, for the first time, that the ABB GoFa and certain robots with three parallel joint axes are cuspidal. We then propose a new path planning method for cuspidal robots by finding all IK solutions for each point along a task-space path and constructing a graph to connect each vertex corresponding to an IK solution. Graph edges have a weight based on the optimization metric, such as minimizing joint velocity. The optimal feasible path is the shortest path in the graph. This method can find non-singular paths as well as smooth paths which pass through singularities. Finally, we incorporate this path planning method into a path optimization algorithm. Given a fixed workspace toolpath, we optimize the offset of the toolpath in the robot base frame while ensuring continuous joint motion. Code examples are available in a publicly accessible repository.</description>

      <title>Improving Grip Stability Using Passive Compliant Microspine Arrays for Soft Robots in Unstructured Terrain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12347v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Microspine grippers are small spines commonly found on insect legs that reinforce surface interaction by engaging with asperities to increase shear force and traction. An array of such microspines, when integrated into the limbs or undercarriage of a robot, can provide the ability to maneuver uneven terrains, traverse inclines, and even climb walls. Conformability and adaptability of soft robots makes them ideal candidates for these applications involving traversal of complex, unstructured terrains. However, there remains a real-life realization gap for soft locomotors pertaining to their transition from controlled lab environment to the field by improving grip stability through effective integration of microspines. We propose a passive, compliant microspine stacked array design to enhance the locomotion capabilities of mobile soft robots, in our case, ones that are motor tendon actuated. We offer a standardized microspine array integration method with effective soft-compliant stiffness integration, and reduced complexity resulting from a single actuator passively controlling them. The presented design utilizes a two-row, stacked microspine array configuration that offers additional gripping capabilities on extremely steep/irregular surfaces from the top row while not hindering the effectiveness of the more frequently active bottom row. We explore different configurations of the microspine array to account for changing surface topologies and enable independent, adaptable gripping of asperities per microspine. Field test experiments are conducted on various rough surfaces including concrete, brick, compact sand, and tree roots with three robots consisting of a baseline without microspines compared against two robots with different combinations of microspine arrays. Tracking results indicate that the inclusion of microspine arrays increases planar displacement on average by 15 and 8 times.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06669v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore how scalable robot data can address real-world challenges for generalized robotic manipulation. Introducing AgiBot World, a large-scale platform comprising over 1 million trajectories across 217 tasks in five deployment scenarios, we achieve an order-of-magnitude increase in data scale compared to existing datasets. Accelerated by a standardized collection pipeline with human-in-the-loop verification, AgiBot World guarantees high-quality and diverse data distribution. It is extensible from grippers to dexterous hands and visuo-tactile sensors for fine-grained skill acquisition. Building on top of data, we introduce Genie Operator-1 (GO-1), a novel generalist policy that leverages latent action representations to maximize data utilization, demonstrating predictable performance scaling with increased data volume. Policies pre-trained on our dataset achieve an average performance improvement of 30% over those trained on Open X-Embodiment, both in in-domain and out-of-distribution scenarios. GO-1 exhibits exceptional capability in real-world dexterous and long-horizon tasks, achieving over 60% success rate on complex tasks and outperforming prior RDT approach by 32%. By open-sourcing the dataset, tools, and models, we aim to democratize access to large-scale, high-quality robot data, advancing the pursuit of scalable and general-purpose intelligence.</description>

      <title>ForceGrip: Reference-Free Curriculum Learning for Realistic Grip Force Control in VR Hand Manipulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08061v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Realistic Hand manipulation is a key component of immersive virtual reality (VR), yet existing methods often rely on kinematic approach or motion-capture datasets that omit crucial physical attributes such as contact forces and finger torques. Consequently, these approaches prioritize tight, one-size-fits-all grips rather than reflecting users' intended force levels. We present ForceGrip, a deep learning agent that synthesizes realistic hand manipulation motions, faithfully reflecting the user's grip force intention. Instead of mimicking predefined motion datasets, ForceGrip uses generated training scenarios-randomizing object shapes, wrist movements, and trigger input flows-to challenge the agent with a broad spectrum of physical interactions. To effectively learn from these complex tasks, we employ a three-phase curriculum learning framework comprising Finger Positioning, Intention Adaptation, and Dynamic Stabilization. This progressive strategy ensures stable hand-object contact, adaptive force control based on user inputs, and robust handling under dynamic conditions. Additionally, a proximity reward function enhances natural finger motions and accelerates training convergence. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations reveal ForceGrip's superior force controllability and plausibility compared to state-of-the-art methods.

      <title>SPARK-Remote: A Cost-Effective System for Remote Bimanual Robot Teleoperation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05488v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Robot teleoperation enables human control over robotic systems in environments where full autonomy is challenging. Recent advancements in low-cost teleoperation devices and VR/AR technologies have expanded accessibility, particularly for bimanual robot manipulators. However, transitioning from in-person to remote teleoperation presents challenges in task performance. We introduce SPARK, a kinematically scaled, low-cost teleoperation system for operating bimanual robots. Its effectiveness is compared to existing technologies like the 3D SpaceMouse and VR/AR controllers. We further extend SPARK to SPARK-Remote, integrating sensor-based force feedback using haptic gloves and a force controller for remote teleoperation. We evaluate SPARK and SPARK-Remote variants on 5 bimanual manipulation tasks which feature operational properties - positional precision, rotational precision, large movements in the workspace, and bimanual collaboration - to test the effective teleoperation modes. Our findings offer insights into improving low-cost teleoperation interfaces for real-world applications.

      <title>Safety with Agency: Human-Centered Safety Filter with Application to AI-Assisted Motorsports</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11717v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a human-centered safety filter (HCSF) for shared autonomy that significantly enhances system safety without compromising human agency. Our HCSF is built on a neural safety value function, which we first learn scalably through black-box interactions and then use at deployment to enforce a novel state-action control barrier function (Q-CBF) safety constraint. Since this Q-CBF safety filter does not require any knowledge of the system dynamics for both synthesis and runtime safety monitoring and intervention, our method applies readily to complex, black-box shared autonomy systems. Notably, our HCSF's CBF-based interventions modify the human's actions minimally and smoothly, avoiding the abrupt, last-moment corrections delivered by many conventional safety filters. We validate our approach in a comprehensive in-person user study using Assetto Corsa-a high-fidelity car racing simulator with black-box dynamics-to assess robustness in "driving on the edge" scenarios. We compare both trajectory data and drivers' perceptions of our HCSF assistance against unassisted driving and a conventional safety filter. Experimental results show that 1) compared to having no assistance, our HCSF improves both safety and user satisfaction without compromising human agency or comfort, and 2) relative to a conventional safety filter, our proposed HCSF boosts human agency, comfort, and satisfaction while maintaining robustness.</description>

      <title>Fast Online Adaptive Neural MPC via Meta-Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16369v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data-driven model predictive control (MPC) has demonstrated significant potential for improving robot control performance in the presence of model uncertainties. However, existing approaches often require extensive offline data collection and computationally intensive training, limiting their ability to adapt online. To address these challenges, this paper presents a fast online adaptive MPC framework that leverages neural networks integrated with Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML). Our approach focuses on few-shot adaptation of residual dynamics - capturing the discrepancy between nominal and true system behavior - using minimal online data and gradient steps. By embedding these meta-learned residual models into a computationally efficient L4CasADi-based MPC pipeline, the proposed method enables rapid model correction, enhances predictive accuracy, and improves real-time control performance. We validate the framework through simulation studies on a Van der Pol oscillator, a Cart-Pole system, and a 2D quadrotor. Results show significant gains in adaptation speed and prediction accuracy over both nominal MPC and nominal MPC augmented with a freshly initialized neural network, underscoring the effectiveness of our approach for real-time adaptive robot control.</description>

      <title>Robotic Trail Maker Platform for Rehabilitation in Neurological Conditions: Clinical Use Cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19230v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Patients with neurological conditions require rehabilitation to restore their motor, visual, and cognitive abilities. To meet the shortage of therapists and reduce their workload, a robotic rehabilitation platform involving the clinical trail making test is proposed. Therapists can create custom trails for each patient and the patient can trace the trails using a robotic device. The platform can track the performance of the patient and use these data to provide dynamic assistance through the robot to the patient interface. Therefore, the proposed platform not only functions as an evaluation platform, but also trains the patient in recovery. The developed platform has been validated at a rehabilitation center, with therapists and patients operating the device. It was found that patients performed poorly while using the platform compared to healthy subjects and that the assistance provided also improved performance amongst patients. Statistical analysis demonstrated that the speed of the patients was significantly enhanced with the robotic assistance. Further, neural networks are trained to classify between patients and healthy subjects and to forecast their movements using the data collected.</description>

      <title>Motion Generation for Food Topping Challenge 2024: Serving Salmon Roe Bowl and Picking Fried Chicken</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19498v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although robots have been introduced in many industries, food production robots are yet to be widely employed because the food industry requires not only delicate movements to handle food but also complex movements that adapt to the environment. Force control is important for handling delicate objects such as food. In addition, achieving complex movements is possible by making robot motions based on human teachings. Four-channel bilateral control is proposed, which enables the simultaneous teaching of position and force information. Moreover, methods have been developed to reproduce motions obtained through human teachings and generate adaptive motions using learning. We demonstrated the effectiveness of these methods for food handling tasks in the Food Topping Challenge at the 2024 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA 2024). For the task of serving salmon roe on rice, we achieved the best performance because of the high reproducibility and quick motion of the proposed method. Further, for the task of picking fried chicken, we successfully picked the most pieces of fried chicken among all participating teams. This paper describes the implementation and performance of these methods.</description>

      <title>Beyond Winning Strategies: Admissible and Admissible Winning Strategies for Quantitative Reachability Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13369v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Classical reactive synthesis approaches aim to synthesize a reactive system that always satisfies a given specifications. These approaches often reduce to playing a two-player zero-sum game where the goal is to synthesize a winning strategy. However, in many pragmatic domains, such as robotics, a winning strategy does not always exist, yet it is desirable for the system to make an effort to satisfy its requirements instead of "giving up". To this end, this paper investigates the notion of admissible strategies, which formalize "doing-your-best", in quantitative reachability games. We show that, unlike the qualitative case, quantitative admissible strategies are history-dependent even for finite payoff functions, making synthesis a challenging task. In addition, we prove that admissible strategies always exist but may produce undesirable optimistic behaviors. To mitigate this, we propose admissible winning strategies, which enforce the best possible outcome while being admissible. We show that both strategies always exist but are not memoryless. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of both strategies and propose synthesis algorithms. Finally, we illustrate the strategies on gridworld and robot manipulator domains.</description>

      <title>HOT3D: Hand and Object Tracking in 3D from Egocentric Multi-View Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19167v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce HOT3D, a publicly available dataset for egocentric hand and object tracking in 3D. The dataset offers over 833 minutes (3.7M+ images) of recordings that feature 19 subjects interacting with 33 diverse rigid objects. In addition to simple pick-up, observe, and put-down actions, the subjects perform actions typical for a kitchen, office, and living room environment. The recordings include multiple synchronized data streams containing egocentric multi-view RGB/monochrome images, eye gaze signal, scene point clouds, and 3D poses of cameras, hands, and objects. The dataset is recorded with two headsets from Meta: Project Aria, which is a research prototype of AI glasses, and Quest 3, a virtual-reality headset that has shipped millions of units. Ground-truth poses were obtained by a motion-capture system using small optical markers attached to hands and objects. Hand annotations are provided in the UmeTrack and MANO formats, and objects are represented by 3D meshes with PBR materials obtained by an in-house scanner. In our experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of multi-view egocentric data for three popular tasks: 3D hand tracking, model-based 6DoF object pose estimation, and 3D lifting of unknown in-hand objects. The evaluated multi-view methods, whose benchmarking is uniquely enabled by HOT3D, significantly outperform their single-view counterparts.</description>

      <title>Estimation-Aware Trajectory Optimization with Set-Valued Measurement Uncertainties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09192v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, an optimization-based framework for generating estimation-aware trajectories is presented. In this setup, measurement (output) uncertainties are state-dependent and set-valued. Enveloping ellipsoids are employed to characterize state-dependent uncertainties with unknown distributions. The concept of regularity for set-valued output maps is then introduced, facilitating the formulation of the estimation-aware trajectory generation problem. Specifically, it is demonstrated that for output-regular maps, one can utilize a set-valued observability measure that is concave with respect to the finite horizon state trajectories. By maximizing this measure, estimation-aware trajectories can then be synthesized for a broad class of systems. Trajectory planning routines are also examined in this work, by which the observability measure is optimized for systems with locally linearized dynamics. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, representative examples in the context of trajectory planning with vision-based estimation are presented. Moreover, the paper presents estimation-aware planning for an uncooperative Target-Rendezvous problem, where an Ego-satellite employs an onboard machine learning (ML)-based estimation module to realize the rendezvous trajectory.</description>

      <title>OPAL: Visibility-aware LiDAR-to-OpenStreetMap Place Recognition via Adaptive Radial Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19258v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: LiDAR place recognition is a critical capability for autonomous navigation and cross-modal localization in large-scale outdoor environments. Existing approaches predominantly depend on pre-built 3D dense maps or aerial imagery, which impose significant storage overhead and lack real-time adaptability. In this paper, we propose OPAL, a novel network for LiDAR place recognition that leverages OpenStreetMap (OSM) as a lightweight and up-to-date prior. Our key innovation lies in bridging the domain disparity between sparse LiDAR scans and structured OSM data through two carefully designed components. First, a cross-modal visibility mask that identifies maximal observable regions from both modalities to guide feature learning. Second, an adaptive radial fusion module that dynamically consolidates radial features into discriminative global descriptors. Extensive experiments on the KITTI and KITTI-360 datasets demonstrate OPAL's superiority, achieving 15.98% higher recall at @1m threshold for top-1 retrieved matches, along with 12x faster inference speed compared to the state-of-the-art approach. Code and datasets will be publicly available.</description>
