      <title>Topological Dynamics via Learned Hybrid Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The analysis of global dynamics, particularly the identification and characterization of attractors and their regions of attraction, is essential for complex nonlinear and hybrid systems. Combinatorial methods based on Conley's index theory have provided a rigorous framework for this analysis. However, the computation relies on rigorous outer approximations of the dynamics over a discretized state space, which is challenging to obtain from scattered trajectory data. We propose a methodology that integrates recent advances in switching system identification via convex optimization to bridge this gap between data and topological analysis. We leverage the identified switching system to construct combinatorial outer approximations. This paper outlines the integration of these methods and evaluates the efficacy of computing Morse graphs versus data-driven and statistical approaches.</description>

      <title>Output-only road roughness identification from vehicle axle accelerations through a universal smoothing method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an output-only method to identify road roughness profiles from axle accelerations of a moving vehicle. A two degree of freedom half-car model is discretised with a zero-order hold and a backward-difference approximation of the roughness rate, which introduces both the current and previous roughness inputs into the observation equation. This modification enables joint input state estimation with limited measurements using a Universal Smoothing (US) method, which belongs to the family of Minimum-Variance Unbiased (MVU) estimators. To improve numerical robustness under high process noise, stemming from modelling errors such as neglected bridge vehicle interaction, the system inversion is regularised by truncated singular value decomposition. The method is validated on a full-scale bridge with a commercial SUV at two different speeds. Compared to the Dual Kalman filter and an MVU-based smoother, the proposed US achieves stable, accurate reconstructions across different scenarios and remains numerically well conditioned when noise increases. Practical aspects of tuning, window length selection, and computational cost are also discussed.</description>

      <title>When is a System Discoverable from Data? Discovery Requires Chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The deep learning revolution has spurred a rise in advances of using AI in sciences. Within physical sciences the main focus has been on discovery of dynamical systems from observational data. Yet the reliability of learned surrogates and symbolic models is often undermined by the fundamental problem of non-uniqueness. The resulting models may fit the available data perfectly, but lack genuine predictive power. This raises the question: under what conditions can the systems governing equations be uniquely identified from a finite set of observations? We show, counter-intuitively, that chaos, typically associated with unpredictability, is crucial for ensuring a system is discoverable in the space of continuous or analytic functions. The prevalence of chaotic systems in benchmark datasets may have inadvertently obscured this fundamental limitation.
  More concretely, we show that systems chaotic on their entire domain are discoverable from a single trajectory within the space of continuous functions, and systems chaotic on a strange attractor are analytically discoverable under a geometric condition on the attractor. As a consequence, we demonstrate for the first time that the classical Lorenz system is analytically discoverable. Moreover, we establish that analytic discoverability is impossible in the presence of first integrals, common in real-world systems. These findings help explain the success of data-driven methods in inherently chaotic domains like weather forecasting, while revealing a significant challenge for engineering applications like digital twins, where stable, predictable behavior is desired. For these non-chaotic systems, we find that while trajectory data alone is insufficient, certain prior physical knowledge can help ensure discoverability. These findings warrant a critical re-evaluation of the fundamental assumptions underpinning purely data-driven discovery.</description>

      <title>Genuine and spurious bistability in a simple epidemic model with waning immunity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study an infection-age structured epidemic model in which both the infectivity and the rate of loss of immunity depend on the time-since-infection. The model can be equivalently viewed as a nonlinear renewal equation for the incidence of infection or as a partial differential equation for the density of infected individuals. We explicitly consider gamma, rather than Erlang, distributed durations of infection using a combination of ODE approximations and numerical bifurcation methods. We show that the shape of this distribution strongly influences stability of the endemic equilibrium, even when the basic reproduction number $R_0$ and the mean duration of infectiousness are fixed. Moreover, we establish the existence of regions of bistability, where a stable endemic equilibrium coexists with a stable periodic orbit. To our knowledge, this provides the first example of bistability in infection-age structured models with waning immunity alone. Finally, we show how common compartmental modelling approaches, which impose implicit assumptions on the distribution of the duration of infection, can lead to spurious dynamical outcomes. Taken together, our analysis underscores the crucial role of distributional structure in epidemic modelling and provides new insights into the rich dynamics of infection-age structured SIS/SIRS models.</description>

      <title>Universal Averaging for Ergodic Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We say that a sequence $\nu_j$ of normalized Borel measures on $R$ is universal if, for any $f\in L_1(X,m)$ and any ergodic flow on the probability space, the following convergence holds: $$\left\|\int_R f(T_{r}x) d\nu_j(r) -\int f \, dm\right\|\to 0, \ \ j\to \infty.$$ If, for some $n$, the convolution powers $\nu_j^{\ast n}$ form a universal sequence for ergodic flows, then $\nu_j$ is also universal. This generalizes one of Kozlov-Treschev's results from \cite{KT}.</description>

      <title>Assouad and quasi-Assouad dimensions of Moran sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Moran sets are a non-autonomous generalization of self-similar sets. In this paper, we study the quasi-Assouad and Assouad dimensions of Moran sets in $\mathbb{R}^{d}$. First we provide quasi-Assouad dimension formulae for Moran sets satisfying $c_*&gt;0$. Then, we provide the upper and lower bounds for quasi-Assouad dimension formulae for Moran sets without assuming $c_*&gt;0$. To obtain the exact dimension formulae in this case, we define quasi-normal and normal Moran sets, and provide quasi-Assouad dimension formulae for these sets.</description>

      <title>When the weak separation condition implies the generalize finite type in $\mathbb{r}^d$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{S}$ be an iterated function system in $\mathbb{R}^d$, with full support and some restrictions on the allowable rotations. We show that $\mathcal{S}$ satisfies the weak separation condition if and only if it satisfies the generalized finite-type condition. With this in mind, we extend the notion of net intervals from $\mathbb{R}$ to $\mathbb{R}^d$. We also use net intervals to calculate the local dimension of a self-similar measure with the finite-type condition and full support.</description>

      <title>Towards Learning and Verifying Maximal Lyapunov-Barrier Functions with a Zubov PDE Formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Verifying stability and safety guarantees for nonlinear systems has received considerable attention in recent years. This property serves as a fundamental building block for specifying more complex system behaviors and control objectives. However, estimating the domain of attraction under safety constraints and constructing a Lyapunov-barrier function remain challenging tasks for nonlinear systems. To address this problem, we propose a Zubov PDE formulation with a Dirichlet boundary condition for autonomous nonlinear systems and show that a physics-informed neural network solution, once formally verified, can serve as a Lyapunov-barrier function that jointly certifies stability and safety. This approach extends existing converse Lyapunov-barrier theorems by introducing a PDE-based framework with boundary conditions defined on the safe set, yielding a near-optimal certified under-approximation of the true safe domain of attraction.</description>

      <title>Mixing and equipartition for automorphism invariant processes on regular trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper is devoted to equipartition of measured information for finite state processes over regular trees whose laws are invariant under all parity preserving tree automorphisms. We show almost everywhere equipartition for ergodic processes along spheres and balls in every horosphere. Moreover, under a quantitive mixing condition we obtain a Shannon-McMillan-Breiman theorem along metric spheres of even radius.</description>

      <title>Discovering and exploiting active sensing motifs for estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: From organisms to machines, autonomous systems rely on measured sensory cues to estimate unknown information about themselves or their environment. For nonlinear systems, carefully selected sensor motion can be exploited to extract information that is otherwise unavailable, i.e. active sensing. Empirical, yet mathematically rigorous, tools are needed to (1) quantify how sensor movement can contribute to estimation performance, and (2) leverage this knowledge to improve state estimates. Here, we introduce "BOUNDS: Bounding Observability for Uncertain Nonlinear Dynamic Systems", and Python package pybounds, which can discover patterns of sensor motion that increase information for individual state variables. Crucially, it is suitable for partially observable nonlinear systems, accounts for sensor noise, and can be applied to either simulated or observed trajectories. We demonstrate BOUNDS through a case study on a flying agent with limited sensors, showing how active sensing can be leveraged to estimate key variables such as ground speed, altitude, and ambient wind direction. Finally, we present a framework to refine sporadic estimates from bouts of active sensing that combines data-driven state and observability estimation from artificial neural networks with model-based estimation, which we call the Augmented Information Kalman Filter (AI-KF). We validate our framework using altitude estimation given GPS-denied data from an outdoor quadcopter flight. Collectively, our work will help decode active sensing strategies and inform the design of estimation algorithms in sensorimotor systems.</description>

      <title>Data-driven spatiotemporal modeling reveals personalized trajectories of cortical atrophy in Alzheimer's disease</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the progressive spread of pathology across brain networks, yet forecasting this cascade at the individual level remains challenging. We present a personalized graph-based dynamical model that captures the spatiotemporal evolution of cortical atrophy from longitudinal MRI and PET data. The approach constructs individualized brain graphs and learns the dynamics driving regional neurodegeneration. Applied to 1,891 participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, the model accurately predicts key AD biomarkers -- including amyloid-beta, tau, neurodegeneration, and cognition -- outperforming clinical and neuroimaging benchmarks. Patient-specific parameters reveal distinct progression subtypes and anticipate future cognitive decline more effectively than standard biomarkers. Sensitivity analysis highlights regional drivers of disease spread, reproducing known temporolimbic and frontal vulnerability patterns. This network-based digital twin framework offers a quantitative, personalized paradigm for AD trajectory prediction, with implications for patient stratification, clinical trial design, and targeted therapeutic development.</description>

      <title>Properness and finiteness of totally geodesic submanifolds in the convex core</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that in any geometrically finite rank-one manifold of infinite volume, every maximal totally geodesic submanifold of dimension at least two contained in the convex core is properly immersed and has finite volume. Moreover, there are only finitely many such submanifolds. This finiteness result, combined with the work of Bader-Fisher-Miller-Stover and of Gromov-Schoen, implies that any geometrically finite rank-one manifold with infinitely many maximal totally geodesic submanifolds of dimension at least two and of finite volume must be arithmetic.
  These results follow from rigidity theorems for totally geodesic submanifolds contained in the convex core of a geometrically finite manifold, whose proofs rely on deep results in unipotent dynamics and measure classification in the infinite-volume setting, due to Ratner, Dani-Margulis, and Mozes-Shah.</description>

      <title>Distribution of integers with digit restrictions via Markov chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07418v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new technique to study the distribution in residue classes of sets of integers with digit and sum-of-digits restrictions. From our main theorem, we derive a necessary and sufficient condition for integers with missing digits to be uniformly distributed in arithmetic progressions, extending previous results going back to the work of Erd\H{o}s, Mauduit and S\'ark\"ozy. Our approach utilizes Markov chains and does not rely on Fourier analysis as many results of this nature do. Our results apply more generally to the class of multiplicatively invariant sets of integers. This class, defined by Glasscock, Moreira and Richter using symbolic dynamics, is an integer analogue to fractal sets and includes all missing digits sets. We address uniform distribution in this setting, partially answering an open question posed by the same authors.</description>

      <title>Homogeneous Convex Foliations of degree 6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16632v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study homogeneous convex foliations on the complex projective plane $\mathbb{P}^2$. A foliation is called convex if all of its leaves, except straight lines, have no inflection points, and such foliations form a Zariski closed subset in the space of degree $d$ foliations on $\mathbb{P}^2$. Using projective duality, every foliation can be associated with a $d$-web on the dual plane via its Legendre transform, and it is known that the Legendre transform of a homogeneous convex foliation is flat. Our first main result provides a classification of homogeneous convex foliations admitting exactly three radial singularities on the line at infinity. As a second result, we complete the classification of convex homogeneous foliations of degree $6$, extending previous classifications in degrees $4$ and $5$.</description>

In the tame case ($p \nmid d$) we give a concise local criterion for strict good reduction on the natural residual 'etale locus: there exists a nonempty open $U_k\subset\mathbb{P}^1_k\setminus \mathrm{PC}(\tilde\varphi)$ such that for every $x\in\mathbb{P}^1(\mathcal{O}_K)$ with $\bar x\in U_k$ the reduced level-$1$ fiber has degree $d$ and is 'etale; equivalently, the fiber polynomial has unit leading coefficient and unit discriminant. In particular, all backward preimage extensions $K(X_n(x))/K$ are unramified for all $n\ge1$. This work provides an orbital refinement of the pointwise criterion of Benedetto, framing it in terms of a canonical, orbit-invariant Galois object. We provide complete proofs and explicit examples over $\mathbb{Q}_p$.</description>
