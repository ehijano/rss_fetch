      <title>Towards Multi-dimensional Elasticity for Pervasive Stream Processing Services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a hierarchical solution to scale streaming services across quality and resource dimensions. Modern scenarios, like smart cities, heavily rely on the continuous processing of IoT data to provide real-time services and meet application targets (Service Level Objectives -- SLOs). While the tendency is to process data at nearby Edge devices, this creates a bottleneck because resources can only be provisioned up to a limited capacity. To improve elasticity in Edge environments, we propose to scale services in multiple dimensions -- either resources or, alternatively, the service quality. We rely on a two-layer architecture where (1) local, service-specific agents ensure SLO fulfillment through multi-dimensional elasticity strategies; if no more resources can be allocated, (2) a higher-level agent optimizes global SLO fulfillment by swapping resources. The experimental results show promising outcomes, outperforming regular vertical autoscalers, when operating under tight resource constraints.</description>

      <title>Cloud Computing Energy Consumption Prediction Based on Kernel Extreme Learning Machine Algorithm Improved by Vector Weighted Average Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapid expansion of cloud computing infrastructure, energy consumption has become a critical challenge, driving the need for accurate and efficient prediction models. This study proposes a novel Vector Weighted Average Kernel Extreme Learning Machine (VWAA-KELM) model to enhance energy consumption prediction in cloud computing environments. By integrating a vector weighted average algorithm (VWAA) with kernel extreme learning machine (KELM), the proposed model dynamically adjusts feature weights and optimizes kernel functions, significantly improving prediction accuracy and generalization. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of VWAA-KELM: 94.7% of test set prediction errors fall within [0, 50] units, with only three cases exceeding 100 units, indicating strong stability. The model achieves a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.987 in the training set (RMSE = 28.108, RPD = 8.872) and maintains excellent generalization with R2 = 0.973 in the test set (RMSE = 43.227, RPD = 6.202). Visual analysis confirms that predicted values closely align with actual energy consumption trends, avoiding overfitting while capturing nonlinear dependencies. A key innovation of this study is the introduction of adaptive feature weighting, allowing the model to dynamically assign importance to different input parameters, thereby enhancing high-dimensional data processing. This advancement provides a scalable and efficient approach for optimizing cloud data center energy consumption. Beyond cloud computing, the proposed hybrid framework has broader applications in Internet of Things (IoT) and edge computing, supporting real-time energy management and intelligent resource allocation.</description>

      <title>Ecomap: Sustainability-Driven Optimization of Multi-Tenant DNN Execution on Edge Servers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Edge computing systems struggle to efficiently manage multiple concurrent deep neural network (DNN) workloads while meeting strict latency requirements, minimizing power consumption, and maintaining environmental sustainability. This paper introduces Ecomap, a sustainability-driven framework that dynamically adjusts the maximum power threshold of edge devices based on real-time carbon intensity. Ecomap incorporates the innovative use of mixed-quality models, allowing it to dynamically replace computationally heavy DNNs with lighter alternatives when latency constraints are violated, ensuring service responsiveness with minimal accuracy loss. Additionally, it employs a transformer-based estimator to guide efficient workload mappings. Experimental results using NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier demonstrate that Ecomap reduces carbon emissions by an average of 30% and achieves a 25% lower carbon delay product (CDP) compared to state-of-the-art methods, while maintaining comparable or better latency and power efficiency.</description>

      <title>TakuNet: an Energy-Efficient CNN for Real-Time Inference on Embedded UAV systems in Emergency Response Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05880v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Designing efficient neural networks for embedded devices is a critical challenge, particularly in applications requiring real-time performance, such as aerial imaging with drones and UAVs for emergency responses. In this work, we introduce TakuNet, a novel light-weight architecture which employs techniques such as depth-wise convolutions and an early downsampling stem to reduce computational complexity while maintaining high accuracy. It leverages dense connections for fast convergence during training and uses 16-bit floating-point precision for optimization on embedded hardware accelerators. Experimental evaluation on two public datasets shows that TakuNet achieves near-state-of-the-art accuracy in classifying aerial images of emergency situations, despite its minimal parameter count. Real-world tests on embedded devices, namely Jetson Orin Nano and Raspberry Pi, confirm TakuNet's efficiency, achieving more than 650 fps on the 15W Jetson board, making it suitable for real-time AI processing on resource-constrained platforms and advancing the applicability of drones in emergency scenarios. The code and implementation details are publicly released.</description>
