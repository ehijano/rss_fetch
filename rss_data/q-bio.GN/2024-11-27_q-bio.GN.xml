      <title>From Exponential to Polynomial Complexity: Efficient Permutation Counting with Subword Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Counting distinct permutations with replacement, especially when involving multiple subwords, is a longstanding challenge in combinatorial analysis, with critical applications in cryptography, bioinformatics, and statistical modeling. This paper introduces a novel framework that presents closed-form formulas for calculating distinct permutations with replacement, fundamentally reducing the time complexity from exponential to linear relative to the sequence length for single-subword calculations. We then extend our foundational formula to handle multiple subwords through the development of an additional formula. Unlike traditional methods relying on brute-force enumeration or recursive algorithms, our approach leverages novel combinatorial constructs and advanced mathematical techniques to achieve unprecedented efficiency. This comprehensive advancement in reducing computational complexity not only simplifies permutation counting but also establishes a new benchmark for scalability and versatility. We also demonstrate the practical utility of our formulas through diverse applications, including the simultaneous identification of multiple genetic motifs in DNA sequences and complex pattern analysis in cryptographic systems, using a computer program that runs the proposed formulae.</description>

      <title>ST-Align: A Multimodal Foundation Model for Image-Gene Alignment in Spatial Transcriptomics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) provides high-resolution pathological images and whole-transcriptomic expression profiles at individual spots across whole-slide scales. This setting makes it an ideal data source to develop multimodal foundation models. Although recent studies attempted to fine-tune visual encoders with trainable gene encoders based on spot-level, the absence of a wider slide perspective and spatial intrinsic relationships limits their ability to capture ST-specific insights effectively. Here, we introduce ST-Align, the first foundation model designed for ST that deeply aligns image-gene pairs by incorporating spatial context, effectively bridging pathological imaging with genomic features. We design a novel pretraining framework with a three-target alignment strategy for ST-Align, enabling (1) multi-scale alignment across image-gene pairs, capturing both spot- and niche-level contexts for a comprehensive perspective, and (2) cross-level alignment of multimodal insights, connecting localized cellular characteristics and broader tissue architecture. Additionally, ST-Align employs specialized encoders tailored to distinct ST contexts, followed by an Attention-Based Fusion Network (ABFN) for enhanced multimodal fusion, effectively merging domain-shared knowledge with ST-specific insights from both pathological and genomic data. We pre-trained ST-Align on 1.3 million spot-niche pairs and evaluated its performance through two downstream tasks across six datasets, demonstrating superior zero-shot and few-shot capabilities. ST-Align highlights the potential for reducing the cost of ST and providing valuable insights into the distinction of critical compositions within human tissue.</description>

      <title>Single-cell Curriculum Learning-based Deep Graph Embedding Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10511</link>

Abstract: The swift advancement of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies enables the investigation of cellular-level tissue heterogeneity. Cell annotation significantly contributes to the extensive downstream analysis of scRNA-seq data. However, The analysis of scRNA-seq for biological inference presents challenges owing to its intricate and indeterminate data distribution, characterized by a substantial volume and a high frequency of dropout events. Furthermore, the quality of training samples varies greatly, and the performance of the popular scRNA-seq data clustering solution GNN could be harmed by two types of low-quality training nodes: 1) nodes on the boundary; 2) nodes that contribute little additional information to the graph. To address these problems, we propose a single-cell curriculum learning-based deep graph embedding clustering (scCLG). We first propose a Chebyshev graph convolutional autoencoder with multi-criteria (ChebAE) that combines three optimization objectives, including topology reconstruction loss of cell graphs, zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) loss, and clustering loss, to learn cell-cell topology representation. Meanwhile, we employ a selective training strategy to train GNN based on the features and entropy of nodes and prune the difficult nodes based on the difficulty scores to keep the high-quality graph. Empirical results on a variety of gene expression datasets show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods. The code of scCLG will be made publicly available at https://github.com/LFD-byte/scCLG.</description>

      <title>Expected Density of Random Minimizers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16968v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Minimizer schemes, or just minimizers, are a very important computational primitive in sampling and sketching biological strings. Assuming a fixed alphabet of size $\sigma$, a minimizer is defined by two integers $k,w\ge2$ and a total order $\rho$ on strings of length $k$ (also called $k$-mers). A string is processed by a sliding window algorithm that chooses, in each window of length $w+k-1$, its minimal $k$-mer with respect to $\rho$. A key characteristic of the minimizer is the expected density of chosen $k$-mers among all $k$-mers in a random infinite $\sigma$-ary string. Random minimizers, in which the order $\rho$ is chosen uniformly at random, are often used in applications. However, little is known about their expected density $\mathcal{DR}_\sigma(k,w)$ besides the fact that it is close to $\frac{2}{w+1}$ unless $w\gg k$.
  We first show that $\mathcal{DR}_\sigma(k,w)$ can be computed in $O(k\sigma^{k+w})$ time. Then we attend to the case $w\le k$ and present a formula that allows one to compute $\mathcal{DR}_\sigma(k,w)$ in just $O(w \log w)$ time. Further, we describe the behaviour of $\mathcal{DR}_\sigma(k,w)$ in this case, establishing the connection between $\mathcal{DR}_\sigma(k,w)$, $\mathcal{DR}_\sigma(k+1,w)$, and $\mathcal{DR}_\sigma(k,w+1)$. In particular, we show that $\mathcal{DR}_\sigma(k,w)&lt;\frac{2}{w+1}$ (by a tiny margin) unless $w$ is small. We conclude with some partial results and conjectures for the case $w&gt;k$.</description>
