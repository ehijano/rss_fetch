      <title>Nano Bio-Agents (NBA): Small Language Model Agents for Genomics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the application of Small Language Models (&lt;10 billion parameters) for genomics question answering via agentic framework to address hallucination issues and computational cost challenges. The Nano Bio-Agent (NBA) framework we implemented incorporates task decomposition, tool orchestration, and API access into well-established systems such as NCBI and AlphaGenome. Results show that SLMs combined with such agentic framework can achieve comparable and in many cases superior performance versus existing approaches utilising larger models, with our best model-agent combination achieving 98% accuracy on the GeneTuring benchmark. Notably, small 3-10B parameter models consistently achieve 85-97% accuracy while requiring much lower computational resources than conventional approaches. This demonstrates promising potential for efficiency gains, cost savings, and democratization of ML-powered genomics tools while retaining highly robust and accurate performance.</description>

      <title>PathGene: Benchmarking Driver Gene Mutations and Exon Prediction Using Multicenter Lung Cancer Histopathology Image Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00096v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurately predicting gene mutations, mutation subtypes and their exons in lung cancer is critical for personalized treatment planning and prognostic assessment. Faced with regional disparities in medical resources and the high cost of genomic assays, using artificial intelligence to infer these mutations and exon variants from routine histopathology images could greatly facilitate precision therapy. Although some prior studies have shown that deep learning can accelerate the prediction of key gene mutations from lung cancer pathology slides, their performance remains suboptimal and has so far been limited mainly to early screening tasks. To address these limitations, we have assembled PathGene, which comprises histopathology images paired with next-generation sequencing reports from 1,576 patients at the Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, and 448 TCGA-LUAD patients. This multi-center dataset links whole-slide images to driver gene mutation status, mutation subtypes, exon, and tumor mutational burden (TMB) status, with the goal of leveraging pathology images to predict mutations, subtypes, exon locations, and TMB for early genetic screening and to advance precision oncology. Unlike existing datasets, we provide molecular-level information related to histopathology images in PathGene to facilitate the development of biomarker prediction models. We benchmarked 11 multiple-instance learning methods on PathGene for mutation, subtype, exon, and TMB prediction tasks. These experimental methods provide valuable alternatives for early genetic screening of lung cancer patients and assisting clinicians to quickly develop personalized precision targeted treatment plans for patients.
