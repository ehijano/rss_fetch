      <title>Resilient Estimator-based Control Barrier Functions for Dynamical Systems with Disturbances and Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Control Barrier Function (CBF) is an emerging method that guarantees safety in path planning problems by generating a control command to ensure the forward invariance of a safety set. Most of the developments up to date assume availability of correct state measurements and absence of disturbances on the system. However, if the system incurs disturbances and is subject to noise, the CBF cannot guarantee safety due to the distorted state estimate. To improve the resilience and adaptability of the CBF, we propose a resilient estimator-based control barrier function (RE-CBF), which is based on a novel stochastic CBF optimization and resilient estimator, to guarantee the safety of systems with disturbances and noise in the path planning problems. The proposed algorithm uses the resilient estimation algorithm to estimate disturbances and counteract their effect using novel stochastic CBF optimization, providing safe control inputs for dynamical systems with disturbances and noise. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm in handling both noise and disturbances in dynamics and measurement, we design a quadrotor testing pipeline to simulate the proposed algorithm and then implement the algorithm on a real drone in our flying arena. Both simulations and real-world experiments show that the proposed method can guarantee safety for systems with disturbances and noise.</description>

      <title>Personalised Outfit Recommendation via History-aware Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the history-aware transformer (HAT), a transformer-based model that uses shoppers' purchase history to personalise outfit predictions. The aim of this work is to recommend outfits that are internally coherent while matching an individual shopper's style and taste. To achieve this, we stack two transformer models, one that produces outfit representations and another one that processes the history of purchased outfits for a given shopper. We use these models to score an outfit's compatibility in the context of a shopper's preferences as inferred from their previous purchases. During training, the model learns to discriminate between purchased and random outfits using 3 losses: the focal loss for outfit compatibility typically used in the literature, a contrastive loss to bring closer learned outfit embeddings from a shopper's history, and an adaptive margin loss to facilitate learning from weak negatives. Together, these losses enable the model to make personalised recommendations based on a shopper's purchase history.
  Our experiments on the IQON3000 and Polyvore datasets show that HAT outperforms strong baselines on the outfit Compatibility Prediction (CP) and the Fill In The Blank (FITB) tasks. The model improves AUC for the CP hard task by 15.7% (IQON3000) and 19.4% (Polyvore) compared to previous SOTA results. It further improves accuracy on the FITB hard task by 6.5% and 9.7%, respectively. We provide ablation studies on the personalisation, constrastive loss, and adaptive margin loss that highlight the importance of these modelling choices.</description>

      <title>A Review of Safe Reinforcement Learning Methods for Modern Power Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the availability of more comprehensive measurement data in modern power systems, there has been significant interest in developing and applying reinforcement learning (RL) methods for operation and control. Conventional RL training is based on trial-and-error and reward feedback interaction with either a model-based simulated environment or a data-driven and model-free simulation environment. These methods often lead to the exploration of actions in unsafe regions of operation and, after training, the execution of unsafe actions when the RL policies are deployed in real power systems. A large body of literature has proposed safe RL strategies to prevent unsafe training policies. In power systems, safe RL represents a class of RL algorithms that can ensure or promote the safety of power system operations by executing safe actions while optimizing the objective function. While different papers handle the safety constraints differently, the overarching goal of safe RL methods is to determine how to train policies to satisfy safety constraints while maximizing rewards. This paper provides a comprehensive review of safe RL techniques and their applications in different power system operations and control, including optimal power generation dispatch, voltage control, stability control, electric vehicle (EV) charging control, buildings' energy management, electricity market, system restoration, and unit commitment and reserve scheduling. Additionally, the paper discusses benchmarks, challenges, and future directions for safe RL research in power systems.</description>

      <title>Sparse Actuator Scheduling for Discrete-Time Linear Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the control of discrete-time linear dynamical systems using sparse inputs where we limit the number of active actuators at every time step. We develop an algorithm for determining a sparse actuator schedule that ensures the existence of a sparse control input sequence, following the schedule, that takes the system from any given initial state to any desired final state. Since such an actuator schedule is not unique, we look for a schedule that minimizes the energy of sparse inputs. For this, we optimize the trace of the inverse of the resulting controllability Gramian, which is an approximate measure of the average energy of the inputs. We present a greedy algorithm along with its theoretical guarantees. Finally, we empirically show that our greedy algorithm ensures the controllability of the linear system with a small number of active actuators per time step without a significant average energy expenditure compared to the fully actuated system.</description>

      <title>Safe and Stable Filter Design Using a Relaxed Compatibitlity Control Barrier -- Lyapunov Condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a quadratic programming-based filter for safe and stable controller design, via a Control Barrier Function (CBF) and a Control Lyapunov Function (CLF). Our method guarantees safety and local asymptotic stability without the need for an asymptotically stabilizing control law. Feasibility of the proposed program is ensured under a mild regularity condition, termed relaxed compatibility between the CLF and CBF. The resulting optimal control law is guaranteed to be locally Lipschitz continuous. We also analyze the closed-loop behaviour by characterizing the equilibrium points, and verifying that there are no equilibrium points in the interior of the control invariant set except at the origin. For a polynomial system and a semi-algebraic safe set, we provide a sum-of-squares program to design a relaxed compatible pair of CLF and CBF. The proposed approach is compared with other methods in the literature using numerical examples, exhibits superior filter performance and guarantees safety and local stability.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Control of Linear Parabolic Systems using Koopman Eigenstructure Assignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers the data-driven stabilization of linear boundary controlled parabolic PDEs by making use of the Koopman operator. For this, a Koopman eigenstructure assignment problem is solved, which amounts to determine a feedback of the Koopman open-loop eigenfunctionals assigning a desired finite set of closed-loop Koopman eigenvalues and eigenfunctionals to the closed-loop system. It is shown that the designed controller only needs a finite number of open-loop Koopman eigenvalues and modes of the state. They are determined by extending the classical Krylov-DMD to parabolic systems. For this, only a finite number of pointlike outputs and their temporal samples as well as temporal samples of the inputs are required resulting in a data-driven solution of the eigenstructure assignment problem. Exponential stability of the closed-loop system in the presence of small Krylov-DMD errors is verified. An unstable diffusion-reaction system demonstrates the new data-driven controller design technique for distributed-parameter systems.</description>

      <title>An Application of Model Reference Adaptive Control for Multi-Agent Synchronization in Drone Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the application of a Distributed Model Reference Adaptive Control (DMRAC) strategy for robust multi-agent synchronization of a network of drones. The proposed approach enables the development of controllers capable of accommodating differences in real-life model parameters between agents, thereby enhancing overall network performance. We compare the performance of the adaptive control laws with classical PID controllers for the reference tracking task. Each follower drone has a model reference adaptive controller that continuously updates its parameters based on real-time feedback and reference model information. This adaptability ensures an adequate performance that, compared to conventional non-adaptive techniques, can reduce the amount of energy required and consequently increase the operating duration of the drones. The experimental results, particularly in vertical velocity control, underscore the effectiveness of the proposed approach in achieving synchronized behavior.</description>

      <title>Safe Reinforcement Learning for Power System Control: A Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The large-scale integration of intermittent renewable energy resources introduces increased uncertainty and volatility to the supply side of power systems, thereby complicating system operation and control. Recently, data-driven approaches, particularly reinforcement learning (RL), have shown significant promise in addressing complex control challenges in power systems, because RL can learn from interactive feedback without needing prior knowledge of the system model. However, the training process of model-free RL methods relies heavily on random decisions for exploration, which may result in ``bad" decisions that violate critical safety constraints and lead to catastrophic control outcomes. Due to the inability of RL methods to theoretically ensure decision safety in power systems, directly deploying traditional RL algorithms in the real world is deemed unacceptable. Consequently, the safety issue in RL applications, known as safe RL, has garnered considerable attention in recent years, leading to numerous important developments. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art safe RL techniques and discusses how these techniques can be applied to power system control problems such as frequency regulation, voltage control, and energy management. We then present discussions on key challenges and future research directions, related to convergence and optimality, training efficiency, universality, and real-world deployment.</description>

      <title>Guarding a Target Area from a Heterogeneous Group of Cooperative Attackers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a multi-agent target guarding problem in which a single defender seeks to capture multiple attackers aiming to reach a high-value target area. In contrast to previous studies, the attackers herein are assumed to be heterogeneous in the sense that they have not only different speeds but also different weights representing their respective degrees of importance (e.g., the amount of allocated resources). The objective of the attacker team is to jointly minimize the weighted sum of their final levels of proximity to the target area, whereas the defender aims to maximize the same value. Using geometric arguments, we construct candidate equilibrium control policies that require the solution of a (possibly nonconvex) optimization problem. Subsequently, we validate the optimality of the candidate control policies using parametric optimization techniques. Lastly, we provide numerical examples to illustrate how cooperative behaviors emerge within the attacker team due to their heterogeneity.</description>

      <title>Exploring a Physics-Informed Decision Transformer for Distribution System Restoration: Methodology and Performance Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Driven by advancements in sensing and computing, deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based methods have demonstrated significant potential in effectively tackling distribution system restoration (DSR) challenges under uncertain operational scenarios. However, the data-intensive nature of DRL poses obstacles in achieving satisfactory DSR solutions for large-scale, complex distribution systems. Inspired by the transformative impact of emerging foundation models, including large language models (LLMs), across various domains, this paper explores an innovative approach harnessing LLMs' powerful computing capabilities to address scalability challenges inherent in conventional DRL methods for solving DSR. To our knowledge, this study represents the first exploration of foundation models, including LLMs, in revolutionizing conventional DRL applications in power system operations. Our contributions are twofold: 1) introducing a novel LLM-powered Physics-Informed Decision Transformer (PIDT) framework that leverages LLMs to transform conventional DRL methods for DSR operations, and 2) conducting comparative studies to assess the performance of the proposed LLM-powered PIDT framework at its initial development stage for solving DSR problems. While our primary focus in this paper is on DSR operations, the proposed PIDT framework can be generalized to optimize sequential decision-making across various power system operations.</description>

      <title>Fleet Size and Spill for UAM Operation under Uncertain Demand</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variation and imbalance in demand poses significant challenges to Urban Air Mobility (UAM) operations, affecting strategic decisions such as fleet sizing. To study the implications of demand variation on UAM fleet operations, we propose a stochastic passenger arrival time generation model that uses real-world data to infer demand distributions, and two integer programs that compute the zero-spill fleet size and the spill-minimizing flight schedules and charging policies, respectively. Our numerical experiment on a two-vertiport network shows that spill in relatively inelastic to fleet size and that the driving factor behind spill is the imbalance in demand.</description>

      <title>Effective Management of Airport Security Queues with Passenger Reassignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Airport security queues often suffer from inefficiencies that result in long wait times and decreased throughput, especially at peak departure time, affecting both passengers and airlines. This work addresses the problem of reassigning passengers to specific time slots for crossing security, aiming to mitigate these inefficiencies. We frame this problem as a Minimum Cost Network Flow (MCNF) problem, enabling us to solve it exactly in polynomial time due to its linear programming structure. Our approach redistributes passenger demand across different time intervals. By optimizing the reassignment of passengers to sigma-minute time slots, we achieve significant improvements in throughput and reductions in waiting time. Preliminary results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in enhancing operational efficiency and passenger satisfaction. The MCNF formulation offers a scalable and adaptable solution, providing long-term benefits for airport security management.</description>

      <title>Trajectory Tracking for UAVs: An Interpolating Control Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building on our previous work, this paper investigates the effectiveness of interpolating control (IC) for real-time trajectory tracking. Unlike prior studies that focused on trajectory tracking itself or UAV stabilization control in simulation, we evaluate the performance of a modified extended IC (eIC) controller compared to Model Predictive Control (MPC) through both simulated and laboratory experiments with a remotely controlled UAV.
  The evaluation focuses on the computational efficiency and control quality of real-time UAV trajectory tracking compared to previous IC applications. The results demonstrate that the eIC controller achieves competitive performance compared to MPC while significantly reducing computational complexity, making it a promising alternative for resource-constrained platforms.</description>

      <title>HGNET: A Hierarchical Feature Guided Network for Occupancy Flow Field Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting the motion of multiple traffic participants has always been one of the most challenging tasks in autonomous driving. The recently proposed occupancy flow field prediction method has shown to be a more effective and scalable representation compared to general trajectory prediction methods. However, in complex multi-agent traffic scenarios, it remains difficult to model the interactions among various factors and the dependencies among prediction outputs at different time steps. In view of this, we propose a transformer-based hierarchical feature guided network (HGNET), which can efficiently extract features of agents and map information from visual and vectorized inputs, modeling multimodal interaction relationships. Second, we design the Feature-Guided Attention (FGAT) module to leverage the potential guiding effects between different prediction targets, thereby improving prediction accuracy. Additionally, to enhance the temporal consistency and causal relationships of the predictions, we propose a Time Series Memory framework to learn the conditional distribution models of the prediction outputs at future time steps from multivariate time series. The results demonstrate that our model exhibits competitive performance, which ranks 3rd in the 2024 Waymo Occupancy and Flow Prediction Challenge.</description>

      <title>An AI-based, Error-bounded Compression Scheme for High-frequency Power Quality Disturbance Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The implementation of modern monitoring systems for power quality disturbances have the potential to generate substantial amounts of data, reaching a point where transmission and storage of high-frequency measurements become impractical. This research paper addresses this challenge by presenting a new, AI-based data compression method. It is based on existing, multi-level compression schemes; however, it uses state-of-the-art technologies, such as autoencoders, to improve the performance. Furthermore, it solves the problem that such algorithms usually cannot ensure an error bound. The scheme is tested on synthetically generated power quality disturbance samples. The evaluation is performed using different metrics such as final compression rate and overhead size. Compression rates between 5 and 68 were achieved depending on the error bound and noise level. Additionally, the impact of the compression on the performance of subsequent algorithms is determined by applying a classification algorithm to the decompressed data. The classification accuracy only declined by 0.8--11.9 \%, depending on the chosen error bound.</description>

      <title>Bayesian grey-box identification of nonlinear convection effects in heat transfer dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a computational procedure for identifying convection in heat transfer dynamics. The procedure is based on a Gaussian process latent force model, consisting of a white-box component (i.e., known physics) for the conduction and linear convection effects and a Gaussian process that acts as a black-box component for the nonlinear convection effects. States are inferred through Bayesian smoothing and we obtain approximate posterior distributions for the kernel covariance function's hyperparameters using Laplace's method. The nonlinear convection function is recovered from the Gaussian process states using a Bayesian regression model. We validate the procedure by simulation error using the identified nonlinear convection function, on both data from a simulated system and measurements from a physical assembly.</description>

      <title>From Coupling to Resilience: Quantifying the Impact of Interconnection in Energy Carrier Grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the increasing share of renewable energy resources and the emergence of couplings of different energy carrier grids, which may support the electricity networks by providing additional flexibility, conducting research on the properties of multi-energy systems is necessary. Primarily to keep stable grid operation and provide efficient planning, the resilience of such systems against low-probability, high-impact events is central. Previous steady-state resilience studies of electricity grids also involved investigating the topological attributes from a complex network theory perspective. However, this work aims to determine the influence of complex topological attributes on the resilience of coupled energy grids. To achieve this, we set up a Monte Carlo simulation to calculate the load-shedding performance indicator for the grids when affected by high-impact events. This indicator is used to calculate resilience metrics, which express the influence of the grids on each other. The metrics are the base to search for correlations between centrality/vitality metrics and the resilience impact metric. We apply our method to a case study based on a benchmark electricity grid. Our results show that, first, our impact metric is feasible for determining the influences of the network on each other. Second, we show that increasing coupling densities can lead to lower resilience in single-carrier grids. Third, it is apparent that centrality influences the impact of the grid components' resilience.</description>

      <title>Hydraulic Parameter Estimation for District Heating Based on Laboratory Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider calibration of hydraulic models for district heating systems based on operational data. We extend previous theoretical work on the topic to handle real-world complications, namely unknown valve characteristics and hysteresis. We generate two datasets in the Smart Water Infrastructure laboratory in Aalborg, Denmark, on which we evaluate the proposed procedure. In the first data set the system is controlled in such a way to excite all operational modes in terms of combinations of valve set-points. Here the best performing model predicted volume flow rates within roughly 5 and 10 \% deviation from the mean volume flow rate for the consumer with the highest and lowest mean volume flow rates respectively. This performance was met in the majority of the operational region. In the second data set, the system was controlled in order to mimic real load curves. The model trained on this data set performed similarly well when evaluated on data in the operational range represented in the training data. However, the model performance deteriorated when evaluated on data which was not represented in the training data.</description>

      <title>C-MP: A decentralized adaptive-coordinated traffic signal control using the Max Pressure framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coordinated traffic signals seek to provide uninterrupted flow through a series of closely spaced intersections, typically using pre-defined fixed signal timings and offsets. Adaptive traffic signals dynamically change signal timings based on observed traffic conditions in a way that might disrupt coordinated movements, particularly when these decisions are made independently at each intersection. To alleviate this issue, this paper introduces a novel Max Pressure-based traffic signal framework that can provide coordination even under decentralized decision-making. The proposed Coordinated Max Pressure (C-MP) algorithm uses the space mean speeds of vehicles to explicitly detect freely flowing platoons of vehicles and prioritizes their movement along a corridor. Specifically, upstream platoons are detected and their weight in the MP framework increased to provide priority, while downstream platoons are detected and their weight reduced to ensure smooth traffic flow across corridors. The study analytically proves that C-MP maintains the desirable maximum stability property, while micro-simulation analyses conducted on an arterial network demonstrate its ability to achieve a larger stable region compared to benchmark MP control policies. Simulation results also reveal that the proposed control algorithm can effectively coordinate traffic signals in both directions along an arterial without explicitly assigned offsets or constraints. The results also reveal C-MP's superiority to benchmark coordination strategies in reducing travel time, and fuel consumption both at the corridor level and the network level by balancing the negative impact imparted to vehicles in the minor direction.</description>

      <title>Simplifying Kinematic Parameter Estimation in sEMG Prosthetic Hands: A Two-Point Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Regression-based sEMG prosthetic hands are widely used for their ability to provide continuous kinematic parameters. However, establishing these models traditionally requires complex kinematic sensor systems to collect corresponding kinematic data in synchronization with EMG, which is cumbersome and user-unfriendly. This paper presents a simplified approach utilizing only two data points to depict kinematic parameters. Finger flexion is recorded as 1, extension as -1, and a near-linear model is employed to interpolate intermediate values, offering a viable alternative for kinematic data. We validated the approach with twenty participants through offline analysis and online experiments. The offline analysis confirmed the model's capability to fill in intermediate points and the online experiments demonstrated that participants could control gestures, adjust force accurately. This study significantly reduces the complexity of collecting dynamic parameters in EMG-based regression prosthetics, thus enhancing usability for prosthetic hands.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The network approach to characterizing psychopathology departs from traditional latent categorical and dimensional approaches. Causal interplay among symptoms contributed to dynamic psychopathology system. Therefore, analyzing the symptom clusters is critical for understanding mental disorders. Furthermore, despite extensive research studying the topological features of symptom networks, the control relationships between symptoms remain largely unclear. Here, we present a novel systematizing concept, module control, to analyze the control principle of the symptom network at a module level. We introduce Module Control Network (MCN) to identify key modules that regulate the network's behavior. By applying our approach to a multivariate psychological dataset, we discover that non-emotional modules, such as sleep-related and stress-related modules, are the primary controlling modules in the symptom network. Our findings indicate that module control can expose central symptom cluster governing psychopathology network, offering novel insights into the underlying mechanisms of mental disorders and individualized approach to psychological interventions.</description>

      <title>Quadratic Optimal Control of Graphon Q-noise Linear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The modelling of linear quadratic Gaussian optimal control problems on large complex networks is intractable computationally. Graphon theory provides an approach to overcome these issues by defining limit objects for infinite sequences of graphs permitting one to approximate arbitrarily large networks by infinite dimensional operators. This is extended to stochastic systems by the use of Q-noise, a generalization of Wiener processes in finite dimensional spaces to processes in function spaces. The optimal control of linear quadratic problems on graphon systems with Q-noise disturbances are defined and shown to be the limit of the corresponding finite graph optimal control problem. The theory is extended to low rank systems, and a fully worked special case is presented. In addition, the worst-case long-range average and infinite horizon discounted optimal control performance with respect to Q-noise distribution are computed for a small set of standard graphon limits.</description>

      <title>A flexured-gimbal 3-axis force-torque sensor reveals minimal cross-axis coupling in an insect-sized flapping-wing robot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mechanical complexity of flapping wings, their unsteady aerodynamic flow, and challenge of making measurements at the scale of a sub-gram flapping-wing flying insect robot (FIR) make its behavior hard to predict. Knowing the precise mapping from voltage input to torque output, however, can be used to improve their mechanical and flight controller design. To address this challenge, we created a sensitive force-torque sensor based on a flexured gimbal that only requires a standard motion capture system or accelerometer for readout. Our device precisely and accurately measures pitch and roll torques simultaneously, as well as thrust, on a tethered flapping-wing FIR in response to changing voltage input signals. With it, we were able to measure cross-axis coupling of both torque and thrust input commands on a 180 mg FIR, the UW Robofly. We validated these measurements using free-flight experiments. Our results showed that roll and pitch have maximum cross-axis coupling errors of 8.58% and 17.24%, respectively, relative to the range of torque that is possible. Similarly, varying the pitch and roll commands resulted in up to a 5.78% deviation from the commanded thrust, across the entire commanded torque range. Our system, the first to measure two torque axes simultaneously, shows that torque commands have a negligible cross-axis coupling on both torque and thrust.</description>

      <title>Graph Simplification Solutions to the Street Intersection Miscount Problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Street intersection counts and densities are ubiquitous measures in transport geography and planning. However, typical street network data and typical street network analysis tools can substantially overcount them. This paper explains why this happens and introduces solutions to this problem. It presents the OSMnx package's algorithms to automatically simplify graph models of urban street networks -- via edge simplification and node consolidation -- resulting in faster, parsimonious models and more accurate network measures like intersection counts/densities, street segment lengths, and node degrees. Then it validates these algorithms and conducts a worldwide empirical assessment of count bias to quantify the motivating problem's prevalence. A full accounting of this bias and better methods to attenuate misrepresentations of intersections are necessary for data-driven, evidence-informed transport planning.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models for Power Scheduling: A User-Centric Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While traditional optimization and scheduling schemes are designed to meet fixed, predefined system requirements, future systems are moving toward user-driven approaches and personalized services, aiming to achieve high quality-of-experience (QoE) and flexibility. This challenge is particularly pronounced in wireless and digitalized energy networks, where users' requirements have largely not been taken into consideration due to the lack of a common language between users and machines. The emergence of powerful large language models (LLMs) marks a radical departure from traditional system-centric methods into more advanced user-centric approaches by providing a natural communication interface between users and devices. In this paper, for the first time, we introduce a novel architecture for resource scheduling problems by constructing three LLM agents to convert an arbitrary user's voice request (VRQ) into a resource allocation vector. Specifically, we design an LLM intent recognition agent to translate the request into an optimization problem (OP), an LLM OP parameter identification agent, and an LLM OP solving agent. To evaluate system performance, we construct a database of typical VRQs in the context of electric vehicle (EV) charging. As a proof of concept, we primarily use Llama 3 8B. Through testing with different prompt engineering scenarios, the obtained results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed architecture. The conducted performance analysis allows key insights to be extracted. For instance, having a larger set of candidate OPs to model the real-world problem might degrade the final performance because of a higher recognition/OP classification noise level. All results and codes are open source.</description>

      <title>Learning to Control Unknown Strongly Monotone Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider $N$ players each with a $d$-dimensional action set. Each of the players' utility functions includes their reward function and a linear term for each dimension, with coefficients that are controlled by the manager. We assume that the game is strongly monotone, so if each player runs gradient descent, the dynamics converge to a unique Nash equilibrium (NE). The NE is typically inefficient in terms of global performance. The resulting global performance of the system can be improved by imposing $K$-dimensional linear constraints on the NE. We therefore want the manager to pick the controlled coefficients that impose the desired constraint on the NE. However, this requires knowing the players' reward functions and their action sets. Obtaining this game structure information is infeasible in a large-scale network and violates the users' privacy. To overcome this, we propose a simple algorithm that learns to shift the NE of the game to meet the linear constraints by adjusting the controlled coefficients online. Our algorithm only requires the linear constraints violation as feedback and does not need to know the reward functions or the action sets. We prove that our algorithm, which is based on two time-scale stochastic approximation, guarantees convergence with probability 1 to the set of NE that meet target linear constraints. We then provide a mean square convergence rate of $O(t^{-1/4})$ for our algorithm. This is the first such bound for two time-scale stochastic approximation where the slower time-scale is a fixed point iteration with a non-expansive mapping. We demonstrate how our scheme can be applied to optimizing a global quadratic cost at NE and load balancing in resource allocation games. We provide simulations of our algorithm for these scenarios.</description>

      <title>DADEE: Well-calibrated uncertainty quantification in neural networks for barriers-based robot safety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Uncertainty-aware controllers that guarantee safety are critical for safety critical applications. Among such controllers, Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) based approaches are popular because they are fast, yet safe. However, most such works depend on Gaussian Processes (GPs) or MC-Dropout for learning and uncertainty estimation, and both approaches come with drawbacks: GPs are non-parametric methods that are slow, while MC-Dropout does not capture aleatoric uncertainty. On the other hand, modern Bayesian learning algorithms have shown promise in uncertainty quantification. The application of modern Bayesian learning methods to CBF-based controllers has not yet been studied. We aim to fill this gap by surveying uncertainty quantification algorithms and evaluating them on CBF-based safe controllers. We find that model variance-based algorithms (for example, Deep ensembles, MC-dropout, etc.) and direct estimation-based algorithms (such as DEUP) have complementary strengths. Algorithms in the former category can only estimate uncertainty accurately out-of-domain, while those in the latter category can only do so in-domain. We combine the two approaches to obtain more accurate uncertainty estimates both in- and out-of-domain. As measured by the failure rate of a simulated robot, this results in a safer CBF-based robot controller.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Dependency-Aware Priority Adjustment for Mixed-Criticality TSN Flow Scheduling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) serves as a one-size-fits-all solution for mixed-criticality communication, in which flow scheduling is vital to guarantee real-time transmissions. Traditional approaches statically assign priorities to flows based on their associated applications, resulting in significant queuing delays. In this paper, we observe that assigning different priorities to a flow leads to varying delays due to different shaping mechanisms applied to different flow types. Leveraging this insight, we introduce a new scheduling method in mixed-criticality TSN that incorporates a priority adjustment scheme among diverse flow types to mitigate queuing delays and enhance schedulability. Specifically, we propose dependency-aware priority adjustment algorithms tailored to different link-overlapping conditions. Experiments in various settings validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, which enhances the schedulability by 20.57% compared with the SOTA method.</description>

      <title>Data on the Move: Traffic-Oriented Data Trading Platform Powered by AI Agent with Common Sense</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the digital era, data has become a pivotal asset, advancing technologies such as autonomous driving. Despite this, data trading faces challenges like the absence of robust pricing methods and the lack of trustworthy trading mechanisms. To address these challenges, we introduce a traffic-oriented data trading platform named Data on The Move (DTM), integrating traffic simulation, data trading, and Artificial Intelligent (AI) agents. The DTM platform supports evident-based data value evaluation and AI-based trading mechanisms. Leveraging the common sense capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to assess traffic state and data value, DTM can determine reasonable traffic data pricing through multi-round interaction and simulations. Moreover, DTM provides a pricing method validation by simulating traffic systems, multi-agent interactions, and the heterogeneity and irrational behaviors of individuals in the trading market. Within the DTM platform, entities such as connected vehicles and traffic light controllers could engage in information collecting, data pricing, trading, and decision-making. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed AI agent-based pricing approach enhances data trading by offering rational prices, as evidenced by the observed improvement in traffic efficiency. This underscores the effectiveness and practical value of DTM, offering new perspectives for the evolution of data markets and smart cities. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study employing LLMs in data pricing and a pioneering data trading practice in the field of intelligent vehicles and smart cities.</description>

      <title>Quaternion-based Adaptive Backstepping Fast Terminal Sliding Mode Control for Quadrotor UAVs with Finite Time Convergence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel quaternion-based approach for tracking the translation (position and linear velocity) and rotation (attitude and angular velocity) trajectories of underactuated Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). Quadrotor UAVs are challenging regarding accuracy, singularity, and uncertainties issues. Controllers designed based on unit-quaternion are singularity-free for attitude representation compared to other methods (e.g., Euler angles), which fail to represent the vehicle's attitude at multiple orientations. Quaternion-based Adaptive Backstepping Control (ABC) and Adaptive Fast Terminal Sliding Mode Control (AFTSMC) are proposed to address a set of challenging problems. A quaternion-based ABC, a superior recursive approach, is proposed to generate the necessary thrust handling unknown uncertainties and UAV translation trajectory tracking. Next, a quaternion-based AFTSMC is developed to overcome parametric uncertainties, avoid singularity, and ensure fast convergence in a finite time. Moreover, the proposed AFTSMC is able to significantly minimize control signal chattering, which is the main reason for actuator failure and provide smooth and accurate rotational control input. To ensure the robustness of the proposed approach, the designed control algorithms have been validated considering unknown time-variant parametric uncertainties and significant initialization errors. The proposed techniques has been compared to state-of-the-art control technique.

Abstract: This paper examines the influence of initial guesses on trajectory planning for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) formulated in terms of Optimal Control Problem (OCP). The OCP is solved numerically using the Pseudospectral collocation method. Our approach leverages a path identified through Lazy Theta* and incorporates known constraints and a model of the UAV's behavior for the initial guess. Our findings indicate that a suitable initial guess has a beneficial influence on the planned trajectory. They also suggest promising directions for future research.</description>

      <title>How Clustering Affects the Convergence of Decentralized Optimization over Networks: A Monte-Carlo-based Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decentralized algorithms have gained substantial interest owing to advancements in cloud computing, Internet of Things (IoT), intelligent transportation networks, and parallel processing over sensor networks. The convergence of such algorithms is directly related to specific properties of the underlying network topology. Specifically, the clustering coefficient is known to affect, for example, the controllability/observability and the epidemic growth over networks. In this work, we study the effects of the clustering coefficient on the convergence rate of networked optimization approaches. In this regard, we model the structure of large-scale distributed systems by random scale-free (SF) and clustered scale-free (CSF) networks and compare the convergence rate by tuning the network clustering coefficient. This is done by keeping other relevant network properties (such as power-law degree distribution, number of links, and average degree) unchanged. Monte-Carlo-based simulations are used to compare the convergence rate over many trials of SF graph topologies. Furthermore, to study the convergence rate over real case studies, we compare the clustering coefficient of some real-world networks with the eigenspectrum of the underlying network (as a measure of convergence rate). The results interestingly show higher convergence rate over low-clustered networks. This is significant as one can improve the learning rate of many existing decentralized machine-learning scenarios by tuning the network clustering.</description>

      <title>Turbidity Control in Sedimentation Columns by Direction Dependent Models</title>

Abstract: Sedimentation is a crucial phenomenon in recovering water from slurries by separating solid-liquid. Thickeners and sedimentation columns are equipments widely used in the process industry to reclaim water from process slurries. This contribution addresses the problem of controlling the turbidity of the recovered water in a sedimentation column by manipulating the underflow. The phenomenological model describing the turbidity is too complex to be used in a control strategy, and it is difficult to identify its parameters using plant measurements. This work proposes an empirical piece-wise time-delay model for modeling the turbidity at the top of the column to circumvent these problems. A systematic design procedure is developed to tune a Proportional Integral controller guaranteeing closed-loop stability for systems modeled as a piece-wise time delay model. Experiments in a pilot plant validate the theoretical results and illustrate the control performance under various operational scenarios.</description>

      <title>Unambiguous Interpretation of IEC 60848 GRAFCET based on a Literature Review</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.11556v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: IEC 60848 GRAFCET is a standardized, graphical specification language for control functions. Because of the semiformal nature of IEC 60848, the details of specifications created with GRAFCET can be interpreted in different ways, possibly leading to faulty implementations. These ambiguities have been partially addressed in existing literature, but solved in different manners. Based on a literature review, this work aims at providing an overview of existing interpretations and, based on that, proposes a comprehensive interpretation algorithm for IEC 60848, which takes all relevant ambiguities from the literature review into account.</description>

      <title>Output-feedback adaptive model predictive control for ramp metering: a set-membership approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.05265v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ramp metering, which regulates the flow entering the freeway, is one of the most effective freeway traffic control methods. This paper introduces an output-feedback adaptive approach to ramp metering that combines model predictive control (MPC) with set-membership parameter and state estimation. The set-membership estimator is designed based on a mixed-monotone embedding of underlying traffic dynamics. The embedding is also used as the modeling basis for MPC optimization. For a line freeway network with unknown parameters and partial measurement on the freeway mainline, we provide sufficient conditions on the control horizon, cost functions, terminal sets of MPC, and inflow demand at the ramps such that the queue lengths in the closed-loop system remain bounded. The sufficient condition on the demand matches the necessary condition, thereby proving maximal throughput under the proposed controller. The result is strengthened to input-to-state stability when model parameters and demand are known. The samples generated by the proposed controller are shown to facilitate finite time estimation of free-flow model parameters, i.e., free-flow speed and turning ratios. Simulation results illustrate stability of the closed-loop system under the proposed controller even under few mainline measurements, for which the system becomes unstable under existing approaches.</description>

      <title>A General Verification Framework for Dynamical and Control Models via Certificate Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.06090v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An emerging branch of control theory specialises in certificate learning, concerning the specification of a desired (possibly complex) system behaviour for an autonomous or control model, which is then analytically verified by means of a function-based proof. However, the synthesis of controllers abiding by these complex requirements is in general a non-trivial task and may elude the most expert control engineers. This results in a need for automatic techniques that are able to design controllers and to analyse a wide range of elaborate specifications. In this paper, we provide a general framework to encode system specifications and define corresponding certificates, and we present an automated approach to formally synthesise controllers and certificates. Our approach contributes to the broad field of safe learning for control, exploiting the flexibility of neural networks to provide candidate control and certificate functions, whilst using SMT-solvers to offer a formal guarantee of correctness. We test our framework by developing a prototype software tool, and assess its efficacy at verification via control and certificate synthesis over a large and varied suite of benchmarks.</description>

      <title>On Completeness of SDP-Based Barrier Certificate Synthesis over Unbounded Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15416v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Barrier certificates, serving as differential invariants that witness system safety, play a crucial role in the verification of cyber-physical systems (CPS). Prevailing computational methods for synthesizing barrier certificates are based on semidefinite programming (SDP) by exploiting Putinar Positivstellensatz. Consequently, these approaches are limited by the Archimedean condition, which requires all variables to be bounded, i.e., systems are defined over bounded domains. For systems over unbounded domains, unfortunately, existing methods become incomplete and may fail to identify potential barrier certificates.
  In this paper, we address this limitation for the unbounded cases. We first give a complete characterization of polynomial barrier certificates by using homogenization, a recent technique in the optimization community to reduce an unbounded optimization problem to a bounded one. Furthermore, motivated by this formulation, we introduce the definition of homogenized systems and propose a complete characterization of a family of non-polynomial barrier certificates with more expressive power. Experimental results demonstrate that our two approaches are more effective while maintaining a comparable level of efficiency.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-Aware Transient Stability-Constrained Preventive Redispatch: A Distributional Reinforcement Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09263v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transient stability-constrained preventive redispatch plays a crucial role in ensuring power system security and stability. Since redispatch strategies need to simultaneously satisfy complex transient constraints and the economic need, model-based formulation and optimization become extremely challenging. In addition, the increasing uncertainty and variability introduced by renewable sources start to drive the system stability consideration from deterministic to probabilistic, which further exaggerates the complexity. In this paper, a Graph neural network guided Distributional Deep Reinforcement Learning (GD2RL) method is proposed, for the first time, to solve the uncertainty-aware transient stability-constrained preventive redispatch problem. First, a graph neural network-based transient simulator is trained by supervised learning to efficiently generate post-contingency rotor angle curves with the steady-state and contingency as inputs, which serves as a feature extractor for operating states and a surrogate time-domain simulator during the environment interaction for reinforcement learning. Distributional deep reinforcement learning with explicit uncertainty distribution of system operational conditions is then applied to generate the redispatch strategy to balance the user-specified probabilistic stability performance and economy preferences. The full distribution of the post-redispatch transient stability index is directly provided as the output. Case studies on the modified New England 39-bus system validate the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Robust and fast backbone tracking via phase-locked loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06639v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Phase-locked loops are commonly used for shaker-based backbone tracking of nonlinear structures. The state of the art is to tune the control parameters by trial and error. In the present work, an approach is proposed to make backbone tracking much more robust and faster. A simple PI controller is proposed, and closed-form expressions for the gains are provided that lead to an optimal settling of the phase transient. The required input parameters are obtained from a conventional shaker-based linear modal test, and an open-loop sine test at a single frequency and level. For phase detection, an adaptive filter based on the LMS algorithm is used, which is shown to be superior to the synchronous demodulation commonly used. Once the phase has locked, one can directly take the next step along the backbone, eliminating the hold times. The latter are currently used for recording the steady state, and to estimate Fourier coefficients in the post-process, which becomes unnecessary since the adaptive filter yields a highly accurate estimation at runtime.The excellent performance of the proposed approach is demonstrated for a doubly clamped beam undergoing bending-stretching coupling leading to a 20 percent shift of the lowest modal frequency. Even for fixed control parameters, designed for the linear regime, only about 100 periods are needed per backbone point, also in the nonlinear regime. This is much faster than what has been reported in the literature so far.</description>

Abstract: We consider the design of a new class of passive iFIR controllers given by the parallel action of an integrator and a finite impulse response filter. iFIRs are more expressive than PID controllers but retain their features and simplicity. The paper provides a model-free data-driven design for passive iFIR controllers based on virtual reference feedback tuning. Passivity is enforced through constrained optimization (three different formulations are discussed). The proposed design does not rely on large datasets or accurate plant models.</description>

      <title>Distributed Adaptive Control of Disturbed Interconnected Systems with High-Order Tuners</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15178v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of network synchronization under limited communication, involving heterogeneous agents with different dynamics and various network topologies, to achieve consensus. We investigate the distributed adaptive control for interconnected unknown linear subsystems with a leader and followers, in the presence of input-output disturbance. We enhance the communication within multi-agent systems to achieve consensus under the leadership's guidance. While the measured variable is similar among the followers, the incoming measurements are weighted and constructed based on their proximity to the leader. We also explore the convergence rates across various balanced topologies (Star-like, Cyclic-like, Path, Random), featuring different numbers of agents, using three distributed algorithms, ranging from first- to high-order tuners to effectively address time-varying regressors. The mathematical foundation is rigorously presented from the network designs of the unknown agents following a leader, to the distributed methods. Moreover, we conduct several numerical simulations across various networks, agents and tuners to evaluate the effects of sparsity in the interaction between subsystems using the $L_2-$norm and $L_\infty-$norm. Some networks exhibit a trend where an increasing number of agents results in smaller errors, although this is not universally the case. Additionally, patterns observed at initial times may not reliably predict overall performance across different networks. Finally, we demonstrate that the proposed modified high-order tuner outperforms its counterparts, and we provide related insights along with our conclusions.</description>

      <title>Model Predictive Control and Reinforcement Learning: A Unified Framework Based on Dynamic Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00592v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we describe a new conceptual framework that connects approximate Dynamic Programming (DP), Model Predictive Control (MPC), and Reinforcement Learning (RL). This framework centers around two algorithms, which are designed largely independently of each other and operate in synergy through the powerful mechanism of Newton's method. We call them the off-line training and the on-line play algorithms. The names are borrowed from some of the major successes of RL involving games; primary examples are the recent (2017) AlphaZero program (which plays chess, [SHS17], [SSS17]), and the similarly structured and earlier (1990s) TD-Gammon program (which plays backgammon, [Tes94], [Tes95], [TeG96]). In these game contexts, the off-line training algorithm is the method used to teach the program how to evaluate positions and to generate good moves at any given position, while the on-line play algorithm is the method used to play in real time against human or computer opponents.
  Significantly, the synergy between off-line training and on-line play also underlies MPC (as well as other major classes of sequential decision problems), and indeed the MPC design architecture is very similar to the one of AlphaZero and TD-Gammon. This conceptual insight provides a vehicle for bridging the cultural gap between RL and MPC, and sheds new light on some fundamental issues in MPC. These include the enhancement of stability properties through rollout, the treatment of uncertainty through the use of certainty equivalence, the resilience of MPC in adaptive control settings that involve changing system parameters, and the insights provided by the superlinear performance bounds implied by Newton's method.</description>

      <title>Non-Euclidean Contraction Analysis of Continuous-Time Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2110.08298v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Critical questions in dynamical neuroscience and machine learning are related to the study of continuous-time neural networks and their stability, robustness, and computational efficiency. These properties can be simultaneously established via a contraction analysis. This paper develops a comprehensive non-Euclidean contraction theory for continuous-time neural networks. Specifically, we provide novel sufficient conditions for the contractivity of general classes of continuous-time neural networks including Hopfield, firing rate, Persidskii, Lur'e, and other neural networks with respect to the non-Euclidean $\ell_1/\ell_\infty$ norms. These sufficient conditions are based upon linear programming or, in some special cases, establishing the Hurwitzness of a particular Metzler matrix. To prove these sufficient conditions, we develop novel results on non-Euclidean logarithmic norms and a novel necessary and sufficient condition for contractivity of systems with locally Lipschitz dynamics. For each model, we apply our theoretical results to compute the optimal contraction rate and corresponding weighted non-Euclidean norm with respect to which the neural network is contracting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.11414v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The paper deals with the setting where two viruses (say virus 1 and virus 2) coexist in a population, and they are not necessarily mutually exclusive, in the sense that infection due to one virus does not preclude the possibility of simultaneous infection due to the other. We develop a coupled bi-virus susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model from a 4n-state Markov chain model, where n is the number of agents (i.e., individuals or subpopulation) in the population. We identify a sufficient condition for both viruses to eventually die out, and a sufficient condition for the existence, uniqueness and asymptotic stability of the endemic equilibrium of each virus. We establish a sufficient condition and multiple necessary conditions for local exponential convergence to the boundary equilibrium (i.e., one virus persists, the other one dies out) of each virus. Under mild assumptions on the healing rate, we show that there cannot exist a coexisting equilibrium where for each node there is a nonzero fraction infected only by virus 1; a nonzero fraction infected only by virus 2; but no fraction that is infected by both viruses 1 and 2. Likewise, assuming that healing rates are strictly positive, a coexisting equilibrium where for each node there is a nonzero fraction infected by both viruses 1 and 2, but no fraction is infected only by virus 1 (resp. virus 2) does not exist. Further, we provide a necessary condition for the existence of certain other kinds of coexisting equilibria. We show that, unlike the competitive bivirus model, the coupled bivirus model is not monotone. Finally, we illustrate our theoretical findings using an extensive set of in-depth simulations.</description>

      <title>Towards Improving Unit Commitment Economics: An Add-On Tailor for Renewable Energy and Reserve Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.13065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.13065v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generally, day-ahead unit commitment (UC) is conducted in a predict-then-optimize process: it starts by predicting the renewable energy source (RES) availability and system reserve requirements; given the predictions, the UC model is then optimized to determine the economic operation plans. In fact, predictions within the process are raw. In other words, if the predictions are further tailored to assist UC in making the economic operation plans against realizations of the RES and reserve requirements, UC economics will benefit significantly. To this end, this paper presents a cost-oriented tailor of RES-and-reserve predictions for UC, deployed as an add-on to the predict-then-optimize process. The RES-and-reserve tailor is trained by solving a bi-level mixed-integer programming model: the upper level trains the tailor based on its induced operating cost; the lower level, given tailored predictions, mimics the system operation process and feeds the induced operating cost back to the upper level; finally, the upper level evaluates the training quality according to the fed-back cost. Through this training, the tailor learns to customize the raw predictions into cost-oriented predictions. Moreover, the tailor can be embedded into the existing predict-then-optimize process as an add-on, improving the UC economics. Lastly, the presented method is compared to traditional, binary-relaxation, neural network-based, stochastic, and robust methods.</description>

Abstract: The convex hull cheapest insertion heuristic is known to produce good solutions to the Traveling Salesperson Problem in Euclidean spaces, but it has never been extended to the non-Euclidean problem. This paper proposes an adaptation that uses multidimensional scaling to first project the points from a non-Euclidean space into a Euclidean equivalent space, thereby enabling the generation of a convex hull that initializes the algorithm. To evaluate the proposed algorithm, non-Euclidean spaces are created by adding separators to the Euclidean TSPLIB benchmark data-set, or by using the L1 norm as a metric. This adapted heuristic is demonstrated to outperform the commonly used Nearest Neighbor heuristic and Nearest Insertion heuristic in 88% and 99% of the cases studied, respectively. When compared with metaheuristic algorithms, the proposed heuristic's tour costs are lower than the solutions found by the genetic algorithm and ant colony optimization algorithm in 87% and 95% of the instances, respectively.</description>

      <title>Quadratic Programming-based Reference Spreading Control for Dual-Arm Robotic Manipulation with Planned Simultaneous Impacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.08643v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the aim of further enabling the exploitation of intentional impacts in robotic manipulation, a control framework is presented that directly tackles the challenges posed by tracking control of robotic manipulators that are tasked to perform nominally simultaneous impacts. This framework is an extension of the reference spreading control framework, in which overlapping ante- and post-impact references that are consistent with impact dynamics are defined. In this work, such a reference is constructed starting from a teleoperation-based approach. By using the corresponding ante- and post-impact control modes in the scope of a quadratic programming control approach, peaking of the velocity error and control inputs due to impacts is avoided while maintaining high tracking performance. With the inclusion of a novel interim mode, we aim to also avoid input peaks and steps when uncertainty in the environment causes a series of unplanned single impacts to occur rather than the planned simultaneous impact. This work in particular presents for the first time an experimental evaluation of reference spreading control on a robotic setup, showcasing its robustness against uncertainty in the environment compared to three baseline control approaches.</description>

      <title>Structure-Preserving Discretization and Model Order Reduction of Boundary-Controlled 1D Port-Hamiltonian Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06425v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a systematic methodology for the discretization and reduction of a class of one-dimensional Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) with inputs and outputs collocated at the spatial boundaries. The class of system that we consider is known as Boundary-Controlled Port-Hamiltonian Systems (BC-PHSs) and covers a wide class of Hyperbolic PDEs with a large type of boundary inputs and outputs. This is, for instance, the case of waves and beams with Neumann, Dirichlet, or mixed boundary conditions. Based on a Partitioned Finite Element Method (PFEM), we develop a numerical scheme for the structure-preserving spatial discretization for the class of one-dimensional BC-PHSs. We show that if the initial PDE is passive (or impedance energy preserving), the discretized model also is. In addition and since the discretized model or Full Order Model (FOM) can be of large dimension, we recall the standard Loewner framework for the Model Order Reduction (MOR) using frequency domain interpolation. We recall the main steps to produce a Reduced Order Model (ROM) that approaches the FOM in a given range of frequencies. We summarize the steps to follow in order to obtain a ROM that preserves the passive structure as well. Finally, we provide a constructive way to build a projector that allows to recover the physical meaning of the state variables from the ROM to the FOM. We use the one-dimensional wave equation and the Timoshenko beam as examples to show the versatility of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Integrating solid direct air capture systems with green hydrogen production: Economic synergy of sector coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00665v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the global pursuit of sustainable energy solutions, mitigating carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions stands as a pivotal challenge. With escalating atmospheric CO2 levels, the imperative of direct air capture (DAC) systems becomes evident. Simultaneously, green hydrogen (GH) emerges as a pivotal medium for renewable energy. Nevertheless, the substantial expenses associated with these technologies impede widespread adoption, primarily due to significant installation costs and underutilized operational advantages when deployed independently. Integration through sector coupling enhances system efficiency and sustainability, while shared power sources and energy storage devices offer additional economic benefits. In this study, we assess the economic viability of polymer electrolyte membrane electrolyzers versus alkaline electrolyzers within the context of sector coupling. Our findings indicate that combining GH production with solid DAC systems yields significant economic advantages, with approximately a 10% improvement for PEM electrolyzers and a 20% enhancement for alkaline electrolyzers. These results highlight a substantial opportunity to improve the efficiency and economic viability of renewable energy and green hydrogen initiatives, thereby facilitating the broader adoption of cleaner technologies.</description>
