      <title>BIPeC: A Combined Change-Point Analyzer to Identify Performance Regressions in Large-scale Database Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Performance testing in large-scale database systems like SAP HANA is a crucial yet labor-intensive task, involving extensive manual analysis of thousands of measurements, such as CPU time and elapsed time. Manual maintenance of these metrics is time-consuming and susceptible to human error, making early detection of performance regressions challenging. We address these issues by proposing an automated approach to detect performance regressions in such measurements. Our approach integrates Bayesian inference with the Pruned Exact Linear Time (PELT) algorithm, enhancing the detection of change points and performance regressions with high precision and efficiency compared to previous approaches. Our method minimizes false negatives and ensures SAP HANA's system's reliability and performance quality. The proposed solution can accelerate testing and contribute to more sustainable performance management practices in large-scale data management environments.</description>

      <title>Sampling Methods for Inner Product Sketching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16157v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, Bessa et al. (PODS 2023) showed that sketches based on coordinated weighted sampling theoretically and empirically outperform popular linear sketching methods like Johnson-Lindentrauss projection and CountSketch for the ubiquitous problem of inner product estimation. We further develop this finding by introducing and analyzing two alternative sampling-based methods. In contrast to the computationally expensive algorithm in Bessa et al., our methods run in linear time (to compute the sketch) and perform better in practice, significantly beating linear sketching on a variety of tasks. For example, they provide state-of-the-art results for estimating the correlation between columns in unjoined tables, a problem that we show how to reduce to inner product estimation in a black-box way. While based on known sampling techniques (threshold and priority sampling) we introduce significant new theoretical analysis to prove approximation guarantees for our methods.</description>

      <title>Multi-Relational Algebra and Its Applications to Data Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04824v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A range of data insight analytical tasks involves analyzing a large set of tables of different schemas, possibly induced by various groupings, to find salient patterns. In particular, such analyses are about many-to-many transformations of tables, while the classic relational algebra is about one-to-one or many-to-one transformations. This paper presents Multi-Relational Algebra, which extends relational algebra for such transformations and their compositions. Multi-Relational Algebra introduces MultiRelation to model of a set of tables of different schemas. Importantly, while the information unit in Relational Algebra is a tuple, the information unit in Multi-Relational Algebra is a slice, which formally is a pair $(r, X)$ where $r$ is a (region) tuple, and $X$ is a (feature) table. Multi-Relational Algebra introduces three new fundamental algebraic operators, MultiSelect, MultiProject, and MultiJoin, which lift their counterparts Select, Project, and Join to transform MultiRelation to MultiRelation. Through various examples, we show that multi-relational algebra can effortlessly express many complex analytic problems, some of which are traditionally considered out of scope for relational analytics. We have implemented and deployed a service for multi-relational analytics. Due to a unified logical design, we are able to conduct systematic optimization for a variety of seemingly different tasks. Our service has garnered interest from over a hundred internal teams who have developed data-insight applications using it, and serves millions of operators daily.</description>
