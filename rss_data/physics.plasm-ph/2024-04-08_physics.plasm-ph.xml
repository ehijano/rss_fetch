      <title>Geometric Burn Control For Tokamaks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new burn control scheme for tokamaks is described where the total fusion power is controlled by adjusting the plasma volume fraction that is packed into power dense regions. In an example spherical tokamak burning plasma, by modifying the plasma edge squareness the total fusion power is doubled at almost constant total plasma volume and fusion power density. Therefore, increased plasma squareness could be extremely beneficial to a fusion reactor and squareness control could be desirable for power load balancing. Experiments have observed the impact of increased edge squareness on modified core plasma volume, highlighting the practical relevance of this approach.</description>

      <title>A birdcage resonant antenna for helicon wave generation in TORPEX</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A birdcage resonant helicon antenna is designed, mounted and tested in the toroidal device TORPEX. The birdcage resonant antenna is an alternative to the usual Boswell or half-helical antenna designs commonly used for $\sim$ 10 cm diameter helicon sources in low temperature plasma devices. The main advantage of the birdcage antenna lies in its resonant nature, which makes it easily operational even at large scales, an appealing feature for the TORPEX device whose poloidal cross section is 40 cm in diameter. With this antenna helicon waves are shown to be launched and sustained throughout the whole torus of TORPEX. The helicon waves can be launched at low power on a pre-existing magnetron-generated plasma with little effect on the density profiles. The birdcage antenna can also be used alone to produce plasma, which removes the constraint of a narrow range of applied magnetic fields required by the magnetron, opening the way to a new range of studies on TORPEX with the external magnetic field as a control parameter.</description>

      <title>Oblique photons, plasmons, and current-plasmons in relativistic plasmas and their topological implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photons in vacuum are transverse in any inertial frame; longitudinal photons only exist virtually. By developing a manifestly covariant theory for electromagnetic excitations in relativistic plasmas and applying Wigner's little group method for elementary particle classifications, we show that photons in plasmas are neither transverse nor longitudinal; they are oblique. Plasmons are electromagnetic and oblique as well. The Lorentz invariant characteristics that distinguishes photons and plasmons is covariant compressibility. The manifestly covariant theory predicts the existence of the current-plasmon, a third oblique, electromagnetic eigenmode, and it also enables the study of photon topology in plasmas. Plasmas remove the photon's Dirac point in vacuum by giving it an effective mass, but create a tilted Dirac-Weyl point by reviving the virtual longitudinal photon.</description>

      <title>Semi-empirical cross-section formulas for electron-impact ionization and rate coefficient calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a semi-empirical formula for the cross section of ionization by electron impact. The formula involves adjustable parameters which are determined by comparison with measured or numerically calculated cross sections. In the latter case, the ions are perturbed by their environment which is a high-density plasma. As a consequence, the cross section is significantly modified. We investigate Be-like carbon, nitrogen and oxygen as well as aluminum ions. We also show that the formula is well-suited for interpolation and extrapolation. Knowing the cross section, we calculate the rate coefficient within the Boltzmann and Fermi-Dirac statistics. In the first case, the rate can be calculated analytically. In the second one, it can be expressed in terms of special functions, but the numerical evaluation is more convenient while providing accurate results. Our results are compared to experiment and to other calculations.</description>

      <title>Cosmic-ray confinement in radio bubbles by micromirrors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radio bubbles, ubiquitous features of the intracluster medium around active galactic nuclei, are known to rise buoyantly for multiple scale heights through the intracluster medium (ICM). It is an open question how the bubbles can retain their high-energy cosmic-ray content over such distances. We propose that the enhanced scattering of cosmic rays due to micromirrors generated in the ICM, as proposed recently by Reichherzer et al. (2023), is a viable mechanism for confining the cosmic rays within bubbles and can qualitatively reproduce their morphology. We discuss the observational implications of such a model of cosmic-ray confinement.</description>

      <title>Design, fabrication and test of a 5 GHz klystron based on the kladistron principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new bunching method, named "kladistron" has been developed at CEA in order to provide high efficiency klystrons. A first "kladistron" prototype was designed and realized. It was adapted from the 4.9 GHz TH2166 from Thales, where the interaction line was transformed from 6 to 16 cavities. The design and fabrication phases of this prototype are developed in this paper. The kladistron prototype was tested in Thales facility. Its efficiency is finally lower (41 %) than expected (55 %), moreover it presents a spurious oscillation at 4.96 GHz. After analysis of the experimental results, it is concluded that the discrepancy between design and real frequencies is the cause for the low efficiency while the spurious oscillation results from a high gain peak at 4.96 GHz.</description>

      <title>Provably Convergent and Robust Newton-Raphson Method: A New Dawn in Primitive Variable Recovery for Relativistic MHD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A long-standing and formidable challenge faced by all conservative schemes for relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD) is the recovery of primitive variables from conservative ones. This process involves solving highly nonlinear equations subject to physical constraints. An ideal solver should be "robust, accurate, and fast -- it is at the heart of all conservative RMHD schemes," as emphasized in [S.C. Noble et al., ApJ, 641:626-637, 2006]. Despite over three decades of research, seeking efficient solvers that can provably guarantee stability and convergence remains an open problem.
  This paper presents the first theoretical analysis for designing a robust, physical-constraint-preserving (PCP), and provably (quadratically) convergent Newton-Raphson (NR) method for primitive variable recovery in RMHD. Our key innovation is a unified approach for the initial guess, devised based on sophisticated analysis. It ensures that the NR iteration consistently converges and adheres to physical constraints. Given the extreme nonlinearity and complexity of the iterative function, the theoretical analysis is highly nontrivial and technical. We discover a pivotal inequality for delineating the convexity and concavity of the iterative function and establish theories to guarantee the PCP property and convergence. We also develop theories to determine a computable initial guess within a theoretical "safe" interval. Intriguingly, we find that the unique positive root of a cubic polynomial always falls within this interval. Our PCP NR method is versatile and can be seamlessly integrated into any RMHD scheme that requires the recovery of primitive variables, potentially leading to a broad impact in this field. As an application, we incorporate it into a discontinuous Galerkin method, resulting in fully PCP schemes. Several numerical experiments demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of the PCP NR method.</description>

      <title>Kinetic-Ballooning-Limited Pedestals in Spherical Tokamak Plasmas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.05238v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A theoretical model is presented that for the first time matches experimental measurements of the pedestal width-height Diallo scaling in the low-aspect-ratio high-$\beta$ tokamak NSTX. Combining linear gyrokinetics with self-consistent pedestal equilibrium variation, kinetic-ballooning, rather than ideal-ballooning plasma instability, is shown to limit achievable confinement in spherical tokamak pedestals. Simulations are used to find the novel Gyrokinetic Critical Pedestal constraint, which determines the steepest pressure profile a pedestal can sustain subject to gyrokinetic instability. Gyrokinetic width-height scaling expressions for NSTX pedestals with varying density and temperature profiles are obtained. These scalings for spherical tokamaks depart significantly from that of conventional aspect ratio tokamaks.</description>

      <title>Kinetic-Ballooning-Bifurcation in Tokamak Pedestals Across Shaping and Aspect-Ratio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05216v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use a new gyrokinetic threshold model to predict a bifurcation in tokamak pedestal width-height scalings that depends strongly on plasma shaping and aspect-ratio. The bifurcation arises from the first and second stability properties of kinetic-ballooning-modes that yields wide and narrow pedestal branches, expanding the space of accessible pedestal widths and heights. The wide branch offers potential for edge-localized-mode-free pedestals with high core pressure. For negative triangularity, low-aspect-ratio configurations are predicted to give steeper pedestals than conventional-aspect-ratio. Both wide and narrow branches have been attained in tokamak experiments.</description>

      <title>Local momentum balance in electromagnetic gyrokinetic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12757v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Eulerian variational formulation is presented to obtain governing equations of the electromagnetic turbulent gyrokinetic system. A local momentum balance in the system is derived from the invariance of the Lagrangian of the system under an arbitrary spatial coordinate transformation by extending the previous work [H. Sugama et al., Phys. Plasmas 28, 022312 (2021)]. Polarization and magnetization due to finite gyroradii and electromagnetic microturbulence are correctly described by the gyrokinetic Poisson equation and Amp\`{e}re's law which are derived from the variational principle. Also shown is how the momentum balance is influenced by including collisions and external sources. Momentum transport due to collisions and turbulence is represented by a symmetric pressure tensor which originates in a variational derivative of the Lagrangian with respect to the metric tensor. The relations of the axisymmetry and quasi-axisymmetry of the toroidal background magnetic field to a conservation form of the local momentum balance equation are clarified. In addition, an ensemble-averaged total momentum balance equation is shown to take the conservation form even in the background field with no symmetry when a constraint condition representing the macroscopic Amp\`{e}re's law is imposed on the background field. Using the WKB representation, the ensemble-averaged pressure tensor due to the microturbulence is expressed in detail and it is verified to reproduce the toroidal momentum transport derived in previous works for axisymmetric systems. The local momentum balance equation and the pressure tensor obtained in this work present a useful reference for elaborate gyrokinetic simulation studies of momentum transport processes.</description>

      <title>A Computational Model for Ion and Electron Energization during Macroscale Magnetic Reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14500v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A set of equations are developed that extend the macroscale magnetic reconnection simulation model kglobal to include particle ions. The extension from earlier versions of kglobal, which included only particle electrons, requires the inclusion of the inertia of particle ions in the fluid momentum equation, which was not required in the electron-only model. The new equations will facilitate the exploration of the simultaneous non-thermal energization of ions and electrons during magnetic reconnection in macroscale systems. Numerical tests of the propagation of Alfv\'en waves in a plasma with anisotropic electron and ion pressure are presented to benchmark the new model.</description>

      <title>Effects of Magnetic Helicity on 3D Equilibria and Self-Organized States in KTX Reversed Field Pinch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14604v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The RFP is a toroidal magnetic configuration in which plasmas can spontaneously transform into different self-organized states. Among various states, the QSH state has a dominant component for the magnetic field and significantly improves confinement. Many theoretical and experimental efforts have investigated the transitions among different states. This paper employs the MRxMHD model to study the properties of QSH and other states. The SPEC is used to compute MHD equilibria for the KTX. The toroidal volume of KTX is partitioned into two subvolumes by an internal transport barrier. The geometry of this barrier is adjusted to achieve force balance across the interface, ensuring that the plasma in each subvolume is force-free and that magnetic helicity is conserved. By varying the parameters, we generate distinct self-organized states in KTX. Our findings highlight the crucial role of magnetic helicity in shaping these states. In states with low magnetic helicity in both subvolumes, the plasma exhibits axisymmetric behavior. With increasing core helicity, the plasma gradually transforms from an axisymmetric state to a double-axis helical state and finally to a single-helical-axis state. Elevated core magnetic helicity leads to a more pronounced dominant mode of the boundary magnetic field and a reduced core magnetic shear. This is consistent with previous experimental and numerical results in other RFP devices. We find a linear relationship between the plasma current and helicity in different self-organized states. Our findings suggest that KTX may enter the QSH state when the toroidal current reaches 0.72 MA. This study demonstrates that the stellarator equilibrium code SPEC unveils crucial RFP equilibrium properties, rendering it applicable to a broad range of RFP devices and other toroidal configurations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15326v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we present a novel kind of energetic particle modes with frequencies in the range of thermal ion diamagnetic and/or transit frequencies in burning plasmas. It is shown that the continuum structure can be broken by the energetic particles. In addition, the mode destabilization does not require the energetic particle drive to overcome the continuum damping, which indicates that they are much easier to be excited and thus manifest themselves as wide-band modes. Based on the analysis, a switch or even an oscillation between phases of discrete eigenmodes and wide-band modes can be predicted.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.08072v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The nonresonant streaming instability (Bell instability) plays a pivotal role in the acceleration and confinement of cosmic rays (CRs); yet, the exact mechanism responsible for its saturation and the magnitude of the final amplified magnetic field have not been assessed from first-principles. Using a survey of hybrid simulations (with kinetic ions and fluid electrons), we study the evolution of the Bell instability as a function of the parameters of the CR population. We find that, at saturation, the magnetic pressure in the amplified field is comparable with the initial CR anisotropic pressure, rather than with the CR energy flux as previously argued. These results provide a predictive prescription for the total magnetic field amplification expected in the many astrophysical environments where the Bell instability is important.</description>

      <title>Electron and proton energization in 3D reconnecting current sheets in semirelativistic plasma with guide magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14290v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using 3D particle-in-cell simulation, we characterize energy conversion, as a function of guide magnetic field, in a thin current sheet in semirelativistic plasma, with relativistic electrons and subrelativistic protons. There, magnetic reconnection, the drift-kink instability (DKI), and the flux-rope kink instability all compete and interact in their nonlinear stages to convert magnetic energy to plasma energy. We compare fully 3D simulations with 2D in two different planes to isolate reconnection and DKI effects. In zero guide field, these processes yield distinct energy conversion signatures: ions gain more energy than electrons in 2Dxy (reconnection), while the opposite is true in 2Dyz (DKI), and the 3D result falls in between. The flux-rope instability, which occurs only in 3D, allows more magnetic energy to be released than in 2D, but the rate of energy conversion in 3D tends to be lower. Increasing the guide magnetic field strongly suppresses DKI, and in all cases slows and reduces the overall amount of energy conversion; it also favors electron energization through a process by which energy is first stored in the motional electric field of flux ropes before energizing particles. Understanding the evolution of the energy partition thus provides insight into the role of various plasma processes, and is important for modeling radiation from astrophysical sources such as accreting black holes and their jets.</description>
