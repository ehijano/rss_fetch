      <title>On the number of real zeroes of a homogeneous differential polynomial and a generalization of the Hawaii conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a given real polynomial $p$ we study the possible number of real roots of a differential polynomial $H_{\varkappa}[p](x) = \varkappa\left(p'(x)\right)^2-p(x)p''(x), \varkappa \in \mathbb{R}.$ In the special case when all real zeros of the polynomial $p$ are simple, and all roots of its derivative $p'$ are real and simple, the distribution of zeros of $H_{\varkappa}[p]$ is completely described for each real $\varkappa.$ We also provide counterexamples to two Boris Shapiro's conjectures about the number of zeros of the function $H_{\frac{n-1}{n}}[p].$</description>

      <title>Criteria for extension of commutativity to fractional iterates of holomorphic self-maps in the unit disc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\varphi$ be a univalent non-elliptic self-map of the unit disc $\mathbb D$ and let $(\psi_{t})$ be a continuous one-parameter semigroup of holomorphic functions in $\mathbb D$ such that $\psi_{1}\neq\mathrm{id}_{\mathbb D}$ commutes with $\varphi$. This assumption does not imply that all elements of the semigroup $(\psi_t)$ commute with $\varphi$. In this paper, we provide a number of sufficient conditions that guarantee that ${\psi_t\circ\varphi=\varphi\circ\psi_t}$ for all ${t&gt;0}$: this holds, for example, if $\varphi$ and $\psi_1$ have a common boundary (regular or irregular) fixed point different from their common Denjoy-Wolff point $\tau$, or when $\psi_1$ has a boundary regular fixed point ${\sigma\neq\tau}$ at which $\varphi$ is isogonal, or when $(\varphi-\mathrm{id}_{\mathbb D})/(\psi_1-\mathrm{id}_{\mathbb D})$ has an unrestricted limit at $\tau$. In addition, we analyze how $\varphi$ behaves in the petals of the semigroup $(\psi_t)$.</description>

      <title>Non-existence of a holomorphic imbedding of the Sobolev loop space into the Hilbert projective space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to understand the properties of meromorphic mappings with values in two model complex Hibert manifolds: Hilbert projective space $\pp(l^2)$ and Sobolev loop space of the Riemann sphere $L\pp^1$. It occurs that these properties are quite different. Based on our study we obtain as a corollary that $L\pp^1$ does not admit a closed holomorphic imbedding to $\pp(l^2)$. In other words $L\pp^1$ is {\slsf not} a Hilbert projective variety despite of the fact that it is K\"ahler and meromorphic functions separate points on it.</description>

      <title>Volume forms on balanced manifolds and the Calabi-Yau equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the space of mixed-volume forms on a balanced manifold endowed with an $L^2$ metric. A geodesic equation can be derived in this space that has an interesting structure and extends the equation of Donaldson and Chen-He in the space of volume forms on a Riemannian manifold. This nonlinear PDE is studied in detail and the existence of weak solution is shown for the Dirichlet problem, under a positivity assumption. Later we study the Calabi-Yau equation for balanced metrics and introduce a geometric criteria for prescribing volume forms that is closely related to the positivity assumption above. By deriving $C^0$ a priori estimates, we show that the existence of solutions can be established under this assumption</description>

      <title>Volumes of Bott-Chern classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the volumes of transcendental and possibly non-closed Bott-Chern $(1,1)$-classes on an arbitrary compact complex manifold $X$. We show that the latter belongs to the class $\mathcal{C}$ of Fujiki if and only if it has the $\textit{bounded mass property}$ -- i.e., its Monge-Amp\`ere volumes have a uniform upper-bound -- and there exists a closed Bott-Chern class with positive volume. This yields a positive answer to a conjecture of Demailly-P\u{a}un-Boucksom. To this end we extend to the hermitian context the notion of non-pluripolar products of currents, allowing for the latter to be merely ${\it quasi}$-${\it closed}$ and ${\it quasi}$-${\it positive}$. We establish a quasi-monotonicity property of Monge-Amp\`ere masses, and moreover show the existence of solutions to degenerate complex Monge-Amp\`ere equations in big classes, together with uniform a priori estimates. This extends to the hermitian context fundamental results of Boucksom-Eyssidieux-Guedj-Zeriahi.</description>

      <title>Approximation of plurisubharmonic functions by logarithms of Gaussian analytic functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11833v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\Omega$ be a bounded pseudoconvex domain in $\mathbb{C}^N$. Given a continuous plurisubharmonic function $u$ on $\Omega$, we construct a sequence of Gaussian analytic functions $f_n$ on $\Omega$ associated with $u$ such that $\frac{1}{n}\log|f_n|$ converges to $u$ in $L^1_{loc}(\Omega)$ almost surely, as $n\rightarrow\infty$. Gaussian analytic function $f_n$ is constructed by its covariance, or equivalently by its reproducing kernel Hilbert space, which is given by weighed Bergman space with weight $e^{-2nu}$ with respect to the Lebesgue measure. We show the normalized zeros of $f_n$ converge to $dd^c u$ in the sense of currents.</description>

      <title>Integral means spectrum functionals on Teichmuller spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07683v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce and study the integral means spectrum (IMS) functionals on Teichmuller spaces. We show that the IMS functionals on the closure of the universal Teichmuller space and on the asymptotic universal Teichmuller space are both continuous. During the proof, we obtain some new results about the universal asymptotic Teichmuller space.</description>

      <title>K\"ahler families of Green's functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17232v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a remarkable series of works, Guo, Phong, Song, and Sturm have obtained key uniform estimates for the Green's functions associated with certain K\"ahler metrics. In this note, we broaden the scope of their techniques by removing one of their assumptions and allowing the complex structure to vary. We apply our results to various families of canonical K\"ahler metrics.</description>

      <title>Fano varieties with large pseudoindex and non-free rational curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.03438v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For $n\geq 4$, let $X$ be a complex smooth Fano $n$-fold whose minimal anticanonical degree of non-free rational curves on $X$ is at least $n-2$. We classify extremal contractions of such varieties. As an application, we obtain a classification of Fano fourfolds with pseudoindex and Picard number greater than one. Combining this result with previous results, we complete the classification of smooth Fano $n$-folds with pseudoindex at least $n-2$ and Picard number greater than one. This can be seen as a generalization of various previous results. We also discuss the relations between pseudoindex and other invariants of Fano varieties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14958v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a cohomology $(1,1)$-class $\{\beta\}$ of compact Hermitian manifold $(X,\omega)$ possessing a bounded potential and fixed a model potential $\phi$, motivated by Darvas-Di Nezza-Lu and Li-Wang-Zhou's work, we show that degenerate complex Monge-Amp\`ere equation $(\beta+dd^c \varphi)^n=e^{\lambda \varphi}\mu$ has a unique solution in the relative full mass class $\mathcal{E}(X,\beta,\phi)$, where $\mu$ is a non-pluripolar measure on $X$ and $\lambda\geq0$ is a fixed constant.
  As an application, we give an explicit description of Lelong numbers of elements in $\mathcal{E}(X,\beta,\phi)$ which generalized a theorem of Darvas-Di Nezza-Lu in the Hermitian context.</description>

      <title>The spectral genus of an isolated hypersurface singularity and a conjecture relating to the Milnor number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03450v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the notion of spectral genus $\widetilde{p}_{g}$ of a germ of an isolated hypersurface singularity $(\mathbb{C}^{n+1}, 0) \to (\mathbb{C}, 0)$, defined as a sum of small exponents of monodromy eigenvalues. The number of these is equal to the geometric genus $p_{g}$, and hence $\widetilde{p}_g$ can be considered as a secondary invariant to it. We then explore a secondary version of the Durfee conjecture on $p_{g}$, and we predict an inequality between $\widetilde{p}_{g}$ and the Milnor number $\mu$, to the effect that $$\widetilde{p}_g\leq\frac{\mu-1}{(n+2)!}.$$ We provide evidence by confirming our conjecture in several cases, including homogeneous singularities and singularities with large Newton polyhedra, and quasi-homogeneous or irreducible curve singularities. We also show that a weaker inequality follows from Durfee's conjecture, and hence holds for quasi-homogeneous singularities and curve singularities.
  Our conjecture is shown to relate closely to the asymptotic behavior of the holomorphic analytic torsion of the sheaf of holomorphic functions on a degeneration of projective varieties, potentially indicating deeper geometric and analytic connections.</description>

      <title>Contractive representations of odometer semigroup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14157v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a natural number $n \geq 1$, the odometer semigroup $O_n$, also known as the adding machine or the Baumslag-Solitar monoid with two generators, is a well-known object in group theory. This paper examines the odometer semigroup in relation to representations of bounded linear operators. We focus on noncommutative operators and prove that contractive representations of $O_n$ always admit to nicer representations of $O_n$. We give a complete description of representations of $O_n$ on the Fock space and relate it to the odometer lifting and subrepresentations of $O_n$. Along the way, we also classify Nica covariant representations of $O_n$.</description>
