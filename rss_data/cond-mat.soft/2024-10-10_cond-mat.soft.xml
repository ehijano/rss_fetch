      <title>Effect of Grafting Density on the Two-dimensional Assembly of Nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Employing grazing-incidence small-angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS) and X-ray reflectivity (XRR), we demonstrate that films composed of polyethylene glycol (PEG)-grafted silver nanoparticles (AgNP) and gold nanoparticles (AuNP), as well as their binary mixtures, form highly stable hexagonal structures at the vapor-liquid interface. These nanoparticles exhibit remarkable stability under varying environmental conditions, including changes in pH, mixing concentration, and PEG chain length. Short-chain PEG grafting produces dense, well-ordered films, while longer chains produce more complex, less dense quasi-bilayer structures. AuNPs exhibit higher grafting densities than AgNPs, leading to more ordered in-plane arrangements. In binary mixtures, AuNPs dominate the population at the surface, while AgNPs integrate into the system, expanding the lattice without forming a distinct binary superstructure. These results offer valuable insights into the structural behavior of PEG-grafted nanoparticles and provide a foundation for optimizing binary nanoparticle assemblies for advanced nanotechnology applications.</description>

      <title>Light tuning of selective Bragg diffraction of the oblique helicoidal cholesteric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that the oblique helicoidal cholesteric structure (Ch$_{OH}$), which is formed in alternating electrical field applied to the chiral nematic phase (N*) at temperatures above the chiral twist-bend nematic phase (N*$_{tb}$), can show selective Bragg reflection in the visible range of spectrum. In this work, we study the effects of AC electric field at different frequencies, as well as UV irradiation on the Bragg reflection of Ch$_{OH}$ structure of the N*$_{tb}$-forming mixture containing a light sensitive chiral azo-compound. It has been found that Ch$_{OH}$ structure shows two sequential states in the tuning of selective Bragg reflection at high and low electrical fields.</description>

      <title>Active noise-induced dynamic clustering of passive colloids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05555v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active fluids generate spontaneous, often chaotic mesoscale flows. Harnessing these flows to drive embedded soft materials into structures with controlled length scales and lifetimes is a key challenge at the interface between the fields of active matter and nonequilibrium self-assembly. Here, we present a simple and highly efficient computational approach to model soft materials advected by active fluids, by simulating particles moving in a spatiotemporally correlated noise field. The algorithm enables orders of magnitude speed up in comparison to other methods. To illustrate our approach, we simulate the dynamical self-organization of repulsive colloids within such an active noise field in two and three dimensions. The colloids form structures whose sizes and dynamics can be tuned by the correlation time and length of the active fluid, and range from small rotating droplets to clusters with internal flows and system-spanning sizes that vastly exceed the active correlation length. Our results elucidate how the interplay between active fluid time/length scales and emergent driven assembly can be used to rationally design functional assemblies. More broadly, our approach can be used to efficiently simulate diverse active fluids and other systems with spatiotemporally correlated noise.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Inversion from Scattering for Mechanically Driven Polymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a Machine Learning Inversion method for analyzing scattering functions of mechanically driven polymers and extracting the corresponding feature parameters, which include energy parameters and conformation variables. The polymer is modeled as a chain of fixed-length bonds constrained by bending energy, and it is subject to external forces such as stretching and shear. We generate a data set consisting of random combinations of energy parameters, including bending modulus, stretching, and shear force, along with Monte Carlo-calculated scattering functions and conformation variables such as end-to-end distance, radius of gyration, and the off-diagonal component of the gyration tensor. The effects of the energy parameters on the polymer are captured by the scattering function, and principal component analysis ensures the feasibility of the Machine Learning inversion. Finally, we train a Gaussian Process Regressor using part of the data set as a training set and validate the trained regressor for inversion using the rest of the data. The regressor successfully extracts the feature parameters.</description>

      <title>Microscopic Mechanisms of Diffusion Dynamics: A Comparative Efficiency Study of Event-Chain Monte Carlo Variants in Dense Hard Disk Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In molecular simulations, efficient methods for investigating equilibration and slow relaxation in dense systems are crucial yet challenging. This study focuses on the diffusional characteristics of monodisperse hard disk systems at equilibrium, comparing novel methodologies of event-chain Monte Carlo variants, specifically the Newtonian event-chain and straight event-chain algorithms. We systematically analyze both event-based and CPU time-based efficiency in liquid and solid phases, aiming to elucidate the microscopic mechanisms underlying structural relaxation. Our results demonstrate how chain length or duration, system size, and phase state influence the efficiency of diffusion dynamics, including hopping motion. This work provides insights into optimizing simulation techniques for highly packed systems and has the potential to improve our understanding of diffusion dynamics even in complex many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Swelling and evaporation determine surface morphology of grafted hydrogel thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally study the formation of surface patterns in grafted hydrogel films of nanometer-to-micrometer thicknesses during imbibition-driven swelling followed by evaporation-driven shrinking. Creases are known to form at the hydrogel surface during swelling; the wavelength of the creasing pattern is proportional to the initial thickness of the hydrogel film with a logarithmic correction that depends on microscopic properties of the hydrogel. We find that, although the characteristic wavelength of the pattern is determined during swelling, the surface morphology can be significantly influenced by evaporation-induced shrinking. We observe that the elastocapillary length based on swollen mechanical properties gives a threshold thickness for a surface pattern formation, and consequently an important change in morphology.</description>

      <title>Fluid flow in 3-dimensional porous systems shows power law scaling with Minkowski functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integral geometry uses four geometric invariants -- the Minkowski functionals -- to characterize certain subsets of 3-dimensional space. The question was, how is the fluid flow in a 3-dimensional porous system related to these invariants? In this work, we systematically study the dependency of permeability on the geometrical characteristics of two categories of 3-dimensional porous systems generated: (i) stochastic and (ii) deterministic. For the stochastic systems, we investigated both normal and log-normal size distribution of grains. For the deterministic porous systems, we checked for a cubic and a hexagonal arrangement of grains of equal size. Our studies reveal that for any 3-dimensional porous system, ordered or disordered, permeability $k$ follows a unique scaling relation with the Minkowski functionals: (a) volume of the pore space, (b) integral mean curvature, (c) Euler Characteristic and (d) critical cross-sectional area of the pore space. The cubic and the hexagonal symmetrical systems formed the upper and lower bounds of the scaling relations, respectively. The disordered systems lay between these bounds. Moreover, we propose a combinatoric $F$ that weaves together the four Minkowski functionals and follows a power-law scaling with permeability. The scaling exponent is independent of particle size and distribution and has a universal value of $ 0.428$ for 3-dimensional porous systems built of spherical grains.</description>

      <title>Stability of diverse dodecagonal quasicrystals in T-shaped liquid crystalline molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06048v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasicrystals are intriguing ordered structures characterized by the lack of translational symmetry and the existence of rotational symmetry. The tiling of different geometric units such as triangles and squares in two-dimensional space can result in a great variety of quasicrystals that could be realized by the self-assembly of liquid crystalline molecules. In this study, we introduce three self-similar dodecagonal tilings, including a novel Diamond-Square-Triangle pattern, composed of triangular and quadrangular tiles and examine their thermodynamic stability by using the self-consistent field theory applied to T-shaped liquid crystalline molecules. Specifically, we detail the inflation rules for the construction of these dodecagonal tilings and analyze their self-similarity, and show that these tilings can be viewed as projections of higher-dimensional periodic lattice points with projection windows. Using these dodecagonal tilings as initial configurations of the SCFT results in solutions corresponding to quasicrystals that could form from the T-shaped liquid crystalline molecules. The relative stability of these aperiodic phases is analyzed to obtain design rules that could stabilize quasicrystals. Meanwhile, we provide two criteria for distinguishing three dodecagonal quasicrystals and their approximants by analyzing their diffraction peaks. These findings shed new lighten on the discovery of new quasicrystals in soft materials.</description>

      <title>Biomimetic Swarm of Active Particles with Coupled Passive-Active Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the universal behavior of a class of active colloids whose design is inspired by the collective dynamics of natural systems like schools of fish and flocks of birds. These colloids, with off-center repulsive interaction sites, self-organize into polar swarms exhibiting long-range order and directional motion without significant hydrodynamic interactions. Our simulations show that the system transitions from motile perfect crystals to solid-like, liquid-like and gas-like states depending on noise levels, repulsive interaction strength, and particle density. By analyzing swarm polarity and hexatic bond order parameters, we demonstrate that effective volume fractions based on force-range and torque-range interactions explain the system's universal behavior. This work lays a groundwork for biomimetic applications utilizing the cooperative dynamics of active colloids.</description>

      <title>Dual photoisomerization mechanism of azobenzene embedded in a lipid membrane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The photoisomerization of chromophores embedded in biological environments is of high importance for biomedical applications, but it is still challenging to define the photoisomerization mechanism both experimentally and computationally. We present here a computational study of the azobenzene molecule embedded in a DPPC lipid membrane, and assess the photoisomerization mechanism by means of the quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics surface hopping (QM/MM-SH) method. We observe that while the trans-to-cis isomerization is a slow process governed by a torsional mechanism due to the strong interaction with the environment, the cis-to-trans mechanism is completed in sub-ps time scale and is governed by a pedal-like mechanism in which both weaker interactions with the environment and a different geometry of the potential energy surface play a key role.</description>

      <title>Deformation of hydrogel during freezing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conducted experiments to directionally freeze agar hydrogel drops with different polymer concentrations, on a copper substrate maintained at low temperature. Unlike the water droplet studied in the literature, where the liquid part can reorganize during freezing, our droplets show a distinct deformation. This is due to the presence of the viscoelastic solid polymer matrix, which prevents deformation of the unfrozen part, leading mainly to elongation in the direction of the temperature gradient. We then derive a model describing this deformation. It assumes a flat freezing front, a change in volume at the front resulting from the Stefan condition, and a remaining volume to be frozen identical in shape to the initial one. The latter is in good agreement with experimental observations as long as water fluxes in the porous hydrogel remain negligible. It is also conclusive for different object shapes, as the hydrogel can be freely molded without a container.</description>

      <title>Precisely controlled colloids: A playground for path-wise non-equilibrium physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate path-wise observables in experiments on driven colloids in a periodic optical field to dissect selected intricate transport features, kinetics, and transition-path time statistics out of thermodynamic equilibrium. These observables directly reflect the properties of individual paths in contrast to the properties of an ensemble of particles, such as radial distribution functions or mean-squared displacements. In particular, we present two distinct albeit equivalent formulations of the underlying stochastic equation of motion, highlight their respective practical relevance, and show how to interchange between them. We discuss conceptually different notions of local velocities and interrogate one- and two-sided first-passage and transition-path-time statistics in and out of equilibrium. We emphasize how path-wise observables may be employed to systematically assess the quality of experimental data and demonstrate that, given sufficient control and sampling, one may quantitatively verify subtle theoretical predictions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experimental realizations of liquid-liquid phase separation of active liquid crystals have offered an insight into the interaction between phase separation, ubiquitous in soft matter and biology, and chaotic active flows. In this Letter, we use continuum theory to examine phase separation of an active liquid crystal and a passive fluid and report two new results. First, we provide an analytical derivation of the activity-induced suppression of the phase boundary of the coexistence region - a result first reported in simulations and experiments. We show that the shift in the critical point is a result of the balance between self-stirring active flows and phase-separating diffusive fluxes. Second, we show that this same balance is responsible for dramatically changing the morphology of the phase separated state, resulting in the emergence of a new mixed active phase consisting of a dynamical filamentous active network that invades the entire system area, trapping droplets of passive material. This structure exists even for very low volume fractions of active material. Our work provides an important step towards the goal of understanding how to use activity as a new handle for sculpting interfaces.</description>

      <title>Jamming the Random Lorentz Gas: Configurational Entropy, Crunching Geometry, and Critical Universality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deterministic optimization algorithms unequivocally partition a complex energy landscape in inherent structures (ISs) and their respective basins of attraction. But can these basins be defined solely through geometric principles? This question is particularly important when examining the jamming of hard spheres. We here consider this issue by proposing a geometric class of gradient descent-like algorithms, which we use to study a system in the hard-sphere universality class, the random Lorentz gas. The statistics of the resulting IS is found to be strictly inherited from those of Poisson-Voronoi tessellations. The landscape roughness is further found to give rise to a hierarchical organization of ISs which various algorithms explore differently. In particular, greedy and reluctant schemes tend to favor ISs of markedly different densities. The resulting ISs nevertheless robustly exhibit a universal force distribution, thus confirming the geometric nature of the jamming universality class.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Run-and-tumble particles confined between two walls seem like a simple enough problem to possess analytical tractability. Yet up to date, no satisfactory analysis is available for dimensions higher than one. This work contributes to the theoretical understanding of this system by reinterpreting it as a splitting probability problem. Such reinterpretation permits us to formulate the problem as the integral equation, rather than a more standard differential equation based on the Fokker-Planck equation. In addition to providing an analogy with another phenomenon, the reinterpretation permits a new type of analysis, yields useful results, and offers some analytical tractability.</description>

Abstract: Two dimensional (2D) crystals have attracted strong interest as a new class of proton conducting materials that can block atoms, molecules and ions while allowing proton transport through the atomically thin basal planes. Although 2D materials exhibit this perfect selectivity, the reported proton conductivities have been relatively low. Here we show that vacancy-rich titania monolayers are highly permeable to protons while remaining impermeable to helium with proton conductivity exceeding 100 S cm-2 at 200 C and surpassing targets set by industry roadmaps. The fast and selective proton transport is attributed to an extremely high density of titanium-atom vacancies (one per square nm), which effectively turns titania monolayers into angstrom-scale sieves. Our findings highlight the potential of 2D oxides as membrane materials for hydrogen-based technologies.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Face-Dependent Ice Growth Kinetics: Insights from Molecular Dynamics on the Basal and Prism Surfaces</title>

Abstract: Ice nucleation and growth are critical in many fields, including atmospheric science, cryobiology, and aviation. However, understanding the detailed mechanisms of ice crystal growth remains challenging. In this work, crystallization at the ice/quasi-liquid layer (QLL) interface of the basal and primary prism (prism1) surfaces of hexagonal ice (Ih) was investigated using molecular dynamics simulations across a wide range of temperatures for the TIP4P/Ice model, with comparisons to the mW coarse-grained model. Together with elucidating the temperature-dependent mechanisms of crystallization, face-specific growth rates were systematically estimated. While the prism surface generally exhibits faster growth rates than the basal surface, a temperature-dependent crossover in growth rates between the basal and prism surfaces is observed in TIP4P/Ice simulations, which correlates with a crossover in QLL thickness and with the well-known column to platelets transition in ice-crystal habits at low vapour pressure. This observation helps decode the complex dependence between crystal morphology and temperature in ice crystals.</description>

      <title>Seasonal footprints on ecological time series and jumps in dynamic states of protein configurations from a non-linear forecasting method characterization</title>

Abstract: We have analyzed phenology data and jumps in protein configurations with the non-linear forecasting method proposed by May and Sugihara \cite{MS90}. Full plots of prediction quality as a function of dimensionality and forecasting time give fast and valuable information about Complex Systems dynamics. At the end of this second version of this manuscript we added another figure in which we consider the stationarity of the phenology data and include some additional comments regarding dimensionality.</description>

      <title>Why gauge invariance applies to statistical mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14166v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give an introductory account of the recently identified gauge invariance of the equilibrium statistical mechanics of classical many-body systems [J. M\"uller et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. (to appear) arXiv:2406.19235]. The gauge transformation is a non-commutative shifting operation on phase space that keeps the differential phase space volume element and hence the Gibbs integration measure conserved. When thermally averaged any observable is an invariant, including thermodynamic and structural quantities. Shifting transformations are canonical in the sense of classical mechanics. They also form an infinite-dimensional group with generators of infinitesimal transformations that build a non-commutative Lie algebra. We lay out the connections with the underlying geometry of coordinate displacement and with Noether's theorem. Spatial localization of the shifting yields differential operators that satisfy commutator relationships, which we describe both in purely configurational and in full phase space setups. Standard operator calculus yields corresponding equilibrium hyperforce correlation sum rules for general observables and order parameters. Using Monte Carlos simulations we demonstrate explicitly the gauge invariance for finite shifting. We argue in favour of using the gauge invariance as a statistical mechanical construction principle for obtaining exact results and for formulating smart sampling algorithms.</description>
