      <title>Multi-task parallelism for robust pre-training of graph foundation models on multi-source, multi-fidelity atomistic modeling data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph foundation models using graph neural networks promise sustainable, efficient atomistic modeling. To tackle challenges of processing multi-source, multi-fidelity data during pre-training, recent studies employ multi-task learning, in which shared message passing layers initially process input atomistic structures regardless of source, then route them to multiple decoding heads that predict data-specific outputs. This approach stabilizes pre-training and enhances a model's transferability to unexplored chemical regions. Preliminary results on approximately four million structures are encouraging, yet questions remain about generalizability to larger, more diverse datasets and scalability on supercomputers. We propose a multi-task parallelism method that distributes each head across computing resources with GPU acceleration. Implemented in the open-source HydraGNN architecture, our method was trained on over 24 million structures from five datasets and tested on the Perlmutter, Aurora, and Frontier supercomputers, demonstrating efficient scaling on all three highly heterogeneous super-computing architectures.</description>

      <title>Implementation and representation of qudit multi-controlled unitaries and hypergraph states by many-body angular momentum couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a representation of qudit multi-controlled unitary operators in terms of many-body angular momentum interactions. The representation is particularly convenient for odd-dimensional systems, with interesting connections to the Pegg-Barnett phase formalism. We illustrate the main points in the special case of qutrits, where simplifications and connections to dipole-quadrupole and quadrupole-quadrupole interactions can be established. We describe the representation of the closely related set of qudit hypergraph states, identifying possible realizations and their main obstacles. Qutrit tripartite controlled unitaries are decomposed in terms of more familiar two-body angular momentum couplings, enabling their implementation in a variety of physical systems. We give then a concrete example of implementation of qutrit unitaries and hypergraph states in optical systems that employs single-photon sources, two-mode cross-Kerr interactions and linear optical operations. Moreover, we define a new set of states, called angular momentum hypergraph states, which are more directly related to the angular momentum representation.</description>

      <title>Complete insensitivity to ab initio data -- A new perspective on modeling collision-induced absorption of noble gas atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we systematically investigate how the accuracy of CIA spectra depends on the quality of the ab initio data used. We evaluate quantitatively the impact of different quantum chemical methods and basis sets on spectral features, finding that even the lowest-level calculations are accurate to approximately 10 % at room temperature, and better at higher temperatures. This study also reveals a previously unreported double-peak structure for the He-Ne complex, which cannot be described by simple but commonly used single-exponential models for the short-range dipole. Our analysis shows that the range of internuclear distances relevant for CIA spectra varies with temperature, with short-range interactions becoming increasingly important at high temperatures. The long-range van der Waals induced dipoles never contribute. These findings provide new insights into the temperature-dependent behavior of CIA spectra and emphasize the importance of accurate modeling of short-range interactions for reliable astronomical modeling.</description>
