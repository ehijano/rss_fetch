      <title>Eight-Dimensional Symplectic Nilpotent Lie Groups with Lagrangian Normal Subgroups: A Complete Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate symplectic nilpotent Lie groups with Lagrangian normal subgroups. We show that there exists a bijection between the isomorphism classes of nilpotent Lie groups with Lagrangian normal subgroups and the isomorphism classes of geodesically complete, flat, nilpotent Lie groups with Lagrangian extension cohomology class. Finally, we provide a complete classification of eight-dimensional symplectic nilpotent Lie groups with Lagrangian normal subgroups, identifying exactly ninety-five such groups. As a consequence, we obtain a complete classification of eight-dimensional symplectic filiform real Lie groups.</description>

      <title>Exploration of vertical self-resonant bifurcations from DRO in the Earth-Moon CR3BP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to investigate vertical self-resonant (VSR) bifurcations from distant retrograde orbit (DRO) family in the framework of the Earth-Moon CR3BP. To this end, by using a classical corrector-predictor algorithm we compute the vertical stability of DROs and identify twelve vertical-critical DROs. We split them into three groups according to orbiting around libration points $L_i$, $i=1,2,4,5$. (i) We first analyze six VSR bifurcations of multiplicity from five to ten associated to DROs near the Moon. (ii) For DROs that move in addition around $L_1$ and $L_2$, we study four VSR bifurcations of multiplicity from five to eight. (iii) Within DROs additionally orbiting also around $L_4$ and $L_5$, two vertical 1:1 resonant branch points occur. In total, we generate 21 bifurcated families of spatial symmetric periodic solutions and present their orbital characteristics, including bridge families to Butterfly, prograde orbits, quasi DRO and DRO. We also obtain branches whose members approach collision with the Moon and are of Bumble Bee, Hoverfly or Dragonfly shape. In order to provide a structured and systematic overview of such bifurcation results, we determine Conley-Zehnder indices and construct bifurcation diagrams in view of symplectic invariants.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian actions on 0-shifted cosymplectic groupoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of 0-shifted cosymplectic structure on differentiable stacks and develop a corresponding moment map theory for Hamiltonian cosymplectic actions. We present a reduction procedure, establish a version of the Kirwan convexity theorem, and obtain examples of Morse-Bott Lie groupoid morphisms.</description>

      <title>Pre-Lagrangian tori transverse to an Anosov flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An Anosov flow on a smooth three-manifold \( M \) gives rise to a Liouville structure on \( \mathbb{R} \times M \) by a construction of Mitsumatsu. In a recent paper, Cieliebak, Lazarev, Massoni and Moreno ask whether an embedded torus \( \Sigma \subseteq M \) transverse to an Anosov flow gives rise to a Lagrangian in \( \mathbb{R} \times M \). We show that the answer to this question is in general negative by finding a topological obstruction related to the foliations induced on the torus by the weak stable and unstable bundles of the flow. Going in the opposite direction, we show that the answer is positive if the induced foliations do not admit parallel compact leaves.</description>

      <title>Integral points and volume of integral-integral affine manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give an elementary proof that, for a closed manifold with an integral-integral affine structure, its total volume and number of integral points coincide. This theorem was previously shown to be equivalent to the "independence of polarization" phenomenon of geometric quantization. The proof uses rational Ehrhart theory and elementary Fourier analysis to estimate the difference between the total volume and the number of integral points.</description>

      <title>Special Lagrangian sections and stability conditions on threefolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a class of Lagrangian submanifolds, given by sections of a special Lagrangian fibration, contained in certain almost Calabi-Yau threefolds (mirrors of polarised toric threefolds satisfying suitable assumptions). We show that, for a Lagrangian section $L$ in this class, the shift $L[2]$ defines an object in the heart of a natural Bridgeland stability condition on the relevant Fukaya-Seidel category, and that if $L[2]$ is semistable with respect to this stability condition, then it is isomorphic to a special Lagrangian. For mirrors of weak Fanos, the central charge of the stability condition is very close to periods of the holomorphic volume form. These results are consistent with Joyce's interpretation of the Thomas-Yau conjecture. As part of the proof we describe a set of line bundles and polarisations on suitable toric threefolds for which semistability with respect to the Bridgeland stability conditions constructed by Bernardara-Macr\`i-Schmidt-Zhao implies the existence of a deformed Hermitian Yang-Mills connection.</description>

      <title>Fourier analysis of equivariant quantum cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18849v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Equivariant quantum cohomology possesses the structure of a difference module by shift operators (Seidel representation) of equivariant parameters. Teleman's conjecture suggests that shift operators and equivariant parameters acting on QH_T(X) should be identified, respectively, with the Novikov variables and the quantum connection of the GIT quotient X//T. This can be interpreted as a form of Fourier duality between equivariant quantum cohomology (D-module) of X and quantum cohomology (D-module) of the GIT quotient X//T.
  We introduce the notion of "quantum volume," derived from Givental's path integral over the Floer fundamental cycle, and present a conjectural Fourier duality relationship between the T-equivariant quantum volume of X and the quantum volume of X//T. We also explore the "reduction conjecture," developed in collaboration with Fumihiko Sanda, which expresses the I-function of X//T as a discrete Fourier transform of the equivariant J-function of X. Furthermore, we demonstrate how to use Fourier analysis of equivariant quantum cohomology to observe toric mirror symmetry and prove a decomposition of quantum cohomology D-modules of projective bundles or blowups.</description>
