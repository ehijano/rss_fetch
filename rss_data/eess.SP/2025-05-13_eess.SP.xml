      <title>Near-Field Beamfocusing, Localization, and Channel Estimation with Modular Linear Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates how near-field beamfocusing can be achieved using a modular linear array (MLA), composed of multiple widely spaced uniform linear arrays (ULAs). The MLA architecture extends the aperture length of a standard ULA without adding additional antennas, thereby enabling near-field beamfocusing without increasing processing complexity. Unlike conventional far-field beamforming, near-field beamfocusing enables simultaneous data transmission to multiple users at different distances in the same angular interval, offering significant multiplexing gains. We present a detailed mathematical analysis of the beamwidth and beamdepth achievable with the MLA and show that by appropriately selecting the number of antennas in each constituent ULA, ideal near-field beamfocusing can be realized. In addition, we propose a computationally efficient localization method that fuses estimates from each ULA, enabling efficient parametric channel estimation. Simulation results confirm the accuracy of the analytical expressions and that MLAs achieve near-field beamfocusing with a limited number of antennas, making them a promising solution for next-generation wireless systems.</description>

      <title>Statistical CSI-Based Distributed Precoding Design for OFDM-Cooperative Multi-Satellite Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the design of distributed precoding for multi-satellite massive MIMO transmissions. We first conduct a detailed analysis of the transceiver model, in which delay and Doppler precompensation is introduced to ensure coherent transmission. In this analysis, we examine the impact of precompensation errors on the transmission model, emphasize the near-independence of inter-satellite interference, and ultimately derive the received signal model. Based on such signal model, we formulate an approximate expected rate maximization problem that considers both statistical channel state information (sCSI) and compensation errors. Unlike conventional approaches that recast such problems as weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE) minimization, we demonstrate that this transformation fails to maintain equivalence in the considered scenario. To address this, we introduce an equivalent covariance decomposition-based WMMSE (CDWMMSE) formulation derived based on channel covariance matrix decomposition. Taking advantage of the channel characteristics, we develop a low-complexity decomposition method and propose an optimization algorithm. To further reduce computational complexity, we introduce a model-driven scalable deep learning (DL) approach that leverages the equivariance of the mapping from sCSI to the unknown variables in the optimal closed-form solution, enhancing performance through novel dense Transformer network and scaling-invariant loss function design. Simulation results validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method in some practical scenarios. We also demonstrate that the DL approach can adapt to dynamic settings with varying numbers of users and satellites.</description>

      <title>Zak-OTFS for Spread Spectrum Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An attractive feature of spread spectrum technologies such as code division multiple access (CDMA) is that it is harder to intercept or jam signals, and this feature was lost when orthogonal frequency domain modulation prevailed over CDMA in wireless standards. Legacy spread carrier waveforms are not matched to delay and Doppler shifts characteristic of 6G wireless environments, and this makes equalization very challenging. Zak-OTFS modulation is a communication framework that parameterizes the wireless channel in the delay-Doppler (DD) domain, where the parameters map directly to physical attributes of the scatterers that comprise the scattering environment. Hence, the channel can be efficiently acquired and equalized. The Zak-OTFS carrier is a pulse in the DD domain, and the Zak transform converts it to a pulse train modulated by a tone (pulsone) in the time domain. The pulsone waveform is localized rather than spread, and it suffers from high PAPR. We describe how to transform Zak-OTFS into a spread spectrum communication system, where the spread carrier waveforms have low PAPR and are matched to the delay and Doppler characteristics of the wireless channel. This transformation is realized by a unitary transform that is a generalization of the discrete affine Fourier transform. The transform maps a pulsone to a time domain waveform which yields a CAZAC sequence after sampling. The family of CAZAC sequences includes the Zadoff-Chu sequences incorporated in LTE and 5G-NR standards. We describe the end-to-end time-domain transceiver signal processing, comprising channel estimation and data demodulation, for the proposed system. We quantify system performance through BER simulations using a six-path Veh-A channel model, showing that the proposed system achieves similar uncoded BER as pulsone-based Zak-OTFS, where the PAPR of each spread carrier waveform is only 3.58 dB.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis of Cooperative Integrated Sensing and Communications for 6G Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we aim to effectively characterize the performance of cooperative integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) networks and to reveal how performance metrics relate to network parameters. To this end, we introduce a generalized stochastic geometry framework to model the cooperative ISAC networks, which approximates the spatial randomness of the network deployment. Based on this framework, we derive analytical expressions for key performance metrics in both communication and sensing domains, with a particular focus on communication coverage probability and radar information rate. The analytical expressions derived explicitly highlight how performance metrics depend on network parameters, thereby offering valuable insights into the deployment and design of cooperative ISAC networks. In the end, we validate the theoretical performance analysis through Monte Carlo simulation results. Our results demonstrate that increasing the number of cooperative base stations (BSs) significantly improves both metrics, while increasing the BS deployment density has a limited impact on communication coverage probability but substantially enhances the radar information rate. Additionally, increasing the number of transmit antennas is effective when the total number of transmit antennas is relatively small. The incremental performance gain reduces with the increase of the number of transmit antennas, suggesting that indiscriminately increasing antennas is not an efficient strategy to improve the performance of the system in cooperative ISAC networks.</description>

      <title>N$^2$LoS: Single-Tag mmWave Backscatter for Robust Non-Line-of-Sight Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accuracy of traditional localization methods significantly degrades when the direct path between the wireless transmitter and the target is blocked or non-penetrable. This paper proposes N2LoS, a novel approach for precise non-line-of-sight (NLoS) localization using a single mmWave radar and a backscatter tag. N2LoS leverages multipath reflections from both the tag and surrounding reflectors to accurately estimate the targets position. N2LoS introduces several key innovations. First, we design HFD (Hybrid Frequency-Hopping and Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum) to detect and differentiate reflectors from the target. Second, we enhance signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by exploiting the correlation properties of the designed signals, improving detection robustness in complex environments. Third, we propose FS-MUSIC (Frequency-Spatial Multiple Signal Classification), a super resolution algorithm that extends the traditional MUSIC method by constructing a higher-rank signal matrix, enabling the resolution of additional multipath components. We evaluate N2LoS using a 24 GHz mmWave radar with 250 MHz bandwidth in three diverse environments: a laboratory, an office, and an around-the-corner corridor. Experimental results demonstrate that N2LoS achieves median localization errors of 10.69 cm (X) and 11.98 cm (Y) at a 5 m range in the laboratory setting, showcasing its effectiveness for real-world NLoS localization.</description>

      <title>Sparsity-Aware Near-Field Beam Training via Multi-Beam Combination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes an adaptive near-field beam training method to enhance performance in multi-user and multipath environments. The approach identifies multiple strongest beams through beam sweeping and linearly combines their received signals - capturing both amplitude and phase - for improved channel estimation. Two codebooks are considered: the conventional DFT codebook and a near-field codebook that samples both angular and distance domains. As the near-field basis functions are generally non-orthogonal and often over-complete, we exploit sparsity in the solution using LASSO-based linear regression, which can also suppress noise. Simulation results show that the near-field codebook reduces feedback overhead by up to 95% compared to the DFT codebook. The proposed LASSO regression method also maintains robustness under varying noise levels, particularly in low SNR regions. Furthermore, an off-grid refinement scheme is introduced to enhance accuracy especially when the codebook sampling is coarse, improving reconstruction accuracy by 69.4%.</description>

      <title>Multi-Active RIS-Assisted THz Cell-Free Systems: Spectral and Energy Efficiency Tradeoff</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) and cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) are effective solutions for mitigating large path loss and inter-cell interference in terahertz (THz) systems. However, passive RISs are notably limited from double-fading attenuation, motivating the use of active RISs with power amplification to improve signal strength. In this paper, we investigate a multi-active RIS-aided wideband CF-mMIMO system for THz communications, considering low-resolution digital-to-analog converters (DACs) to optimize the spectral efficiency (SE)-energy efficiency (EE) tradeoff by adjusting precoding vectors and reflection coefficient response of the RISs, subject to power and minimum desirable per-user rate constraints. This leads to a highly complex and non-convex, multi-objective and fractional optimization problem. To solve it, we propose a tailored quadratic transformation to manage the fractional form. This allows decomposition into two subproblems, which are iteratively solved via a successive convex approximation algorithm to optimize the precoding vectors and active RIS reflection coefficients until convergence. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed active RIS-aided CF-mMIMO system effectively addresses propagation loss and limited scattering in THz communication, achieving superior EE and SE compared to conventional passive RIS across diverse scenarios. Furthermore, the integration of low-resolution DACs shows significant improvement in EE while preserving satisfactory communication performance.</description>

      <title>SemCSINet: A Semantic-Aware CSI Feedback Network in Massive MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technology is a key enabler of modern wireless communication systems, which demand accurate downlink channel state information (CSI) for optimal performance. Although deep learning (DL) has shown great potential in improving CSI feedback, most existing approaches fail to exploit the semantic relationship between CSI and other related channel metrics. In this paper, we propose SemCSINet, a semantic-aware Transformer-based framework that incorporates Channel Quality Indicator (CQI) into the CSI feedback process. By embedding CQI information and leveraging a joint coding-modulation (JCM) scheme, SemCSINet enables efficient, digital-friendly CSI feedback under noisy feedback channels. Experimental results on DeepMIMO datasets show that SemCSINet significantly outperforms conventional methods, particularly in scenarios with low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and low compression ratios (CRs), highlighting the effectiveness of semantic embedding in enhancing CSI reconstruction accuracy and system robustness.</description>

      <title>Non-contact Vital Signs Detection in Dynamic Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate phase demodulation is critical for vital sign detection using millimeter-wave radar. However, in complex environments, time-varying DC offsets and phase imbalances can severely degrade demodulation performance. To address this, we propose a novel DC offset calibration method alongside a Hilbert and Differential Cross-Multiply (HADCM) demodulation algorithm. The approach estimates time-varying DC offsets from neighboring signal peaks and valleys, then employs both differential forms and Hilbert transforms of the I/Q channel signals to extract vital sign information. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method maintains robust performance under low signal-to-noise ratios. Compared to existing demodulation techniques, it offers more accurate signal recovery in challenging scenarios and effectively suppresses noise interference.</description>

      <title>On the Average Secrecy Performance of Satellite Networks in Short Packet Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the secrecy performance of satellite networks in short packet communication systems under shadowed Rician fading (SRF). We derive a lower bound on the average achievable secrecy rate in the finite blocklength regime (FBL) and provide analytical insights into the impact of key secrecy-related performance indicators (KPIs). Monte Carlo simulations validate the theoretical framework, and demonstrate that increasing the blocklength and improving the legitimate receiver's signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) enhance secrecy, while a stronger eavesdropper degrades it. Additionally, we show that directional antenna patterns can effectively reduce information leakage and provide secure satellite communications in the short packet regime. These findings offer valuable guidance for designing secure and efficient satellite-based communication systems, particularly in IoT and space-based networks.</description>

      <title>Short Wins Long: Short Codes with Language Model Semantic Correction Outperform Long Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel semantic-enhanced decoding scheme for transmitting natural language sentences with multiple short block codes over noisy wireless channels. After ASCII source coding, the natural language sentence message is divided into segments, where each is encoded with short block channel codes independently before transmission. At the receiver, each short block of codewords is decoded in parallel, followed by a semantic error correction (SEC) model to reconstruct corrupted segments semantically. We design and train the SEC model based on Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers (BART). Simulations demonstrate that the proposed scheme can significantly outperform encoding the sentence with one conventional long LDPC code, in terms of block error rate (BLER), semantic metrics, and decoding latency. Finally, we proposed a semantic hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) scheme to further enhance the error performance, which selectively requests retransmission depends on semantic uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Extract the Best, Discard the Rest: CSI Feedback with Offline Large AI Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large AI models (LAMs) have shown strong potential in wireless communication tasks, but their practical deployment remains hindered by latency and computational constraints. In this work, we focus on the challenge of integrating LAMs into channel state information (CSI) feedback for frequency-division duplex (FDD) massive multiple-intput multiple-output (MIMO) systems. To this end, we propose two offline frameworks, namely site-specific LAM-enhanced CSI feedback (SSLCF) and multi-scenario LAM-enhanced CSI feedback (MSLCF), that incorporate LAMs into the codebook-based CSI feedback paradigm without requiring real-time inference. Specifically, SSLCF generates a site-specific enhanced codebook through fine-tuning on locally collected CSI data, while MSLCF improves generalization by pre-generating a set of environment-aware codebooks. Both of these frameworks build upon the LAM with vision-based backbone, which is pre-trained on large-scale image datasets and fine-tuned with CSI data to generate customized codebooks. This resulting network named LVM4CF captures the structural similarity between CSI and image, allowing the LAM to refine codewords tailored to the specific environments. To optimize the codebook refinement capability of LVM4CF under both single- and dual-side deployment modes, we further propose corresponding training and inference algorithms. Simulation results show that our frameworks significantly outperform existing schemes in both reconstruction accuracy and system throughput, without introducing additional inference latency or computational overhead. These results also support the core design methodology of our proposed frameworks, extracting the best and discarding the rest, as a promising pathway for integrating LAMs into future wireless systems.</description>

      <title>Joint Optimization of User Association and Resource Allocation for Load Balancing With Multi-Level Fairness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: User association, the problem of assigning each user device to a suitable base station, is increasingly crucial as wireless networks become denser and serve more users with diverse service demands. The joint optimization of user association and resource allocation (UARA) is a fundamental issue for future wireless networks, as it plays a pivotal role in enhancing overall network performance, user fairness, and resource efficiency. Given the latency-sensitive nature of emerging network applications, network management favors algorithms that are simple and computationally efficient rather than complex centralized approaches. Thus, distributed pricing-based strategies have gained prominence in the UARA literature, demonstrating practicality and effectiveness across various objective functions, e.g., sum-rate, proportional fairness, max-min fairness, and alpha-fairness. While the alpha-fairness frameworks allow for flexible adjustments between efficiency and fairness via a single parameter $\alpha$, existing works predominantly assume a homogeneous fairness context, assigning an identical $\alpha$ value to all users. Real-world networks, however, frequently require differentiated user prioritization due to varying application requirements and latency. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel heterogeneous alpha-fairness (HAF) objective function, assigning distinct {\alpha} values to different users, thereby providing enhanced control over the balance between throughput, fairness, and latency across the network. We present a distributed, pricing-based optimization approach utilizing an auxiliary variable framework and provide analytical proof of its convergence to an $\epsilon$-optimal solution, where the optimality gap $\epsilon$ decreases with the number of iterations.</description>

      <title>Robust Beamforming Design for STAR-RIS Aided RSMA Network with Hardware Impairments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate the robust beamforming design for a simultaneous transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) aided downlink rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) communication system, where both transceivers and STAR-RIS suffer from the impact of hardware impairments (HWI). A base station (BS) is deployed to transmit messages concurrently to multiple users, utilizing a STAR-RIS to improve communication quality and expand user coverage. We aim to maximize the achievable sum rate of the users while ensuring the constraints of transmit power, STAR-RIS coefficients, and the actual rate of the common stream for all users. To solve this challenging high-coupling and non-convexity problem, we adopt a fractional programming (FP)-based alternating optimization (AO) approach, where each sub-problem is addressed via semidefinite relaxation (SDR) and successive convex approximation (SCA) methods. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms other multiple access schemes and conventional passive RIS in terms of the achievable sum rate. Additionally, considering the HWI of the transceiver and STAR-RIS makes our algorithm more robust than when such considerations are not included.</description>

      <title>3GPP-Compliant Radar Cross Section Characterization of Indoor Factory Targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The following paper presents a systematic 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP)-compliant characterization of radar cross section (RCS) for indoor factory (InF) objects, including small and mid-sized unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), robotic arms, and automated guided vehicles (AGVs). Through measurements in the 25-28 GHz range, we validate the 3GPP standardized log-normal distribution model for RCS for above-mentioned target objects. The 3GPP-complaint RCS parameters obtained for the small-sized UAV are in close agreement (&lt;1 dB deviation) with 3GPP agreed values. The mid-sized UAVs exhibit higher reflectivity compared to the small-sized UAV due to enhanced specular components attributed to material and lithium-ion battery packs. The robotic arm exhibits dynamic RCS behavior due to mechanical articulation, whereas UAVs show clear size-dependent reflectivity patterns in AGVs. Our findings provide empirical validation for RCS characterization for integrated sensing and communication channel modeling in InF environments.</description>

      <title>GNN-based Precoder Design and Fine-tuning for Cell-free Massive MIMO with Real-world CSI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cell-free massive MIMO (CF-mMIMO) has emerged as a promising paradigm for delivering uniformly high-quality coverage in future wireless networks. To address the inherent challenges of precoding in such distributed systems, recent studies have explored the use of graph neural network (GNN)-based methods, using their powerful representation capabilities. However, these approaches have predominantly been trained and validated on synthetic datasets, leaving their generalizability to real-world propagation environments largely unverified. In this work, we initially pre-train the GNN using simulated channel state information (CSI) data, which incorporates standard propagation models and small-scale Rayleigh fading. Subsequently, we finetune the model on real-world CSI measurements collected from a physical testbed equipped with distributed access points (APs). To balance the retention of pre-trained features with adaptation to real-world conditions, we adopt a layer-freezing strategy during fine-tuning, wherein several GNN layers are frozen and only the later layers remain trainable. Numerical results demonstrate that the fine-tuned GNN significantly outperforms the pre-trained model, achieving an approximate 8.2 bits per channel use gain at 20 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), corresponding to a 15.7 % improvement. These findings highlight the critical role of transfer learning and underscore the potential of GNN-based precoding techniques to effectively generalize from synthetic to real-world wireless environments.</description>

      <title>Revenue Optimization in Video Caching Networks with Privacy-Preserving Demand Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Performance of video streaming, which accounts for most of the traffic in wireless communication, can be significantly improved by caching popular videos at the wireless edge. Determining the cache content that optimizes performance (defined via a revenue function) is thus an important task, and prediction of the future demands based on past history can make this process much more efficient. However, since practical video caching networks involve various parties (e.g., users, isp, and csp) that do not wish to reveal information such as past history to each other, privacy-preserving solutions are required. Motivated by this, we propose a proactive caching method based on users' privacy-preserving multi-slot future demand predictions -- obtained from a trained Transformer -- to optimize revenue. Specifically, we first use a privacy-preserving fl algorithm to train a Transformer to predict multi-slot future demands of the users. However, prediction accuracy is not perfect and decreases the farther into the future the prediction is done. We model the impact of prediction errors invoking the file popularities, based on which we formulate a long-term system revenue optimization to make the cache placement decisions. As the formulated problem is NP-hard, we use a greedy algorithm to efficiently obtain an approximate solution. Simulation results validate that (i) the fl solution achieves results close to the centralized (non-privacy-preserving) solution and (ii) optimization of revenue may provide different solutions than the classical chr criterion.</description>

      <title>Channel Fingerprint Construction for Massive MIMO: A Deep Conditional Generative Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate channel state information (CSI) acquisition for massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems is essential for future mobile communication networks. Channel fingerprint (CF), also referred to as channel knowledge map, is a key enabler for intelligent environment-aware communication and can facilitate CSI acquisition. However, due to the cost limitations of practical sensing nodes and test vehicles, the resulting CF is typically coarse-grained, making it insufficient for wireless transceiver design. In this work, we introduce the concept of CF twins and design a conditional generative diffusion model (CGDM) with strong implicit prior learning capabilities as the computational core of the CF twin to establish the connection between coarse- and fine-grained CFs. Specifically, we employ a variational inference technique to derive the evidence lower bound (ELBO) for the log-marginal distribution of the observed fine-grained CF conditioned on the coarse-grained CF, enabling the CGDM to learn the complicated distribution of the target data. During the denoising neural network optimization, the coarse-grained CF is introduced as side information to accurately guide the conditioned generation of the CGDM. To make the proposed CGDM lightweight, we further leverage the additivity of network layers and introduce a one-shot pruning approach along with a multi-objective knowledge distillation technique. Experimental results show that the proposed approach exhibits significant improvement in reconstruction performance compared to the baselines. Additionally, zero-shot testing on reconstruction tasks with different magnification factors further demonstrates the scalability and generalization ability of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>EnvCDiff: Joint Refinement of Environmental Information and Channel Fingerprints via Conditional Generative Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paradigm shift from environment-unaware communication to intelligent environment-aware communication is expected to facilitate the acquisition of channel state information for future wireless communications. Channel Fingerprint (CF), as an emerging enabling technology for environment-aware communication, provides channel-related knowledge for potential locations within the target communication area. However, due to the limited availability of practical devices for sensing environmental information and measuring channel-related knowledge, most of the acquired environmental information and CF are coarse-grained, insufficient to guide the design of wireless transmissions. To address this, this paper proposes a deep conditional generative learning approach, namely a customized conditional generative diffusion model (CDiff). The proposed CDiff simultaneously refines environmental information and CF, reconstructing a fine-grained CF that incorporates environmental information, referred to as EnvCF, from its coarse-grained counterpart. Experimental results show that the proposed approach significantly improves the performance of EnvCF construction compared to the baselines.</description>

      <title>An Ultra-Sub-Wavelength Microwave Polarization Switch Implemented with Directed Surface Acoustic Waves in a Magnonic Crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability to switch the polarization of a transmitted electromagnetic wave from vertical to horizontal, or vice versa, is of great technological interest because of its many applications in long distance communication. Binary bits can be encoded in two orthogonal polarizations and transmitted securely from point to point. Polarization switches, however, are usually much larger than the wavelength of the electromagnetic wave. Consequently, most research in this area has focused on the optical regime where the wavelength is relatively short (~1 micron), so that the switch being much larger than the wavelength is not too inconvenient. However, this changes in the microwave regime where the wavelength is much larger (typically &gt; 1 cm). That makes a microwave ultra-sub-wavelength polarization switch very attractive. Here, we report such a switch made of an array of magnetostrictive nanomagnets (~100 nm lateral dimension) deposited on a piezoelectric substrate to make an "artificial magnonic crystal". A surface acoustic wave (SAW) launched in the substrate with suitable electrodes excites spin waves in the nanomagnets via phonon-magnon coupling, resulting in radiation of electromagnetic waves via magnon-photon coupling. The polarization of the beam radiated in a given direction at a given frequency can be rotated through ~90 degrees by changing the direction of SAW propagation in the substrate to implement the polarization switch.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mobile jammers pose a critical threat to 5G networks, particularly in military communications. We propose an intelligent anti-jamming framework that integrates Multiple Signal Classification (MUSIC) for high-resolution Direction-of-Arrival (DoA) estimation, Minimum Variance Distortionless Response (MVDR) beamforming for adaptive interference suppression, and machine learning (ML) to enhance DoA prediction for mobile jammers. Extensive simulations in a realistic highway scenario demonstrate that our hybrid approach achieves an average Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) improvement of 9.58 dB (maximum 11.08 dB) and up to 99.8% DoA estimation accuracy. The framework's computational efficiency and adaptability to dynamic jammer mobility patterns outperform conventional anti-jamming techniques, making it a robust solution for securing 5G communications in contested environments.</description>

      <title>QubitLens: An Interactive Learning Tool for Quantum State Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum state tomography is a fundamental task in quantum computing, involving the reconstruction of an unknown quantum state from measurement outcomes. Although essential, it is typically introduced at the graduate level due to its reliance on advanced concepts such as the density matrix formalism, tensor product structures, and partial trace operations. This complexity often creates a barrier for students and early learners. In this work, we introduce QubitLens, an interactive visualization tool designed to make quantum state tomography more accessible and intuitive. QubitLens leverages maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), a classical statistical method, to estimate pure quantum states from projective measurement outcomes in the X, Y, and Z bases. The tool emphasizes conceptual clarity through visual representations, including Bloch sphere plots of true and reconstructed qubit states, bar charts comparing parameter estimates, and fidelity gauges that quantify reconstruction accuracy. QubitLens offers a hands-on approach to learning quantum tomography without requiring deep prior knowledge of density matrices or optimization theory. The tool supports both single- and multi-qubit systems and is intended to bridge the gap between theory and practice in quantum computing education.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Polarforming Antenna Enhanced Sensing and Communication: Modeling and Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel intelligent polarforming antenna (IPA) to achieve cost-effective wireless sensing and communication. Specifically, the IPA can enable polarforming by adaptively controlling the antenna's polarization electrically as well as its position/rotation mechanically, so as to effectively exploit polarization and spatial diversity to reconfigure wireless channels for improving sensing and communication performance. We study an IPA-enhanced integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system that utilizes user location sensing to facilitate communication between an IPA-equipped base station (BS) and IPA-equipped users. First, we model the IPA channel in terms of transceiver antenna polarforming vectors and antenna positions/rotations. We then propose a two-timescale ISAC protocol, where in the slow timescale, user localization is first performed, followed by the optimization of the BS antennas' positions and rotations based on the sensed user locations; subsequently, in the fast timescale, transceiver polarforming is adapted to cater to the instantaneous channel state information (CSI), with the optimized BS antennas' positions and rotations. We propose a new polarforming-based user localization method that uses a structured time-domain pattern of pilot-polarforming vectors to extract the common stable components in the IPA channel across different polarizations based on the parallel factor (PARAFAC) tensor model. Moreover, we maximize the achievable average sum-rate of users by jointly optimizing the fast-timescale transceiver polarforming, including phase shifts and amplitude variations, along with the slow-timescale antenna rotations and positions at the BS. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of polarforming-based localization algorithm and demonstrate the performance advantages of polarforming, antenna placement, and their joint design.</description>

      <title>Fr\'{e}chet Power-Scenario Distance: A Metric for Evaluating Generative AI Models across Multiple Time-Scales in Smart Grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) models in smart grids have advanced significantly in recent years due to their ability to generate large amounts of synthetic data, which would otherwise be difficult to obtain in the real world due to confidentiality constraints. A key challenge in utilizing such synthetic data is how to assess the data quality produced from such generative models. Traditional Euclidean distance-based metrics only reflect pair-wise relations between two individual samples, and could fail in evaluating quality differences between groups of synthetic datasets. In this work, we propose a novel metric based on the Fr\'{e}chet Distance (FD) estimated between two datasets in a learned feature space. The proposed method evaluates the quality of generation from a distributional perspective. Empirical results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed metric across timescales and models, enhancing the reliability of data-driven decision-making in smart grid operations.</description>

Abstract: Network slicing in 5G/6G Non-Terrestrial Network (NTN) is confronted with mobility and traffic variability. An artificial intelligence (AI)-based digital twin (DT) architecture with deep reinforcement learning (DRL) using Deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) is proposed for dynamic optimization of resource allocation. DT virtualizes network states to enable predictive analysis, while DRL changes bandwidth for eMBB slice. Simulations show a 25\% latency reduction compared to static methods, with enhanced resource utilization. This scalable solution supports 5G/6G NTN applications like disaster recovery and urban blockage.</description>

      <title>Lorentzian-Constrained Holographic Beamforming Optimization in Multi-user Networks with Dynamic Metasurface Antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamic metasurface antennas (DMAs) are promising alternatives to fully digital (FD) architectures, enabling hybrid beamforming via low-cost reconfigurable metasurfaces. In DMAs, holographic beamforming is achieved through tunable elements by Lorentzian-constrained holography (LCH), significantly reducing the need for radio-frequency (RF) chains and analog circuitry. However, the Lorentzian constraints and limited RF chains introduce a trade-off between reduced system complexity and beamforming performance, especially in dense network scenarios. This paper addresses resource allocation in multi-user multiple-input-single-output (MISO) networks under the Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) constraints, aiming to minimize total transmit power. We propose a holographic beamforming algorithm based on the Generalized Method of Lorentzian-Constrained Holography (GMLCH), which optimizes DMA weights, yielding flexibility for using various LCH techniques to tackle the aforementioned trade-offs. Building upon GMLCH, we further propose a new algorithm, Adaptive Radius Lorentzian Constrained Holography (ARLCH), which achieves optimization of DMA weights with additional degree of freedom in a greater optimization space, and provides lower transmitted power, while improving scalability for higher number of users. Numerical results show that ARLCH reduces power consumption by over 20% compared to benchmarks, with increasing effectiveness as the number of users grows.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work studies a point-to-point MIMO uplink in which user equipment transmits data to a base station equipped with a massive array. Signal detection is noncoherent and fading is assumed to follow the Weichselberger model. By exploiting the spatial stationarity of fading at the base station, a cyclostationary structure emerges naturally in the space-time representation, which suggests formulating the statistical properties of the received signal in the Karhunen-Lo\`eve domain. This allows the derivation of a low-complexity receiver that approximates maximum likelihood detection even for a moderate array size. The spectral analysis of the problem provides valuable insights on the design of space-time codewords.</description>

      <title>Dual-UAV-Enabled Secure Communication and Sensing for A2G-ISAC Systems with Maneuverable Jamming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a dual-unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled secure communication and sensing (SCS) scheme for an air-to-ground integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system, in which a dual-functional source UAV and jamming UAV collaborate to enhance both the secure communication and target sensing performance. From a perspective of hybrid monostatitc-bistatic radar, the jamming UAV maneuvers to aid the source UAV to detect multiple ground targets by emitting artificial noise, meanwhile interfering with the ground eavesdropper. Residual interference is considered to reflect the effects of imperfect successive interference cancellation (SIC) on the receive signal-plus-interference-to-noise ratios, which results in a degraded system performance. To maximize the average secrecy rate (ASR), the dual-UAV trajectory and dual-UAV beamforming are jointly optimized subject to the transmit power budget, UAV maneuvering constraint, and sensing requirements. To tackle the highly complicated non-convex ASR maximization problem, the dual-UAV trajectory and dual-UAV beamforming are optimized for the secure communication (SC) purpose and the SCS purpose, sequentially. In the SC phase, a block coordinate descent algorithm is proposed to optimize the dual-UAV trajectory and dual-UAV beamforming iteratively, using the trust-region successive convex approximation (SCA) and semidefinite relaxation (SDR) techniques. Then, a weighted distance minimization problem is formulated to determine the dual-UAV maneuvering positions suitable for the SCS purpose, which is solved by a heuristic greedy algorithm, followed by the joint optimization of source beamforming and jamming beamforming.</description>

      <title>MINIMALIST: switched-capacitor circuits for efficient in-memory computation of gated recurrent units</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have been a long-standing candidate for processing of temporal sequence data, especially in memory-constrained systems that one may find in embedded edge computing environments. Recent advances in training paradigms have now inspired new generations of efficient RNNs. We introduce a streamlined and hardware-compatible architecture based on minimal gated recurrent units (GRUs), and an accompanying efficient mixed-signal hardware implementation of the model. The proposed design leverages switched-capacitor circuits not only for in-memory computation (IMC), but also for the gated state updates. The mixed-signal cores rely solely on commodity circuits consisting of metal capacitors, transmission gates, and a clocked comparator, thus greatly facilitating scaling and transfer to other technology nodes.
  We benchmark the performance of our architecture on time series data, introducing all constraints required for a direct mapping to the hardware system. The direct compatibility is verified in mixed-signal simulations, reproducing data recorded from the software-only network model.</description>

      <title>Rydberg Atomic Quantum Receivers for Classical Wireless Communications and Sensing: Their Models and Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05554v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The significant progress of quantum sensing technologies offer numerous radical solutions for measuring a multitude of physical quantities at an unprecedented precision. Among them, Rydberg atomic quantum receivers (RAQRs) emerge as an eminent solution for detecting the electric field of radio frequency (RF) signals, exhibiting great potential in assisting classical wireless communications and sensing. So far, most experimental studies have aimed for the proof of physical concepts to reveal its promise, while the practical signal model of RAQR-aided wireless communications and sensing remained under-explored. Furthermore, the performance of RAQR-based wireless receivers and their advantages over classical RF receivers have not been fully characterized. To fill these gaps, we introduce the RAQR to the wireless community by presenting an end-to-end reception scheme. We then develop a corresponding equivalent baseband signal model relying on a realistic reception flow. Our scheme and model provide explicit design guidance to RAQR-aided wireless systems. We next study the performance of RAQR-aided wireless systems based on our model, and compare them to classical RF receivers. The results show that the RAQR is capable of achieving a substantial received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) gain of over $27$ decibel (dB) and $40$ dB in the photon shot limit regime and the standard quantum limit regime, respectively.</description>

      <title>RadioLLM: Introducing Large Language Model into Cognitive Radio via Hybrid Prompt and Token Reprogrammings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17888v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The growing scarcity of spectrum resources and rapid proliferation of wireless devices make efficient radio network management critical. While deep learning-enhanced Cognitive Radio Technology (CRT) provides promising solutions for tasks such as radio signal classification (RSC), denoising, and spectrum allocation, existing DL-based CRT frameworks are typically task-specific and lack scalability in diverse real-world applications. This limitation naturally leads to the exploration of Large Language Models (LLMs), whose exceptional cross-domain generalization capabilities offer new potential for advancing CRT. To bridge this gap, we propose RadioLLM, a novel framework that integrates Hybrid Prompt and Token Reprogramming (HPTR) for combining radio signal features with expert knowledge, and a Frequency-Attuned Fusion (FAF) module for enhanced high-frequency feature modeling. Extensive evaluations on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that RadioLLM achieves superior performance compared to existing baselines in the majority of testing scenarios.</description>

      <title>Estimation of Food Intake Quantity Using Inertial Signals from Smartwatches</title>

Abstract: Accurate monitoring of eating behavior is crucial for managing obesity and eating disorders such as bulimia nervosa. At the same time, existing methods rely on multiple and/or specialized sensors, greatly harming adherence and ultimately, the quality and continuity of data. This paper introduces a novel approach for estimating the weight of a bite, from a commercial smartwatch. Our publicly-available dataset contains smartwatch inertial data from ten participants, with manually annotated start and end times of each bite along with their corresponding weights from a smart scale, under semi-controlled conditions. The proposed method combines extracted behavioral features such as the time required to load the utensil with food, with statistical features of inertial signals, that serve as input to a Support Vector Regression model to estimate bite weights. Under a leave-one-subject-out cross-validation scheme, our approach achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 3.99 grams per bite. To contextualize this performance, we introduce the improvement metric, that measures the relative MAE difference compared to a baseline model. Our method demonstrates a 17.41% improvement, while the adapted state-of-the art method shows a -28.89% performance against that same baseline. The results presented in this work establish the feasibility of extracting meaningful bite weight estimates from commercial smartwatch inertial sensors alone, laying the groundwork for future accessible, non-invasive dietary monitoring systems.</description>

      <title>The Communication and Computation Trade-off in Wireless Semantic Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10357v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semantic communications have emerged as a crucial research direction for future wireless communication networks. However, as wireless systems become increasingly complex, the demands for computation and communication resources in semantic communications continue to grow rapidly. This paper investigates the trade-off between computation and communication in wireless semantic communications, taking into consideration transmission task delay and performance constraints within the semantic communication framework. We propose a novel tradeoff metric to analyze the balance between computation and communication in semantic transmissions and employ the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm to minimize this metric, thereby reducing the cost associated with balancing computation and communication. Through simulations, we analyze the tradeoff between computation and communication and demonstrate the effectiveness of optimizing this trade-off metric.</description>

      <title>Robust Quickest Change Detection in Non-Stationary Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.09673v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optimal algorithms are developed for robust detection of changes in non-stationary processes. These are processes in which the distribution of the data after change varies with time. The decision-maker does not have access to precise information on the post-change distribution. It is shown that if the post-change non-stationary family has a distribution that is least favorable in a well-defined sense, then the algorithms designed using the least favorable distributions are robust and optimal. Non-stationary processes are encountered in public health monitoring and space and military applications. The robust algorithms are applied to real and simulated data to show their effectiveness.</description>

      <title>On the Impact of Uncertainty and Calibration on Likelihood-Ratio Membership Inference Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10686v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a membership inference attack (MIA), an attacker exploits the overconfidence exhibited by typical machine learning models to determine whether a specific data point was used to train a target model. In this paper, we analyze the performance of the likelihood ratio attack (LiRA) within an information-theoretical framework that allows the investigation of the impact of the aleatoric uncertainty in the true data generation process, of the epistemic uncertainty caused by a limited training data set, and of the calibration level of the target model. We compare three different settings, in which the attacker receives decreasingly informative feedback from the target model: confidence vector (CV) disclosure, in which the output probability vector is released; true label confidence (TLC) disclosure, in which only the probability assigned to the true label is made available by the model; and decision set (DS) disclosure, in which an adaptive prediction set is produced as in conformal prediction. We derive bounds on the advantage of an MIA adversary with the aim of offering insights into the impact of uncertainty and calibration on the effectiveness of MIAs. Simulation results demonstrate that the derived analytical bounds predict well the effectiveness of MIAs.</description>

      <title>Decadal analysis of sea surface temperature patterns, climatology, and anomalies in temperate coastal waters with Landsat-8 TIRS observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05843v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sea surface temperature (SST) is a fundamental physical parameter characterising the thermal state of sea surface. Due to the intricate thermal interactions between land, sea, and atmosphere, the spatial gradients of SST in coastal waters often appear at finer spatial scales than those in open ocean waters. The Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) onboard Landsat-8, with its 100-meter spatial resolution, offers a unique opportunity to uncover fine-scale coastal SST patterns that would otherwise be overlooked by coarser-resolution thermal sensors. In this study, we first analysed the spatiotemporal patterns of SST in South Australia's temperate coastal waters from 2014 to 2023 by developing an operational approach for SST retrieval from the Landsat-8 TIRS sensor. A buoy was deployed off the coast of Port Lincoln, South Australia, to validate the quality of SST retrievals. Then the daily baseline climatology of SST with 100 m resolution was constructed, which allowed for the detection and analysis of anomalous SST events. Our results suggest the following: (1) the satellite-derived SST data aligned well with the in-situ measured SST values; (2) the semi-enclosed, shallow regions of Upper Spencer Gulf and Upper St Vincent Gulf showed higher temperatures during summer and cooler temperatures during winter than waters closer to the open ocean, resulting in a higher seasonal variation in SST; (3) the near-shore shallow areas in Spencer Gulf and St Vincent Gulf, and regions surrounding Kangaroo Island, were identified to have a higher probability of SST anomalies compared to the rest of the study area; and (4) anomalous SST events were more likely to happen during the warm months than the cool months. We hope these findings would be helpful in supporting the fishing and aquaculture industries in the coastal waters of South Australia.</description>

      <title>SCAN-BEST: Sub-6GHz-Aided Near-field Beam Selection with Formal Reliability Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13801v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As millimeter-wave (mmWave) MIMO systems adopt larger antenna arrays, near-field propagation becomes increasingly prominent, especially for users close to the transmitter. Traditional far-field beam training methods become inadequate, while near-field training faces the challenge of large codebooks due to the need to resolve both angular and distance domains. To reduce in-band training overhead, prior work has proposed to leverage the spatial-temporal congruence between sub-6 GHz (sub-6G) and mmWave channels to predict the best mmWave beam within a near-field codebook from sub-6G channel estimates. To cope with the uncertainty caused by sub-6G/mmWave differences, we introduce a novel Sub-6G Channel Aided Near-field BEam SelecTion (SCAN-BEST) framework that wraps around any beam predictor to produce candidate beam subset with formal suboptimality guarantees. The proposed SCAN-BEST builds on conformal risk control (CRC), and is calibrated offline using limited calibration data. Its performance guarantees apply even in the presence of statistical shifts between calibration and deployment. Numerical results validate the theoretical properties and efficiency of SCAN-BEST.</description>
