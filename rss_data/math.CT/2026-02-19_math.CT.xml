      <title>Derivations as Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Differential categories provide the categorical foundations for the algebraic approaches to differentiation. They have been successful in formalizing various important concepts related to differentiation, such as, in particular, derivations. In this paper, we show that the differential modality of a differential category lifts to a monad on the arrow category and, moreover, that the algebras of this monad are precisely derivations. Furthermore, in the presence of finite biproducts, the differential modality in fact lifts to a differential modality on the arrow category. In other words, the arrow category of a differential category is again a differential category. As a consequence, derivations also form a tangent category, and derivations on free algebras form a cartesian differential category.</description>

      <title>A type theory for invertibility in weak $\omega$-categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a conservative extension ICaTT of the dependent type theory CaTT for weak $\omega$-categories with a type witnessing coinductive invertibility of cells. This extension allows for a concise description of the "walking equivalence" as a context, and of a set of maps characterising $\omega$-equifibrations as substitutions. We provide an implementation of our theory, which we use to formalise basic properties of invertible cells. These properties allow us to give semantics of ICaTT in marked weak $\omega$-categories, building a fibrant marked $\omega$-category out of every model of ICaTT.</description>

      <title>Homotopy Lie algebras and coherent infinitesimal 2-braidings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a homotopy Lie algebra (i.e. an $L_\infty$-algebra) $\mathfrak{g}$, we show concretely how the Lada-Markl $\mathfrak{g}$-modules (i.e. representations) assemble into a symmetric monoidal dg-category. Considering the homotopy 2-category of that dg-category, we construct infinitesimal 2-braidings from 2-shifted Poisson structures then show that such infinitesimal 2-braidings are coherent in Cirio and Faria Martins' sense. We then explicitly determine the differential of the Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra associated with a finite-dimensional homotopy Lie algebra and construct the symmetric monoidal dg-equivalence between the category of representations and the category of semi-free dg-modules over the Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra.</description>

      <title>Causal and Compositional Abstraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Abstracting from a low level to a more explanatory high level of description, and ideally while preserving causal structure, is fundamental to scientific practice, to causal inference problems, and to robust, efficient and interpretable AI. We present a general account of abstractions between low and high level models as natural transformations, focusing on the case of causal models. This provides a new formalisation of causal abstraction, unifying several notions in the literature, including constructive causal abstraction, Q-$\tau$ consistency, abstractions based on interchange interventions, and `distributed' causal abstractions. Our approach is formalised in terms of category theory, and uses the general notion of a compositional model with a given set of queries and semantics in a monoidal, cd- or Markov category; causal models and their queries such as interventions being special cases. We identify two basic notions of abstraction: downward abstractions mapping queries from high to low level; and upward abstractions, mapping concrete queries such as Do-interventions from low to high. Although usually presented as the latter, we show how common causal abstractions may, more fundamentally, be understood in terms of the former. Our approach also leads us to consider a new stronger notion of `component-level' abstraction, applying to the individual components of a model. In particular, this yields a novel, strengthened form of constructive causal abstraction at the mechanism-level, for which we prove characterisation results. Finally, we show that abstraction can be generalised to further compositional models, including those with a quantum semantics implemented by quantum circuits, and we take first steps in exploring abstractions between quantum compositional circuit models and high-level classical causal models as a means to explainable quantum AI.</description>

      <title>Cech cohomology of partially ordered sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.05577v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The article is devoted to a comparison of the \v{C}ech cohomology with the coefficients in a presheaf of Abelian groups and the topos cohomology of the sheaf generated by this presheaf for a poset with the Aleksandrov topology. The article consists of three parts. The first part provides information from the theory of cohomology of small categories and cohomology of simplicial sets with systems of coefficients. The second part is devoted to Laudal's Theorem stating that covering cohomology for an arbitrary topological space with coefficients in the presheaf of Abelian groups is isomorphic to the derived limit functors. The third part presents the main results. The criterion for the invariance of cohomology groups of small categories when passing to the inverse image leads to necessary and sufficient isomorphism conditions for the \v{C}ech cohomology of an arbitrary presheaf and the topos cohomology of the sheaf generated by this presheaf. In particular, for a finite poset, these conditions reduce to the acyclicity of the upper secrions of Dedekind-MacNeille cuts having a non-empty lower section, and the verification of these conditions is algorithmically computable.</description>

      <title>The Born rule as a natural transformation of functors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08323v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we show that the quantum mechanical notions of density operator, positive operator-valued measure (POVM), and the Born rule, are all simultaneously encoded in the categorical notion of a natural transformation of functors. In particular, we show that given a fixed quantum system, there exists an explicit bijection from the set of density operators on the associated Hilbert space to the set of natural transformations between the canonical measurement and probability functors associated with the system, which formalize the way in which quantum effects (i.e., POVM elements) and their associated probabilities are additive with respect to a coarse-graining of measurements.</description>
