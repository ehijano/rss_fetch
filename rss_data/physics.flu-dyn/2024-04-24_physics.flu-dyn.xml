      <title>Multi-Physics Numerical Analysis of Single-phase Immersion Cooling for Thermal Management of Li-Ion Batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Battery thermal management systems (BTMSs) are critical for efficient and safe operation of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), especially for fast charging/discharging applications that generate significant heating within the cell. Forced immersion cooling, where a dielectric fluid flows in direct contact with the LIB cells, is an effective cooling approach. But because of its complex nature, a thorough understanding of the underlying physics - including the coupled electrochemical, thermal, fluid, and mechanical effects - is required before immersion cooling will see wide adoption into commercial systems. In this work, to investigate the performance of a LIB subjected to forced immersion cooling, we develop a fully coupled modeling approach that solves the detailed electrochemical model in conjunction with the thermal-fluid transport models for both the cell and fluid domain. After calculating the electrochemical and thermal responses, we also estimate the mechanical stresses within the cell generated due to the ion diffusion and temperature rise that impact reliability. To assess the effectiveness of forced immersion cooling, we evaluate several different configurations for a cylindrical 18650 battery cell under varying cell discharge rates. We compare forced immersion cooling for two liquids (deionized water and mineral oil) at three different fluid mass flow rates. The results highlight the strong cross-coupling of the electrochemical and heat transfer phenomena. By comparing results across fluids and flow rates, we define a new metric that can be used to compare the cooling capacity considering different flow parameters. Overall, this study provides insights that will be useful in the design of immersion cooling-based BTMSs including, for example, the selection of forced immersion cooling specifications, such that the temperature is controlled without significant capacity loss.</description>

      <title>Effect of structural parameters on the synchronization characteristics in a stall-induced aeroelastic system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study focuses on discerning the role of structural parameters on the bifurcation characteristics and the underlying synchronization mechanism in an aeroelastic system undergoing nonlinear stall behaviour. To that end, wind tunnel experiments are performed on a NACA 0012 airfoil capable of undergoing bending (plunging) and torsional (pitching) oscillations under scenarios involving nonlinear aerodynamic loads, i.e., dynamic stall conditions. Flow conditions under both deterministic/sterile flows and fluctuating/stochastic flows are fostered. The structure possesses continuous or polynomial-type stiffness nonlinearities, and therefore, is an aeroelastic experiment involving both structural and aerodynamic nonlinearities. We discern the bifurcation routes for a range of key structural parameters such as frequency ratio, static imbalance, and the extent of structural nonlinearity. In addition to interesting and atypical routes to stall-induced instabilities, we systematically demonstrate the role of modal interactions - via a synchronization analysis - over the manifestation of these instabilities. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is perhaps the first study to document the role of multiple structural parameters on a stall-induced aeroelastic system, and in turn, cast the physical mechanism behind these dynamical transitions from the vantage of synchronization.</description>

      <title>A Non-staggered Projection Algorithm for Two-Phase Fluid-Structure Interaction Simulation Using the Phase-Field/Immersed-Boundary Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a Pressure-Oscillation-Free projection algorithm for large-density-ratio multiphase fluid-structure interaction simulations, implemented on a non-staggered Cartesian grid. The incompressible Navier-Stokes is decoupled with an improved five-step incremental pressure correction algorithm. Fluid-fluid interface is captured using the Cahn-Hilliard equation, and the surface tension model is coupled with a momentum-weighted interpolation scheme to suppress unphysical pressure oscillations, ensuring accurate evolution of multiphase interfaces. Interaction at the fluid-structure interface is obtained by implicitly solving for the feedback acceleration in the Eulerian-Lagrangian system. For validation of the present method, the comparison studies for Pressure-Oscillation-Free effect are systematically conducted using lid driving cavity and droplet deformation cases. Moreover, several challenging multiphase simulations are implemented and discussed. As a demonstrating example of fluid-structure interaction, a rising bubble bypassing an obstacle is tested.</description>

      <title>Droplet impact behavior on a hydrophobic plate with a wettability-patterned orifice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Droplet impact behavior has attracted much attention recently due to its academic significance and diverse industrial applications. This study employs the lattice Boltzmann method to simulate the impact of a droplet on a hydrophobic plate featuring a square orifice. Unlike previous studies, the chemical property of the orifice considered in this work is not homogeneous but heterogeneous, and its cross-sectional wettability changes from hydrophobicity to hydrophilicity. The study first validates the numerical method against experimental data, and then investigates in detail the influences of the Weber number, wettability difference, and pore size. According to the numerical results, we observed that the evolutionary stages of the impinging droplet always include the spreading phase and the rebounding phase, while whether there exists the splitting phase, it depends on the combined effect of the wettability difference and the Weber number. The impact behavior of droplets is analyzed by evaluating the underlying mechanisms such as kinetic energy, surface energy, viscous dissipation energy, and pressure. It is interesting to note that the existence of wettability-patterned pore tends to promote adhesion of droplets on the plate, resulting in the droplet impact behaviors are largely different from that for the case of homogeneous pore. Additionally, a phase diagram is constructed for various Weber numbers and pore sizes, revealing that the dynamic behavior of droplets is determined by the competition among dynamic pressure, capillary pressure, and viscous pressure losses. These insights from numerical studies guide the development of innovative solid substrates capable of manipulating droplet motion.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Crossflow-Based Stabilization in Channel Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stabilization schemes in wall-bounded flows often invoke fluid transpiration through porous boundaries. While these have been extensively validated for external flows, their efficacy in channels, particularly from the standpoint of non-modal perturbations, is yet to be demonstrated. Here, we show that crossflow strengths previously considered ``ideal'' for optimizing stability in channels in fact admit strong non-modal energy amplification. We begin by supplementing existing modal calculations and then show via the resolvent that extremely strong and potentially unfeasible crossflows are required to suppress non-modal growth in linearly stable regimes. Investigation of unforced algebraic growth paints a similar picture. Here, a component-wise budget analysis reveals that energy redistribution through pressure-velocity correlations plays an important role in driving energy growth/decay. The superposition of a moving wall is also considered, and it is shown that while energy amplification generally worsens, it can potentially be suppressed beyond a regime shift in parameter space. However, these flows are marred by rapidly declining mass transport, rendering their ultimate utility questionable. Our results suggest that crossflow-based stabilization might not be useful in internal flows.</description>

      <title>A unified analytical prediction for steady-state behavior of confined drop with interface viscosity under shear flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this Letter, we fill in the blanks in the theory of drops under shear flow by unifying analytical predictions for steady-state behavior proposed by Flumerfelt [R. W. Flumerfelt, J. Colloid Interface Sci. 76, 330 (1980)] for unconfined drops with interface viscosity with the one of Shapira &amp; Haber [M. Shapira and S. Haber, Int. J. Multiph. Flow. 16, 305 (1990)] for confined drops without interface viscosity. Our predictions for both steady-state drop deformation and inclination angle are broadly valid for situations involving confined/unconfined drops, with/without interface viscosity and viscosity ratio, thus making our model so general that it can include any of the above conditions.</description>

      <title>Momentum deficit and wake-added turbulence kinetic energy budgets in the stratified atmospheric boundary layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To achieve decarbonization targets, wind turbines are growing in hub height, rotor diameter, and are being deployed in new locations with diverse atmospheric conditions not previously seen, such as offshore. Physics-based analytical wake models commonly used for design and control of wind farms simplify atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) and wake physics to achieve computational efficiency. This is done primarily through a simplified model form that neglects certain flow processes and through parameterization of ABL and wake turbulence through a wake spreading rate. In this study, we analyze the physical mechanisms that govern momentum and turbulence within a wind turbine wake in the stratified ABL. We use large eddy simulation and analysis of the streamwise momentum deficit and wake-added turbulence kinetic energy (TKE) budgets to study wind turbine wakes under neutral and stable conditions. To parse the wake from the turbulent, incident ABL flow, we decompose the flow into the base ABL flow and the deficit flow produced by the presence of a turbine. We analyze the decomposed flow field budgets to study the effects of changing stability on the streamwise momentum deficit and wake-added TKE. The results demonstrate that stability changes the importance of physical mechanisms for both quantities primarily through the nonlinear interactions of the base and deficit flows, with the stable case most affected by higher shear in the base flow and the neutral case by higher base flow TKE. Buoyancy forcing terms in the momentum deficit and wake-added TKE budgets are relatively less important compared to the aforementioned effects. While total TKE is higher in wakes in neutral ABL flows, the wake-added TKE is higher downwind of turbines in stable ABL conditions. The dependence of wake-added TKE on ABL stability is not represented in existing empirical models widely used for mean wake flow modeling.</description>

      <title>Scaling laws for Rayleigh-B\'enard convection between Navier-slip boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the two-dimensional Rayeigh-B\'enard convection problem between Navier-slip fixed-temperature boundary conditions and present a new upper bound for the Nusselt number. The result, based on a localization principle for the Nusselt number and an interpolation bound, exploits the regularity of the flow. On one hand our method yields a shorter proof of the celebrated result in Whitehead &amp; Doering (2011) in the case of free-slip boundary conditions. On the other hand, its combination with a new, refined estimate for the pressure gives a substantial improvement of the interpolation bounds in Drivas et al. (2022) for slippery boundaries. A rich description of the scaling behaviour arises from our result: depending on the magnitude of the slip-length and on the Prandtl number, our upper bounds indicate five possible scaling laws: $\textit{Nu} \sim (L_s^{-1}\textit{Ra})^{\frac{1}{3}}$, $\textit{Nu} \sim (L_s^{-\frac{2}{5}}\textit{Ra})^{\frac{5}{13}}$, $\textit{Nu} \sim \textit{Ra}^{\frac{5}{12}}$, $\textit{Nu} \sim \textit{Pr}^{-\frac{1}{6}} (L_s^{-\frac{4}{3}}\textit{Ra})^{\frac{1}{2}}$ and $\textit{Nu} \sim \textit{Pr}^{-\frac{1}{6}} (L_s^{-\frac{1}{3}}\textit{Ra})^{\frac{1}{2}}$</description>

      <title>Intermittency in the not-so-smooth elastic turbulence</title>

Abstract: Elastic turbulence is the chaotic fluid motion resulting from elastic instabilities due to the addition of polymers in small concentrations at very small Reynolds ($\mbox{Re}$) numbers. Our direct numerical simulations show that elastic turbulence, though a low $\mbox{Re}$ phenomenon, has more in common with classical, Newtonian turbulence than previously thought. In particular, we find power-law spectra for kinetic energy $E(k) \sim k^{-4}$ and polymeric energy $E_{\rm p}(k) \sim k^{-3/2}$, independent of the Deborah ($\mbox{De}$) number. This is further supported by calculation of scale-by-scale energy budget which shows a balance between the viscous term and the polymeric term in the momentum equation. In real space, as expected, the velocity field is smooth, i.e., the velocity difference across a length scale $r$, $\delta u \sim r$ but, crucially, with a non-trivial sub-leading contribution $r^{3/2}$ which we extract by using the second difference of velocity. The structure functions of second difference of velocity up to order $6$ show clear evidence of intermittency/multifractality. We provide additional evidence in support of this intermittent nature by calculating moments of rate of dissipation of kinetic energy averaged over a ball of radius $r$, $\varepsilon_{r}$, from which we compute the multifractal spectrum.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation-Induced Transitions in Anisotropic Two-Dimensional Turbulence</title>

Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) turbulence features an inverse energy cascade that produces large-scale flow structures such as large-scale vortices (LSVs) and unidirectional jets. We investigate the dynamics of such structures using extensive direct numerical simulations (DNS) of randomly forced, viscously damped 2D turbulence within a periodic rectangular (Cartesian) domain $[0,L_x]\times[0,L_y]$. LSVs form and dominate the system when the domain aspect ratio $\delta = L_x/L_y \approx 1$, while unidirectional jets predominate at $\delta \gtrsim 1.1$. At intermediate $\delta$, both structures are metastable, with noise-induced transitions between LSVs and jets. We derive and verify predictions for the dependence of kinetic energy E and flow polarity on the nondimensional control parameters. We further collect detailed statistics on the lifetimes of LSVs and jets from DNS runs that are up to 10738 viscous diffusive times long. The distribution of the lifetimes is consistent with that of a memoryless process. Our DNS show an exponential dependence of the mean lifetime on $\delta$. Mean lifetimes depend sensitively on the Reynolds number Re: as Re increases, the energy gap between LSV (lower E) and jet states (higher E) arising from anisotropic dissipation increases, leading to an approximately exponential increase in lifetimes with Re for both LSVs and jets. Similarly, as the forcing scale decreases, transitions become less frequent. We study the transitions in detail, revealing that they occur in two stages: an initial, rapid redistribution of kinetic energy by nonlinear triadic interactions deforms LSVs into jets or vice versa. In the second stage, the energy of the newly formed structure slowly adjusts to its associated equilibrium value on a longer, viscous timescale, producing hysteresis. Our findings shed new light on the dynamics of coherent large-scale structures in anisotropic turbulence.</description>

      <title>A high-fidelity finite volume scheme for ideal magnetohydrodynamics equations using boundary variation diminishing algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13015v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A high-fidelity finite volume scheme based on the BVD (boundary variation diminishing) concept is proposed in this study to solve the ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations. A hybrid spatial reconstruction profile, consisting of a quadratic polynomial and a steepness-adjustable hyperbolic tangent function, is adopted to reproduce the accurate solutions of the complex magnetohydrodynamics flows. The BVD principle is used to find a optimal combination of these two types of spatial reconstructions by comparing the variations of the interface values interpolated in two adjacent cells, aiming to remove the non-physical oscillations around discontinuities by switching the quadratic polynomial to a step-shaped function. Additionally, a constrained transport (CT) method is applied in this study to assure the non-divergent solution of the magnetic field. The widely used numerical tests in one and two dimensional cases were checked in this study. The numerical results can retrieve the accuracy of a $3^{rd}$-order linear scheme in the convergence test for both advection and MHD equations and capture the strong shock waves in MHD flows without spurious oscillations. In comparison with the results of a $3^{rd}$-order WENO (weighted essentially non-oscillatory) scheme, the proposed scheme gains more accurate solutions not only for the strong discontinuities but also the smooth structures across scales. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to build a high-fidelity model for ideal MHD equations by a BVD algorithm. Numerical results are competitive to those of existing advanced models and thus the BVD algorithm has promising potentials to build practical models for various MHD flows.</description>

      <title>Photomolecular Effect: Visible Light Absorption at Water-Vapor Interface</title>

      <description>arXiv:2202.10646v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The evaporation of water is ubiquitous in nature and industrial technologies. The known mechanism for evaporation is "thermal evaporation" which highlights the energy input for evaporation is via heat. Due to the weak absorption of water to visible light, the first step to using solar energy to evaporate water is usually by converting it into thermal energy through photothermal processes via additional absorbing materials. Contrary to this conventional wisdom, we report here strong absorption of photons in the visible spectrum at the water-vapor interface by direct cleavage of water clusters via a process we call photomolecular effect. We show that this process happens at the water-vapor interface by measuring the dependence of the photomolecular evaporation rate on the wavelength, the angle of incidence, and the polarization of the incident light. The spectra signatures in the vapor phase further support the photomolecular effect. Despite the long propagation lengths of visible light in bulk water, we demonstrate that they can heat a thin layer of fog easily, suggesting that this process is ubiquitous. The photomolecular effect will have significant implications for the earth's water cycle, global warming, plant transpiration, as well as different technologies involving the evaporation of liquids from drying to power generation</description>

Abstract: Recent work has given a systematic way for studying the kinetics of classical weakly interacting waves beyond leading order, having analogies with renormalization in quantum field theory. An important context is weak wave turbulence, occurring for waves which are small in magnitude and weakly interacting, such as those on the surface of the ocean. Here we continue the work of perturbatively computing correlation functions and the kinetic equation in this far-from-equilibrium state. In particular, we obtain the two-loop kinetic equation for waves with a cubic interaction. Our main result is a simple graphical prescription for the terms in the kinetic equation, at any order in the nonlinearity.</description>

      <title>Effect of the presence of pinned particles on the structural parameters of a liquid and correlation between structure and dynamics at the local level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10353v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pinning particles at the equilibrium configuration of the liquid is expected not to affect the structure and any property that depends on the structure while slowing down the dynamics. This leads to a breakdown of the structure dynamics correlation. Here, we calculate two structural quantities, the pair excess entropy, $S_2$, and the mean field caging potential, the inverse of which is our structural order parameter (SOP). We show that when the pinned particles are treated the same way as the mobile particles, both $S_2$ and SOP of the mobile particles remain the same as that of the unpinned system, and the structure dynamics correlation decreases with an increase in pinning density, "c". However, when we treat the pinned particles as a different species, even if we consider that the structure does not change, the expression of $S_2$ and SOP changes. The microscopic expressions show that interaction between a pinned and mobile particle affects $S_2$ and SOP more than the interaction between two mobile particles. We show that a similar effect is also present in the calculation of the excess entropy and the primary reason for the well-known vanishing of the configurational entropy at high temperatures. We further show that contrary to common belief, the pinning process does change the structure. When these two effects are considered, both $S_2$ and SOP decrease with an increase in "c", and the correlation between the structural parameters and the dynamics continues even for higher values of "c".</description>

      <title>Wave-resolving Voronoi model of Rouse number for sediment entrainment equilibrium</title>

Abstract: To integrate wave and sediment transport modeling, a computationally extensive wave-resolving Voronoi mesh-based simulation has been developed to improve upon heretofore separate sediment and spectral wave modeling. Orbital wave motion-dependent sediment transport and fine structures of the dynamic Rouse number distribution across the seabed were brought into focus. The entirely parallelized wave-resolving hydrodynamic model is demonstrated for nearshore beach waters adjacent to artificial islands in Doha Bay. The nested model was validated with tidal time series for three locations and two seasons.</description>
