      <title>Model-independent upper bounds for the price of Bermudan option with convex payoffs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Suppose $\mu$ and $\nu$ are probability measures on $\mathbb R$ satisfying $\mu \leq_{cx} \nu$. Let $a$ and $b$ be convex functions on $\mathbb R$ with $a \geq b \geq 0$. We are interested in finding \[ \sup_{\mathcal M} \sup_{\tau} \mathbb{E}^{\mathcal M} \left[ a(X) I_{ \{ \tau = 1 \} } + b(Y) I_{ \{ \tau = 2 \} } \right] \] where the first supremum is taken over consistent models $\mathcal M$ (i.e., filtered probability spaces $(\Omega, \mathcal F, \mathbb F, \mathbb P)$) such that $Z=(z,Z_1,Z_2)=(\int_{\mathbb R} x \mu(dx) = \int_{\mathbb R} y \nu(dy), X, Y)$ is a $(\mathbb F,\mathbb P)$ martingale, where $X$ has law $\mu$ and $Y$ has law $\nu$ under $\mathbb P$) and $\tau$ in the second supremum is a $(\mathbb F,\mathbb P)$-stopping time taking values in $\{1,2\}$.
  Our contributions are first to characterise and simplify the dual problem, and second to completely solve the problem in the symmetric case under the dispersion assumption. A key finding is that the canonical set-up in which the filtration is that generated by $Z$ is not rich enough to define an optimal model and additional randomisation is required. This holds even though the marginal laws $\mu$ and $\nu$ are atom-free.
  The problem has an interpretation of finding the robust, or model-free, no-arbitrage bound on the price of a Bermudan option with two possible exercise dates, given the prices of co-maturing European options.</description>

      <title>Intraday Battery Dispatch for Hybrid Renewable Energy Assets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a mathematical model for intraday dispatch of co-located wind-battery energy assets. Focusing on the primary objective of firming grid-side actual production vis-a-vis the preset day-ahead hourly generation targets, we conduct a comprehensive study of the resulting stochastic control problem across different firming formulations and wind generation dynamics. Among others, we provide a closed-form solution in the special case of a quadratic objective and linear dynamics, as well as design a novel adaptation of a Gaussian Process-based Regression Monte Carlo algorithm for our setting. Extensions studied include an asymmetric loss function for peak shaving, capturing the cost of battery cycling, and the role of battery duration. In the applied portion of our work, we calibrate our model to a collection of 140+ wind-battery assets in Texas, benchmarking the economic benefits of firming based on outputs of a realistic unit commitment and economic dispatch solver.</description>

      <title>Model-free Analysis of Dynamic Trading Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.02870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2011.02870v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a model-free approach for analyzing the risk and return for a broad class of dynamic trading strategies, including pairs trading, mean-reversion trading and other statistical arbitrage strategies, in terms of excursions of a trading signal away from a reference level. Our results are derived in a pathwise setting, without any probabilistic assumptions.
  We introduce the notion of {\delta}-excursion, defined as a path which deviates by {\delta} from a reference level before returning to this level. We show that every continuous path has a unique decomposition into {\delta}-excursions. This decomposition is useful for the scenario analysis of dynamic trading strategies, leading to simple expressions for the number of trades, realized profit, maximum loss, and drawdown. We show that the high-frequency limit of mean-reversion strategies may be described in terms of the (p-th order) local time of the signal. In particular, our results yield a financial interpretation of the local time of an irregular path. Finally, we describe a non-parametric scenario simulation method for generating paths whose excursion properties match those observed in empirical data.</description>

      <title>Pricing and hedging of SOFR derivatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.14033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.14033v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The LIBOR has served since the 1970s as a fundamental measure for floating term rates across multiple currencies and maturities. However, in 2017 the Financial Conduct Authority announced the discontinuation of LIBOR from the end of 2021 and the New York Fed declared the Treasury repo financing rate, called the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), as a candidate for a new reference rate for interest rate swaps denominated in U.S. dollars. We examine arbitrage-free pricing and hedging of swaps referencing SOFR without and with collateral backing. As hedging instruments, we take SOFR futures and idiosyncratic funding rates for the hedge and margin account. For simplicity, a one-factor model based on Vasicek's equation is used to specify the joint dynamics of several overnight interest rates, including the SOFR and unsecured funding rate.</description>
