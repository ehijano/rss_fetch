      <title>Reduced-order modeling of large-scale turbulence using Koopman $\beta$-variational autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reduced-order models (ROM) are very popular for surrogate modeling of full-order computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, allowing for real-time approximation of complex flow phenomena. However, their application to CFD models including large eddy simulation (LES) and direct numerical simulaton (DNS) is limited due to the highly chaotic and multi-scale nature of resolved turbulent flow. Due to the large amounts of noise present in small-scale turbulent structures, error propagation becomes a major issue, making long-term prediction of unsteady flow infeasible. While linear subspace methods like dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) can be used to pre-process turbulent flow data to remove small-scale structures, this often requires a very large number of modes and a non-trivial mode selection process. In this work, a ROM framework using Koopman $\beta$-variational autoencoders ($\beta$-VAEs) is introduced for reduced-order modeling of large-scale turbulence. The Koopman operator captures the variation of a non-linear dynamical system through a linear representation of state observables. By constraining the latent space of a $\beta$-VAE to grow linearly using a Koopman loss function, small-scale turbulent structures are filtered out in reconstructions of input data and latent variables are denoised in an unsupervised manner so that they can be sufficiently modeled over time. Combined with an LSTM ensemble for time series prediction of latent variables, the model is tested on LES flow past a Windsor body at multiple yaw angles, showing that the Koopman $\beta$-VAE can effectively denoise latent variables and remove small-scale structures from reconstructions while acting globally over multiple cases.</description>

      <title>Resolvent-based estimation of a turbulent wake</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a resolvent-based framework for estimating turbulent velocity fluctuations in the wake of a spanwise-periodic NACA0012 airfoil at Mach 0.3, Reynolds number 23,000, and an angle of attack of 6 degrees. Building on the methodology of Jung et al. (J. Fluid Mech. 2025, vol. 0, A1), we extend the approach to the more complex regime of a turbulent wake, which involves three primary challenges: (1) globally unstable modes in the linearized Navier-Stokes operator, (2) multi-scale turbulent structures, and (3) high-dimensional datasets. To address these challenges, we employ a data-driven approach that constructs causal resolvent-based estimation kernels from cross-spectral densities obtained via large-eddy simulations. These kernels are derived using the Wiener-Hopf method, which optimally enforces causality, thereby enhancing real-time estimation accuracy. The framework captures the spectral signatures of coherent structures and incorporates the colored statistics of nonlinear forcing terms acting on the linear system. To handle the computational demands of the high-dimensional estimation problem, we utilize parallel algorithms developed within the same framework. We further investigate sensor placement by analyzing single-sensor estimation error and coherence with target flow quantities. Results demonstrate accurate causal estimation of streamwise velocity for the spanwise-averaged, spanwise-Fourier-transformed, and mid-span flow using limited shear-stress measurements on the surface of the airfoil. This study underscores the potential of the resolvent-based framework for efficient estimation in compressible, turbulent environments.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Metachronal Paddling with Reinforcement Learning at Low Reynolds Number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metachronal paddling is a swimming strategy in which an organism oscillates sets of adjacent limbs with a constant phase lag, propagating a metachronal wave through its limbs and propelling it forward. This limb coordination strategy is utilized by swimmers across a wide range of Reynolds numbers, which suggests that this metachronal rhythm was selected for its optimality of swimming performance. In this study, we apply reinforcement learning to a swimmer at zero Reynolds number and investigate whether the learning algorithm selects this metachronal rhythm, or if other coordination patterns emerge. We design the swimmer agent with an elongated body and pairs of straight, inflexible paddles placed along the body for various fixed paddle spacings. Based on paddle spacing, the swimmer agent learns qualitatively different coordination patterns. At tight spacings, a back-to-front metachronal wave-like stroke emerges which resembles the commonly observed biological rhythm, but at wide spacings, different limb coordinations are selected. Across all resulting strokes, the fastest stroke is dependent on the number of paddles, however, the most efficient stroke is a back-to-front wave-like stroke regardless of the number of paddles.</description>

      <title>Diffusioosmotic flow in a soft microfluidic configuration induces fluid-structure instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusioosmotic flow arises in microfluidic configurations due to solute concentration gradients. In soft microfluidic channels, internal pressure gradients generated by diffusioosmotic flow to conserve mass result in elastic deformation of the channel walls, triggering fluid-structure interaction. In this work, we analyze the fluid-structure interaction between diffusioosmotic flow of an electrolyte solution and a deformable microfluidic channel. We provide insight into the physical behavior of the system by developing a reduced-order model, in which a viscous film is confined between a rigid bottom surface and an elastic top substrate, represented as a rigid plate connected to a linear spring. Considering a slender configuration and applying the lubrication approximation, we derive a set of two-way coupled governing equations describing the evolution of the fluidic film thickness and the solute concentration. Our theoretical predictions show that above a certain concentration gradient threshold, negative pressures induced by diffusioosmotic flow give rise to fluid-structure instability, causing the elastic top substrate to collapse onto the bottom surface. We employ theoretical analysis to elucidate the underlying physical mechanisms for the onset of fluid-structure instability by performing a linear stability analysis of the system and identifying three distinct dynamic regimes. We validate our theoretical results with finite-element simulations and find excellent agreement. The understanding of this instability is of fundamental importance for improving the control and design of microfluidic systems driven by diffusioosmotic flow and containing soft elements.</description>

      <title>Deterministic diffusion models for Lagrangian turbulence: robustness and encoding of extreme events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling Lagrangian turbulence remains a fundamental challenge due to its multiscale, intermittent, and non-Gaussian nature. Recent advances in data-driven diffusion models have enabled the generation of realistic Lagrangian velocity trajectories that accurately reproduce statistical properties across scales and capture rare extreme events. This study investigates three key aspects of diffusion-based modeling for Lagrangian turbulence. First, we assess architectural robustness by comparing a U-Net backbone with a transformer-based alternative, finding strong consistency in generated trajectories, with only minor discrepancies at small scales. Second, leveraging a deterministic variant of diffusion model formulation, namely the deterministic denoising diffusion implicit model (DDIM), we identify structured features in the initial latent noise that align consistently with extreme acceleration events. Third, we explore accelerated generation by reducing the number of diffusion steps, and find that DDIM enables substantial speedups with minimal loss of statistical fidelity. These findings highlight the robustness of diffusion models and their potential for interpretable, scalable modeling of complex turbulent systems.</description>

      <title>Boundary-layer transition in the age of data: from a comprehensive dataset to fine-grained prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The laminar-to-turbulent transition remains a fundamental and enduring challenge in fluid mechanics. Its complexity arises from the intrinsic nonlinearity and extreme sensitivity to external disturbances. This transition is critical in a wide range of applications, including aerospace, marine engineering, geophysical flows, and energy systems. While the governing physics can be well described by the Navier-Stokes equations, practical prediction efforts often fall short due to the lack of comprehensive models for perturbation initialization and turbulence generation in numerical simulations. To address the uncertainty introduced by unforeseeable environmental perturbations, we propose a fine-grained predictive framework that accurately predicts the transition location. The framework generates an extensive dataset using nonlinear parabolized stability equations (NPSE). NPSE simulations are performed over a wide range of randomly prescribed initial conditions for the generic zero-pressure-gradient flat-plate boundary-layer flow, resulting in a large dataset that captures the nonlinear evolution of instability waves across three canonical transition pathways (Type-K, -H, and -O). From a database of 3000 simulation cases, we extract diagnostic quantities (e.g., wall pressure signals and skin-friction coefficients) from each simulation to construct a feature set that links pre-transition flow characteristics to transition onset locations. Machine learning models are systematically evaluated, with ensemble methods-particularly XGBoost-demonstrating exceptional predictive accuracy (mean relative error of approximately 0.001). Compared to methods currently available (e.g., N-factor, transitional turbulence model), this approach accounts for the physical process and achieves transition prediction without relying on any empirical parameters.</description>

      <title>Passive cell body plays active roles in microalgal swimming via nonreciprocal interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cell body of flagellated microalgae is commonly considered to act merely as a passive load during swimming, and a larger body size would simply reduce the speed. In this work, we use numerical simulations based on a boundary element method to investigate the effect of body-flagella hydrodynamic interactions (HIs) on the swimming performance of the biflagellate, \textit{C. reinhardtii}. We find that body-flagella HIs significantly enhance the swimming speed and efficiency. As the body size increases, the competition between the enhanced HIs and the increased viscous drag leads to an optimal body size for swimming. Based on the simplified three-sphere model, we further demonstrate that the enhancement by body-flagella HIs arises from an effective nonreciprocity: the body affects the flagella more strongly during the power stroke, while the flagella affect the body more strongly during the recovery stroke. Our results have implications for both microalgal swimming and laboratory designs of biohybrid microrobots.</description>

      <title>Studying propagating turbulent structures in the near wake of a sphere using Hilbert proper orthogonal decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Turbulent flows, despite their apparent randomness, exhibit coherent structures that underpin their dynamics. Proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) has been widely used to extract these structures from experimental data. While periodic features like vortex shedding can be identified using POD mode pairs when periodicity dominates the flow, detecting such structures in complex flows is more challenging. The Hilbert proper orthogonal decomposition (HPOD) addresses this by applying POD to the analytic signal of the turbulent fluctuations, yielding complex modes with a $90^\circ$ phase shift between the real and imaginary components. These modes capture propagating structures effectively but introduce filtering artefacts from the Hilbert transform that is used to derive the analytic signal. The current work investigates the relationship between the modes of the POD and those of the HPOD on the velocity fluctuations in the wake of a sphere. By comparing their outputs, POD mode pairs that correspond to the same propagating structures revealed by HPOD are identified. Furthermore, this study explored whether computing the analytic signal of the POD modes can replicate the HPOD modes, offering a more computationally efficient method for determining the pairs of POD modes that represent propagating structures. The results show that the pairs of POD modes identified by the HPOD can be more efficiently determined using the Hilbert transform directly on the POD modes. This method enhances the interpretive power of POD, enabling more detailed analysis of turbulent dynamics without introducing the filtering from the Hilbert transform.</description>

      <title>Component-Based Machine Learning for Indoor Flow and Temperature Fields Prediction Latent Feature Aggregation and Flow Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate and efficient prediction of indoor airflow and temperature distributions is essential for building energy optimization and occupant comfort control. However, traditional CFD simulations are computationally intensive, limiting their integration into real-time or design-iterative workflows. This study proposes a component-based machine learning (CBML) surrogate modeling approach to replace conventional CFD simulation for fast prediction of indoor velocity and temperature fields. The model consists of three neural networks: a convolutional autoencoder with residual connections (CAER) to extract and compress flow features, a multilayer perceptron (MLP) to map inlet velocities to latent representations, and a convolutional neural network (CNN) as an aggregator to combine single-inlet features into dual-inlet scenarios. A two-dimensional room with varying left and right air inlet velocities is used as a benchmark case, with CFD simulations providing training and testing data. Results show that the CBML model accurately and fast predicts two-component aggregated velocity and temperature fields across both training and testing datasets.</description>

      <title>A boostlet transform for wave-based acoustic signal processing in space-time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11362v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sparse representation systems that encode signal architecture have had a profound impact on sampling and compression paradigms. Remarkable examples are multi-scale directional systems, which, similar to our vision system, encode the underlying architecture of natural images with sparse features. Inspired by this philosophy, we introduce a representation system for wave-based acoustic signal processing in 2D space--time, referred to as the \emph{boostlet transform}, which encodes sparse features of natural acoustic fields using the Poincar\'e group and isotropic dilations. Boostlets are spatiotemporal functions parametrized with dilations, Lorentz boosts, and translations in space--time. Physically speaking, boostlets are supported away from the acoustic radiation cone, i.e., having broadband frequency with phase velocities other than the speed of sound, resulting in a peculiar scaling function. We formulate a discrete boostlet frame using Meyer wavelets and bump functions and examine its sparsity properties. An analysis with experimentally measured fields indicates that discrete boostlet coefficients decay significantly faster and attain superior reconstruction performance than wavelets, curvelets, shearlets, and wave atoms. The results demonstrate that boostlets provide a natural, compact representation system for acoustic waves in space-time.</description>

      <title>Mean flow data assimilation using physics-constrained Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09476v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite their widespread use, purely data-driven methods often suffer from overfitting, lack of physical consistency, and high data dependency, particularly when physical constraints are not incorporated. This study introduces a novel data assimilation approach that integrates Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with optimisation techniques to enhance the accuracy of mean flow reconstruction, using Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations as a baseline. The method leverages the adjoint approach, incorporating RANS-derived gradients as optimisation terms during GNN training, ensuring that the learned model adheres to physical laws and maintains consistency. Additionally, the GNN framework is well-suited for handling unstructured data, which is common in the complex geometries encountered in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). The GNN is interfaced with the Finite Element Method (FEM) for numerical simulations, enabling accurate modelling in unstructured domains. We consider the reconstruction of mean flow past bluff bodies at low Reynolds numbers as a test case, addressing tasks such as sparse data recovery, denoising, and inpainting of missing flow data. The key strengths of the approach lie in its integration of physical constraints into the GNN training process, leading to accurate predictions with limited data, making it particularly valuable when data are scarce or corrupted. Results demonstrate significant improvements in the accuracy of mean flow reconstructions, even with limited training data, compared to analogous purely data-driven models.</description>

      <title>A parametric study of the pipeline hammer phenomenon in plastic Bingham slurry flows using the finite element method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00610v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We conduct a numerical study of the transient phenomenon in pipelines transporting plastic Bingham slurry flows, using a lowest-order finite element method (FEM). While most pipeline hammer studies focus on Newtonian fluids, the transient dynamics in Bingham fluids remains elusive and poorly afforded, despite their significant industrial impact, particularly in mining. A detailed parametric study assesses the effects of the slurry yield stress and the valve closure times on both pressure and velocity distributions along the pipeline, using an adaptive friction model to account for turbulent slurries. Results reveal that yield stress enhances flow resistance and accelerates pressure peak attenuation, underscoring the damping role of Bingham rheology compared to Newtonian flows. These insights emphasize the need for advanced FEM-based schemes in non-Newtonian shockwave modeling, with implications for industrial pipeline design and operational safety.</description>

      <title>Analytical and numerical solutions to the three-phase Stefan problem with simultaneous occurrences of melting, solidification, boiling, and condensation phenomena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06360v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The one-dimensional (1D) Stefan problem is a prototypical heat and mass transfer problem that analyzes the temperature distribution in a material undergoing phase change. In addition, it describes the evolution of the phase change front within the phase change material (PCM). Analytical solutions to the two-phase Stefan problem that describe melting of a solid or boiling of a liquid have been extensively discussed in the literature. Density change effects and associated fluid flow phenomena during phase change are typically ignored to simplify the analysis. As the PCM boils or condenses, it undergoes a density change of 1000 or more. The effects of density changes and convection cannot be ignored when dealing with such problems. In our recent work, we found analytical solutions to the two-phase Stefan problem that account for a jump in the thermophysical properties of the two phases, including density. In the present work, we extend our prior analyses to obtain analytical solutions to the three-phase Stefan problem in which an initially solid PCM melts and boils under imposed temperature conditions. This scenario is typical of metal additive manufacturing (AM) and welding processes, wherein a high-power laser melts and boils the metal powder or substrate. While deriving the analytical solution, all relevant jump conditions, including density and kinetic energy, are accounted for. It is shown that the three-phase Stefan problem admits similarity transformations and similarity solutions. To our knowledge, this is the first work that presents an analytical solution to the three-phase Stefan problem with simultaneous melting, solidification, boiling, and condensation (MSNBC). Furthermore, we describe a numerical method for solving the three-phase Stefan problem with second-order accuracy.</description>

      <title>Scaling and Predictability in Surface Quasi-Geostrophic Turbulence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07914v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Turbulent flows are strongly chaotic and unpredictable, with a Lyapunov exponent that increases with the Reynolds number. Here, we study the chaoticity of the Surface Quasi-geostrophic system, a two-dimensional model for geophysical flows that displays a direct cascade similar to that of three-dimensional turbulence. Using high-resolution direct numerical simulations, we investigate the dependence of the Lyapunov exponent on the Reynolds number and find an anomalous scaling exponent larger than the one predicted by dimensional arguments. We also study the finite-time fluctuation of the Lyapunov exponent by computing the Cram\'er function associated with its probability distribution. We find that the Cram\'er function attains a self-similar form at large Re.</description>

      <title>Improvement of Solid-Fluid Interaction Scheme in Lattice Boltzmann Immiscible Pseudopotential Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22256v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The pseudopotential model within the Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) framework has emerged as a prominent approach in computational fluid dynamics due to its dual strengths in physical intuitiveness and computational tractability. However, when modeling wettability phenomenon, existing solid-fluid interaction schemes exhibit persistent challenges in multi-component immiscible fluid systems, notably manifested through spurious velocity artifacts and unphysical mass-transfer boundary layers. This study presents an improved interaction scheme that preserves implementation simplicity while effectively mitigating these numerical artifacts. Furthermore, leveraging the enhanced isotropy characteristics of eighth-order discrete schemes, we develop a novel boundary treatment methodology addressing second-layer lattice data reconstruction at complex interfaces. To verify the universality of the proposed optimization scheme, four benchmark scenarios, including static contact angle measurement on cylindrical surface, droplet dynamics through confined geometries, immiscible displacement processes, and co-current flow in microchannels, are simulated to demonstrate the proposed scheme's capability. The results show that the improved scheme can well simulate various complex immiscible multiphase flows.</description>

      <title>Experimental and theoretical evidence of universality in superfluid vortex reconnections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08942v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The minimum separation between reconnecting vortices in fluids and superfluids obeys a universal scaling law with respect to time. The pre-reconnection and the post-reconnection prefactors of this scaling law are different, a property related to irreversibility and to energy transfer and dissipation mechanisms. In the present work, we determine the temperature dependence of these prefactors in superfluid helium from experiments and a numeric model which fully accounts for the coupled dynamics of the superfluid vortex lines and the thermal normal fluid component. At all temperatures, we observe a pre- and post-reconnection asymmetry similar to that observed in other superfluids and in classical viscous fluids, indicating that vortex reconnections display a universal behaviour independent of the small-scale regularising dynamics. We also numerically show that each vortex reconnection event represents a sudden injection of energy in the normal fluid. Finally we argue that in a turbulent flow, these punctuated energy injections can sustain the normal fluid in a perturbed state, provided that the density of superfluid vortices is large enough.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium distribution of the liquid phase in an unsaturated granular material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00751v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In an unsaturated granular material, the spatial distribution of the liquid phase results from the competition between gravity and capillary forces. We show that, in the funicular regime, it can be described by a Boltzmann law, with static disorder playing the role of thermal agitation. We propose an approach based on a Langevin equation to derive this distribution, and compare our predictions with conductivity measurements giving the local water content as a function of height in a wet granular medium. We show that experimental data obtained with samples of different polydispersities collapse on a single master curve consistent with our model.</description>
