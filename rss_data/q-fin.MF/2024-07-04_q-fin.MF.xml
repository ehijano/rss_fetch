      <title>DeFi's Concentrated Liquidity From Scratch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The scope of this article includes the three preeminent descriptions of concentrated liquidity from Bancor (2020 and 2022), and Uniswap (2021), as well as three additional descriptions informed by trigonometric analysis of the same. The purpose of this contribution is to organize the seminal and derivative forms of this cornerstone DeFi technology, and algebraically and geometrically elaborate these descriptions to achieve an authoritative and near-exhaustive overview of the underlying theory powering the current state-of-the-art in decentralized exchange infrastructure.

      <title>Robust optimal investment and consumption strategies with portfolio constraints and stochastic environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a continuous-time investment-consumption problem with model uncertainty in a general diffusion-based market with random model coefficients. We assume that a power utility investor is ambiguity-averse, with the preference to robustness captured by the homothetic multiplier robust specification, and the investor's investment and consumption strategies are constrained to closed convex sets. To solve this constrained robust control problem, we employ the stochastic Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman-Isaacs equations, backward stochastic differential equations, and bounded mean oscillation martingale theory. Furthermore, we show the investor incurs (non-negative) utility loss, i.e. the loss in welfare, if model uncertainty is ignored. When the model coefficients are deterministic, we establish formally the relationship between the investor's robustness preference and the robust optimal investment-consumption strategy and the value function, and the impact of investment and consumption constraints on the investor's robust optimal investment-consumption strategy and value function. Extensive numerical experiments highlight the significant impact of ambiguity aversion, consumption and investment constraints, on the investor's robust optimal investment-consumption strategy, utility loss, and value function. Key findings include: 1) short-selling restriction always reduces the investor's utility loss when model uncertainty is ignored; 2) the effect of consumption constraints on utility loss is more delicate and relies on the investor's risk aversion level.</description>

      <title>Basket Options with Volatility Skew: Calibrating a Local Volatility Model by Sample Rearrangement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The pricing of derivatives tied to baskets of assets demands a sophisticated framework that aligns with the available market information to capture the intricate non-linear dependency structure among the assets. We describe the dynamics of the multivariate process of constituents with a copula model and propose an efficient method to extract the dependency structure from the market. The proposed method generates coherent sets of samples of the constituents process through systematic sampling rearrangement. These samples are then utilized to calibrate a local volatility model (LVM) of the basket process, which is used to price basket derivatives. We show that the method is capable of efficiently pricing basket options based on a large number of basket constituents, accomplishing the calibration process within a matter of seconds, and achieving near-perfect calibration to the index options of the market.</description>

      <title>The not-so-hidden risks of 'hidden-to-maturity' accounting: on depositor runs and bank resilience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We build a balance sheet-based model to capture run risk, i.e., a reduced potential to raise capital from liquidity buffers under stress, driven by depositor scrutiny and further fueled by fire sales in response to withdrawals. The setup is inspired by the Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) meltdown in March 2023 and our model may serve as a supervisory analysis tool to monitor build-up of balance sheet vulnerabilities. Specifically, we analyze which characteristics of the balance sheet are critical in order for banking system regulators to adequately assess run risk and resilience. By bringing a time series of SVB's balance sheet data to our model, we are able to demonstrate how changes in the funding and respective asset composition made SVB prone to run risk, as they were increasingly relying on held-to-maturity, aka hidden-to-maturity, accounting standards, masking revaluation losses in securities portfolios. Finally, we formulate a tractable optimisation problem to address the designation of held-to-maturity assets and quantify banks' ability to hold these assets without resorting to remarking. By calibrating this to SVB's balance sheet data, we shed light on the bank's funding risk and implied risk tolerance in the years 2020--22 leading up to its collapse.</description>
