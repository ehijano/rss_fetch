      <title>Speech Recognition With LLMs Adapted to Disordered Speech Using Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a large language model (LLM) capable of processing speech inputs and show that tuning it further with reinforcement learning on human preference (RLHF) enables it to adapt better to disordered speech than traditional fine-tuning. Our method replaces low-frequency text tokens in an LLM's vocabulary with audio tokens and enables the model to recognize speech by fine-tuning it on speech with transcripts. We then use RL with rewards based on syntactic and semantic accuracy measures generalizing the LLM further to recognize disordered speech. While the resulting LLM does not outperform existing systems for speech recognition, we find that tuning with reinforcement learning using custom rewards leads to substantially better performance than supervised fine-tuning of the language model, specifically when adapting to speech in a different setting. This presents a compelling alternative tuning strategy for speech recognition using large language models.</description>

      <title>DiCoW: Diarization-Conditioned Whisper for Target Speaker Automatic Speech Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speaker-attributed automatic speech recognition (ASR) in multi-speaker environments remains a significant challenge, particularly when systems conditioned on speaker embeddings fail to generalize to unseen speakers. In this work, we propose Diarization-Conditioned Whisper (DiCoW), a novel approach to target-speaker ASR that leverages speaker diarization outputs as conditioning information. DiCoW extends the pre-trained Whisper model by integrating diarization labels directly, eliminating reliance on speaker embeddings and reducing the need for extensive speaker-specific training data. Our method introduces frame-level diarization-dependent transformations (FDDT) and query-key biasing (QKb) techniques to refine the model's focus on target speakers while effectively handling overlapping speech. By leveraging diarization outputs as conditioning signals, DiCoW simplifies the workflow for multi-speaker ASR, improves generalization to unseen speakers and enables more reliable transcription in real-world multi-speaker recordings. Additionally, we explore the integration of a connectionist temporal classification (CTC) head to Whisper and demonstrate its ability to improve transcription efficiency through hybrid decoding. Notably, we show that our approach is not limited to Whisper; it also provides similar benefits when applied to the Branchformer model. We validate DiCoW on real-world datasets, including AMI and NOTSOFAR-1 from CHiME-8 challenge, as well as synthetic benchmarks such as Libri2Mix and LibriCSS, enabling direct comparisons with previous methods. Results demonstrate that DiCoW enhances the model's target-speaker ASR capabilities while maintaining Whisper's accuracy and robustness on single-speaker data.</description>

      <title>Tackling Cognitive Impairment Detection from Speech: A submission to the PROCESS Challenge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work describes our group's submission to the PROCESS Challenge 2024, with the goal of assessing cognitive decline through spontaneous speech, using three guided clinical tasks. This joint effort followed a holistic approach, encompassing both knowledge-based acoustic and text-based feature sets, as well as LLM-based macrolinguistic descriptors, pause-based acoustic biomarkers, and multiple neural representations (e.g., LongFormer, ECAPA-TDNN, and Trillson embeddings). Combining these feature sets with different classifiers resulted in a large pool of models, from which we selected those that provided the best balance between train, development, and individual class performance. Our results show that our best performing systems correspond to combinations of models that are complementary to each other, relying on acoustic and textual information from all three clinical tasks.</description>

      <title>VoiceRestore: Flow-Matching Transformers for Speech Recording Quality Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present VoiceRestore, a novel approach to restoring the quality of speech recordings using flow-matching Transformers trained in a self-supervised manner on synthetic data. Our method tackles a wide range of degradations frequently found in both short and long-form speech recordings, including background noise, reverberation, compression artifacts, and bandwidth limitations - all within a single, unified model. Leveraging conditional flow matching and classifier free guidance, the model learns to map degraded speech to high quality recordings without requiring paired clean and degraded datasets. We describe the training process, the conditional flow matching framework, and the model's architecture. We also demonstrate the model's generalization to real-world speech restoration tasks, including both short utterances and extended monologues or dialogues. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations show that our approach provides a flexible and effective solution for enhancing the quality of speech recordings across varying lengths and degradation types.</description>

      <title>Automatic Text Pronunciation Correlation Generation and Application for Contextual Biasing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effectively distinguishing the pronunciation correlations between different written texts is a significant issue in linguistic acoustics. Traditionally, such pronunciation correlations are obtained through manually designed pronunciation lexicons. In this paper, we propose a data-driven method to automatically acquire these pronunciation correlations, called automatic text pronunciation correlation (ATPC). The supervision required for this method is consistent with the supervision needed for training end-to-end automatic speech recognition (E2E-ASR) systems, i.e., speech and corresponding text annotations. First, the iteratively-trained timestamp estimator (ITSE) algorithm is employed to align the speech with their corresponding annotated text symbols. Then, a speech encoder is used to convert the speech into speech embeddings. Finally, we compare the speech embeddings distances of different text symbols to obtain ATPC. Experimental results on Mandarin show that ATPC enhances E2E-ASR performance in contextual biasing and holds promise for dialects or languages lacking artificial pronunciation lexicons.</description>

      <title>SLIDE: Integrating Speech Language Model with LLM for Spontaneous Spoken Dialogue Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, ``textless" speech language models (SLMs) based on speech units have made huge progress in generating naturalistic speech, including non-verbal vocalizations. However, the generated speech samples often lack semantic coherence. In this paper, we propose SLM and LLM Integration for spontaneous spoken Dialogue gEneration (SLIDE). Specifically, we first utilize an LLM to generate the textual content of spoken dialogue. Next, we convert the textual dialogues into phoneme sequences and use a two-tower transformer-based duration predictor to predict the duration of each phoneme. Finally, an SLM conditioned on the spoken phoneme sequences is used to vocalize the textual dialogue. Experimental results on the Fisher dataset demonstrate that our system can generate naturalistic spoken dialogue while maintaining high semantic coherence.</description>

      <title>Disambiguation of Chinese Polyphones in an End-to-End Framework with Semantic Features Extracted by Pre-trained BERT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) conversion serves as an essential component in Chinese Mandarin text-to-speech (TTS) system, where polyphone disambiguation is the core issue. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end framework to predict the pronunciation of a polyphonic character, which accepts sentence containing polyphonic character as input in the form of Chinese character sequence without the necessity of any preprocessing. The proposed method consists of a pre-trained bidirectional encoder representations from Transformers (BERT) model and a neural network (NN) based classifier. The pre-trained BERT model extracts semantic features from a raw Chinese character sequence and the NN based classifier predicts the polyphonic character's pronunciation according to BERT output. In out experiments, we implemented three classifiers, a fully-connected network based classifier, a long short-term memory (LSTM) network based classifier and a Transformer block based classifier. The experimental results compared with the baseline approach based on LSTM demonstrate that, the pre-trained model extracts effective semantic features, which greatly enhances the performance of polyphone disambiguation. In addition, we also explored the impact of contextual information on polyphone disambiguation.</description>

      <title>learning discriminative features from spectrograms using center loss for speech emotion recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying the emotional state from speech is essential for the natural interaction of the machine with the speaker. However, extracting effective features for emotion recognition is difficult, as emotions are ambiguous. We propose a novel approach to learn discriminative features from variable length spectrograms for emotion recognition by cooperating softmax cross-entropy loss and center loss together. The softmax cross-entropy loss enables features from different emotion categories separable, and center loss efficiently pulls the features belonging to the same emotion category to their center. By combining the two losses together, the discriminative power will be highly enhanced, which leads to network learning more effective features for emotion recognition. As demonstrated by the experimental results, after introducing center loss, both the unweighted accuracy and weighted accuracy are improved by over 3\% on Mel-spectrogram input, and more than 4\% on Short Time Fourier Transform spectrogram input.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity of Room Impulse Responses in Changing Acoustic Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Changes in room acoustics, such as modifications to surface absorption or the insertion of a scattering object, significantly impact measured room impulse responses (RIRs). These changes can affect the performance of systems used in echo cancellation and active acoustics and support tasks such as navigation and object tracking. Recognizing and quantifying such changes is, therefore, critical for advancing technologies based on room acoustics. This study introduces a method for analyzing acoustic environment changes by evaluating the similarity of consecutively recorded RIRs. Short-time coherence is employed to characterize modifications, including changes in wall absorption or the presence of a moving person in the room. A sensitivity rating is further used to quantify the magnitude of these changes. The results clearly differentiate between types of modifications -- atmospheric variation, changes in absorption, and human presence. The methods described provide a novel approach to analyzing and interpreting room acoustics, emphasizing RIR similarity and extracting information from temporal and spectral signal properties.</description>

      <title>VoiceVector: Multimodal Enrolment Vectors for Speaker Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a transformer-based architecture for voice separation of a target speaker from multiple other speakers and ambient noise. We achieve this by using two separate neural networks: (A) An enrolment network designed to craft speaker-specific embeddings, exploiting various combinations of audio and visual modalities; and (B) A separation network that accepts both the noisy signal and enrolment vectors as inputs, outputting the clean signal of the target speaker. The novelties are: (i) the enrolment vector can be produced from: audio only, audio-visual data (using lip movements) or visual data alone (using lip movements from silent video); and (ii) the flexibility in conditioning the separation on multiple positive and negative enrolment vectors. We compare with previous methods and obtain superior performance.</description>

      <title>SECodec: Structural Entropy-based Compressive Speech Representation Codec for Speech Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), discrete speech representations have become crucial for integrating speech into LLMs. Existing methods for speech representation discretization rely on a predefined codebook size and Euclidean distance-based quantization. However, 1) the size of codebook is a critical parameter that affects both codec performance and downstream task training efficiency. 2) The Euclidean distance-based quantization may lead to audio distortion when the size of the codebook is controlled within a reasonable range. In fact, in the field of information compression, structural information and entropy guidance are crucial, but previous methods have largely overlooked these factors. Therefore, we address the above issues from an information-theoretic perspective, we present SECodec, a novel speech representation codec based on structural entropy (SE) for building speech language models. Specifically, we first model speech as a graph, clustering the speech features nodes within the graph and extracting the corresponding codebook by hierarchically and disentangledly minimizing 2D SE. Then, to address the issue of audio distortion, we propose a new quantization method. This method still adheres to the 2D SE minimization principle, adaptively selecting the most suitable token corresponding to the cluster for each incoming original speech node. Furthermore, we develop a Structural Entropy-based Speech Language Model (SESLM) that leverages SECodec. Experimental results demonstrate that SECodec performs comparably to EnCodec in speech reconstruction, and SESLM surpasses VALL-E in zero-shot text-to-speech tasks. Code, demo speeches, speech feature graph, SE codebook, and models are available at https://github.com/wlq2019/SECodec.</description>

      <title>Sound-Based Recognition of Touch Gestures and Emotions for Enhanced Human-Robot Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emotion recognition and touch gesture decoding are crucial for advancing human-robot interaction (HRI), especially in social environments where emotional cues and tactile perception play important roles. However, many humanoid robots, such as Pepper, Nao, and Furhat, lack full-body tactile skin, limiting their ability to engage in touch-based emotional and gesture interactions. In addition, vision-based emotion recognition methods usually face strict GDPR compliance challenges due to the need to collect personal facial data. To address these limitations and avoid privacy issues, this paper studies the potential of using the sounds produced by touching during HRI to recognise tactile gestures and classify emotions along the arousal and valence dimensions. Using a dataset of tactile gestures and emotional interactions from 28 participants with the humanoid robot Pepper, we design an audio-only lightweight touch gesture and emotion recognition model with only 0.24M parameters, 0.94MB model size, and 0.7G FLOPs. Experimental results show that the proposed sound-based touch gesture and emotion recognition model effectively recognises the arousal and valence states of different emotions, as well as various tactile gestures, when the input audio length varies. The proposed model is low-latency and achieves similar results as well-known pretrained audio neural networks (PANNs), but with much smaller FLOPs, parameters, and model size.</description>

      <title>Lungmix: A Mixup-Based Strategy for Generalization in Respiratory Sound Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Respiratory sound classification plays a pivotal role in diagnosing respiratory diseases. While deep learning models have shown success with various respiratory sound datasets, our experiments indicate that models trained on one dataset often fail to generalize effectively to others, mainly due to data collection and annotation \emph{inconsistencies}. To address this limitation, we introduce \emph{Lungmix}, a novel data augmentation technique inspired by Mixup. Lungmix generates augmented data by blending waveforms using loudness and random masks while interpolating labels based on their semantic meaning, helping the model learn more generalized representations. Comprehensive evaluations across three datasets, namely ICBHI, SPR, and HF, demonstrate that Lungmix significantly enhances model generalization to unseen data. In particular, Lungmix boosts the 4-class classification score by up to 3.55\%, achieving performance comparable to models trained directly on the target dataset.</description>

      <title>Ensemble of classifiers for speech evaluation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The article describes an attempt to apply an ensemble of binary classifiers to solve the problem of speech assessment in medicine. A dataset was compiled based on quantitative and expert assessments of syllable pronunciation quality. Quantitative assessments of 7 selected metrics were used as features: dynamic time warp distance, Minkowski distance, correlation coefficient, longest common subsequence (LCSS), edit distance of real se-quence (EDR), edit distance with real penalty (ERP), and merge split (MSM). Expert as-sessment of pronunciation quality was used as a class label: class 1 means high-quality speech, class 0 means distorted. A comparison of training results was carried out for five classification methods: logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), naive Bayes (NB), decision trees (DT), and K-nearest neighbors (KNN). The results of using the mixture method to build an ensemble of classifiers are also presented. The use of an en-semble for the studied data sets allowed us to slightly increase the classification accuracy compared to the use of individual binary classifiers.</description>

      <title>VoxVietnam: a Large-Scale Multi-Genre Dataset for Vietnamese Speaker Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent research in speaker recognition aims to address vulnerabilities due to variations between enrolment and test utterances, particularly in the multi-genre phenomenon where the utterances are in different speech genres. Previous resources for Vietnamese speaker recognition are either limited in size or do not focus on genre diversity, leaving studies in multi-genre effects unexplored. This paper introduces VoxVietnam, the first multi-genre dataset for Vietnamese speaker recognition with over 187,000 utterances from 1,406 speakers and an automated pipeline to construct a dataset on a large scale from public sources. Our experiments show the challenges posed by the multi-genre phenomenon to models trained on a single-genre dataset, and demonstrate a significant increase in performance upon incorporating the VoxVietnam into the training process. Our experiments are conducted to study the challenges of the multi-genre phenomenon in speaker recognition and the performance gain when the proposed dataset is used for multi-genre training.</description>

      <title>Temporal Information Reconstruction and Non-Aligned Residual in Spiking Neural Networks for Speech Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, it can be noticed that most models based on spiking neural networks (SNNs) only use a same level temporal resolution to deal with speech classification problems, which makes these models cannot learn the information of input data at different temporal scales. Additionally, owing to the different time lengths of the data before and after the sub-modules of many models, the effective residual connections cannot be applied to optimize the training processes of these models.To solve these problems, on the one hand, we reconstruct the temporal dimension of the audio spectrum to propose a novel method named as Temporal Reconstruction (TR) by referring the hierarchical processing process of the human brain for understanding speech. Then, the reconstructed SNN model with TR can learn the information of input data at different temporal scales and model more comprehensive semantic information from audio data because it enables the networks to learn the information of input data at different temporal resolutions. On the other hand, we propose the Non-Aligned Residual (NAR) method by analyzing the audio data, which allows the residual connection can be used in two audio data with different time lengths. We have conducted plentiful experiments on the Spiking Speech Commands (SSC), the Spiking Heidelberg Digits (SHD), and the Google Speech Commands v0.02 (GSC) datasets. According to the experiment results, we have achieved the state-of-the-art (SOTA) result 81.02\% on SSC for the test classification accuracy of all SNN models, and we have obtained the SOTA result 96.04\% on SHD for the classification accuracy of all models.</description>

      <title>TSPE: Task-Specific Prompt Ensemble for Improved Zero-Shot Audio Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Audio-language models (ALMs) excel in zero-shot audio classification, a task where models classify previously unseen audio clips at test time by leveraging descriptive natural language prompts. We introduce TSPE (Task-Specific Prompt Ensemble), a simple, training-free hard prompting method that boosts ALEs' zero-shot performance by customizing prompts for diverse audio classification tasks. Rather than using generic template-based prompts like "Sound of a car" we generate context-rich prompts, such as "Sound of a car coming from a tunnel". Specifically, we leverage label information to identify suitable sound attributes, such as "loud" and "feeble", and appropriate sound sources, such as "tunnel" and "street" and incorporate this information into the prompts used by Audio-Language Models (ALMs) for audio classification. Further, to enhance audio-text alignment, we perform prompt ensemble across TSPE-generated task-specific prompts. When evaluated on 12 diverse audio classification datasets, TSPE improves performance across ALMs by showing an absolute improvement of 1.23-16.36% over vanilla zero-shot evaluation.</description>

      <title>Whisper Turns Stronger: Augmenting Wav2Vec 2.0 for Superior ASR in Low-Resource Languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Approaching Speech-to-Text and Automatic Speech Recognition problems in low-resource languages is notoriously challenging due to the scarcity of validated datasets and the diversity of dialects. Arabic, Russian, and Portuguese exemplify these difficulties, being low-resource languages due to the many dialects of these languages across different continents worldwide. Moreover, the variety of accents and pronunciations of such languages complicate ASR models' success. With the increasing popularity of Deep Learning and Transformers, acoustic models like the renowned Wav2Vec2 have achieved superior performance in the Speech Recognition field compared to state-of-the-art approaches. However, despite Wav2Vec2's improved efficiency over traditional methods, its performance significantly declines for under-represented languages, even though it requires significantly less labeled data. This paper introduces an end-to-end framework that enhances ASR systems fine-tuned on Wav2Vec2 through data augmentation techniques. To validate our framework's effectiveness, we conducted a detailed experimental evaluation using three datasets from Mozilla's Common Voice project in Arabic, Russian, and Portuguese. Additionally, the framework presented in this paper demonstrates robustness to different diacritics. Ultimately, our approach outperforms two previous baseline models, which are the pre-trained Wav2Vec2 and the well-known Whisper ASR model, resulting in an average relative improvement of 33.9\% in Word Error Rate and a 53.2\% relative improvement in Character Error Rate.</description>

      <title>Unrolled Creative Adversarial Network For Generating Novel Musical Pieces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Music generation has been established as a prominent topic in artificial intelligence and machine learning over recent years. In most recent works on RNN-based neural network methods have been applied for sequence generation. In contrast, generative adversarial networks (GANs) and their counterparts have been explored by very few researchersfor music generation.
  In this paper, a classical system was employed alongside a new system to generate creative music. Both systems were designed based on adversarial networks to generate music by learning from examples. The classical system was trained to learn a set of music pieces without differentiating between classes, whereas the new system was trained to learn the different composers and their styles to generate a creative music piece by deviating from the learned composers' styles.
  The base structure utilized was generative adversarial networks (GANs), which are capable of generating novel outputs given a set of inputs to learn from and mimic their distribution. It has been shown in previous work that GANs are limited in their original design with respect to creative outputs. Building on the Creative Adversarial Networks (CAN) , this work applied them in the music domain rather than the visual art domain. Additionally, unrolled CAN was introduced to prevent mode collapse. Experiments were conducted on both GAN and CAN for generating music, and their capabilities were measured in terms of deviation from the input set.</description>

      <title>Fotheidil: an Automatic Transcription System for the Irish Language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper sets out the first web-based transcription system for the Irish language - Fotheidil, a system that utilises speech-related AI technologies as part of the ABAIR initiative. The system includes both off-the-shelf pre-trained voice activity detection and speaker diarisation models and models trained specifically for Irish automatic speech recognition and capitalisation and punctuation restoration. Semi-supervised learning is explored to improve the acoustic model of a modular TDNN-HMM ASR system, yielding substantial improvements for out-of-domain test sets and dialects that are underrepresented in the supervised training set. A novel approach to capitalisation and punctuation restoration involving sequence-to-sequence models is compared with the conventional approach using a classification model. Experimental results show here also substantial improvements in performance. The system will be made freely available for public use, and represents an important resource to researchers and others who transcribe Irish language materials. Human-corrected transcriptions will be collected and included in the training dataset as the system is used, which should lead to incremental improvements to the ASR model in a cyclical, community-driven fashion.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Speech-Input Length for Speaker-Independent Depression Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning models for speech-based depression classification offer promise for health care applications. Despite growing work on depression classification, little is understood about how the length of speech-input impacts model performance. We analyze results for speaker-independent depression classification using a corpus of over 1400 hours of speech from a human-machine health screening application. We examine performance as a function of response input length for two NLP systems that differ in overall performance.
  Results for both systems show that performance depends on natural length, elapsed length, and ordering of the response within a session. Systems share a minimum length threshold, but differ in a response saturation threshold, with the latter higher for the better system. At saturation it is better to pose a new question to the speaker, than to continue the current response. These and additional reported results suggest how applications can be better designed to both elicit and process optimal input lengths for depression classification.</description>

      <title>Toward Corpus Size Requirements for Training and Evaluating Depression Risk Models Using Spoken Language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mental health risk prediction is a growing field in the speech community, but many studies are based on small corpora. This study illustrates how variations in test and train set sizes impact performance in a controlled study. Using a corpus of over 65K labeled data points, results from a fully crossed design of different train/test size combinations are provided. Two model types are included: one based on language and the other on speech acoustics. Both use methods current in this domain. An age-mismatched test set was also included. Results show that (1) test sizes below 1K samples gave noisy results, even for larger training set sizes; (2) training set sizes of at least 2K were needed for stable results; (3) NLP and acoustic models behaved similarly with train/test size variations, and (4) the mismatched test set showed the same patterns as the matched test set. Additional factors are discussed, including label priors, model strength and pre-training, unique speakers, and data lengths. While no single study can specify exact size requirements, results demonstrate the need for appropriately sized train and test sets for future studies of mental health risk prediction from speech and language.</description>

      <title>SoundBrush: Sound as a Brush for Visual Scene Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose SoundBrush, a model that uses sound as a brush to edit and manipulate visual scenes. We extend the generative capabilities of the Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) to incorporate audio information for editing visual scenes. Inspired by existing image-editing works, we frame this task as a supervised learning problem and leverage various off-the-shelf models to construct a sound-paired visual scene dataset for training. This richly generated dataset enables SoundBrush to learn to map audio features into the textual space of the LDM, allowing for visual scene editing guided by diverse in-the-wild sound. Unlike existing methods, SoundBrush can accurately manipulate the overall scenery or even insert sounding objects to best match the audio inputs while preserving the original content. Furthermore, by integrating with novel view synthesis techniques, our framework can be extended to edit 3D scenes, facilitating sound-driven 3D scene manipulation. Demos are available at https://soundbrush.github.io/.</description>

      <title>U-GIFT: Uncertainty-Guided Firewall for Toxic Speech in Few-Shot Scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the widespread use of social media, user-generated content has surged on online platforms. When such content includes hateful, abusive, offensive, or cyberbullying behavior, it is classified as toxic speech, posing a significant threat to the online ecosystem's integrity and safety. While manual content moderation is still prevalent, the overwhelming volume of content and the psychological strain on human moderators underscore the need for automated toxic speech detection. Previously proposed detection methods often rely on large annotated datasets; however, acquiring such datasets is both costly and challenging in practice. To address this issue, we propose an uncertainty-guided firewall for toxic speech in few-shot scenarios, U-GIFT, that utilizes self-training to enhance detection performance even when labeled data is limited. Specifically, U-GIFT combines active learning with Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) to automatically identify high-quality samples from unlabeled data, prioritizing the selection of pseudo-labels with higher confidence for training based on uncertainty estimates derived from model predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that U-GIFT significantly outperforms competitive baselines in few-shot detection scenarios. In the 5-shot setting, it achieves a 14.92\% performance improvement over the basic model. Importantly, U-GIFT is user-friendly and adaptable to various pre-trained language models (PLMs). It also exhibits robust performance in scenarios with sample imbalance and cross-domain settings, while showcasing strong generalization across various language applications. We believe that U-GIFT provides an efficient solution for few-shot toxic speech detection, offering substantial support for automated content moderation in cyberspace, thereby acting as a firewall to promote advancements in cybersecurity.</description>

      <title>Advancing Singlish Understanding: Bridging the Gap with Datasets and Multimodal Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Singlish, a Creole language rooted in English, is a key focus in linguistic research within multilingual and multicultural contexts. However, its spoken form remains underexplored, limiting insights into its linguistic structure and applications. To address this gap, we standardize and annotate the largest spoken Singlish corpus, introducing the Multitask National Speech Corpus (MNSC). These datasets support diverse tasks, including Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), Spoken Question Answering (SQA), Spoken Dialogue Summarization (SDS), and Paralinguistic Question Answering (PQA). We release standardized splits and a human-verified test set to facilitate further research. Additionally, we propose SingAudioLLM, a multi-task multimodal model leveraging multimodal large language models to handle these tasks concurrently. Experiments reveal our models adaptability to Singlish context, achieving state-of-the-art performance and outperforming prior models by 10-30% in comparison with other AudioLLMs and cascaded solutions.</description>

      <title>Time Difference of Arrival Source Localization: Exact Linear Solutions for the General 3D Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The time difference of arrival (TDOA) problem admits exact, purely algebraic solutions for the situation in which there are 4 and 5 sensors and a single source whose position is to be determined in 3 dimensions. The solutions are exact in the sense that there is no least squares operation (i.e., projection) involved in the solution. The solutions involve no linearization or iteration, and are algebraically transparent via vector algebra in Cartesian coordinates. The solution with 5 sensors requires no resolution of sign ambiguities; the solution with 4 sensors requires resolution of one sign ambiguity. Solutions are effected using only TDOA and not, e.g., frequency difference of arrival (FDOA) or angle of arrival (AOA).
  We first present the 5-sensor solution and then follow with the 4-sensor scenario. Numerical experiments are presented showing the performance of the calculations in the case of no noise, before closing with conclusions. Performance of the calculations is exact within numerical error, and in the small fraction of cases in which source localization does not occur, it is driven by misidentification in resolution of sign ambiguity without priors. We therefore believe the calculations have substantial practical utility for their speed and exactness.</description>

      <title>MMVA: Multimodal Matching Based on Valence and Arousal across Images, Music, and Musical Captions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Multimodal Matching based on Valence and Arousal (MMVA), a tri-modal encoder framework designed to capture emotional content across images, music, and musical captions. To support this framework, we expand the Image-Music-Emotion-Matching-Net (IMEMNet) dataset, creating IMEMNet-C which includes 24,756 images and 25,944 music clips with corresponding musical captions. We employ multimodal matching scores based on the continuous valence (emotional positivity) and arousal (emotional intensity) values. This continuous matching score allows for random sampling of image-music pairs during training by computing similarity scores from the valence-arousal values across different modalities. Consequently, the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in valence-arousal prediction tasks. Furthermore, the framework demonstrates its efficacy in various zeroshot tasks, highlighting the potential of valence and arousal predictions in downstream applications.</description>

      <title>FAST: Fast Audio Spectrogram Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In audio classification, developing efficient and robust models is critical for real-time applications. Inspired by the design principles of MobileViT, we present FAST (Fast Audio Spectrogram Transformer), a new architecture that combines convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformers to capitalize on the strengths of both. FAST integrates the local feature extraction efficiencies of CNNs with the global context modeling capabilities of transformers, resulting in a model that is powerful yet lightweight, well-suited to a real-time or mobile use case. Additionally, we incorporate Lipschitz continuous attention mechanisms to improve training stability and accelerate convergence. We evaluate FAST on the ADIMA dataset, a multilingual corpus towards real-time profanity and abuse detection, as well as on the more traditional AudioSet. Our results show that FAST achieves state-of-the-art performance on both the ADIMA and AudioSet classification tasks and in some cases surpasses existing benchmarks while using up to 150x fewer parameters.</description>

      <title>MuQ: Self-Supervised Music Representation Learning with Mel Residual Vector Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent years have witnessed the success of foundation models pre-trained with self-supervised learning (SSL) in various music informatics understanding tasks, including music tagging, instrument classification, key detection, and more. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised music representation learning model for music understanding. Distinguished from previous studies adopting random projection or existing neural codec, the proposed model, named MuQ, is trained to predict tokens generated by Mel Residual Vector Quantization (Mel-RVQ). Our Mel-RVQ utilizes residual linear projection structure for Mel spectrum quantization to enhance the stability and efficiency of target extraction and lead to better performance. Experiments in a large variety of downstream tasks demonstrate that MuQ outperforms previous self-supervised music representation models with only 0.9K hours of open-source pre-training data. Scaling up the data to over 160K hours and adopting iterative training consistently improve the model performance. To further validate the strength of our model, we present MuQ-MuLan, a joint music-text embedding model based on contrastive learning, which achieves state-of-the-art performance in the zero-shot music tagging task on the MagnaTagATune dataset. Code and checkpoints are open source in https://github.com/tencent-ailab/MuQ.</description>

      <title>Robust COVID-19 Detection from Cough Sounds using Deep Neural Decision Tree and Forest: A Comprehensive Cross-Datasets Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This research presents a robust approach to classifying COVID-19 cough sounds using cutting-edge machine-learning techniques. Leveraging deep neural decision trees and deep neural decision forests, our methodology demonstrates consistent performance across diverse cough sound datasets. We begin with a comprehensive extraction of features to capture a wide range of audio features from individuals, whether COVID-19 positive or negative. To determine the most important features, we use recursive feature elimination along with cross-validation. Bayesian optimization fine-tunes hyper-parameters of deep neural decision tree and deep neural decision forest models. Additionally, we integrate the SMOTE during training to ensure a balanced representation of positive and negative data. Model performance refinement is achieved through threshold optimization, maximizing the ROC-AUC score. Our approach undergoes a comprehensive evaluation in five datasets: Cambridge, Coswara, COUGHVID, Virufy, and the combined Virufy with the NoCoCoDa dataset. Consistently outperforming state-of-the-art methods, our proposed approach yields notable AUC scores of 0.97, 0.98, 0.92, 0.93, 0.99, and 0.99 across the respective datasets. Merging all datasets into a combined dataset, our method, using a deep neural decision forest classifier, achieves an AUC of 0.97. Also, our study includes a comprehensive cross-datasets analysis, revealing demographic and geographic differences in the cough sounds associated with COVID-19. These differences highlight the challenges in transferring learned features across diverse datasets and underscore the potential benefits of dataset integration, improving generalizability and enhancing COVID-19 detection from audio signals.</description>

      <title>RingFormer: A Neural Vocoder with Ring Attention and Convolution-Augmented Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While transformers demonstrate outstanding performance across various audio tasks, their application to neural vocoders remains challenging. Neural vocoders require the generation of long audio signals at the sample level, which demands high temporal resolution. This results in significant computational costs for attention map generation and limits their ability to efficiently process both global and local information. Additionally, the sequential nature of sample generation in neural vocoders poses difficulties for real-time processing, making the direct adoption of transformers impractical. To address these challenges, we propose RingFormer, a neural vocoder that incorporates the ring attention mechanism into a lightweight transformer variant, the convolution-augmented transformer (Conformer). Ring attention effectively captures local details while integrating global information, making it well-suited for processing long sequences and enabling real-time audio generation. RingFormer is trained using adversarial training with two discriminators. The proposed model is applied to the decoder of the text-to-speech model VITS and compared with state-of-the-art vocoders such as HiFi-GAN, iSTFT-Net, and BigVGAN under identical conditions using various objective and subjective metrics. Experimental results show that RingFormer achieves comparable or superior performance to existing models, particularly excelling in real-time audio generation. Our code and audio samples are available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>AdaptVC: High Quality Voice Conversion with Adaptive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The goal of voice conversion is to transform the speech of a source speaker to sound like that of a reference speaker while preserving the original content. A key challenge is to extract disentangled linguistic content from the source and voice style from the reference. While existing approaches leverage various methods to isolate the two, a generalization still requires further attention, especially for robustness in zero-shot scenarios. In this paper, we achieve successful disentanglement of content and speaker features by tuning self-supervised speech features with adapters. The adapters are trained to dynamically encode nuanced features from rich self-supervised features, and the decoder fuses them to produce speech that accurately resembles the reference with minimal loss of content. Moreover, we leverage a conditional flow matching decoder with cross-attention speaker conditioning to further boost the synthesis quality and efficiency. Subjective and objective evaluations in a zero-shot scenario demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing models in speech quality and similarity to the reference speech.</description>

      <title>OmniChat: Enhancing Spoken Dialogue Systems with Scalable Synthetic Data for Diverse Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapid development of large language models, researchers have created increasingly advanced spoken dialogue systems that can naturally converse with humans. However, these systems still struggle to handle the full complexity of real-world conversations, including audio events, musical contexts, and emotional expressions, mainly because current dialogue datasets are constrained in both scale and scenario diversity. In this paper, we propose leveraging synthetic data to enhance the dialogue models across diverse scenarios. We introduce ShareChatX, the first comprehensive, large-scale dataset for spoken dialogue that spans diverse scenarios. Based on this dataset, we introduce OmniChat, a multi-turn dialogue system with a heterogeneous feature fusion module, designed to optimize feature selection in different dialogue contexts. In addition, we explored critical aspects of training dialogue systems using synthetic data. Through comprehensive experimentation, we determined the ideal balance between synthetic and real data, achieving state-of-the-art results on the real-world dialogue dataset DailyTalk. We also highlight the crucial importance of synthetic data in tackling diverse, complex dialogue scenarios, especially those involving audio and music.

      <title>An investigation of phrase break prediction in an End-to-End TTS system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.04157v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Purpose: This work explores the use of external phrase break prediction models to enhance listener comprehension in End-to-End Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems.
  Methods: The effectiveness of these models is evaluated based on listener preferences in subjective tests. Two approaches are explored: (1) a bidirectional LSTM model with task-specific embeddings trained from scratch, and (2) a pre-trained BERT model fine-tuned on phrase break prediction. Both models are trained on a multi-speaker English corpus to predict phrase break locations in text. The End-to-End TTS system used comprises a Tacotron2 model with Dynamic Convolutional Attention for mel spectrogram prediction and a WaveRNN vocoder for waveform generation.
  Results: The listening tests show a clear preference for text synthesized with predicted phrase breaks over text synthesized without them.
  Conclusion: These results confirm the value of incorporating external phrasing models within End-to-End TTS to enhance listener comprehension.</description>

      <title>Multi-Scale Accent Modeling and Disentangling for Multi-Speaker Multi-Accent Text-to-Speech Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10844v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generating speech across different accents while preserving speaker identity is crucial for various real-world applications. However, accurately and independently modeling both speaker and accent characteristics in text-to-speech (TTS) systems is challenging due to the complex variations of accents and the inherent entanglement between speaker and accent identities. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for multi-speaker multi-accent TTS synthesis that aims to synthesize speech for multiple speakers, each with various accents. Our approach employs a multi-scale accent modeling strategy to address accent variations on different levels. Specifically, we introduce both global (utterance level) and local (phoneme level) accent modeling to capture overall accent characteristics within an utterance and fine-grained accent variations across phonemes, respectively. To enable independent control of speakers and accents, we use the speaker embedding to represent speaker identity and achieve speaker-independent accent control through speaker disentanglement within the multi-scale accent modeling. Additionally, we present a local accent prediction model that enables our system to generate accented speech directly from phoneme inputs. We conduct extensive experiments on an English accented speech corpus. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed system outperforms baseline systems in terms of speech quality and accent rendering for generating multi-speaker multi-accent speech. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of different components in our proposed system.</description>

      <title>SSR-Speech: Towards Stable, Safe and Robust Zero-shot Text-based Speech Editing and Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07556v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce SSR-Speech, a neural codec autoregressive model designed for stable, safe, and robust zero-shot textbased speech editing and text-to-speech synthesis. SSR-Speech is built on a Transformer decoder and incorporates classifier-free guidance to enhance the stability of the generation process. A watermark Encodec is proposed to embed frame-level watermarks into the edited regions of the speech so that which parts were edited can be detected. In addition, the waveform reconstruction leverages the original unedited speech segments, providing superior recovery compared to the Encodec model. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in the RealEdit speech editing task and the LibriTTS text-to-speech task, surpassing previous methods. Furthermore, SSR-Speech excels in multi-span speech editing and also demonstrates remarkable robustness to background sounds. The source code and demos are released.</description>

      <title>SoloAudio: Target Sound Extraction with Language-oriented Audio Diffusion Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08425v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce SoloAudio, a novel diffusion-based generative model for target sound extraction (TSE). Our approach trains latent diffusion models on audio, replacing the previous U-Net backbone with a skip-connected Transformer that operates on latent features. SoloAudio supports both audio-oriented and language-oriented TSE by utilizing a CLAP model as the feature extractor for target sounds. Furthermore, SoloAudio leverages synthetic audio generated by state-of-the-art text-to-audio models for training, demonstrating strong generalization to out-of-domain data and unseen sound events. We evaluate this approach on the FSD Kaggle 2018 mixture dataset and real data from AudioSet, where SoloAudio achieves the state-of-the-art results on both in-domain and out-of-domain data, and exhibits impressive zero-shot and few-shot capabilities. Source code and demos are released.</description>

      <title>Guided Speaker Embedding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12182v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a guided speaker embedding extraction system, which extracts speaker embeddings of the target speaker using speech activities of target and interference speakers as clues. Several methods for long-form overlapped multi-speaker audio processing are typically two-staged: i) segment-level processing and ii) inter-segment speaker matching. Speaker embeddings are often used for the latter purpose. Typical speaker embedding extraction approaches only use single-speaker intervals to avoid corrupting the embeddings with speech from interference speakers. However, this often makes speaker embeddings impossible to extract because sufficiently long non-overlapping intervals are not always available. In this paper, we propose using speaker activities as clues to extract the embedding of the speaker-of-interest directly from overlapping speech. Specifically, we concatenate the activity of target and non-target speakers to acoustic features before being fed to the model. We also condition the attention weights used for pooling so that the attention weights of the intervals in which the target speaker is inactive are zero. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated in speaker verification and speaker diarization.</description>

      <title>Can Large Audio-Language Models Truly Hear? Tackling Hallucinations with Multi-Task Assessment and Stepwise Audio Reasoning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16130v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in large audio-language models (LALMs) have shown impressive capabilities in understanding and reasoning about audio and speech information. However, these models still face challenges, including hallucinating non-existent sound events, misidentifying the order of sound events, and incorrectly attributing sound sources, which undermine their reliability and real-world application. To systematically evaluate these issues, we propose three distinct tasks: object existence, temporal order, and object attribute within audio. These tasks assess the models' comprehension of critical audio information aspects. Our experimental results reveal limitations in these fundamental tasks, underscoring the need for better models in recognizing specific sound events, determining event sequences, and identifying sound sources. To improve performance in these areas, we introduce a multi-turn chain-of-thought approach, which demonstrates significantly improved model performance across the proposed tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07607v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: CTC compressor can be an effective approach to integrate audio encoders to decoder-only models, which has gained growing interest for different speech applications. In this work, we propose a novel CTC compressor based joint speech and text training (CJST) framework for decoder-only ASR. CJST matches speech and text modalities from both directions by exploring a simple modality adaptor and several features of the CTC compressor, including sequence compression, on-the-fly forced peaky alignment and CTC class embeddings. Experimental results on the Librispeech and TED-LIUM2 corpora show that the proposed CJST achieves an effective text injection without the need of duration handling, leading to the best performance for both in-domain and cross-domain scenarios. We also provide a comprehensive study on CTC compressor, covering various compression modes, edge case handling and behavior under both clean and noisy data conditions, which reveals the most robust setting to use CTC compressor for decoder-only models.</description>

      <title>Speech Retrieval-Augmented Generation without Automatic Speech Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16500v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One common approach for question answering over speech data is to first transcribe speech using automatic speech recognition (ASR) and then employ text-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) on the transcriptions. While this cascaded pipeline has proven effective in many practical settings, ASR errors can propagate to the retrieval and generation steps. To overcome this limitation, we introduce SpeechRAG, a novel framework designed for open-question answering over spoken data. Our proposed approach fine-tunes a pre-trained speech encoder into a speech adapter fed into a frozen large language model (LLM)--based retrieval model. By aligning the embedding spaces of text and speech, our speech retriever directly retrieves audio passages from text-based queries, leveraging the retrieval capacity of the frozen text retriever. Our retrieval experiments on spoken question answering datasets show that direct speech retrieval does not degrade over the text-based baseline, and outperforms the cascaded systems using ASR. For generation, we use a speech language model (SLM) as a generator, conditioned on audio passages rather than transcripts. Without fine-tuning of the SLM, this approach outperforms cascaded text-based models when there is high WER in the transcripts.</description>

      <title>Sound-VECaps: Improving Audio Generation with Visual Enhanced Captions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04416v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative models have shown significant achievements in audio generation tasks. However, existing models struggle with complex and detailed prompts, leading to potential performance degradation. We hypothesize that this problem stems from the simplicity and scarcity of the training data. This work aims to create a large-scale audio dataset with rich captions for improving audio generation models. We first develop an automated pipeline to generate detailed captions by transforming predicted visual captions, audio captions, and tagging labels into comprehensive descriptions using a Large Language Model (LLM). The resulting dataset, Sound-VECaps, comprises 1.66M high-quality audio-caption pairs with enriched details including audio event orders, occurred places and environment information. We then demonstrate that training the text-to-audio generation models with Sound-VECaps significantly improves the performance on complex prompts. Furthermore, we conduct ablation studies of the models on several downstream audio-language tasks, showing the potential of Sound-VECaps in advancing audio-text representation learning. Our dataset and models are available online from here https://yyua8222.github.io/Sound-VECaps-demo/.</description>

      <title>Personalized Lip Reading: Adapting to Your Unique Lip Movements with Vision and Language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00986v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lip reading aims to predict spoken language by analyzing lip movements. Despite advancements in lip reading technologies, performance degrades when models are applied to unseen speakers due to their sensitivity to variations in visual information such as lip appearances. To address this challenge, speaker adaptive lip reading technologies have advanced by focusing on effectively adapting a lip reading model to target speakers in the visual modality. However, the effectiveness of adapting language information, such as vocabulary choice, of the target speaker has not been explored in previous works. Additionally, existing datasets for speaker adaptation have limited vocabulary sizes and pose variations, which restrict the validation of previous speaker-adaptive methods in real-world scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a novel speaker-adaptive lip reading method that adapts a pre-trained model to target speakers at both vision and language levels. Specifically, we integrate prompt tuning and the LoRA approach, applying them to a pre-trained lip reading model to effectively adapt the model to target speakers. Furthermore, to validate its effectiveness in real-world scenarios, we introduce a new dataset, VoxLRS-SA, derived from VoxCeleb2 and LRS3. It contains a vocabulary of approximately 100K words, offers diverse pose variations, and enables the validation of adaptation methods in the wild, sentence-level lip reading for the first time in English. Through various experiments, we demonstrate that the existing speaker-adaptive method also improves performance in the wild at the sentence level. Moreover, we show that the proposed method achieves larger improvements compared to the previous works.</description>

      <title>FlowSep: Language-Queried Sound Separation with Rectified Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07614v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Language-queried audio source separation (LASS) focuses on separating sounds using textual descriptions of the desired sources. Current methods mainly use discriminative approaches, such as time-frequency masking, to separate target sounds and minimize interference from other sources. However, these models face challenges when separating overlapping soundtracks, which may lead to artifacts such as spectral holes or incomplete separation. Rectified flow matching (RFM), a generative model that establishes linear relations between the distribution of data and noise, offers superior theoretical properties and simplicity, but has not yet been explored in sound separation. In this work, we introduce FlowSep, a new generative model based on RFM for LASS tasks. FlowSep learns linear flow trajectories from noise to target source features within the variational autoencoder (VAE) latent space. During inference, the RFM-generated latent features are reconstructed into a mel-spectrogram via the pre-trained VAE decoder, followed by a pre-trained vocoder to synthesize the waveform. Trained on 1,680 hours of audio data, FlowSep outperforms the state-of-the-art models across multiple benchmarks, as evaluated with subjective and objective metrics. Additionally, our results show that FlowSep surpasses a diffusion-based LASS model in both separation quality and inference efficiency, highlighting its strong potential for audio source separation tasks.

      <title>M2R-Whisper: Multi-stage and Multi-scale Retrieval Augmentation for Enhancing Whisper</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11889v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: State-of-the-art models like OpenAI's Whisper exhibit strong performance in multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR), but they still face challenges in accurately recognizing diverse subdialects. In this paper, we propose M2R-whisper, a novel multi-stage and multi-scale retrieval augmentation approach designed to enhance ASR performance in low-resource settings. Building on the principles of in-context learning (ICL) and retrieval-augmented techniques, our method employs sentence-level ICL in the pre-processing stage to harness contextual information, while integrating token-level k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) retrieval as a post-processing step to further refine the final output distribution. By synergistically combining sentence-level and token-level retrieval strategies, M2R-whisper effectively mitigates various types of recognition errors. Experiments conducted on Mandarin and subdialect datasets, including AISHELL-1 and KeSpeech, demonstrate substantial improvements in ASR accuracy, all achieved without any parameter updates.</description>

      <title>Audio Array-Based 3D UAV Trajectory Estimation with LiDAR Pseudo-Labeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12698v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) become increasingly prevalent, there is growing concern regarding their impact on public safety and privacy, highlighting the need for advanced tracking and trajectory estimation solutions. In response, this paper introduces a novel framework that utilizes audio array for 3D UAV trajectory estimation. Our approach incorporates a self-supervised learning model, starting with the conversion of audio data into mel-spectrograms, which are analyzed through an encoder to extract crucial temporal and spectral information. Simultaneously, UAV trajectories are estimated using LiDAR point clouds via unsupervised methods. These LiDAR-based estimations act as pseudo labels, enabling the training of an Audio Perception Network without requiring labeled data. In this architecture, the LiDAR-based system operates as the Teacher Network, guiding the Audio Perception Network, which serves as the Student Network. Once trained, the model can independently predict 3D trajectories using only audio signals, with no need for LiDAR data or external ground truth during deployment. To further enhance precision, we apply Gaussian Process modeling for improved spatiotemporal tracking. Our method delivers top-tier performance on the MMAUD dataset, establishing a new benchmark in trajectory estimation using self-supervised learning techniques without reliance on ground truth annotations.</description>

      <title>TAME: Temporal Audio-based Mamba for Enhanced Drone Trajectory Estimation and Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13037v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The increasing prevalence of compact UAVs has introduced significant risks to public safety, while traditional drone detection systems are often bulky and costly. To address these challenges, we present TAME, the Temporal Audio-based Mamba for Enhanced Drone Trajectory Estimation and Classification. This innovative anti-UAV detection model leverages a parallel selective state-space model to simultaneously capture and learn both the temporal and spectral features of audio, effectively analyzing propagation of sound. To further enhance temporal features, we introduce a Temporal Feature Enhancement Module, which integrates spectral features into temporal data using residual cross-attention. This enhanced temporal information is then employed for precise 3D trajectory estimation and classification. Our model sets a new standard of performance on the MMUAD benchmarks, demonstrating superior accuracy and effectiveness. The code and trained models are publicly available on GitHub \url{https://github.com/AmazingDay1/TAME}.</description>

      <title>Stable-V2A: Synthesis of Synchronized Sound Effects with Temporal and Semantic Controls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15023v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sound designers and Foley artists usually sonorize a scene, such as from a movie or video game, by manually annotating and sonorizing each action of interest in the video. In our case, the intent is to leave full creative control to sound designers with a tool that allows them to bypass the more repetitive parts of their work, thus being able to focus on the creative aspects of sound production. We achieve this presenting Stable-V2A, a two-stage model consisting of: an RMS-Mapper that estimates an envelope representative of the audio characteristics associated with the input video; and Stable-Foley, a diffusion model based on Stable Audio Open that generates audio semantically and temporally aligned with the target video. Temporal alignment is guaranteed by the use of the envelope as a ControlNet input, while semantic alignment is achieved through the use of sound representations chosen by the designer as cross-attention conditioning of the diffusion process. We train and test our model on Greatest Hits, a dataset commonly used to evaluate V2A models. In addition, to test our model on a case study of interest, we introduce Walking The Maps, a dataset of videos extracted from video games depicting animated characters walking in different locations. Samples and code available on our demo page at https://ispamm.github.io/Stable-V2A.</description>

      <title>RiTTA: Modeling Event Relations in Text-to-Audio Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15922v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite significant advancements in Text-to-Audio (TTA) generation models achieving high-fidelity audio with fine-grained context understanding, they struggle to model the relations between audio events described in the input text. However, previous TTA methods have not systematically explored audio event relation modeling, nor have they proposed frameworks to enhance this capability. In this work, we systematically study audio event relation modeling in TTA generation models. We first establish a benchmark for this task by: 1. proposing a comprehensive relation corpus covering all potential relations in real-world scenarios; 2. introducing a new audio event corpus encompassing commonly heard audios; and 3. proposing new evaluation metrics to assess audio event relation modeling from various perspectives. Furthermore, we propose a finetuning framework to enhance existing TTA models ability to model audio events relation. Code is available at: https://github.com/yuhanghe01/RiTTA</description>

      <title>Text2midi: Generating Symbolic Music from Captions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16526v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces text2midi, an end-to-end model to generate MIDI files from textual descriptions. Leveraging the growing popularity of multimodal generative approaches, text2midi capitalizes on the extensive availability of textual data and the success of large language models (LLMs). Our end-to-end system harnesses the power of LLMs to generate symbolic music in the form of MIDI files. Specifically, we utilize a pretrained LLM encoder to process captions, which then condition an autoregressive transformer decoder to produce MIDI sequences that accurately reflect the provided descriptions. This intuitive and user-friendly method significantly streamlines the music creation process by allowing users to generate music pieces using text prompts. We conduct comprehensive empirical evaluations, incorporating both automated and human studies, that show our model generates MIDI files of high quality that are indeed controllable by text captions that may include music theory terms such as chords, keys, and tempo. We release the code and music samples on our demo page (https://github.com/AMAAI-Lab/Text2midi) for users to interact with text2midi.</description>

      <title>Mamba-SEUNet: Mamba UNet for Monaural Speech Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16626v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent speech enhancement (SE) research, transformer and its variants have emerged as the predominant methodologies. However, the quadratic complexity of the self-attention mechanism imposes certain limitations on practical deployment. Mamba, as a novel state-space model (SSM), has gained widespread application in natural language processing and computer vision due to its strong capabilities in modeling long sequences and relatively low computational complexity. In this work, we introduce Mamba-SEUNet, an innovative architecture that integrates Mamba with U-Net for SE tasks. By leveraging bidirectional Mamba to model forward and backward dependencies of speech signals at different resolutions, and incorporating skip connections to capture multi-scale information, our approach achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. Experimental results on the VCTK+DEMAND dataset indicate that Mamba-SEUNet attains a PESQ score of 3.59, while maintaining low computational complexity. When combined with the Perceptual Contrast Stretching technique, Mamba-SEUNet further improves the PESQ score to 3.73.</description>

      <title>Zero-resource Speech Translation and Recognition with LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18566v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite recent advancements in speech processing, zero-resource speech translation (ST) and automatic speech recognition (ASR) remain challenging problems. In this work, we propose to leverage a multilingual Large Language Model (LLM) to perform ST and ASR in languages for which the model has never seen paired audio-text data. We achieve this by using a pre-trained multilingual speech encoder, a multilingual LLM, and a lightweight adaptation module that maps the audio representations to the token embedding space of the LLM. We perform several experiments both in ST and ASR to understand how to best train the model and what data has the most impact on performance in previously unseen languages. In ST, our best model is capable to achieve BLEU scores over 23 in CoVoST2 for two previously unseen languages, while in ASR, we achieve WERs of up to 28.2\%. We finally show that the performance of our system is bounded by the ability of the LLM to output text in the desired language.</description>

      <title>Towards Expressive Video Dubbing with Multiscale Multimodal Context Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18748v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automatic Video Dubbing (AVD) generates speech aligned with lip motion and facial emotion from scripts. Recent research focuses on modeling multimodal context to enhance prosody expressiveness but overlooks two key issues: 1) Multiscale prosody expression attributes in the context influence the current sentence's prosody. 2) Prosody cues in context interact with the current sentence, impacting the final prosody expressiveness. To tackle these challenges, we propose M2CI-Dubber, a Multiscale Multimodal Context Interaction scheme for AVD. This scheme includes two shared M2CI encoders to model the multiscale multimodal context and facilitate its deep interaction with the current sentence. By extracting global and local features for each modality in the context, utilizing attention-based mechanisms for aggregation and interaction, and employing an interaction-based graph attention network for fusion, the proposed approach enhances the prosody expressiveness of synthesized speech for the current sentence. Experiments on the Chem dataset show our model outperforms baselines in dubbing expressiveness. The code and demos are available at \textcolor[rgb]{0.93,0.0,0.47}{https://github.com/AI-S2-Lab/M2CI-Dubber}.</description>
