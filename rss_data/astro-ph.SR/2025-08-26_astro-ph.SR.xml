      <title>Transiting Planetary Debris near the Roche Limit of a White Dwarf on a 4.97$\,$hr Orbit -- and its Vanishing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the discovery of deep, irregular, periodic transits towards the white dwarf ZTF$\,$J1944$+$4557 using follow-up time-series photometry and spectroscopy from Palomar, Keck, McDonald, Perkins, and Lowell observatories. We find a predominant period of 4.9704$\,$hr, consistent with an orbit near the Roche limit of the white dwarf, with individual dips over 30$\%$ deep and lasting between 15 and 40 minutes. Similar to the first known white dwarf with transiting debris, WD$\,$1145$+$017, the transit events are well-defined with prominent out-of-transit phases where the white dwarf appears unobscured. Spectroscopy concurrent with transit photometry reveals the average Ca$\,$K equivalent width remains constant in and out of transit. The broadening observed in several absorption features cannot be reproduced by synthetic photospheric models, suggesting the presence of circumstellar gas. Simultaneous $g+r$- and $g+i$-band light curves from the CHIMERA instrument reveal no color dependence to the transit depths, requiring transiting dust grains to have sizes $s \gtrsim0.2\,\mu$m. The transit morphologies appear to be constantly changing at a rate faster than the orbital period. Overall transit activity varies in the system, with transit features completely disappearing during the seven months between our 2023 and 2024 observing seasons and then reappearing in 2025$~$March, still repeating at 4.9704$\,$hr. Our observations of the complete cessation and resumption of transit activity provide a novel laboratory for constraining the evolution of disrupted debris and processes like disk exhaustion and replenishment timescales at white dwarfs.</description>

      <title>VLT observations of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS II. From quiescence to glow: Dramatic rise of Ni I emission and incipient CN outgassing at large heliocentric distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report VLT spectroscopy of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS (C/2025 N1) from $r_{\rm h}\!\simeq\!4.4$ to $2.85$ au using X-shooter (300-550 nm, $R\!\simeq\!3000$) and UVES (optical, $R\!\simeq\!35k-80k$). The coma is dust-dominated with a fairly constant red optical continuum slope ($\sim$21-22\%/1000\AA). At $r_{\rm h}\!\simeq\!3.17$ au we derive $3\sigma$ limits of $Q({\rm OH})&lt;7.76\times10^{23}\ {\rm s^{-1}}$, but find no indications for [O I], C$_2$, C$_3$ or NH$_2$. We report detection of CN emission and also detect numerous Ni I lines while Fe I remains undetected, potentially implying efficiently released gas-phase Ni. From our latest X-shooter measurements conducted on 2025-08-21 ($r_{\rm h} = 2.85$\,au) we measure production rates of $\log~Q(\mathrm{CN}) = 23.61\pm 0.05$ molecules s$^{-1}$ and $\log~Q$(Ni) $= 22.67\pm0.07$ atoms s$^{-1}$, and characterize their evolution as the comet approaches perihelion. We observe a steep heliocentric-distance scaling for the production rates $Q(\mathrm{Ni}) \propto r_h^{-8.43 \pm 0.79}$ and for $Q(\mathrm{CN}) \propto r_h^{-9.38 \pm 1.2}$, and predict a Ni-CO$_{(2)}$ correlation if the Ni I emission is driven by the carbonyl formation channel. Energetic considerations of activation barriers show that this behavior is inconsistent with direct sublimation of canonical metal/sulfide phases and instead favors low-activation-energy release from dust, e.g. photon-stimulated desorption or mild thermolysis of metalated organics or Ni-rich nanophases, possibly including Ni-carbonyl-like complexes. These hypotheses are testable with future coordinated ground-based and space-based monitoring as 3I becomes more active during its continued passage through the solar system.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a new transitional type of evolved massive stars with hard ionizing flux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars are the evolved descendants of the most massive stars and show emission-line dominated spectra formed in their powerful stellar winds. Marking the final evolution stage before core collapse, the standard picture of WR stars has been that they evolve through three well-defined spectral subtypes known as WN, WC, and WO. Here, we present a detailed analysis of five objects that defy this scheme, demonstrating that WR stars can also evolve directly from the WN to the WO stage. Our study reveals that this direct transition is connected to low metallicity and weaker winds. The WN/WO stars and their immediate WN precursors are hot and emit a high flux of photons capable of fully ionizing helium. The existence of these stages unveil that high mass stars which manage to shed off their outer hydrogen layers in a low-metallicity environment can spend a considerable fraction of their lifetime in a stage that is difficult to detect in integrated stellar populations, but at the same time yields hard ionizing flux. The identification of the WN to WO evolution path for massive stars has significant implications for understanding the chemical enrichment and ionizing feedback in star-forming galaxies, in particular at earlier cosmic times.</description>

      <title>Chemical evolution imprints in the rare isotopes of nearby M dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Elements heavier than hydrogen and helium, collectively termed metals, were created inside stars and dispersed through space at the final stages of stellar evolution. The relative amounts of different isotopes (variants of the same element with different masses) in stellar atmospheres provide clues about how our galaxy evolved chemically over billions of years. M dwarfs are small, cool, long-lived stars that comprise three-quarters of all stars in our galaxy. Their spectra exhibit rich fingerprints of their composition, making them potential tracers of chemical evolution. We measure rare carbon and oxygen isotopes in 32 nearby M dwarfs spanning a range of metallicities using high-resolution infrared spectroscopy. We find that stars with higher metal content have lower 12C/13C ratios, indicating they formed from material progressively enriched in 13C over time. This pattern is consistent with models where novae eruptions contributed significant amounts of 13C to the interstellar medium over the past few billion years. Our measurements of 16O/18O ratio match theoretical predictions and suggest that metal-rich stars reach 16O/18O ratios significantly lower than the Sun. These results establish M dwarfs as tracers of chemical enrichment throughout cosmic history.</description>

      <title>FUMES IV: Optical and Far-ultraviolet Spectra of a Flare on the M Dwarf GJ 4334</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On 2017-09-20 we observed GJ 4334, an M5V dwarf rotating with a period of 23.5 days, simultaneously with both the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph aboard Hubble (1160 -- 1710 Angstroms) and the Dual Imaging Spectrograph mounted on the 3.5m telescope at Apache Point Observatory (3750 -- 5050; 5800 -- 6950 Angstroms) as part of a larger survey of intermediately active M dwarfs. GJ 4334 flared during the observation, starting with a rise in the flux of optical chromospheric emission lines, followed by the rapid rise and decay of multiple far-ultraviolet emission lines formed in the transition region, followed by the slow decay of the optical lines. We find significant broadening and asymmetries in the optical emission lines that are potentially from bulk plasma motion, a post-flare elevated flux in both the optical and far-ultraviolet, and trends in the rise and decay timescales of the Balmer series such that higher-order lines rise earlier and decay faster than lower-order lines. The equivalent durations of the flare in individual lines range from 800 -- 3e4 seconds, mapping to flare energies of 1e28 -- 3e29 erg for each line. To contextualize GJ 4334's flare behavior we measure and compare its optical flare frequency distribution with TESS to EV Lacertae, a similar mass but faster rotating M dwarf, and find that GJ 4334 has an excess of large flares relative to the power-law established by the majority of its smaller flares. This dataset is a rare opportunity to characterize flares near a critical transition in stellar magnetic activity.</description>

      <title>Characterizing bright $\delta$ Scuti pulsators using TESS lightcurves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a study of bright, young $\delta$ Scuti stars near the zero-age main sequence using TESS light curves and Gaia DR3 data. From a sample of 2041 stars with G&lt;7 and $G_{BP}-G_{RP}$ colour in the range 0-0.6, we identified 444 $\delta$ Scuti pulsators. We measured a pulsator fraction of ~70% in the middle of the instability strip, tapering off towards the edges. A period - luminosity diagram reveals a concentration along the fundamental mode and overtone ridges. We addressed sample completeness and identified low-frequency pulsators possibly exhibiting mixed modes. Cross-matching with nearby young associations showed that 63 $\delta$ Scuti stars from our sample are association members.</description>

      <title>Magneto-Thermal Coupling and Coronal Heating in Solar Active Regions Inferred from Microwave Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The solar corona is much hotter than the photosphere and chromosphere, but the physical mechanism responsible for heating the coronal plasma remains unidentified yet. The thermal microwave emission, which is produced in strong magnetic field above sunspots, is a promising but barely exploited tool for studying the coronal magnetic field and plasma. We analyzed the microwave observations of eight solar active regions obtained with the Siberian Radioheliograph in years 2022-2024 in the frequency range of 6-12 GHz. We produced synthetic microwave images based on various coronal heating models, and determined the model parameters that provided the best agreement with the observations. The observations and simulations strongly favour either a steady-state (continuous) plasma heating process, or high-frequency heating by small energy release events with a short cadence. The average magnetic field strength in a coronal loop was found to decrease with the loop length, following a scaling law with the most probable index of about -0.55. In the majority of cases, the estimated volumetric heating rate was weakly dependent on the magnetic field strength, and decreased with the coronal loop length following a scaling law with the index of about -2.5. Among the known theoretical heating mechanisms, the model based on wave transmission or reflection in coronal loops acting as resonance cavities was found to provide the best agreement with the observations. The obtained results did not demonstrate a significant dependence on the emission frequency in the considered range.</description>

      <title>Multi-Instrument Observations and Tracking of a Coronal Mass Ejection Front From Low to Middle Corona</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The shape and dynamics of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) vary significantly based on the instrument and wavelength used. This has led to significant debate about the proper definitions of CME/shock fronts, pile-up/compression regions, and cores observations in projection in optically thin vs. optically thick emission. Here we present an observational analysis of the evolving shape and kinematics of a large-scale CME that occurred on May 7, 2021 on the eastern limb of the Sun as seen from 1 au. The eruption was observed continuously, consecutively by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) telescope suite on the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), the ground-based COronal Solar Magnetism Observatory (COSMO) K-coronagraph (K-Cor) on Mauna Loa, and the C2 and C3 tele- scopes of the Large Angle Solar Coronagraph (LASCO) on the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SoHO). We apply the updated multi-instument version of the recently de- veloped Wavetrack Python suite for automated detection and tracking of coronal eruptive features to evaluate and compare the evolving shape of the CME front as it propagated from the solar surface out to 20 solar radii. Our tool allows tracking features beyond just the leading edge and is an important step towards semi-automatic manufacturing of train- ing sets for training data-driven image segmentation models for solar imaging. Our findings confirm the expected strong connection between EUV waves and CMEs. Our novel, de- tailed analysis sheds observational light on the details of EUV wave-shock-CME relations that is lacking for the gap region between the low and middle corona.</description>

      <title>Multipolar magnetic configuration: a trace of post-mergers events in circumstellar disks around FS CMa Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: Observations suggest that magnetic fields of disk-bearing stars may have non-dipolar configurations. However, the influence of these configurations on magnetospheric accretion remains poorly understood. Aims: We aim to simulate magnetospheric accretion incorporating non-dipolar and strong magnetic field. Our model is informed by observations of IRAS 17449+2320, a post-merger belonging to the group of FS CMa stars, which indicate a dominant dipolar magnetic field with an additional quadrupole component. Methods: Using the PLUTO code, we conduct 2.5-D non-ideal viscous-resistive magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) simulations of star-disk magnetospheric interactions. We consider a thin accretion disk and strong stellar magnetic field ($B_\star= 6.2\mathrm{kG}$) under four configurations: pure dipole, pure quadrupole, dipole plus quadrupole, and dipole plus octupole. In the latter two cases, different magnetic polar strength ratios are explored. Results: For asymmetric magnetic field configurations, we find that accretion exhibits funnel streams below the midplane, indicating the dominance of the quadrupolar and octupolar components. In contrast, in dipolar configurations, we observe the formation of two symmetrical funnels with respect to the midplane. However, in the quadrupolar configuration, accretion is entirely confined to the disk midplane forming a cone-like pattern that leads to disk widening. Remarkably, the presence of a quadrupolar component gives rise to highly asymmetric substructures in the corona region. Conclusions: Multipolar stellar magnetic fields drive non-uniform accretion and lead to asymmetric density distributions in both the disk and corona. These results resemble observed features of some FS CMa post-mergers and Herbig Ae/Be stars, highlighting the critical role of magnetic field complexity in shaping circumstellar environments.</description>

      <title>Observations of Successive CMEs and their Successive Type II Solar Radio Bursts in the Corona</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper reports the observations of two coronal shocks from two Coronal Mass
  Ejections (CMEs) for the Successive type II Solar radio bursts observed on 02
  May 2021 in the frequency range of 80 - 1 MHz with the time interval of ~ 20
  minutes between them. Both the bursts show clear band splitting features in the
  harmonic band. The estimated heights for the source of the first type II burst lies
  in the range of 2.06 - 2.93 R0 with the average speeds of 601 + or - 76, 700 + or - 91
  and 783 + or - 105 km/s for 2 X, 3.5 X and 5 X Saito electron density models, and
  the heights for the source of the second type II burst lies in the range of 2.24 -
  3.83 R0 with the average speeds of 1063 + or - 113, 1287 + or - 145 and 1478 + or - 172 km/s. The successive CMEs are observed by the twin Solar Terrestrial Relations
  Observatory STEREO-A between 11:20 - 12:21 UT in the Extreme Ultra Violet
  Imager (EUVI) and in the Internally Occulting Refractive Coronagraphs (COR1)
  FOV, the two coronal shocks are generated by the two successive CMEs observed
  at (11:30) 11:26 UT and (11:55:00) 11:56 UT according to ST-A (EUVI) COR1
  observations and most likely released from the same active region. The average
  speeds of CMEs at COR1 FOV are about 574 = or - 64 km/s and 595 + or - 82
  km/s. The simultaneous observations of the EUV structures and the radio
  bursts, their coinciding height-time further confirms that the successive CMEs are
  responsible for the successive shocks and their related radio bursts in the corona.
  The observed band-splitting in the successive type-II radio bursts provides the
  compression ratios of 1.26 and 1.45 respectively. Therefore, these observations
  confirms the presence of shock waves in the corona.</description>

      <title>In Search of Decay: An Analysis of Transit Times of Hot Jupiters in Main Sequence and Post-Main Sequence Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tidal interactions are one of the primary drivers of orbital evolution for massive planets with short orbital periods. Tidal dissipation within host stars can cause the orbits of such planets to decay. However, the mechanisms of tidal dissipation are difficult to probe. Generally, tidal dissipation is parameterized by the modified stellar tidal quality factor, or $Q_{*}^{'}$, but the lack of observational evidence of orbital decay to confirm dissipation theories has resulted in orders of magnitude of uncertainty in $Q_{*}^{'}$. We present a new transit timing analysis of 54 systems with varying stellar evolutionary states in an attempt to search for orbital decay across multiple stages of stellar evolution. For each system, we obtained mid-transit times from new TESS data and evaluated potential departures from a linear ephemeris using the Bayesian Information Criterion. We then determined tidal quality factors using widely tested theoretical relations. Of the systems studied, 25 showed evidence of a decrease in orbital period over time and 8 showed evidence of a decrease that was inconsistent with 0 by three standard deviations: CoRoT-2, TrES-5, WASP-4, WASP-12, WASP-19, WASP-45, WASP-99, and XO-3. However, the significance of some of these detections may be influenced by unreliable transit time measurements. Similarly, we see that the lower limit on $Q_{*}^{'}$ for evolved systems is marginally lower than it is for the sample of all systems, though both limits are orders of magnitude below the expected theoretical values for both samples. These new constraints on transit times and $Q_{*}^{'}$ values will help to narrow the search for orbital decay in the future and place important constraints on current theories of star-planet interactions.</description>

      <title>Topology of the Superconducting Heart of Neutron Stars: Effects of Microphysics and Gravitational-Wave Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a general-relativistic study of the distribution of proton superconductivity in strongly magnetized neutron stars (NSs), employing the $XNS$ code to solve the coupled Einstein-Maxwell equations. This work extends the previous investigation by us in a few key directions: (i) we explore equilibrium configurations with both toroidal and poloidal magnetic field geometries, (ii) we account for complex many-body effects incorporating microscopically derived pairing gaps, and (iii) our models utilize equation(s) of state (EoS) derived from microscopic many-body theory, including realistic two- and three-body nuclear forces, as well as from relativistic mean-field models. We compare superconducting topologies across our collection of EoS and explore the influences of magnetic field geometry in stellar models parameterized by central density. Our models confirm the absence of $S$-wave superconductivity in the inner core and, importantly, reveal that non-superconducting regions exhibit complex three-dimensional geometries: doughnut-shaped for toroidal fields and prolate-shaped for poloidal fields -- spatial structures that are inherently absent from one-dimensional analyses. We also compute magnetic deformations and ellipticities for several millisecond pulsars (MSPs), estimating their continuous gravitational wave (CGW) strain. While these MSPs remain undetectable by current detectors, next-generation instruments such as the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer may detect their signals, opening an observational window into internal superconductivity and internal magnetic field of NSs, as well as, the fundamental microphysics of dense matter.</description>

      <title>Non-Thermal Ionization of Kilonova Ejecta: Observable Impacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The characteristic rapid rise and decline at optical wavelengths of a kilonova is the product of the low ejecta mass ($\lesssim 0.05 M_\odot$) and high ejecta velocity ($\gtrsim 0.1$c). We show that, even at very early times ($\lesssim 2$ days), regions of ejecta fall below critical density and temperature thresholds at which non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) effects become important. Here, we present an approximate method for calculating the ionization state of the ejecta that accounts for the NLTE impact of high-energy electrons produced in the beta decay of freshly synthesized $r$-process elements. We find that incorporating ionization from high-energy electrons produces an ``inverted" and ``blended" ionization structure, where the most highly ionized species are located in the fastest moving homologous ejecta and multiple ionization states coexist. In radiation transport calculations, the higher degree of ionization reduces line blanketing in optical bands, leading to improved agreement with the light curve properties of AT\,2017gfo such as the duration, decay rates, brightness, and colors. Our quasi-NLTE implementation helps to alleviate tensions in kilonova modeling: for high-velocity ($\sim 0.3c$) ejecta components our models require less mass for a given peak brightness in optical bands, by as much as a factor of 3; our models can explain the presence of observed features associated to Sr II, W III, Se III, and Te III under conditions where LTE models would predict only neutral species; and we naturally predict the coexistence of species like Sr II and Ce III without the need for fine-tuning of the ejecta properties.</description>

      <title>The periastron regression of 2M1510 AB, the jet precession of M87* and Telisto/Planet Nine: three different scenarios for a possible common cause</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The eclipsing binary 2M1510 AB made of two brown dwarfs, the supermassive black hole M87* and our solar system may all have in common the presence of a massive pointlike distant companion perturbing in some ways their inner dynamics. That is, respectively, a circumbinary exoplanet whose orbital plane should be perpendicular to that of its host inner binary, an intermediate mass black hole potentially causing the observed jet precession, and a still unseen planet, known as Telisto or Planet Nine, which may, perhaps, have been recently spotted in archival images although in a quite different orbit with respect to that originally expected. To this aim, the long-term rates of change of all the Keplerian orbital elements of the relative motion of a gravitationally bound two-body system acted upon by a massive remote perturber are analytically worked out in full generality and presented in a way facilitating a straightforward application to those and other potentially interesting astronomical scenarios. For each of the considered cases, exclusion plots in their parameter spaces are provided.</description>

      <title>Lightcurve Features of Magnetar-Powered Superluminous Supernovae with Gravitational-Wave Emission and High-Energy Leakage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) are a distinct class of stellar explosions, exhibiting peak luminosities 10-100 times brighter than those of normal SNe. Their extreme luminosities cannot be explained by the radioactive decay of $^{56}\mathrm{Ni}$ and its daughter $^{56}\mathrm{Co}$ alone. Consequently, models invoking newly formed millisecond magnetars have been widely proposed, capable of supplying additional energy through magnetic dipole radiation. For these rapidly rotating magnetars, however, gravitational-wave (GW) emission may also contribute significantly to the spin-down, particularly during their early evolutionary stages. While high-energy photons initially remain trapped within the optically thick ejecta, they will eventually escape as the ejecta becomes transparent during the expansion, thereby influencing the late-time lightcurve. In this work, we adopt an analytical framework to systematically explore the combined effects of GW emission and high-energy leakage on the lightcurve of SLSNe. Compared to scenarios that neglect these processes, we find that for magnetars with initial spin periods of millisecond, the combined influence suppresses early-time luminosities but enhances late-time emission. We further investigate the effects of the neutron-star equation of state to the lightcurve, GW emission efficiency, ejecta mass, and other relevant quantities. Our results highlight the complex interplay between GW-driven spin-down and radiative transport in shaping the observable features of SLSNe, offering new insights into diagnosing the nature of their central engines.</description>

      <title>A new multifluid method for dusty astrophysical flows. Application to turbulent protostellar collapses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stars and planets form in collapsing clouds of gas and dust. The presence of dust grains and their local distribution play a significant role throughout the protostellar sequence, from the thermodynamics and the chemistry of molecular clouds to the opacity of collapsing protostellar cores and the coupling between the gas and the magnetic field and down to planet formation in young and evolved disks. We aim to simulate the dynamics of the dust, considering the whole range of grain sizes, from few nanometers to millimeters. We implemented a neutral pressureless multifluid that samples the dust size distribution in the RAMSES code. This multifluid is dynamically coupled to the gas via a drag source term and self-gravity, relying on the Eulerian approach. We designed a Riemann solver for the gas and dust mixture that prevents unphysical dust-to-gas ratio variations for well-coupled grains. We illustrated the capacities of the code by performing simulations of a protostellar collapse down to the formation of a first hydrostatic core, both for small and large dust grains. Grains over 100 microns significantly decouple from the gas. The spatial maps and the probability density functions indicate that dust enrichment within the first hydrostatic core and in some locations of the envelope increases as a function of the grain size and the level of initial turbulence. Thanks to the novel Riemann solver, we recovered the terminal velocity regime, even at low resolution. Moreover, we successfully extended it to regimes where the grain inertia matters. The multifluid module performs the coupling between the dust and the gas self-consistently all through the dynamical scales. The dust enrichment in the first hydrostatic core and the envelope have been revised here, assuming the initial turbulence and grain sizes. This enables us to probe new potential conditions for planet formation.</description>

      <title>Photospheric Imprints of Coronal Electric Currents, I. Magnetic Structure Near Polarity Inversion Lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.01911v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coronal electric currents store the magnetic energy that is released in solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs). Here, we use photospheric vector magnetic field observations to study currents in active regions 10930 and 11158, which both produced eruptive, X-class flares. We employ Gauss's separation method in Cartesian geometry to partition the photospheric field into three distinct components: (i) the toroidal field, $\vec B_T$, from vertical currents, $J_z$, passing through the photosphere; (ii) $\vec B^&lt;$, from horizontal currents, $\vec J_h^&lt;$, flowing below it; and (iii) $\vec B^&gt;$, from horizontal currents, $\vec J_h^&gt;$, flowing above it. We refer to $\vec B^&gt;$ as the photospheric imprint of coronal currents. We give two representations of $\vec B^&lt;$ and $\vec B^&gt;$: (i) as second-order derivatives of poloidal potentials $P^&lt;$ and $P^&gt;$, respectively; and (ii) in terms of gradients of interior and exterior scalar potentials, respectively. The central polarity inversion line (PIL) in each region possesses magnetic structure similar to that reported in AR 12673 by Schuck et al. (2022): (i) $\vec B_T$, which arises from $J_z$, produces sheared fields along the PIL; (ii) $\vec B^&gt;$ exhibits large-scale, spatially coherent structure, consistent with $\vec J_h^&gt;$ flowing above and along the PIL; and (iii) the near-PIL currents $\vec J_h^&lt;$ and $\vec J_h^&gt;$ are roughly parallel. Because parallel currents attract, such parallel-current configurations are likely more stable than misaligned-current configurations. Current $\vec J_h^&gt;$ flowing along a PIL increases the magnitued of the gradient of $B_z$ across the PIL, providing a physical explanation for previously reported empirical associations of strong, cross-PIL gradients in $B_z$ with flare and CME occurrence.</description>

      <title>Testing and Combining Transient Spectral Classification Tools on 4MOST-like Blended Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12890v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the 4-meter Multi-Object Spectroscopic Telescope (4MOST) expected to provide an influx of transient spectra when it begins observations in early 2026 we consider the potential for real-time classification of these spectra. We investigate three extant spectroscopic transient classifiers: the Deep Automated Supernova and Host classifier (DASH), Next Generation SuperFit (NGSF) and SuperNova IDentification (SNID), with a focus on comparing the completeness and purity of the transient samples they produce. We manually simulate fibre losses critical for accurately determining host-contamination and use the 4MOST Exposure Time Calculator to produce realistic, 4MOST-like, host-galaxy contaminated spectra. We investigate the three classifiers individually and in all possible combinations. We find that a combination of DASH and NGSF can produce a SN Ia sample with a purity of 99.9% while successfully classifying 70% of SNe Ia. However, it struggles to classify non-SN Ia transients. We investigate photometric cuts to transient magnitude and the transient's fraction of total fibre flux, finding that both can be used to improve non-SN Ia transient classification completeness by 8--44% with SNe Ibc benefitting the most and superluminous (SL) SNe the least. Finally, we present an example classification plan for live classification and the predicted purities and completeness across five transient classes: Ia, Ibc, II, SL and non-SN transients. We find that it is possible to classify 75% of input spectra with &gt;70% purity in all classes except non-SN transients. Precise values can be varied using different classifiers and photometric cuts to suit the needs of a given study.</description>

      <title>Stellar-Mass Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15270v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stellar-mass black holes ($3$ $M_\odot \lesssim M_{\rm BH} \lesssim 150$ $M_\odot$) are the natural product of the evolution of heavy stars ($M_{\rm star} \gtrsim 20$ $M_\odot$). In our Galaxy, we expect $10^8$-$10^9$ stellar-mass black holes formed from the gravitational collapse of heavy stars, but currently we know fewer than 100 objects. We also know $\sim 100$ stellar-mass black holes in other galaxies, most of them discovered by gravitational wave observatories in the past 10 years. The detection of black holes is indeed extremely challenging and possible only in very special cases. This article is a short review on the physics and astrophysics of stellar-mass black holes, including Galactic and extragalactic black holes in X-ray binaries, black holes in astrometric binaries, isolated black holes, and black holes in compact binaries. The article also addresses some important open issues and introduces the idea of a possible interstellar mission to the closest black hole.</description>

      <title>Characterising the short-orbital period X-ray transient Swift J1910.2-0546</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16775v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: SwiftJ1910.2-0546 is a Galactic X-ray transient discovered during a bright outburst in 2012. We use time-series optical photometry and spectroscopy to estimate the orbital period, characterise the donor star, determine the interstellar extinction, distance, and system geometry, and constrain the component masses. Multi-site r-band and clear-filter light curves and WHT/ACAM spectra from the 2012 outburst are combined with time-series spectroscopy from GTC/OSIRIS and VLT/FORS2 in quiescence. Period searches are conducted using generalised Lomb-Scargle, phase-dispersion minimisation, and analysis-of-variance algorithms. Diffuse interstellar bands constrain E(B-V), while empirical correlations involving H$\alpha$ yield estimates of K2, q, and i. We detect a double-humped modulation with a period of $0.0941\pm0.0007$d ($2.26\pm0.02$h) during the outburst. Its morphology is consistent with an early superhump, suggesting that the true orbital period may be slightly shorter than 4.52h. The H$\alpha$ radial velocity curves do not yield a definitive orbital period. In quiescence, TiO bands indicate an M3-M3.5 donor contributing 70% of the red continuum. Diffuse interstellar bands give E(B-V)=$0.60\pm0.05$ and N_H=$(3.9\pm1.3)$x10$^{21}$cm$^{-2}$, placing the system at a distance of 2.8-4.0 kpc. The H$\alpha$ line width in quiescence (FWHM_0 =$990\pm45$km/s), via a FWHM-K_2 calibration, provides an estimate of K_2, while its double peaked profile gives q and i. Adopting the resulting K_2=$230\pm17$km/s and q=$0.032\pm0.010$, and two orbital period scenarios (2.25 and 4.50h), Monte Carlo sampling returns a compact object mass M_1=8-11M_sun and an inclination i=13-18 deg for plausible donor masses (M_2=0.25-0.35M_sun). We favour an orbital period of 4.5h. Further phase-resolved spectroscopy and photometry during quiescence are needed to better determine its fundamental parameters.</description>
