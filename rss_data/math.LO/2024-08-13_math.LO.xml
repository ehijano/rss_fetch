      <title>Some Results on Finitely Splitting Subtrees of Aronszajn Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For any $2 \le n &lt; \omega$, we introduce a forcing poset using generalized promises which adds a normal $n$-splitting subtree to a $(\ge \! n)$-splitting normal Aronszajn tree. Using this forcing poset, we prove several consistency results concerning finitely splitting subtrees of Aronszajn trees. For example, it is consistent that there exists an infinitely splitting Suslin tree whose topological square is not Lindel\"{o}f, which solves an open problem due to Marun. For any $2 &lt; n &lt; \omega$, it is consistent that every $(\ge \! n)$-splitting normal Aronszajn tree contains a normal $n$-splitting subtree, but there exists a normal infinitely splitting Aronszajn tree which contains no $(&lt; \! n)$-splitting subtree. To show the latter consistency result, we prove a forcing iteration preservation theorem related to not adding new small-splitting subtrees of Aronszajn trees.</description>

      <title>Infinite Cliques in Simple and Stable Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Suppose that $G$ is a graph of cardinality $\mu^+$ with chromatic number $\chi(G)\geq \mu^+$. One possible reason that this could happen is if $G$ contains a clique of size $\mu^+$. We prove that this is indeed the case when the edge relation is stable. When $G$ is a random graph (which is simple but not stable), this is not true. But still if in general the complete theory of $G$ is simple, $G$ must contain finite cliques of unbounded sizes.</description>

      <title>The Baire and perfect set properties at singulars cardinals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a model of ZFC with a singular cardinal $\kappa$ such that every subset of $\kappa$ in $L(V_{\kappa+1})$ has both the $\kappa$-Perfect Set Property and the $\mathcal{\vec{U}}$-Baire Property. This is a higher analogue of Solovay's result for $L(\mathbb{R})$. We obtain this configuration starting with large-cardinal assumptions in the realm of supercompactness, thus improving former theorems by Cramer, Shi and Woodin.</description>

      <title>Wright's First-Order Logic of Strict Finitism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A classical reconstruction of Wright's first-order logic of strict finitism is presented. Strict finitism is a constructive standpoint of mathematics that is more restrictive than intuitionism. Wright sketched the semantics of said logic in Wright (Realism, Meaning and Truth, chap 4, 2nd edition in 1993. Blackwell Publishers, Oxford, Cambridge, pp.107-75, 1982), in his strict finitistic metatheory. Yamada (J Philos Log. https://doi.org/10.1007/s10992-022-09698-w, 2023) proposed, as its classical reconstruction, a propositional logic of strict finitism under an auxiliary condition that makes the logic correspond with intuitionistic propositional logic. In this paper, we extend the propositional logic to a first-order logic that does not assume the condition. We will provide a sound and complete pair of a Kripke-style semantics and a natural deduction system, and show that if the condition is imposed, then the logic exhibits natural extensions of Yamada (2023)'s results.</description>

      <title>Characterizations of monadic NIP</title>

      <description>arXiv:2104.12989v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give several characterizations of when a complete first-order theory $T$ is monadically NIP, i.e. when expansions of $T$ by arbitrary unary predicates do not have the independence property. The central characterization is a condition on finite satisfiability of types. Other characterizations include decompositions of models, the behavior of indiscernibles, and a forbidden configuration. As an application, we prove non-structure results for hereditary classes of finite substructures of non-monadically NIP models that eliminate quantifiers.</description>

      <title>Automorphism groups over a hyperimaginary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.09200v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study the Lascar group over a hyperimaginary e. We verify that various results about the group over a real set still hold when the set is replaced by e. First of all, there is no written proof in the available literature that the group over e is a topological group. We present an expository style proof of the fact, which even simplifies existing proofs for the real case. We further extend a result that the orbit equivalence relation under a closed subgroup of the Lascar group is type-definable. On the one hand, we correct errors appeared in the book, "Simplicity Theory" [6, 5.1.14-15] and produce a counterexample. On the other, we extend Newelski's Theorem in "The diameter of a Lascar strong type" [12] that `a G-compact theory over a set has a uniform bound for the Lascar distances' to the hyperimaginary context. Lastly, we supply a partial positive answer to a question raised in "The relativized Lascar groups, type-amalgamations, and algebraicity" [4, 2.11], which is even a new result in the real context.</description>

      <title>Evolution systems: A framework for studying generic mathematical structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.12600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.12600v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of an abstract evolution system, which provides a convenient framework for studying generic mathematical structures and their properties. Roughly speaking, an evolution system is a category endowed with a selected class of morphisms called transitions, and with a selected object called the origin. We illustrate it by a series of examples from several areas of mathematics. We formulate sufficient conditions for the existence of the unique "most complicated" evolution. In case the evolution system "lives" in model theory and nontrivial transitions are one-point extensions, the limit of the most complicated evolution is known under the name Fraisse limit, a unique countable universal homogeneous model determined by a fixed class of finitely generated models satisfying some obvious axioms.
  Evolution systems can also be viewed as a generalization of abstract rewriting systems, where the partially ordered set is replaced by a category. In our setting, the process of rewriting plays a nontrivial role, whereas in rewriting systems only the result of a rewriting procedure is relevant. An analogue of Newman's Lemma holds in our setting, although the proof is a bit more delicate, nevertheless, still based on Huet's idea using well founded induction.</description>

      <title>Preservation of NATP</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.08753v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove several preservation theorems for NATP and furnish several examples of NATP. First, we prove preservation of NATP for the parametrization and sum of the theories of Fra\"{i}ss\'{e} limits of Fra\"{i}ss\'{e} classes satisfying strong amalgamation property. Second, we prove preservation of NATP for two kinds of dense/co-dense expansions, that is, the theories of lovely pairs and of H-structures for geometric theories and dense/co-dense expansion on vector spaces. Third, we prove preservation of NATP for the generic predicate expansion and the pair of an algebraically closed field and its distinguished subfield; for the latter, not only NATP, but also preservations of NTP$_1$ and NTP$_2$ are considered. Fourth, we present some proper examples of NATP using the results proved in this paper. Most of all, we show that the model companion of the theory of algebraically closed fields with circular orders (ACFO) is NATP.</description>

      <title>Club Stationary Reflection and other Combinatorial Principles at $\aleph_{\omega+2}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.01198v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we continue the study in [Gilton-Levine-Stejskalova] of compactness and incompactness principles at double successors, focusing here on the case of double successors of singulars of countable cofinality. We obtain models which satisfy the tree property and club stationary reflection at these double successors. Moreover, we can additionally obtain either approachability or its failure. We also show how to obtain our results on $\aleph_{\omega+2}$ by incorporating collapses; particularly relevant for these circumstances is a new indestructibility theorem of ours showing that posets satisfying certain linked assumptions preserve club stationary reflection.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.05996v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generalised indiscernibles highlight a strong link between model theory and structural Ramsey theory. In this paper, we use generalised indiscernibles as tools to prove results in both these areas. More precisely, we first show that a reduct of an ultrahomogenous $\aleph_0$-categorical structure which has higher arity than the original structure cannot be Ramsey. In particular, the only nontrivial Ramsey reduct of the generically ordered random $k$-hypergraph is the linear order. We then turn our attention to model-theoretic dividing lines that are characterised by collapsing generalised indiscernibles, and prove, for these dividing lines, several transfer principles in (full and lexicographic) products of structures. As an application, we construct new algorithmically tame classes of graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14267v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study some topics about \L o\'s's theorem without assuming the Axiom of Choice. We prove that \L o\'s's fundamental theorem of ultraproducts is equivalent to a weak form that every ultrapower is elementary equivalent to its source structure. On the other hand, it is consistent that there is a structure $M$ and an ultrafilter $U$ such that the ultrapower of $M$ by $U$ is elementary equivalent to $M$, but the fundamental theorem for the ultrapower of $M$ by $U$ fails. We also show that weak fragments of the Axiom of Choice, such as the Countable Choice, do not follow from \L o\'s's theorem, even assuming the existence of non-principal ultrafilters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11619v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study relativized Lascar groups, which are formed by relativizing Lascar groups to the solution set of a partial type $\Sigma$. We introduce the notion of a Lascar tuple for $\Sigma$ and by considering the space of types over a Lascar tuple for $\Sigma$, the topology for a relativized Lascar group is (re-)defined and some fundamental facts about the Galois groups of first-order theories are generalized to the relativized context. In particular, we prove that any closed subgroup of a relativized Lascar group corresponds to a stabilizer of a bounded hyperimaginary having at least one representative in the solution set of the given partial type $\Sigma$. Using this, we find the correspondence between subgroups of the relativized Lascar group and the relativized strong types.</description>

      <title>On the significance of parameters and the projective level in the Choice and Comprehension axioms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20098v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We make use of generalized iterations of Jensen forcing to define a cardinal-preserving generic model of ZF for any $n\ge 1$ and each of the following four Choice hypotheses:
  (1) $\text{DC}(\mathbf\Pi^1_n)\land\neg\text{AC}_\omega(\varPi^1_{n+1})\,;$
  (2) $\text{AC}_\omega(\text{OD})\land\text{DC}(\varPi^1_{n+1})\land \neg\text{AC}_\omega(\mathbf\Pi^1_{n+1});$
  (3) $\text{AC}_\omega\land\text{DC}(\mathbf\Pi^1_n)\land\neg\text{DC}(\varPi^1_{n+1});$
  (4) $\text{AC}_\omega\land\text{DC}(\varPi^1_{n+1})\land\neg\text{DC}(\mathbf\Pi^1_{n+1}).$
  Thus if ZF is consistent and $n\ge1$ then each of these four conjunctions (1)--(4) is consistent with ZF.
  As for the second main result, let PA$^0_2$ be the 2nd-order Peano arithmetic without the Comprehension schema $\text{CA}$. For any $n\ge1$, we define a cardinal-preserving generic model of ZF, and a set $M\subseteq\mathcal P(\omega)$ in this model, such that $\langle\omega, M\rangle$ satisfies
  (5) PA$^0_2$ + $\text{AC}_\omega(\varSigma^1_{\infty})$ + $\text{CA}(\mathbf\Sigma^1_{n+1})$ + $\neg\text{CA}(\mathbf\Sigma^1_{n+1})$.
  Thus $\text{CA}(\mathbf\Sigma^1_{n+1})$ does not imply $\text{CA}(\mathbf\Sigma^1_{n+2})$ in PA$^0_2$ even in the presence of the full parameter-free (countable) Choice $\text{AC}_\omega(\varSigma^1_{\infty}).$</description>

Abstract: Random groups of density d&lt;\frac{1}{2} are infinite hyperbolic, and of density d&gt;\frac{1}{2} are finite. We prove that for any given system of equations \Sigma, all the solutions of \Sigma over a random group of density d&lt;\frac{1}{2} are projected from solutions of \Sigma over the free group F_{k}, with overwhelming probability, where k is the rank of the group. We conclude that any given sentence in the Boolean algebra of universal sentences, is a truth sentence over F_{k} if and only if it is a truth sentence over random groups of density d&lt;\frac{1}{2}, with overwhelming probability.</description>

Abstract: Random groups of density d&lt;\frac{1}{2} are infinite hyperbolic, and of density d&gt;\frac{1}{2} are finite. We prove the existence of a uniform quantifier elimination procedure for formulas of minimal rank (probably the superstable part of the theory). Namely, given a minimal rank formula V(p), we prove the existence of a formula \varphi(p) that belongs to the Boolean algebra of two quantifiers, so that the two formulas V(p) and \varphi(p) define the same set over the free group F_{k} and over a random group of density d&lt;\frac{1}{2}. We conclude that any given sentence of minimal rank is a truth sentence over the free group F_{k} if and only if it is a truth sentence over random groups of density d&lt;\frac{1}{2}.</description>

Abstract: Filters are collections of sets that are closed under supersets and finite intersections, serving as fundamental tools in topology and set theory. An ultrafilter, a maximal filter on a set, plays a crucial role in these fields by rigorously handling limits, convergence, and compactness. A connectivity system is defined as a pair (X,f) , where X is a finite set and f is a symmetric submodular function. Understanding the duality in these parameters elucidates the relationship between different decompositions and measures of a graph's complexity. In this paper, we delve into ultrafilters on connectivity systems, applying Tukey's Lemma to these systems. Additionally, we explore prefilters, ultra-prefilters, and subbases within the context of connectivity systems. Furthermore, we introduce and investigate new parameters related to width, length, and depth, enhancing our understanding of these mathematical structures.</description>
