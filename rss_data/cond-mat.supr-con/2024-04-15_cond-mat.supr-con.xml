      <title>In-situ Formation of Superconducting FeTe/layered-MnTe heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Manganese telluride (MnTe) has garnered strong interest recently for its antiferromagnetic semiconductor properties, which are promising for applications in spintronics, data storage, and quantum computing. In this study, we discovered that the deposition of FeTe onto zinc-blende MnTe (ZB-MnTe) via molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) results in a phase transition from ZB-MnTe to a layered MnTe (l-MnTe) phase with van der Waals (vdW) gaps, which is a novel phase of MnTe. The l-MnTe phase was characterized using cross-sectional high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) imaging, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mapping, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The FeTe/l-MnTe heterostructure exhibits high-quality superconducting properties that closely resemble those of bulk superconducting materials. We found that the Fe:Te ratio during FeTe deposition is critical to the phase transition and the superconducting characteristics of the heterostructure system. An increased Fe:Te ratio used for the FeTe growth leads to localized formation of layered Mn4Te3 (l-Mn4Te3) and degrades the superconductivity, while a decreased ratio may hamper the transformation from ZB-MnTe to l-MnTe, leading to the loss of superconductivity. Most importantly, this study reports the realization of a layered structure of MnTe by an in-situ approach via chemical interaction, which might be further applied to generating unprecedented phases of materials under certain conditions.</description>

      <title>Fabry-Perot superconducting diode</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting diode effects (SDEs) occur in systems with asymmetric critical supercurrents $|I^c_+|\neq |I^c_-|$ yielding dissipationless flow in one direction $(e.g., +)$, while dissipative transport in the opposite direction $(-)$. Here we investigate the SDE in a phase-biased $\phi$ Josephson junction with a double-barrier resonant-tunneling InAs nanowire nested between proximitized InAs/Al leads with finite momentum $\hbar q$ Cooper pairing. Within the Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) approach, we obtain the exact BCS ground state energy $\mathcal{E}_G(q,\phi)$ and $I^{c}_{+} \neq |I^{c}_{-}|$ from the current-phase relation $I_G(q,\phi) \sim \partial_{\phi}\mathcal{E}_G(q,\phi)$. The SDE arises from the accrued Andreev phase shifts $\delta \phi_{L,R}(q,\phi)$ leading to asymmetric BdG spectra for $q\neq 0$. Remarkably, the diode efficiency $\gamma=(I^{c}_{+} - |I^{c}_{-}|)/(I^{c}_{+} + |I^{c}_{-}|)$ shows multiple Fabry-Perot resonances $\gamma \simeq 26\%$ at the double-barrier Andreev bound states as the well depth $V_g$ is varied. Our $\gamma$ also features sign reversals for increasing $q$ and high sensitiveness to fermion-parity transitions. The latter enables $I^{c}_{+} (\phi_+)\rightleftarrows I^{c}_{-}(\phi_-)$ switchings over narrow phase windows, i.e., $\phi_+, \phi_- \in \Delta \phi\ll\pi$, possibly relevant for future superconducting electronics.</description>

      <title>Interlayer Pairing Induced Partially Gapped Fermi Surface in Trilayer La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the superconducting pairing mechanisms in the trilayer $\mathrm{La}_4\mathrm{Ni}_3\mathrm{O}_{10}$ material through self-consistent mean-field calculations. Our findings demonstrate that intralayer pairings are substantially weaker compared to interlayer ones. Remarkably, in the state characterized by interlayer pairing, we detect the presence of partially gapped Fermi surfaces, a fascinating occurrence attributable to the disparity between the inner and outer conducting layers of $\mathrm{La}_4\mathrm{Ni}_3\mathrm{O}_{10}$. Moreover, this study provides valuable insights into the lower superconducting transition temperatures observed in $\mathrm{La}_4\mathrm{Ni}_3\mathrm{O}_{10}$ compounds. This contributes to a deeper understanding of its distinct superconducting attributes.</description>

      <title>Observation of the Josephson effect in superhydrides: DC SQUID based on (La,Ce)H$_{10}$ with operating temperature of 179 K</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Among known materials, hydride superconductors have the highest critical temperatures and are very promising as a basis for electronic sensors. Superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID), due to its unique sensitivity to magnetic fields, is the most important application of superconductors in microelectronics. In this work, we describe a direct current SQUID made of lanthanum-cerium superhydride (La, Ce)H$_{10}$ at a pressure of 148 GPa, with an operating temperature of 179 K and a bias current of about 2 mA. When placing (La, Ce)H$_{10}$ in a modulated magnetic field (0.1-0.005 Hz, 5 G), we observed the generation of higher harmonics up to 18${\nu}$$_0$ and a periodic dependence of the sample resistance on the magnetic flux density R ${\propto}$ cos(${\pi}$${\Phi}$/${\Phi}$$_0$). We demonstrate that the (La, Ce)H$_{10}$ SQUID with a size of about 6 ${\mu}$m, operates in the mode of low thermal fluctuations and can be used to detect magnetic fields below 0.1 G. Our findings pave the road to more advanced applications of the Josephson effect and SQUIDs made of hydride superconductors.</description>

      <title>Flat Band Josephson Junctions with Quantum Metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we consider superconductor/flat band material/superconductor (S/FB/S) Josephson junctions (JJs) where the flat band material possesses isolated flat bands with exactly zero Fermi velocity. Contrary to conventional S/N/S JJs in which the critical Josephson current vanishes when the Fermi velocity goes to zero, we show here that the critical current in the S/FB/S junction is controlled by the quantum metric length $\xi_{QM}$ of the flat bands. Microscopically, when $\xi_{QM}$ of the flat band is long enough, the interface bound states originally localized at the two S/FB, FB/S interfaces can penetrate deeply into the flat band material and hybridize to form Andreev bound states (ABS). These ABS are able to carry long range and sizable supercurrents. Importantly, $\xi_{QM}$ also controls how far the proximity effect can penetrate into the flat band material. This is in sharp contrast with de Gennes' theory for S/N junctions in which the proximity effect is expected to be zero when the Fermi velocity of the normal metal is zero. We further suggest that the S/FB/S junctions gives rise to a new type of resonant Josephson transistors which can carry sizeable and highly gate-tunable supercurrent.</description>

      <title>Odd-frequency superconducting pairing and multiple Majorana edge modes in driven topological superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Majorana zero modes have been shown to be the simplest quasiparticles exhibiting pure odd-frequency pairing, an effect that has so far been theoretically established in the static regime. In this work we investigate the formation of Majorana modes and odd-frequency pairing in $p$-wave spin-polarized superconductors under a time-dependent drive. We first show that the driven system hosts multiple Majorana modes emerging at zero and $\pi$, whose formation can be controlled by an appropriate tuning of the drive frequency and chemical potential. Then we explore the induced pair correlations and find that odd-frequency spin-polarized $s$-wave pairing is broadly induced, acquiring large values in the presence of Majorana modes. We discover that, while odd-frequency pairing is proportional to $\sim1/\omega$ in the presence of Majorana zero modes, it is proportional to $\sim 1/(\omega-\pi\hbar/T)$ in the presence of Majorana $\pi$ modes, where $T$ is the periodicity of the drive. Furthermore, we find that the amount of odd-frequency pairing becomes larger when multiple Majorana modes appear but the overall divergent profile as a function of frequency remains. Our work thus paves the way for understanding the emergent pair correlations in driven topological superconductors</description>

      <title>Quantum size effects on Andreev transport in Nb/Au/Nb Josephson junctions: A combined ab-initio and experimental study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have measured the critical current density, superconducting coherence length, and superconducting transition temperature on single-domain, epitaxially-grown Nb(110)/Au(111)/Nb(110) trilayers, all showing non-monotonic behavior as a function of the thickness of the Au layer. To reveal the underlying physical mechanism, we apply the first-principles-based microscopic theory of inhomogeneous relativistic superconductivity which predicts quantitatively the superconducting properties. As a result of the confinement in the growth direction, quantum-well states appear in the Au layer which yields a complex structure of Andreev states in the superconducting state. It is shown how the quantum-well states modify the quasiparticle spectrum and the Josephson supercurrent. Our study reveals the coexistence of the two superconducting phases in the Au layer, the usual intraband s-wave phase and an additional non-uniform phase stemming from interband pairing (without magnetic field). These results indicate the rich interplay between quantum-size and proximity effects, suggesting the possibility of modifying superconducting transport properties by exploiting thickness-dependent quantum size effect</description>

      <title>Dynamical Mean Field Theory for Real Materials on a Quantum Computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computers (QC) could harbor the potential to significantly advance materials simulations, particularly at the atomistic scale involving strongly correlated fermionic systems where an accurate description of quantum many-body effects scales unfavorably with size. While a full-scale treatment of condensed matter systems with currently available noisy quantum computers remains elusive, quantum embedding schemes like dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) allow the mapping of an effective, reduced subspace Hamiltonian to available devices to improve the accuracy of ab initio calculations such as density functional theory (DFT). Here, we report on the development of a hybrid quantum-classical DFT+DMFT simulation framework which relies on a quantum impurity solver based on the Lehmann representation of the impurity Green's function. Hardware experiments with up to 14 qubits on the IBM Quantum system are conducted, using advanced error mitigation methods and a novel calibration scheme for an improved zero-noise extrapolation to effectively reduce adverse effects from inherent noise on current quantum devices. We showcase the utility of our quantum DFT+DMFT workflow by assessing the correlation effects on the electronic structure of a real material, Ca2CuO2Cl2, and by carefully benchmarking our quantum results with respect to exact reference solutions and experimental spectroscopy measurements.</description>

      <title>Microwave Hall measurements using a circularly polarized dielectric cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have developed a circularly polarized dielectric rutile (TiO$_2$) cavity with a high quality-factor that can generate circularly polarized microwaves from two orthogonal linearly polarized microwaves with a phase difference of $\pm\pi/2$ using a hybrid coupler. Using this cavity, we have established a new methodology to measure the microwave Hall conductivity of a small single crystal of metals in the skin-depth region. Based on the cavity perturbation technique, we have shown that all components of the surface impedance tensor can be extracted under the application of a magnetic field by comparing the right- and left-handed circularly polarization modes. To verify the validity of the developed method, we performed test measurements on tiny Bi single crystals at low temperatures. As a result, we have successfully obtained the surface impedance tensor components and confirmed that the characteristic field dependence of the ac Hall angle in the microwave region is consistent with the expectation from the dc transport measurements. These results demonstrate a significant improvement in sensitivity compared to previous methods. Thus, our developed technique allows more accurate microwave Hall measurements, opening the way for new approaches to explore novel topological quantum materials, such as time-reversal symmetry-breaking superconductors.</description>

      <title>First-order quantum breakdown of superconductivity in amorphous superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continuous quantum phase transitions are widely assumed and frequently observed in various systems of quantum particles or spins. Their characteristic trait involves scaling laws governing a second-order, gradual suppression of the order parameter as the quantum critical point is approached. The localization of Cooper pairs in disordered superconductors and the resulting breakdown of superconductivity have long stood as a prototypical example. Here, we show a departure from this paradigm, showcasing that amorphous superconducting films of indium oxide undergo a distinctive, discontinuous first-order quantum phase transition tuned by disorder. Through systematic measurements of the plasmon spectrum in superconducting microwave resonators, we provide evidence for a marked jump of both the zero-temperature superfluid stiffness and the transition temperature at the critical disorder. This discontinuous transition sheds light on the previously overlooked role of repulsive interactions between Cooper pairs and the subsequent competition between superconductivity and insulating Cooper-pair glass. Furthermore, our investigation shows that the critical temperature of the films no longer relates to the pairing amplitude but aligns with the superfluid stiffness, consistent with the pseudogap regime of preformed Cooper pairs. Our findings raise fundamental new questions into the role of disorder in quantum phase transitions and carry implications for superinductances in quantum circuits.</description>

      <title>Double-dome Unconventional Superconductivity in Twisted Trilayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graphene moir\'e systems are ideal environments for investigating complex phase diagrams and gaining fundamental insights into the mechanisms underlying exotic states of matter, as they permit controlled manipulation of electronic properties. Magic-angle twisted trilayer graphene (MATTG) has emerged as a key platform to explore moir\'e superconductivity, owing to the robustness of its superconducting order and the displacement-field tunability of its energy bands. Recent measurements strongly suggest that superconductivity in MATTG is unconventional. Here, we report the first direct observation of double-dome superconductivity in MATTG. The temperature, magnetic field, and bias current dependence of the superconductivity of doped holes collectively show that it is significantly suppressed near moir\'e filling $\nu^* = -2.6$, leading to a double dome in the phase diagram within a finite window of the displacement field. The temperature dependence of the normal-state resistance and the $I-V$ curves straddling $\nu^*$ are suggestive of a phase transition and the potentially distinct nature of superconductivity in the two domes. Hartree-Fock calculations incorporating mild strain yield an incommensurate Kekul\'e spiral state whose effective spin polarization peaks in the regime where superconductivity is suppressed in experiments. This allows us to draw conclusions about the normal state as well as the unconventional nature of the superconducting order parameter.</description>

      <title>The two critical temperatures conundrum in La$_{1.83}$Sr$_{0.17}$CuO$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.15540v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The in-plane and out-of-plane superconducting stiffness of LSCO rings appear to vanish at different transition temperatures, which contradicts thermodynamical expectation. In addition, we observe a surprisingly strong dependence of the out-of-plane stiffness transition on sample width. With evidence from Monte Carlo simulations, this effect is explained by very small ratio $\alpha$ of interplane over intraplane superconducting stiffnesses. For three dimensional rings of millimeter dimensions, a crossover from layered three dimensional to quasi one dimensional behavior occurs at temperatures near the thermodynamic transition temperature $T_{\rm c}$, and the out of-plane stiffness appears to vanish below $T_{\rm c}$ by a temperature shift of order $\alpha L_a/\xi^\parallel$, where $L_a/\xi^\parallel$ is the sample's width over coherence length. Including the effects of layer-correlated disorder, the measured temperature shifts can be fit by $\alpha=4.1\times 10^{-5}$ near $T_{\rm c}$, which is significantly lower than its previously measured value near zero temperature.</description>

      <title>Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer interaction as an infinite-range Penson-Kolb pairing mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16877v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the well-known $(k\uparrow, -k\downarrow)$ Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer interaction, when considered in real space, is equivalent to an infinite-range Penson-Kolb pairing mechanism coexisting with an attractive Hubbard term. Driven by this discovery and aiming at exploring the conduction properties, we investigate the dynamics of fermionic particles confined in a ring-shaped lattice. We assume that fermions are simultaneously influenced by the pairing interaction and by an Aharonov-Bohm electromagnetic phase, which is incorporated into the model in a highly non-trivial manner. Remarkably, the aforementioned model shows Richardson integrability for both integer and half-integer values of the applied magnetic flux $\Phi/\Phi_0$, thus permitting the exact solution of a genuine many-body problem. We discuss the ground state properties of both two-particle and many-particle systems, drawing comparisons with results from the attractive Hubbard model. Our approach combines exact diagonalization, density matrix renormalization group techniques, and numerical solution of the Richardson equations. This comprehensive analysis allows us to study various key metrics, including the system's conductivity as a function of the interaction strength. In this way, the BCS-BEC transition is investigated in a continuous manner, thus permitting to shed light on fundamental aspects of superconducting pairing. Our findings can be experimentally tested in a condensed matter context or, with greater level of control, using atomtronics platforms.</description>

      <title>General behavior of high temperature and conventional superconductors: Universal condensation energy scaling for both conventional and high $T_c$ superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02532v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the scaling of the condensation energy $E_{\Delta}$ divided by $\gamma$, $E_{\Delta}/\gamma\simeq N(0)\Delta_1^2/\gamma$, of both conventional superconductors and unconventional high-$T_c$ one, where $N(0)$ is the density of states, $\Delta_1$ is the maximum value of the superconducting gap and $\gamma$ is the Sommerfeld coefficient. For the first time, we show that the universal scaling of $E_{\Delta}/\gamma\propto T_c^2$ applies equally to conventional superconductors and unconventional high-$T_c$ ones. Our consideration is based on both facts: Bogoliubov quasiparticles act in conventional and unconventional superconductors, and the corresponding flat band is deformed by the unconventional superconducting state. As a result, our theoretical observations based on the fermion condensation theory are in good agreement with experimental facts.</description>

Abstract: By codoping sulfur and copper into lead apatite, the crystal grains are directionally stacked and the room-temperature resistivity is reduced from insulating to $2\times10^{-5}~\Omega\cdot$m. The resistance-temperature curve exhibits a nearly linear relationship suggesting the presence of strange-metal phase. A possible Meissner effect is observed in dc magnetic measurements. An even-in-field transverse voltage is found indicating the possible contribution of individual vortex dynamics. A clear pathway towards superconductivity in this material is subsequently benchmarked.</description>

      <title>Singlet, triplet, and mixed all-to-all pairing states emerging from incoherent fermions</title>

Abstract: The electron-electron and electron-phonon coupling in complex materials can be more complicated than simple density-density interactions, involving intertwined dynamics of spin, charge, and spatial symmetries. This motivates studying universal models with complex interactions, and studying whether in this case BCS-type singlet pairing is still the ``natural'' fate of the system. To this end, we construct a Yukawa-SYK model with nonlocal couplings in both spin and charge channels. Furthermore, we provide for time-reversal-symmetry breaking dynamics by averaging over the Gaussian Unitary ensemble rather than the Orthogonal ensemble. We find that the ground state of the system can be an orbitally nonlocal superconducting state arising from incoherent fermions with no BCS-like analog. The superconductivity has an equal tendency to triplet and singlet pairing states separated by a non-Fermi liquid phase. We further study the fate of the system within the superconducting phase and find that the expected ground state, away from the critical point, is a mixed singlet/triplet state. Finally, we find that while at $T_c$ the triplet and singlet transitions are dual to one another, below $T_c$ the duality is broken, with the triplet state more susceptible to orbital fluctuations just by virtue of its symmetry. Our results indicate that such fluctuation-induced mixed states may be an inherent feature of strongly correlated materials.</description>
