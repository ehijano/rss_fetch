      <title>LLMs as Educational Analysts: Transforming Multimodal Data Traces into Actionable Reading Assessment Reports</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reading assessments are essential for enhancing students' comprehension, yet many EdTech applications focus mainly on outcome-based metrics, providing limited insights into student behavior and cognition. This study investigates the use of multimodal data sources -- including eye-tracking data, learning outcomes, assessment content, and teaching standards -- to derive meaningful reading insights. We employ unsupervised learning techniques to identify distinct reading behavior patterns, and then a large language model (LLM) synthesizes the derived information into actionable reports for educators, streamlining the interpretation process. LLM experts and human educators evaluate these reports for clarity, accuracy, relevance, and pedagogical usefulness. Our findings indicate that LLMs can effectively function as educational analysts, turning diverse data into teacher-friendly insights that are well-received by educators. While promising for automating insight generation, human oversight remains crucial to ensure reliability and fairness. This research advances human-centered AI in education, connecting data-driven analytics with practical classroom applications.</description>

      <title>AI Automatons: AI Systems Intended to Imitate Humans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is a growing proliferation of AI systems designed to mimic people's behavior, work, abilities, likenesses, or humanness -- systems we dub AI automatons. Individuals, groups, or generic humans are being simulated to produce creative work in their styles, to respond to surveys in their places, to probe how they would use a new system before deployment, to provide users with assistance and companionship, and to anticipate their possible future behavior and interactions with others, just to name a few applications. The research, design, deployment, and availability of such AI systems have, however, also prompted growing concerns about a wide range of possible legal, ethical, and other social impacts. To both 1) facilitate productive discussions about whether, when, and how to design and deploy such systems, and 2) chart the current landscape of existing and prospective AI automatons, we need to tease apart determinant design axes and considerations that can aid our understanding of whether and how various design choices along these axes could mitigate -- or instead exacerbate -- potential adverse impacts that the development and use of AI automatons could give rise to. In this paper, through a synthesis of related literature and extensive examples of existing AI systems intended to mimic humans, we develop a conceptual framework to help foreground key axes of design variations and provide analytical scaffolding to foster greater recognition of the design choices available to developers, as well as the possible ethical implications these choices might have.</description>

      <title>Use Me Wisely: AI-Driven Assessment for LLM Prompting Skills Development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of large language model (LLM)-powered chatbots, such as ChatGPT, has become popular across various domains, supporting a range of tasks and processes. However, due to the intrinsic complexity of LLMs, effective prompting is more challenging than it may seem. This highlights the need for innovative educational and support strategies that are both widely accessible and seamlessly integrated into task workflows. Yet, LLM prompting is highly task- and domain-dependent, limiting the effectiveness of generic approaches. In this study, we explore whether LLM-based methods can facilitate learning assessments by using ad-hoc guidelines and a minimal number of annotated prompt samples. Our framework transforms these guidelines into features that can be identified within learners' prompts. Using these feature descriptions and annotated examples, we create few-shot learning detectors. We then evaluate different configurations of these detectors, testing three state-of-the-art LLMs and ensembles. We run experiments with cross-validation on a sample of original prompts, as well as tests on prompts collected from task-naive learners. Our results show how LLMs perform on feature detection. Notably, GPT- 4 demonstrates strong performance on most features, while closely related models, such as GPT-3 and GPT-3.5 Turbo (Instruct), show inconsistent behaviors in feature classification. These differences highlight the need for further research into how design choices impact feature selection and prompt detection. Our findings contribute to the fields of generative AI literacy and computer-supported learning assessment, offering valuable insights for both researchers and practitioners.</description>

      <title>Do Not Trust Licenses You See -- Dataset Compliance Requires Massive-Scale AI-Powered Lifecycle Tracing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper argues that a dataset's legal risk cannot be accurately assessed by its license terms alone; instead, tracking dataset redistribution and its full lifecycle is essential. However, this process is too complex for legal experts to handle manually at scale. Tracking dataset provenance, verifying redistribution rights, and assessing evolving legal risks across multiple stages require a level of precision and efficiency that exceeds human capabilities. Addressing this challenge effectively demands AI agents that can systematically trace dataset redistribution, analyze compliance, and identify legal risks. We develop an automated data compliance system called NEXUS and show that AI can perform these tasks with higher accuracy, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness than human experts. Our massive legal analysis of 17,429 unique entities and 8,072 license terms using this approach reveals the discrepancies in legal rights between the original datasets before redistribution and their redistributed subsets, underscoring the necessity of the data lifecycle-aware compliance. For instance, we find that out of 2,852 datasets with commercially viable individual license terms, only 605 (21%) are legally permissible for commercialization. This work sets a new standard for AI data governance, advocating for a framework that systematically examines the entire lifecycle of dataset redistribution to ensure transparent, legal, and responsible dataset management.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the advent of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), medical artificial intelligence (AI) has experienced significant technological progress and paradigm shifts. This survey provides an extensive review of recent advancements in Medical Vision-Language Models (Med-VLMs), which integrate visual and textual data to enhance healthcare outcomes. We discuss the foundational technology behind Med-VLMs, illustrating how general models are adapted for complex medical tasks, and examine their applications in healthcare. The transformative impact of Med-VLMs on clinical practice, education, and patient care is highlighted, alongside challenges such as data scarcity, narrow task generalization, interpretability issues, and ethical concerns like fairness, accountability, and privacy. These limitations are exacerbated by uneven dataset distribution, computational demands, and regulatory hurdles. Rigorous evaluation methods and robust regulatory frameworks are essential for safe integration into healthcare workflows. Future directions include leveraging large-scale, diverse datasets, improving cross-modal generalization, and enhancing interpretability. Innovations like federated learning, lightweight architectures, and Electronic Health Record (EHR) integration are explored as pathways to democratize access and improve clinical relevance. This review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of Med-VLMs' strengths and limitations, fostering their ethical and balanced adoption in healthcare.</description>

      <title>Recognition of Dysarthria in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis patients using Hypernetworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) constitutes a progressive neurodegenerative disease with varying symptoms, including decline in speech intelligibility. Existing studies, which recognize dysarthria in ALS patients by predicting the clinical standard ALSFRS-R, rely on feature extraction strategies and the design of customized convolutional neural networks followed by dense layers. However, recent studies have shown that neural networks adopting the logic of input-conditional computations enjoy a series of benefits, including faster training, better performance, and flexibility. To resolve these issues, we present the first study incorporating hypernetworks for recognizing dysarthria. Specifically, we use audio files, convert them into log-Mel spectrogram, delta, and delta-delta, and pass the resulting image through a pretrained modified AlexNet model. Finally, we use a hypernetwork, which generates weights for a target network. Experiments are conducted on a newly collected publicly available dataset, namely VOC-ALS. Results showed that the proposed approach reaches Accuracy up to 82.66% outperforming strong baselines, including multimodal fusion methods, while findings from an ablation study demonstrated the effectiveness of the introduced methodology. Overall, our approach incorporating hypernetworks obtains valuable advantages over state-of-the-art results in terms of generalization ability, parameter efficiency, and robustness.</description>

      <title>MultiAgentBench: Evaluating the Collaboration and Competition of LLM agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities as autonomous agents, yet existing benchmarks either focus on single-agent tasks or are confined to narrow domains, failing to capture the dynamics of multi-agent coordination and competition. In this paper, we introduce MultiAgentBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate LLM-based multi-agent systems across diverse, interactive scenarios. Our framework measures not only task completion but also the quality of collaboration and competition using novel, milestone-based key performance indicators. Moreover, we evaluate various coordination protocols (including star, chain, tree, and graph topologies) and innovative strategies such as group discussion and cognitive planning. Notably, gpt-4o-mini reaches the average highest task score, graph structure performs the best among coordination protocols in the research scenario, and cognitive planning improves milestone achievement rates by 3%. Code and datasets are public available at https://github.com/MultiagentBench/MARBLE.</description>

      <title>Analyzing the Safety of Japanese Large Language Models in Stereotype-Triggering Prompts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01947v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, Large Language Models have attracted growing interest for their significant potential, though concerns have rapidly emerged regarding unsafe behaviors stemming from inherent stereotypes and biases. Most research on stereotypes in LLMs has primarily relied on indirect evaluation setups, in which models are prompted to select between pairs of sentences associated with particular social groups. Recently, direct evaluation methods have emerged, examining open-ended model responses to overcome limitations of previous approaches, such as annotator biases. Most existing studies have focused on English-centric LLMs, whereas research on non-English models, particularly Japanese, remains sparse, despite the growing development and adoption of these models. This study examines the safety of Japanese LLMs when responding to stereotype-triggering prompts in direct setups. We constructed 3,612 prompts by combining 301 social group terms, categorized by age, gender, and other attributes, with 12 stereotype-inducing templates in Japanese. Responses were analyzed from three foundational models trained respectively on Japanese, English, and Chinese language. Our findings reveal that LLM-jp, a Japanese native model, exhibits the lowest refusal rate and is more likely to generate toxic and negative responses compared to other models. Additionally, prompt format significantly influence the output of all models, and the generated responses include exaggerated reactions toward specific social groups, varying across models. These findings underscore the insufficient ethical safety mechanisms in Japanese LLMs and demonstrate that even high-accuracy models can produce biased outputs when processing Japanese-language prompts. We advocate for improving safety mechanisms and bias mitigation strategies in Japanese LLMs, contributing to ongoing discussions on AI ethics beyond linguistic boundaries.</description>

      <title>Linear Representations of Political Perspective Emerge in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the ability to generate text that realistically reflects a range of different subjective human perspectives. This paper studies how LLMs are seemingly able to reflect more liberal versus more conservative viewpoints among other political perspectives in American politics. We show that LLMs possess linear representations of political perspectives within activation space, wherein more similar perspectives are represented closer together. To do so, we probe the attention heads across the layers of three open transformer-based LLMs (\texttt{Llama-2-7b-chat}, \texttt{Mistral-7b-instruct}, \texttt{Vicuna-7b}). We first prompt models to generate text from the perspectives of different U.S.~lawmakers. We then identify sets of attention heads whose activations linearly predict those lawmakers' DW-NOMINATE scores, a widely-used and validated measure of political ideology. We find that highly predictive heads are primarily located in the middle layers, often speculated to encode high-level concepts and tasks. Using probes only trained to predict lawmakers' ideology, we then show that the same probes can predict measures of news outlets' slant from the activations of models prompted to simulate text from those news outlets. These linear probes allow us to visualize, interpret, and monitor ideological stances implicitly adopted by an LLM as it generates open-ended responses. Finally, we demonstrate that by applying linear interventions to these attention heads, we can steer the model outputs toward a more liberal or conservative stance. Overall, our research suggests that LLMs possess a high-level linear representation of American political ideology and that by leveraging recent advances in mechanistic interpretability, we can identify, monitor, and steer the subjective perspective underlying generated text.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown remarkable success in various graph-based learning tasks. However, recent studies have raised concerns about fairness and privacy issues in GNNs, highlighting the potential for biased or discriminatory outcomes and the vulnerability of sensitive information. This paper presents a comprehensive investigation of fairness and privacy in GNNs, exploring the impact of various fairness-preserving measures on model performance. We conduct experiments across diverse datasets and evaluate the effectiveness of different fairness interventions. Our analysis considers the trade-offs between fairness, privacy, and accuracy, providing insights into the challenges and opportunities in achieving both fair and private graph learning. The results highlight the importance of carefully selecting and combining fairness-preserving measures based on the specific characteristics of the data and the desired fairness objectives. This study contributes to a deeper understanding of the complex interplay between fairness, privacy, and accuracy in GNNs, paving the way for the development of more robust and ethical graph learning models.</description>

      <title>Trust and Friction: Negotiating How Information Flows Through Decentralized Social Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decentralized social media protocols enable users in independent, user-hosted servers (i.e., instances) to interact with each other while they self-govern. This community-based model of social media governance opens up new opportunities for tailored decision-making about information flows -- i.e., what user data is shared to whom and when -- and in turn, for protecting user privacy. To better understand how community governance shapes privacy expectations on decentralized social media, we conducted a semi-structured interview with 23 users of the Fediverse, a decentralized social media network. Our findings illustrate important factors that shape a community's understandings of information flows, such as rules and proactive efforts from admins who are perceived as trustworthy. We also highlight ''governance frictions'' between communities that raise new privacy risks due to incompatibilities in values, security practices, and software. Our findings highlight the unique challenges of decentralized social media, suggest design opportunities to address frictions, and outline the role of participatory decision-making to realize the full potential of decentralization.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Large Language Models for Enhanced Digital Twin Modeling: Trends, Methods, and Challenges</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Digital twin technology is a transformative innovation driving the digital transformation and intelligent optimization of manufacturing systems. By integrating real-time data with computational models, digital twins enable continuous monitoring, simulation, prediction, and optimization, effectively bridging the gap between the physical and digital worlds. Recent advancements in communication, computing, and control technologies have accelerated the development and adoption of digital twins across various industries. However, significant challenges remain, including limited data for accurate system modeling, inefficiencies in system analysis, and a lack of explainability in the interactions between physical and digital systems. The rise of large language models (LLMs) offers new avenues to address these challenges. LLMs have shown exceptional capabilities across diverse domains, exhibiting strong generalization and emergent abilities that hold great potential for enhancing digital twins. This paper provides a comprehensive review of recent developments in LLMs and their applications to digital twin modeling. We propose a unified description-prediction-prescription framework to integrate digital twin modeling technologies and introduce a structured taxonomy to categorize LLM functionalities in these contexts. For each stage of application, we summarize the methodologies, identify key challenges, and explore potential future directions. To demonstrate the effectiveness of LLM-enhanced digital twins, we present an LLM-enhanced enterprise digital twin system, which enables automatic modeling and optimization of an enterprise. Finally, we discuss future opportunities and challenges in advancing LLM-enhanced digital twins, offering valuable insights for researchers and practitioners in related fields.</description>

      <title>Limited Effectiveness of LLM-based Data Augmentation for COVID-19 Misinformation Stance Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Misinformation surrounding emerging outbreaks poses a serious societal threat, making robust countermeasures essential. One promising approach is stance detection (SD), which identifies whether social media posts support or oppose misleading claims. In this work, we finetune classifiers on COVID-19 misinformation SD datasets consisting of claims and corresponding tweets. Specifically, we test controllable misinformation generation (CMG) using large language models (LLMs) as a method for data augmentation. While CMG demonstrates the potential for expanding training datasets, our experiments reveal that performance gains over traditional augmentation methods are often minimal and inconsistent, primarily due to built-in safeguards within LLMs. We release our code and datasets to facilitate further research on misinformation detection and generation.</description>

      <title>Encountering Friction, Understanding Crises: How Do Digital Natives Make Sense of Crisis Maps?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Crisis maps are regarded as crucial tools in crisis communication, as demonstrated during the COVID-19 pandemic and climate change crises. However, there is limited understanding of how public audiences engage with these maps and extract essential information. Our study investigates the sensemaking of young, digitally native viewers as they interact with crisis maps. We integrate frameworks from the learning sciences and human-data interaction to explore sensemaking through two empirical studies: a thematic analysis of online comments from a New York Times series on graph comprehension, and interviews with 18 participants from German-speaking regions. Our analysis categorizes sensemaking activities into established clusters: inspecting, engaging with content, and placing, and introduces responding personally to capture the affective dimension. We identify friction points connected to these clusters, including struggles with color concepts, responses to missing context, lack of personal connection, and distrust, offering insights for improving crisis communication to public audiences.</description>

      <title>Multilingualism, Transnationality, and K-pop in the Online #StopAsianHate Movement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The #StopAsianHate (SAH) movement is a broad social movement against violence targeting Asians and Asian Americans, beginning in 2021 in response to racial discrimination related to COVID-19 and sparking worldwide conversation about anti-Asian hate. However, research on the online SAH movement has focused on English-speaking participants so the spread of the movement outside of the United States is largely unknown. In addition, there have been no long-term studies of SAH so the extent to which it has been successfully sustained over time is not well understood. We present an analysis of 6.5 million "#StopAsianHate" tweets from 2.2 million users all over the globe and spanning 60 different languages, constituting the first study of the non-English and transnational component of the online SAH movement. Using a combination of topic modeling, user modeling, and hand annotation, we identify and characterize the dominant discussions and users participating in the movement and draw comparisons of English versus non-English topics and users. We discover clear differences in events driving topics, where spikes in English tweets are driven by violent crimes in the US but spikes in non-English tweets are driven by transnational incidents of anti-Asian sentiment towards symbolic representatives of Asian nations. We also find that global K-pop fans were quick to adopt the SAH movement and, in fact, sustained it for longer than any other user group. Our work contributes to understanding the transnationality and evolution of the SAH movement, and more generally to exploring upward scale shift and public attention in large-scale multilingual online activism.</description>

      <title>Deepfake-Eval-2024: A Multi-Modal In-the-Wild Benchmark of Deepfakes Circulated in 2024</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the age of increasingly realistic generative AI, robust deepfake detection is essential for mitigating fraud and disinformation. While many deepfake detectors report high accuracy on academic datasets, we show that these academic benchmarks are out of date and not representative of recent deepfakes. We introduce Deepfake-Eval-2024, a new deepfake detection benchmark consisting of in-the-wild deepfakes collected from social media and deepfake detection platform users in 2024. Deepfake-Eval-2024 consists of 44 hours of videos, 56.5 hours of audio, and 1,975 images, encompassing the latest manipulation technologies. The benchmark contains diverse media content from 88 different websites in 52 different languages. We find that the performance of open-source state-of-the-art deepfake detection models drops precipitously when evaluated on Deepfake-Eval-2024, with AUC decreasing by 50% for video, 48% for audio, and 45% for image models compared to previous benchmarks. We also evaluate commercial deepfake detection models and models finetuned on Deepfake-Eval-2024, and find that they have superior performance to off-the-shelf open-source models, but they do not yet reach the accuracy of human deepfake forensic analysts. The dataset is available at https://github.com/nuriachandra/Deepfake-Eval-2024.</description>

      <title>Wikipedia in the Era of LLMs: Evolution and Risks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a thorough analysis of the impact of Large Language Models (LLMs) on Wikipedia, examining the evolution of Wikipedia through existing data and using simulations to explore potential risks. We begin by analyzing page views and article content to study Wikipedia's recent changes and assess the impact of LLMs. Subsequently, we evaluate how LLMs affect various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks related to Wikipedia, including machine translation and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Our findings and simulation results reveal that Wikipedia articles have been influenced by LLMs, with an impact of approximately 1%-2% in certain categories. If the machine translation benchmark based on Wikipedia is influenced by LLMs, the scores of the models may become inflated, and the comparative results among models might shift as well. Moreover, the effectiveness of RAG might decrease if the knowledge base becomes polluted by LLM-generated content. While LLMs have not yet fully changed Wikipedia's language and knowledge structures, we believe that our empirical findings signal the need for careful consideration of potential future risks.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Lens: Quantifying the Impact of Scientific Documentaries through Amazon Reviews</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08705v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Engaging the public with science is critical for a well-informed population. A popular method of scientific communication is documentaries. Once released, it can be difficult to assess the impact of such works on a large scale, due to the overhead required for in-depth audience feedback studies. In what follows, we overview our complementary approach to qualitative studies through quantitative impact and sentiment analysis of Amazon reviews for several scientific documentaries. In addition to developing a novel impact category taxonomy for this analysis, we release a dataset containing 1296 human-annotated sentences from 1043 Amazon reviews for six movies created in whole or part by the Advanced Visualization Lab (AVL). This interdisciplinary team is housed at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications and consists of visualization designers who focus on cinematic presentations of scientific data. Using this data, we train and evaluate several machine learning and large language models, discussing their effectiveness and possible generalizability for documentaries beyond those focused on for this work. Themes are also extracted from our annotated dataset which, along with our large language model analysis, demonstrate a measure of the ability of scientific documentaries to engage with the public.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15859v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology is profoundly transforming human society and concurrently presenting a series of ethical, legal, and social issues. The effective governance of AI has become a crucial global concern. Since 2022, the extensive deployment of generative AI, particularly large language models, marked a new phase in AI governance. Continuous efforts are being made by the international community in actively addressing the novel challenges posed by these AI developments. As consensus on international governance continues to be established and put into action, the practical importance of conducting a global assessment of the state of AI governance is progressively coming to light. In this context, we initiated the development of the AI Governance InternationaL Evaluation Index (AGILE Index). Adhering to the design principle, "the level of governance should match the level of development," the inaugural evaluation of the AGILE Index commences with an exploration of four foundational pillars: the development level of AI, the AI governance environment, the AI governance instruments, and the AI governance effectiveness. It covers 39 indicators across 18 dimensions to comprehensively assess the AI governance level of 14 representative countries globally. The index is utilized to delve into the status of AI governance to date in 14 countries for the first batch of evaluation. The aim is to depict the current state of AI governance in these countries through data scoring, assist them in identifying their governance stage and uncovering governance issues, and ultimately offer insights for the enhancement of their AI governance systems.</description>

      <title>AI Literacy in K-12 and Higher Education in the Wake of Generative AI: An Integrative Review</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00079v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Even though AI literacy has emerged as a prominent education topic in the wake of generative AI, its definition remains vague. There is little consensus among researchers and practitioners on how to discuss and design AI literacy interventions. The term has been used to describe both learning activities that train undergraduate students to use ChatGPT effectively and having kindergarten children interact with social robots. This paper applies an integrative review method to examine empirical and theoretical AI literacy studies published since 2020. In synthesizing the 124 reviewed studies, three ways to conceptualize literacy-functional, critical, and indirectly beneficial-and three perspectives on AI-technical detail, tool, and sociocultural-were identified, forming a framework that reflects the spectrum of how AI literacy is approached in practice. The framework highlights the need for more specialized terms within AI literacy discourse and indicates research gaps in certain AI literacy objectives.</description>

      <title>SocialEyes: Scaling mobile eye-tracking to multi-person social settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06345v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Eye movements provide a window into human behaviour, attention, and interaction dynamics. Challenges in real-world, multi-person environments have, however, restrained eye-tracking research predominantly to single-person, in-lab settings. We developed a system to stream, record, and analyse synchronised data from multiple mobile eye-tracking devices during collective viewing experiences (e.g., concerts, films, lectures). We implemented lightweight operator interfaces for real-time-monitoring, remote-troubleshooting, and gaze-projection from individual egocentric perspectives to a common coordinate space for shared gaze analysis. We tested the system in a live concert and a film screening with 30 simultaneous viewers during each of two public events (N=60). We observe precise time-synchronisation between devices measured through recorded clock-offsets, and accurate gaze-projection in challenging dynamic scenes. Our novel analysis metrics and visualizations illustrate the potential of collective eye-tracking data for understanding collaborative behaviour and social interaction. This advancement promotes ecological validity in eye-tracking research and paves the way for innovative interactive tools.</description>

      <title>Can AI writing be salvaged? Mitigating Idiosyncrasies and Improving Human-AI Alignment in the Writing Process through Edits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14509v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: LLM-based applications are helping people write, and LLM-generated text is making its way into social media, journalism, and our classrooms. However, the differences between LLM-generated and human written text remain unclear. To explore this, we hired professional writers to edit paragraphs in several creative domains. We first found these writers agree on undesirable idiosyncrasies in LLM generated text, formalizing it into a seven-category taxonomy (e.g. clich\'es, unnecessary exposition). Second, we curated the LAMP corpus: 1,057 LLM-generated paragraphs edited by professional writers according to our taxonomy. Analysis of LAMP reveals that none of the LLMs used in our study (GPT4o, Claude-3.5-Sonnet, Llama-3.1-70b) outperform each other in terms of writing quality, revealing common limitations across model families. Third, building on existing work in automatic editing we evaluated methods to improve LLM-generated text. A large-scale preference annotation confirms that although experts largely prefer text edited by other experts, automatic editing methods show promise in improving alignment between LLM-generated and human-written text.</description>

      <title>Modular Conversational Agents for Surveys and Interviews</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17049v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Surveys and interviews are widely used for collecting insights on emerging or hypothetical scenarios. Traditional human-led methods often face challenges related to cost, scalability, and consistency. Recently, various domains have begun to explore the use of conversational agents (chatbots) powered by generative artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. However, considering decisions in transportation investments and policies often carry significant public and environmental stakes, surveys and interviews face unique challenges in integrating AI agents, underscoring the need for a rigorous, resource-efficient approach that enhances participant engagement and ensures privacy. This paper addresses this gap by introducing a modular approach and its resulting parameterized process for designing AI agents. We detail the system architecture, integrating engineered prompts, specialized knowledge bases, and customizable, goal-oriented conversational logic. We demonstrate the adaptability, generalizability, and efficacy of our modular approach through three empirical studies: (1) travel preference surveys, highlighting conditional logic and multimodal (voice, text, and image generation) capabilities; (2) public opinion elicitation on a newly constructed, novel infrastructure project, showcasing question customization and multilingual (English and French) capabilities; and (3) expert consultation about the impact of technologies on future transportation systems, highlighting real-time, clarification request capabilities for open-ended questions, resilience in handling erratic inputs, and efficient transcript postprocessing. The results suggest that the AI agent increases completion rates and response quality. Furthermore, the modular approach demonstrates controllability, flexibility, and robustness while addressing key ethical, privacy, security, and token consumption concerns.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18210v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Algorithms have played a central role in personalized recommendations on social media. However, they also present significant obstacles for content creators trying to predict and manage their audience reach. This issue is particularly challenging for marginalized groups seeking to maintain safe spaces. Our study explores how women on Xiaohongshu (rednote), a recommendation-driven social platform, proactively re-appropriate hashtags (e.g., #Baby Supplemental Food) by using them in posts unrelated to their literal meaning. The hashtags were strategically chosen from topics that would be uninteresting to the male audience they wanted to block. Through a mixed-methods approach, we analyzed the practice of hashtag re-appropriation based on 5,800 collected posts and interviewed 24 active users from diverse backgrounds to uncover users' motivations and reactions towards the re-appropriation. This practice highlights how users can reclaim agency over content distribution on recommendation-driven platforms, offering insights into self-governance within algorithmic-centered power structures.</description>

      <title>Independent Mobility GPT (IDM-GPT): A Self-Supervised Multi-Agent Large Language Model Framework for Customized Traffic Mobility Analysis Using Machine Learning Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18652v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the urbanization process, an increasing number of sensors are being deployed in transportation systems, leading to an explosion of big data. To harness the power of this vast transportation data, various machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) methods have been introduced to address numerous transportation challenges. However, these methods often require significant investment in data collection, processing, storage, and the employment of professionals with expertise in transportation and ML. Additionally, privacy issues are a major concern when processing data for real-world traffic control and management. To address these challenges, the research team proposes an innovative Multi-agent framework named Independent Mobility GPT (IDM-GPT) based on large language models (LLMs) for customized traffic analysis, management suggestions, and privacy preservation. IDM-GPT efficiently connects users, transportation databases, and ML models economically. IDM-GPT trains, customizes, and applies various LLM-based AI agents for multiple functions, including user query comprehension, prompts optimization, data analysis, model selection, and performance evaluation and enhancement. With IDM-GPT, users without any background in transportation or ML can efficiently and intuitively obtain data analysis and customized suggestions in near real-time based on their questions. Experimental results demonstrate that IDM-GPT delivers satisfactory performance across multiple traffic-related tasks, providing comprehensive and actionable insights that support effective traffic management and urban mobility improvement.</description>
