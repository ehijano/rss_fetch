      <title>Fact-Finding in Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper models voters who invest effort to determine whether a particular claim relevant to their voting choices is correct. If a voter succeeds in determining whether the claim is correct, this information is shared via a social network. I show that increased connectivity makes voters more informed about basic facts, but less informed about complicated issues. At the same time, polarization makes voters less informed overall.</description>

      <title>Misspecified learning and evolutionary stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the indirect evolutionary approach to the selection of (possibly misspecified) models. Agents with different models match in pairs to play a stage game, where models define feasible beliefs about game parameters and about others' strategies. In equilibrium, each agent adopts the feasible belief that best fits their data and plays optimally given their beliefs. We define the stability of the resident model by comparing its equilibrium payoff with that of the entrant model, and provide conditions under which the correctly specified resident model can only be destabilized by misspecified entrant models that contain multiple feasible beliefs (that is, entrant models that permit inference). We also show that entrants may do well in their matches against the residents only when the entrant population is large, due to the endogeneity of misspecified beliefs. Applications include the selection of demand-elasticity misperception in Cournot duopoly and the emergence of analogy-based reasoning in centipede games.</description>

      <title>Who Pays, Who Benefits? Producer-Insurer Games in Life-Saving Medicines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pharmaceutical markets for life-saving therapies combine monopoly power with insurance coverage. We build a tractable sequential game in which a patent-holder chooses the drug price, a profit-maximising insurer sets its premium, and a population of heterogeneous agents decide whether to insure and, conditional on diagnosis, whether to purchase treatment. Two sufficient statistics - subjective illness probability and reservation price - capture heterogeneity and nest risk-aversion and liquidity-constraint motives within a unified framework. We prove existence of subgame-perfect Nash equilibria and show that entry of an insurer strictly raises producer profits but may raise or lower both drug prices and treatment uptake, depending on the joint distribution of the population statistics. Numerical experiments calibrated to flexible parametric families illustrate non-monotone comparative statics and quantify conditions under which insurance reduces access. Our results provide benchmarks for evaluating price negotiations, price caps, and subsidy schemes in high-cost drug markets.</description>

      <title>Regularity properties of distributions of correspondences without countable generation: applications to large games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that each of the regularity properties of regular conditional distributions of correspondences (convexity, closedness, compactness, and preservation of closed graphs) is equivalent to the condition of nowhere equivalence. This result does not require any countable-generation assumptions. As an application, we establish the existence of a pure-strategy equilibrium for large games with general trait spaces. The trait space may be an arbitrary measurable space. As a corollary, we obtain the existence of a pure-strategy equilibrium in semi-anonymous settings in which payoffs depend, in addition to agents' own actions, on the joint distribution over the space of agents and actions.</description>
