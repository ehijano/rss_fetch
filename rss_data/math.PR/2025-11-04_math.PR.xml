      <title>Concentration inequalities for strong laws and laws of the iterated logarithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive concentration inequalities for sums of independent and identically distributed random variables that yield non-asymptotic generalizations of several strong laws of large numbers including some of those due to Kolmogorov [1930], Marcinkiewicz and Zygmund [1937], Chung [1951], Baum and Katz [1965], Ruf, Larsson, Koolen, and Ramdas [2023], and Waudby-Smith, Larsson, and Ramdas [2024]. As applications, we derive non-asymptotic iterated logarithm inequalities in the spirit of Darling and Robbins [1967], as well as pathwise (sometimes described as "game-theoretic") analogues of strong laws and laws of the iterated logarithm.</description>

      <title>Sharp inequalities between Zolotarev and Wasserstein distances in $\mathrm{P}_2(\mathbb{R}^d)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on a new Kantorovich-Rubinstein duality principle for the Hessian that was recently established by the two authors, we extend the Rio inequality to any dimension $d \ge 1$ with an optimal constant. Similarly, we propose an optimal upper bound for the ratio of Zolotarev distance $Z_2(\mu,\nu)$ to Wasserstein distance $W_2(\mu,\nu)$ when $\mu,\nu \in \mathrm{P}_2(\mathbb{R}^d)$ are centred probabilities with prescribed variances.</description>

      <title>Stochastic solutions to abstract telegraph-type equations involving fractional dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates abstract integro-differential hyperbolic equations, focusing on the probabilistic representation of their solutions. Our analysis is based on fractional derivatives and non-local operators, which are powerful tools for modeling the anomalous behavior and non-Markovian dynamics observed in various phenomena.
  We first analyze a time-fractional version of the abstract telegraph equation (involving the Caputo derivative), restricting our analysis to positive self-adjoint operators to leverage spectral theory, which includes key operators in applications, such as the fractional Laplace operator. We derive analytical representations for the solution and provide a stochastic solution to the telegraph-diffusion equation for a specific range of the fractional parameter $\alpha$, thereby generalizing existing results. We discuss particular cases involving the fractional Laplace and Bessel-Riesz operators.
  Furthermore, we consider the abstract Euler-Poisson-Darboux (EPD) equation, characterized by a singular time coefficient. We demonstrate that the stochastic solution to this EPD equation can be represented in terms of the solution of the abstract wave equation. Crucially, we prove that the solution to the EPD equation admits a representation by means of the Erdelyi-Kober fractional integral.
  Finally, this work provides a comprehensive analysis of both time-fractional and singular-coefficient abstract telegraph-type equations, offering new analytical and stochastic representation formulas.</description>

      <title>Further Developments on Stochastic Dominance for Different Classes of Infinite-mean Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, stochastic dominance for independent and identically distributed (iid) infinite-mean random variables has received considerable attention. The literature has identified several classes of distributions of nonnegative random variables that encompass many common heavy-tailed distributions. A key result demonstrates that the weighted sum of iid random variables from these classes is stochastically larger than any individual random variable in the sense of the first-order stochastic dominance. This paper systematically investigates the properties and inclusion relationships among these distribution classes, and extends some existing results to more practical scenarios. Furthermore, we analyze the case where each random variable follows a compound binomial distribution, establishing necessary and sufficient conditions for the preservation of the aforementioned stochastic dominance relation.</description>

      <title>Information-theoretic minimax and submodular optimization algorithms for multivariate Markov chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study an information-theoretic minimax problem for finite multivariate Markov chains on $d$-dimensional product state spaces. Given a family $\mathcal B=\{P_1,\ldots,P_n\}$ of $\pi$-stationary transition matrices and a class $\mathcal F = \mathcal{F}(\mathbf{S})$ of factorizable models induced by a partition $\mathbf S$ of the coordinate set $[d]$, we seek to minimize the worst-case information loss by analyzing $$\min_{Q\in\mathcal F}\max_{P\in\mathcal B} D_{\mathrm{KL}}^{\pi}(P\|Q),$$ where $D_{\mathrm{KL}}^{\pi}(P\|Q)$ is the $\pi$-weighted KL divergence from $Q$ to $P$. We recast the above minimax problem into concave maximization over the $n$-probability-simplex via strong duality and Pythagorean identities that we derive. This leads us to formulate an information-theoretic game and show that a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium always exists; and propose a projected subgradient algorithm to approximately solve the minimax problem with provable guarantee. By transforming the minimax problem into an orthant submodular function in $\mathbf{S}$, this motivates us to consider a max-min-max submodular optimization problem and investigate a two-layer subgradient-greedy procedure to approximately solve this generalization. Numerical experiments for Markov chains on the Curie-Weiss and Bernoulli-Laplace models illustrate the practicality of these proposed algorithms and reveals sparse optimal structures in these examples.</description>

      <title>Admissible Sequences for Talagrand's $\gamma_2$-functional</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Suprema of random processes appear naturally in a plethora of disciplines, and Talagrand's majorizing theorem yields a geometric interpretation for them: for a centered Gaussian random process $(X_t)_{t \in T},$ $\mathbb{E}[\sup_{t \in T}{X_t}]$ is comparable to the $\gamma_2$-functional of $T,$ a quantity that depends solely on the space $(T,d),$ where $d$ denotes the pseudometric $d(u,v)=\sqrt{\mathbb{E}[(X_u-X_v)^2]}.$ Despite the explicit definition of this functional, an infimum over admissible sequences, this tool tends to be used exclusively as a means to bound the expectation of the supremum of a random process by that of another. This work considers the $\gamma_2$-functional as a proxy for the quantity of interest by constructing admissible sequences that are close to being optimal, and aims to provide a promising avenue towards understanding expectations of suprema of Gaussian random processes.</description>

      <title>Limit profiles and cutoff for the Burnside process on Sylow double cosets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article gives sharp estimates for the mixing time of the Burnside process for Sylow $p$-double cosets in the symmetric group $S_n$. This process is a Markov chain on $S_n$ which can be used to uniformly sample Sylow $p$-double cosets. The analysis applies when $n = pk$ with $p$ prime and $k &lt; p$. The main result describes the limit profile of the distance to the stationary distribution as $p$ goes to infinity. From the limit profile, we get the following two corollaries. First, if $k$ remains fixed as $p \to \infty$, then order $p$ steps are necessary and sufficient for mixing and cut-off does not occur. Second, if $k \to \infty$ as $p \to \infty$, then cut-off occurs at $p \log k$ with a window of size $p$. The limit profile is derived from explicit upper and lower bounds on the distance between the Burnside process and its stationary distribution. These non-asymptotic bounds give very accurate approximations even for $p$ as small as 11.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine applications of the theory of operator-valued processes to algebraic methods in probability theory. We show a central limit theorem for general conservation operator processes. Utilizing this, we analyze the asymptotic behavior of processes derived from unitary groups and quantum unitary groups as their ranks tend to infinity, thereby providing applications of asymptotic representation theory.</description>

      <title>A curiously slowly mixing Markov chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a Markov chain with very different mixing rates depending on how mixing is measured. The chain is the "Burnside process on the hypercube $C_2^n$." Started at the all-zeros state, it mixes in a bounded number of steps, no matter how large $n$ is, in $\ell^1$ and in $\ell^2$. And started at general $x$, it mixes in at most $\log n$ steps in $\ell^1$. But, in $\ell^2$, it takes $\frac{n}{\log n}$ steps for most starting $x$. An interesting connection to Schur--Weyl duality between $\mathfrak{sl}_2(\mathbb{C})$ and $S_n$ further allows for analysis of the mixing time from arbitrary starting states.</description>

      <title>Derivative formula for capacities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain a derivative formula for various notions of capacity. Namely we identify the second order term in the asymptotic expansion of the capacity of a union of two sets, as their distance goes to infinity. Our result applies to the usual Newtonian capacity in the setting of random walks on the Euclidean lattice, to the family of Bessel-Riesz capacities, and to the Branching capacity, which has been introduced recently by Zhu [9] in connection with critical Branching random walks. On the other hand, the result remains open for the notion of capacity in the setting of percolation, which is introduced in a companion paper, but serves as a motivation, as it would have some interesting consequences there.</description>

      <title>Elastic Brownian motion with random jumps from the boundary</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study elastic Brownian motion on a \(C^2\) domain. Instead of being killed at the boundary, the process restarts from a random position inside the domain. We characterize this process through its stochastic differential equation (SDE), its generator, and a description of the paths. We also derive the invariant probability measure and the spectral representation. At the end, we focus on the harmonic functions on the upper half-space to study the trace process.</description>

      <title>Zero distribution of multiplicative Hermite and Laguerre polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well-known that, as $n\to\infty$, the zero distribution of the $n$-th Hermite polynomial converges to the semicircular law (the free normal distribution), while the zero distribution of the associated Laguerre polynomials converges to the Marchenko--Pastur law (the free Poisson distribution). In this paper, we establish multiplicative analogues of these results. We define the multiplicative Hermite and Laguerre polynomials by \begin{align*} H_n^*(x;s) &amp;:= e^{-\frac 12 s ((x\partial_x)^2 - n x \partial_x) } (x-1)^n = \sum_{j=0}^n (-1)^{n-j} \binom nj e^{-\frac 12 s (j^2 - nj)} x^j, \\ L_n^*(x; b,c) &amp;:= (x\partial_x + b)^c (x-1)^n = \sum_{j=0}^n (-1)^{n-j} \binom nj (j+b)^c x^j, \end{align*} where $n\in \mathbb N_0$, $\partial_x$ denotes the differentiation operator w.r.t. $x$, and $s\in \mathbb R$, $b\in \mathbb C$, $c\in \mathbb N_0$ are parameters. In the Hermite case, we show that, as $n\to\infty$, the zero distribution of $H_n^*(x;s/n)$ converges weakly to the free multiplicative normal distribution on the positive half-line (when $s&gt;0$) or to the free unitary normal distribution on the unit circle $\{|z| = 1\}$ (when $s&lt;0$). In the Laguerre case, we show that the zero distribution of $L_n^*(x; n\beta, \lfloor n \gamma \rfloor)$ converges to the free multiplicative Poisson distribution on the positive half-line (when $\gamma &gt;0$ and $\beta \in \mathbb R\backslash[0,1]$) or on the unit circle (when $\gamma&gt;0$ and $\beta \in -\frac 12 + \sqrt{-1} \, \mathbb R$). All these results are obtained by essentially the same method, which treats the Hermite/Laguerre cases and the unitary/positive settings in a unified way.</description>

Abstract: In the present paper, we study the $(2,q)$-Ising-Potts model on the Cayley tree. We have derived a recurrence equation that shows the existence of a splitting Gibbs measure for this model. Furthermore, we have proven that for the $(2,q)$-Ising-Potts model on the Cayley tree of order $k\geq2$, there are at least 3 translation-invariant splitting Gibbs measures. We also prove that for the $(2,3)$-Ising-Potts model on the Cayley tree, specifically the binary tree, under certain conditions, there are at least 8 translation-invariant splitting Gibbs measures.</description>

      <title>Distributionally robust expected shortfall for convex risks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study distributionally robust expected values under optimal transport distance with a quadratic cost function. In general the duality method, for this computation for the payoff function $f$, requires the computation of the $\lambda c-$transform $f^{\lambda c}$. We show that under the quadratic cost function there exists an intuitive and easily implementable representation of $f^{\lambda c}$, if $f$ is convex and piecewise linear. We apply this to the robust expected shortfall under the risk-neutral measure of an unhedged call option, from the point of view of the writer, as well as that of a portfolio mixing underlying shares with a call and a put option.</description>

In this paper, we propose a general partial Cram\'{e}r's condition (GPCC) and apply it to establish the validity of the Edgeworth expansion for the distribution function of these functions of sample means. Additionally, we apply the proposed theorems to several specific statistics. In particular, by verifying the GPCC, we demonstrate for the first time the validity of the formal Edgeworth expansion of Pearson's correlation coefficient between random variables with absolutely continuous and discrete components. Furthermore, we conduct a series of simulation studies that show the Edgeworth expansion has higher accuracy.</description>

      <title>Circular law for non-Hermitian block band matrices with slowly growing bandwidth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the empirical eigenvalue distribution for a class of non-Hermitian random block tridiagonal matrices $T$ with independent entries. The matrix has $n$ blocks on the diagonal and each block has size $\ell_n$, so the whole matrix has size $n\ell_n$. We assume that the nonzero entries are i.i.d. with mean 0, variance 1 and having sufficiently high moments. We prove that when the entries have a bounded density, then whenever $\lim_{n\to\infty}\ell_n=\infty$ and $\ell_n=O(\operatorname{Poly}(n))$, the normalized empirical spectral distribution of $T$ converges almost surely to the circular law. The growing bandwidth condition $\lim _{n\to\infty}\ell_n=\infty$ is the optimal condition of circular law with small bandwidth. This confirms the folklore conjecture that the circular law holds whenever the bandwidth increases with the dimension, while all existing results for the circular law are only proven in the delocalized regime $\ell_n\gg n$.</description>

      <title>Bernstein Fractional Derivatives: Censoring and Stochastic Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define censored fractional Bernstein derivatives on the positive half-line based on the Bernstein--Riemann--Liouville fractional derivative. The censored fractional derivative turns out to be the generator of the censored decreasing subordinator $S^c = (S_t^c)_{t\geq 0}$, which is obtained either via a pathwise construction by removing those jumps from the decreasing subordinator $(x-S_t)_{t\geq 0}$, $x&gt;0$, that drive the path into negative territory, or via the Hille--Yosida theorem. Then we show that the censored decreasing subordinator has only finite life-time, and we identify various probability distributions related to $S^c$.</description>

      <title>Percolation on graphs of polynomial growth is local: analyticity, supercritical sharpness, isoperimetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate locality of the supercritical regime for Bernoulli percolation on transitive graphs with polynomial growth, by which we mean the following. Take a transitive graph of polynomial growth $\mathscr{G}$ satisfying $p_c(\mathscr{G})&lt;1$ and take $p&gt;p_c(\mathscr{G})$. Let $\mathscr{H}$ be another such graph and assume that $\mathscr{G}$ and $\mathscr{H}$ have the same ball of radius $r$ for $r$ large. We prove that various quantities regarding percolation of parameter close to $p$ on $\mathscr{H}$ can be well understood from $(\mathscr{G},p)$ alone.
  This includes uniform versions of supercritical sharpness as well as the Kesten-Zhang bound on the probability of observing a large finite cluster: the constants involved can be chosen to depend only on $(\mathscr{G},p)$. We also prove that $\theta_\mathscr{H}$ is an analytic function of $p$ in the whole supercritical regime and that, for a suitable $\varepsilon=\varepsilon(\mathscr{G},p)&gt;0$, the analytic extension of $\theta_\mathscr{H}$ to the $\varepsilon$-neighbourhood of $p$ in $\mathbb C$ is, uniformly, well approximated by the analytic extension of $\theta_\mathscr{G}$. The proof relies on new results on the connectivity of minimal cutsets; in particular, we answer a question asked by Babson and Benjamini in 1999. We further discuss connections with the conjecture of non-percolation at criticality.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Derivative Estimation for Discontinuous Sample Performances: A Leibniz Integration Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a novel stochastic derivative estimation framework for sample performance functions that are discontinuous in the parameter of interest, based on the multidimensional Leibniz integral rule. When discontinuities arise from indicator functions, we embed the indicator functions into the sample space, yielding a continuous performance function over a parameter-dependent domain. Applying the Leibniz integral rule in this case produces a single-run, unbiased derivative estimator. For general discontinuous functions, we apply a change of variables to shift parameter dependence into the sample space and the underlying probability measure. Applying the Leibniz integral rule leads to two terms: a standard likelihood ratio (LR) term from differentiating the underlying probability measure and a surface integral from differentiating the boundary of the domain. Evaluating the surface integral may require simulating multiple sample paths. Our proposed Leibniz integration framework generalizes the generalized LR (GLR) method and provides intuition as to when the surface integral vanishes, thereby enabling single-run, easily implementable estimators. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our methods.</description>

      <title>Branched Signature Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.00018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the branched signature model, motivated by the branched rough path framework of [Gubinelli, Journal of Differential Equations, 248(4), 2010], which generalizes the classical geometric rough path. We establish a universal approximation theorem for the branched signature model and demonstrate that iterative compositions of lower-level signature maps can approximate higher-level signatures. Furthermore, building on the existence of the extension map proposed in [Hairer-Kelly. Annales de l'Institue Henri Poincar\'e, Probabilit\'es et Statistiques 51, no. 1 (2015)], we show how to explicitly construct the extension of the original paths into higher-dimensional spaces via a map $\Psi$, so that the branched signature can be realized as the classical geometric signature of the extended path. This framework not only provides an efficient computational scheme for branched signatures but also opens new avenues for data-driven modeling and applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.00142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by practical applications, I present a novel and comprehensive framework for operator-valued positive definite kernels. This framework is applied to both operator theory and stochastic processes. The first application focuses on various dilation constructions within operator theory, while the second pertains to broad classes of stochastic processes. In this context, the authors utilize the results derived from operator-valued kernels to develop new Hilbert space-valued Gaussian processes and to investigate the structures of their covariance configurations.</description>

      <title>The hybrid exact scheme for the simulation of first-passage times of jump-diffusions with time-dependent thresholds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The first-passage time is a key concept in stochastic modeling, representing the time at which a process first reaches a specified threshold. In this work, we consider a jump-diffusion (JD) model with a time-dependent threshold, providing a more flexible framework for describing stochastic dynamics. We are interested in the Exact simulation method developed for JD processes with constant thresholds, where the Exact method for pure diffusion is applied between jump intervals. An adaptation of this method to time-dependent thresholds has recently been proposed for a more general stochastic setting. We show that this adaptation can be applied to JD models by establishing a formal correspondence between the two frameworks. A comparative analysis is then performed between the proposed approach and the constant-threshold version in terms of algorithmic structure and computational efficiency. Finally, we show the applicability of the method by predicting neuronal spike times in a JD model driven by two independent Poisson jump mechanisms.</description>

      <title>A non-exchangeable mean field control problem with controlled interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces and analyzes a new class of mean-field control (\textsc{MFC}) problems in which agents interact through a \emph{fixed but controllable} network structure. In contrast with the classical \textsc{MFC} framework -- where agents are exchangeable and interact only through symmetric empirical distributions -- we consider systems with heterogeneous and possibly asymmetric interaction patterns encoded by a structural kernel, typically of graphon type. A key novelty of our approach is that this interaction structure is no longer static: it becomes a genuine \emph{control variable}. The planner therefore optimizes simultaneously two distinct components: a \emph{regular control}, which governs the local dynamics of individual agents, and an \emph{interaction control}, which shapes the way agents connect and influence each other through the fixed structural kernel.
  \medskip We develop a generalized notion of relaxed (randomized) control adapted to this setting, prove its equivalence with the strong formulation, and establish existence, compactness, and continuity results for the associated value function under minimal regularity assumptions. Moreover, we show that the finite $n$-agent control problems with general (possibly asymmetric) interaction matrices converge to the mean-field limit when the corresponding fixed step-kernels converge in cut-norm, with asymptotic consistency of the optimal values and control strategies. Our results provide a rigorous framework in which the \emph{interaction structure itself is viewed and optimized as a control object}, thereby extending mean-field control theory to non-exchangeable populations and controlled network interactions.</description>

      <title>Robustness for expander graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.00404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study robust versions of properties of $(n,d,\lambda)$-graphs, namely, the property of a random sparsification of an $(n,d,\lambda)$-graph, where each edge is retained with probability $p$ independently. We prove such results for the containment problem of perfect matchings, Hamiltonian cycles, and triangle factors. These results address a series of problems posed by Frieze and Krivelevich.
  First we prove that given $\gamma&gt;0$, for sufficient large $n$, any $(n,d,\lambda)$-graph $G$ with $\lambda=o(d)$, $d=\Omega(\log n)$ and $p\ge\frac{(1+\gamma)\log n}{d}$, $G\cap G(n,p)$ contains a Hamiltonian cycle (and thus a perfect matching if $n$ is even) with high probability. This result is asymptotically optimal.
  Moreover, we show that for sufficient large $n$, any $(n,d,\lambda)$-graph $G$ with $\lambda=o(\frac{d^2}{n})$, $d=\Omega(n^{\frac{5}{6}}\log^{\frac{1}{2}}n)$ and $p\gg d^{-1}n^{\frac{1}{3}}\log^{\frac{1}{3}} n$, $G\cap G(n,p)$ contains a triangle factor with high probability. Here, the restrictions on $p$ and $\lambda$ are asymptotically optimal.
  Our proof for the triangle factor problem uses the iterative absorption approach to build a spread measure on the triangle factors, and we also prove and use a coupling result for triangles in the random subgraph of an expander $G$ and the hyperedges in the random subgraph of the triangle-hypergraph of $G$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.00490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural networks are able to approximate any continuous function on a compact set. However, it is not obvious how to quantify the error of the neural network, i.e., the remaining bias between the function and the neural network. Here, we propose the application of extreme value theory to quantify large values of the error, which are typically relevant in applications. The distribution of the error beyond some threshold is approximately generalized Pareto distributed. We provide a new estimator of the shape parameter of the Pareto distribution suitable to describe the error of neural networks. Numerical experiments are provided.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.00708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the theoretical complexity of simulated tempering for sampling from mixtures of log-concave components differing only by location shifts. The main result establishes the first polynomial-time guarantee for simulated tempering combined with the Metropolis-adjusted Langevin algorithm (MALA) with respect to the problem dimension $d$, maximum mode displacement $D$, and logarithmic accuracy $\log \epsilon^{-1}$. The proof builds on a general state decomposition theorem for $s$-conductance, applied to an auxiliary Markov chain constructed on an augmented space. We also obtain an improved complexity estimate for simulated tempering combined with random-walk Metropolis. Our bounds assume an inverse-temperature ladder with smallest value $\beta_1 = O(D^{-2})$ and spacing $\beta_{i+1}/\beta_i = 1 + O( d^{-1/2} )$, both of which are shown to be asymptotically optimal up to logarithmic factors.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we prove existence and uniqueness of a bounded viscosity solution for the Cauchy problem of degenerate parabolic equations with variable exponents coefficients. We construct the solution directly using the stochastic representation, then verify it satisfies the Cauchy problem. The corresponding SDE, on the other hand, allows the drift and diffusion coefficients to respond nonlinearly to the current state through the state-dependent variable exponents, and thus, extends the expressive power of classical SDEs to better capture complex dynamics. To validate our theoretical framework, we conduct comprehensive numerical experiments comparing finite difference solutions (Crank-Nicolson on logarithmic grids) with Monte Carlo simulations of the SDE.</description>

      <title>Robust Hedging of path-dependent options using a min-max algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider an investor who wants to hedge a path-dependent option with maturity $T$ using a static hedging portfolio using cash, the underlying, and vanilla put/call options on the same underlying with maturity $ t_1$, where $0 &lt; t_1 &lt; T$. We propose a model-free approach to construct such a portfolio. The framework is inspired by the \textit{primal-dual} Martingale Optimal Transport (MOT) problem, which was pioneered by \cite{beiglbock2013model}. The optimization problem is to determine the portfolio composition that minimizes the expected worst-case hedging error at $t_1$ (that coincides with the maturity of the options that are used in the hedging portfolio). The worst-case scenario corresponds to the distribution that yields the worst possible hedging performance. This formulation leads to a \textit{min-max} problem. We provide a numerical scheme for solving this problem when a finite number of vanilla option prices are available. Numerical results on the hedging performance of this model-free approach when the option prices are generated using a \textit{Black-Scholes} and a \textit{Merton Jump diffusion} model are presented. We also provide theoretical bounds on the hedging error at $T$, the maturity of the target option.</description>

Abstract: We study the probabilistic behavior of persistence statistics under distributional variability and propose a novel nonparametric framework for detecting structural changes in high-dimensional random point clouds. We first establish moment bounds and tightness results for classical persistence statistics - total and maximum persistence - under general distributions, with explicit scaling behavior derived for Gaussian mixture models. Building on these theoretical foundations, we introduce a normalized statistic based on persistence landscapes combined with the Jensen-Shannon divergence, and we prove its Holder continuity with respect to perturbations of input point clouds. The resulting measure is stable, scale- and shift-invariant, and suitable for nonparametric inference via permutation testing. A numerical illustration using dynamic attribute vectors from decentralized governance data demonstrates how the proposed method can capture regime shifts and evolving geometric complexity. Our results contribute to the theoretical understanding of random persistence and provide a rigorous statistical foundation for topological change-point detection in complex, high-dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>Large deviations of spectral determinants of matrix-valued random Schr\"odinger operators and Dyson Brownian motion in cubic potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the moments of $\overline{|\det(H-E)|^q}$ and the associated large deviations of $\log |\det(H-E)|$ where $H$ are random matrix operators involving Laplace operators and random potentials. This includes as a special case Hessians of random elastic manifolds at a generic energy configuration. In one dimension $d=1$ these are $N \times N$ matrix valued random Schr\"odinger operators and $\log | \det(H-E) | $ is the sum of the $N$ associated Lyapunov exponents. Using a mapping to a stochastic matrix Ricatti equation we make a connection between the spectral properties of these operators and the total $N$ particle current of a Dyson Brownian motion (DBM) in a cubic potential. The latter model was studied by Allez and Dumaz [1] who showed that for $N=+\infty$ it exhibits a sharp transition between a phase with non-zero current and a confined (zero current) phase. We compute the barrier-crossing probability of the DBM at large but finite $N$, which gives an estimate of the exponential tail of the average density of states of a matrix Schrodinger operator below the edge of its spectrum. The barrier behaves as $\sim N (-E)^{3/2}$ at large negative energy and vanishes as $\sim N(E^*-E)^{5/4}$ near the edge. For $q=1$ the present work provides an independent derivation of the total complexity of stationary points for an elastic string embedded in $N$ dimension in presence of disorder.</description>

      <title>Large torus limit of global dynamics of the two-dimensional dispersive Anderson model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We continue the study of the two-dimensional dispersive Anderson model (DAM), i.e. the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with multiplicative spatial white noise. For this model, global well-posedness on the periodic domain was established by Visciglia and the second author (2023), and global well-posedness on the full space was established by Debussche, Visciglia, and the authors (2024). We show that, under suitable initial conditions and suitable periodization procedure of the noise, the periodic global dynamics of the DAM converges in spaces of local domains to that of the DAM on the full space as the period goes to infinity. In Appendix, we also discuss the same problem for the parabolic Anderson model.</description>

      <title>Binary perceptron computational gap -- a parametric fl RDT view</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies suggest that asymmetric binary perceptron (ABP) likely exhibits the so-called statistical-computational gap characterized with the appearance of two phase transitioning constraint density thresholds: \textbf{\emph{(i)}} the \emph{satisfiability threshold} $\alpha_c$, below/above which ABP succeeds/fails to operate as a storage memory; and \textbf{\emph{(ii)}} \emph{algorithmic threshold} $\alpha_a$, below/above which one can/cannot efficiently determine ABP's weight so that it operates as a storage memory.
  We consider a particular parametric utilization of \emph{fully lifted random duality theory} (fl RDT) [85] and study its potential ABP's algorithmic implications. A remarkable structural parametric change is uncovered as one progresses through fl RDT lifting levels. On the first two levels, the so-called $\c$ sequence -- a key parametric fl RDT component -- is of the (natural) decreasing type. A change of such phenomenology on higher levels is then connected to the $\alpha_c$ -- $\alpha_a$ threshold change. Namely, on the second level concrete numerical values give for the critical constraint density $\alpha=\alpha_c\approx 0.8331$. While progressing through higher levels decreases this estimate, already on the fifth level we observe a satisfactory level of convergence and obtain $\alpha\approx 0.7764$. This allows to draw two striking parallels: \textbf{\emph{(i)}} the obtained constraint density estimate is in a remarkable agrement with range $\alpha\in (0.77,0.78)$ of clustering defragmentation (believed to be responsible for failure of locally improving algorithms) [17,88]; and \textbf{\emph{(ii)}} the observed change of $\c$ sequence phenomenology closely matches the one of the negative Hopfield model for which the existence of efficient algorithms that closely approach similar type of threshold has been demonstrated recently [87].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a mild generative variant of the classical neural operator model, which leverages Kolmogorov--Arnold networks to solve infinite families of second-order backward stochastic differential equations ($2$BSDEs) on regular bounded Euclidean domains with random terminal time. Our first main result shows that the solution operator associated with a broad range of $2$BSDE families is approximable by appropriate neural operator models. We then identify a structured subclass of (infinite) families of $2$BSDEs whose neural operator approximation requires only a polynomial number of parameters in the reciprocal approximation rate, as opposed to the exponential requirement in general worst-case neural operator guarantees.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate parameter estimation in subcritical continuous-time birth-and-death processes with multiple births. We show that the classical maximum likelihood estimators for the model parameters, based on the continuous observation of a single non-extinct trajectory, are not consistent in the usual sense: conditional on survival up to time $t$, they converge as $t \to \infty$ to the corresponding quantities in the associated $Q$-process, namely the process conditioned to survive in the distant future. We develop the first $C$-consistent estimators in this setting, which converge to the true parameter values when conditioning on survival up to time $t$, and establish their asymptotic normality. The analysis relies on spine decompositions and coupling techniques.</description>

      <title>Explosive connectivity and mechanical rigidity in cubic lattice structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study explosive connectivity and mechanical rigidity in three-dimensional cubic lattice structures under Achlioptas-type product-rule dynamics. Our work combines extensive numerical simulation with the development of a new theoretical framework. For connectivity, we rigorously establish the presence of sublinear-width merger-cascade windows for $k\ge 2$, which drive macroscopic jumps in the order parameter and imply a first-order transition. For rigidity, we discover numerically that for richly-connected hosts, increasing the number of choices $k$ monotonically enhances the efficiency of rigidification. To explain this phenomenon, we propose a theoretical model centered on a conditional progress function that links an edge's local product-rule score to its global mechanical utility. We show that this function becomes non-increasing, thus explaining the observed monotonic efficiency, under two physically-motivated assumptions. Altogether, our work provides new insights into the relationship between local dynamics and global connectivity and rigidity in cubic lattice structures via both theory and computation.</description>

      <title>Chemotaxis guidance of random walkers modeling self-wiring of neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A stochastic walker model is proposed to describe the chemotactic guidance of growth cones, i.e. the tips of developing neurites. The model accounts for the influence of both attractive and repulsive chemical cues, which are emitted by the growth cones and the somas. The system couples stochastic differential equations governing the motion of the growth cones with reaction-diffusion equations that describe the dynamics of the chemical concentrations. The existence of a unique solution to this coupled system is proved. Numerical experiments are performed to investigate the sensitivity of the model to key biological parameters. The impact of the nonlocal regularization of point sources in the reaction-diffusion equations is analyzed in a simplified deterministic setting.</description>

Abstract: We examine the sensitivity properties of backward stochastic differential equations and reflected backward stochastic differential equations, which naturally arise in the context of optimal control and optimal stopping problems. Motivated by issues of sensitivity analysis in distributionally robust optimization (DRO) control and optimal stopping problems, we establish explicit formulas for the corresponding sensitivities under drift reference measure uncertainty. Our work is closely related to \citeauthor{bartl2023sensitivity} \cite{bartl2023sensitivity}. In contrast to the existing literature, our analysis is carried out within a general non-Markovian framework.</description>

      <title>Arithmetic Properties of Several Generalized-Constant Sequences, with Implications for ${\Gamma^{\left(n\right)}\left(1\right)}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neither the Euler-Mascheroni constant, $\gamma = 0.577215...$, nor the Euler-Gompertz constant, $\delta = 0.596347...$, is currently known to be irrational. However, it has been proved that at least one of them is transcendental. The two constants are related by a well-known equation of Hardy, equivalent to $\gamma + \delta/e = \mathrm{Ein}(1)$, which recently has been generalized to $\gamma^{(n)} + \delta^{(n)}/e = \eta^{(n)}$; $n \ge 0$ for sequences of constants $\gamma^{(n)}$, $\delta^{(n)}$, and $\eta^{(n)}$ (given respectively by full, conditional, and partial moments of the Gumbel(0,1) probability distribution). We first investigate the $\gamma^{(n)}$ through recurrence relations, revealing that at least one of the pair {$\gamma,\gamma^{(2)}$} and at least two of the set {$\gamma,\gamma^{(n)},\gamma^{(n+1)},\ldots,\gamma^{(2n)}$} (for all $n \ge 2$) are transcendental. This result implies $\Gamma^{(n)}(1)$ is transcendental infinitely often for $n \ge 1$. We then show, via a theorem of Shidlovskii, that the $\eta^{(n)}$ are algebraically independent (and therefore transcendental) for all $n \ge 0$, implying further that at least one of each pair, {$\gamma^{(n)},\delta^{(n)}/e$} and {$\gamma^{(n)},\delta^{(n)}$}, and at least two of the triple {$\gamma^{(n)},\delta^{(n)}/e,\delta^{(n)}$}, are transcendental for all $n \ge 1$. Finally, we provide parallel results for the sequences $\tilde{\delta}^{(n)}$ and $\tilde{\eta}^{(n)}$ satisfying the "non-alternating analogue" equation $\gamma^{(n)} + \tilde{\delta}^{(n)}/e = \tilde{\eta}^{(n)}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2202.10258v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a Feller diffusion (Zs, s $\ge$ 0) (with diffusion coefficient $\sqrt$ 2$\beta$ and drift $\theta$ $\in$ R) that we condition on {Zt = at}, where at is a deterministic function, and we study the limit in distribution of the conditioned process and of its genealogical tree as t $\rightarrow$ +$\infty$. When at does not increase too rapidly, we recover the standard size-biased process (and the associated genealogical tree given by the Kesten's tree). When at behaves as $\alpha$$\beta$ 2 t 2 when $\theta$ = 0 or as $\alpha$ e 2$\beta$|$\theta$|t when $\theta$ = 0, we obtain a new process whose distribution is described by a Girsanov transformation and equivalently by a SDE with a Poissonian immigration. Its associated genealogical tree is described by an infinite discrete skeleton (which does not satisfy the branching property) decorated with Brownian continuum random trees given by a Poisson point measure. As a by-product of this study, we introduce several sets of trees endowed with a Gromovtype distance which are of independent interest and which allow here to define in a formal and measurable way the decoration of a backbone with a family of continuum random trees.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.02537v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms based on numerical approximations of piecewise-deterministic Markov processes obtained with the framework of splitting schemes. We present unadjusted as well as adjusted algorithms, for which the asymptotic bias due to the discretisation error is removed applying a non-reversible Metropolis-Hastings filter. In a general framework we demonstrate that the unadjusted schemes have weak error of second order in the step size, while typically maintaining a computational cost of only one gradient evaluation of the negative log-target function per iteration. Focusing then on unadjusted schemes based on the Bouncy Particle and Zig-Zag samplers, we provide conditions ensuring geometric ergodicity and consider the expansion of the invariant measure in terms of the step size. We analyse the dependence of the leading term in this expansion on the refreshment rate and on the structure of the splitting scheme, giving a guideline on which structure is best. Finally, we illustrate promising results for our samplers with numerical experiments on a Bayesian imaging inverse problem and a system of interacting particles.</description>

      <title>Convergence of the pruning processes of stable Galton-Watson trees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.10489v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since the work of Aldous and Pitman (1998), several authors have studied the pruning processes of Galton-Watson trees and their continuous analogue L\'evy trees. L\"ohr, Voisin and Winter (2015) introduced the space of bi-measure $\mathbb{R}$-trees equipped with the so-called leaf sampling weak vague topology which allows them to unify the discrete and the continuous picture by considering them as instances of the same Feller-continuous Markov process with different initial conditions. Moreover, the authors show that these so-called pruning processes converge in the Skorokhod space of c\`adl\`ag paths with values in the space of bi-measure $\mathbb{R}$-trees, whenever the initial bi-measure $\mathbb{R}$-trees converge.
  In this paper we provide an application to the above principle by verifying that a sequence of suitably rescaled critical conditioned Galton-Watson trees whose offspring distributions lie in the domain of attraction of a stable law of index $\alpha \in (1,2]$ converge to the $\alpha$-stable L\'evy-tree in the leaf-sampling weak vague topology.</description>

Abstract: The main objective of this paper is to develop extreme value theory for $\vartheta$-expansions. We establish the limit distribution of the maximum value in a $\vartheta$-continued fraction mixing stationary stochastic process, along with some related results. These findings are analogous to the theorems of J. Galambos and W. Philipp for regular continued fractions. Additionally, we emphasize that a Borel-Bernstein type theorem plays a crucial role.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.17497v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a continuous time Mutually Catalytic Branching model on the $\mathbb{Z}^{d}$. The model describes the behavior of two different populations of particles, performing random walk on the lattice in the presence of branching, that is, each particle dies at a certain rate and is replaced by a random number of offspring. The branching rate of a particle in one population is proportional to the number of particles of another population at the same site. We study the long time behavior for this model, in particular, coexistence and non-coexistence of two populations in the long run. Finally, we construct a sequence of renormalized processes and use duality techniques to investigate its limiting behavior.</description>

      <title>Mermin-Wagner theorem for dimers, monomer double-dimers, and spatial random permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16911v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a generalisation of the double-dimer model that encompasses several models of interest, including the monomer double-dimer model, spatial random permutations, the dimer model, and the spin $O(N)$ model, and which is also related to the loop $O(N)$ model. We show that on two-dimensional-like graphs (such as slabs), both the correlation function and the probability that a loop visits two vertices decay to zero as the distance between the vertices diverges. Our approach is based on the introduction of a new complex spin representation for all models in this class, together with a new proof of the Mermin-Wagner theorem that does not require positivity of the Gibbs measure. Even for the well-studied dimer and double-dimer models our results are new: since they do not rely on exact solvability or Kasteleyn's theorem, they apply beyond the planar-graph setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02244v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a simpler proof of the existence of equilibria for a class of mean field games with common noise, where players interact through the conditional law given the current value of the common noise rather than its entire path. By extending a compactness criterion for Malliavin-differentiable random variables to processes, we establish existence of strong equilibria, where the conditional law and optimal control are adapted to the common noise filtration and defined on the original probability space. Notably, our approach only requires measurability of the drift and cost functionals with respect to the state variable.</description>

Abstract: We provide explicit series expansions to certain stochastic path-dependent integral equations in terms of the path signature of the time augmented driving Brownian motion. Our framework encompasses a large class of stochastic linear Volterra and delay equations and in particular the fractional Brownian motion with a Hurst index $H \in (0, 1)$. Our expressions allow to disentangle an infinite dimensional Markovian structure and open the door to straightforward and simple approximation schemes, that we illustrate numerically.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04579v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce two families of random tridiagonal block matrices for which the joint eigenvalue distributions can be computed explicitly. These distributions are novel within random matrix theory, and exhibit interactions among eigenvalue coordinates beyond the typical mean-field log-gas type. Leveraging the matrix models, we go on to describe the point process limits at the edges of the spectrum in two ways: through certain random differential operators, and also in terms of coupled systems of diffusions. Along the way we establish several algebraic identities involving sums of Vandermonde determinant products.</description>

      <title>Support of the Brown measure of a family of free multiplicative Brownian motions with non-negative initial condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19682v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a family $b_{s,\tau}$ of free multiplicative Brownian motions labeled by a real variance parameter $s$ and a complex covariance parameter $\tau$. We then consider the element $xb_{s,\tau}$, where $x$ is non-negative and freely independent of $b_{s,\tau}$. Our goal is to identify the support of the Brown measure of $xb_{s,\tau}$.
  In the case $\tau =s$, we identify a region $\Sigma_s$ such that the Brown measure is vanishing outside of $\overline{\Sigma}_s$ except possibly at the origin. For general values of $\tau$, we construct a map $f_{s-\tau}$ and define $D_{s,\tau}$ as the complement of $f_{s-\tau}(\overline{\Sigma}_s^c)$. Then the Brown measure is zero outside $D_{s,\tau}$ except possibly at the origin.
  The proof of these results is based on a two-stage PDE analysis, using one PDE (following the work of Driver, Hall, and Kemp) for the case $\tau=s$ and a different PDE (following the work of Hall and Ho) to deform the $\tau=s$ case to general values of $\tau$.</description>

Abstract: This paper establishes a CLT for linear statistics of the form $\langle \mathbf{q},\boldsymbol{\sigma} \rangle$ with quantitative Berry-Esseen bounds, where $\boldsymbol{\sigma}$ is an observation from an exponential family with a quadratic form as its sufficient statistic, in the \enquote{high-temperature} regime. We apply our general result to random field Ising models with both discrete and continuous spins. To demonstrate the generality of our techniques, we apply our results to derive both quenched and annealed CLTs in various examples, which include Ising models on some graph ensembles of common interest (Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi, regular, dense bipartite), and the Hopfield spin glass model. Our proofs rely on a combination of Stein's method of exchangeable pairs and Chevet type concentration inequalities.</description>

      <title>Strong convergence and Mittag-Leffler stability of stochastic theta method for time-changed stochastic differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21653v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose the first $\alpha$-parameterized framework for solving time-changed stochastic differential equations (TCSDEs), explicitly linking convergence rates to the driving parameter of the underlying stochastic processes. Theoretically, we derive exact moment estimates and exponential moment estimates of inverse $\alpha$-stable subordinator $E$ using Mittag-Leffler functions. The stochastic theta (ST) method is investigated for a class of SDEs driven by a time-changed Brownian motion, whose coefficients are time-space-dependent and satisfy the local Lipschitz condition. We prove that the convergence order dynamically responds to the stability index $\alpha$ of stable subordinator $D$, filling a gap in traditional methods that treat these factors independently. We also introduce the notion of Mittag-Leffler stability for TCSDEs, and investigate the criterion of Mittag-Leffler stability for both the exact and numerical solutions. Finally, some numerical simulations are presented to illustrate the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Balinski-Young Theorem: Structure and Probability of Quota Violations in Divisor Methods for Three States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09100v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The apportionment problem asks how to assign representation to states based on their populations. That is, given census data and a fixed number of seats, how many seats should each state be assigned? Various algorithms exist to solve the apportionment problem, but by the Balinski-Young Theorem, every such algorithm will be flawed in some way. This paper focuses on divisor methods of apportionment, where the possible flaws are known as quota violations. This paper presents a detailed analysis of quota violations that can arise under divisor methods for three states. The study focuses on quota violations in Adams's, Jefferson's, Dean's, and the Huntington-Hill methods when allocating $M$ seats. Theoretical results are proved about the behavior of these methods, particularly focusing on the types of quota violations that may occur, their frequency, and their structure. The paper then introduces tests to detect quota violations, which are then employed to construct a probability function which calculates the likelihood of such violations occurring given an initial three state population vector whose components follow varying distributions.</description>

      <title>Coagulation-Fragmentation Duality of Infinitely Exchangeable Partitions from Coupled Mixed Poisson Species Sampling Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18668v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We generalize the celebrated coagulation-fragmentation duality of Jim Pitman (1999), originally established for the PD$(\alpha,\theta)$ laws of Pitman and Marc Yor (1997), resolving a problem open for over two decades. Our framework extends the duality to processes driven by arbitrary non-negative Levy subordinators and, for the first time, to multi-group settings with coupled dynamics. The solution is a novel four-component system we build in this work from the Poisson Hierarchical Indian Buffet Process (PHIBP) , a framework developed for modeling complex microbiome species sampling (\href{arXiv:2502.01919})(2025), which circumvents the intractable analysis on traditional partition spaces. Crucially, the architecture of this construction allows for its natural embedding within Bertoin's (2006) continuous-time fragmentation framework, thereby resolving a foundational impasse he highlighted [2006, Ch. 4 p. 213]: where time-reversal fails, we introduce simultaneous structural duality, where fragmentation and coalescence evolve in physical time while maintaining a pointwise dual relationship via coupled subordinators. This provides a new generative modeling framework, enabling continuous-time representations of coupled genealogical and mutational dynamics--opening new modeling avenues for complex ancestral processes such as recombination graphs. The other important aspect of its architecture is an exact compound Poisson representation, providing the first tractable path to explicit joint EPPF laws for a new class of coupled processes, including structured $\Lambda$-coalescents and $\Lambda$-Fleming-Viot processes, allowing for exact sampling, a key feature of the underlying PHIBP framework first demonstrated in that work.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19414v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the Radon-Nikodym derivative of the law of the spatial increments (with endpoints away from the origin) of inhomogeneous Brownian last passage percolation (LPP) with non-decreasing initial data against the Wiener measure $\mu$ on compacts is in $L^{\infty-}(\mu)$; and for any fixed $p&gt;1$, the $L^p$ norm is at most of the order $O_p(\mathrm{e}^{d_pm^2\log m})$ for some $p$-dependent constant $d_p&gt;0$.
  Furthermore, when the initial data is homogeneous, we establish optimal growth on $L^p$ norms ($\asymp O(\exp(dm^2))$) of the Radon-Nikodym derivative of the Brownian LPP (i.e. top line of an $m$-level Dyson Brownian motion) away from the origin, as the number of curves $m$ tends to infinity, for all $p&gt;1$ sufficiently large.
  As an application of our framework, we show that the Radon-Nikodym derivative of certain toy models for the KPZ fixed point lies in $L^{\infty-}(\mu)$, inspired by its variational characterisation in terms of the directed landscape.</description>

      <title>New representations of the Hu-Meyer formulas and series expansion of iterated Stratonovich stochastic integrals with respect to components of a multidimensional Wiener process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06981v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The article is devoted to the systematic derivation of new representations of the Hu-Meyer formulas. The formula expressing a multiple Wiener stochastic integral through the sum of multiple Stratonovich stochastic integrals and the formula expressing a multiple Stratonovich stochastic integral through the sum of multiple Wiener stochastic integrals are derived for the case of a multidimensional Wiener process. At that several different definitions of the multiple Stratonovich stochastic integral and several variants of sufficient conditions for the validity of the Hu-Meyer formulas are used. In particular, the proof method proposed by the author in 2006 is applied to obtain Hu-Meyers formulas based on generalized multiple Fourier series for the case of a multidimensional Wiener process. Of great importance for the numerical solution of Ito stochastic differential equations is the verification of sufficient conditions for the applicability of the Hu-Meyer formula (based on generalized multiple Fourier series) for the case of iterated Stratonovich stochastic integrals with respect to components of a multidimensional Wiener process. In the author's previous works, the indicated conditions were verified for iterated Stratonovich stochastic integrals of multiplicities 1 to 6 (the case of an arbitrary basis in the Hilbert space) and for iterated Stratonovich stochastic integrals of multiplicities 7 and 8 (the case of two special bases in Hilbert space (the trigonometric Fourier basis and the basis of Legendre polynomials)). Therefore, the results of the article will be usefull for constructing high-order strong numerical methods for non-commutative systems of Ito stochastic differential equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19211v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a probabilistic framework to approximate Nash equilibria in symmetric $N$-player games in the large population regime, via the analysis of associated mean field games (MFGs). The approximation is achieved through the analysis of a McKean-Vlasov type Langevin dynamics and their associated particle systems, with convergence to the MFG solution established in the limit of vanishing temperature parameter. Relying on displacement monotonicity or Lasry-Lions monotonicity of the cost function, we prove contractility of the McKean-Vlasov process and uniform-in-time propagation of chaos for the particle system. Our results contribute to the general theory of interacting diffusions by showing that monotonicity can ensure convergence without requiring small interaction assumptions or functional inequalities.</description>

      <title>A Free Probabilistic Framework for Denoising Diffusion Models: Entropy, Transport, and Reverse Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22778v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper develops a rigorous probabilistic framework that extends denoising diffusion models to the setting of noncommutative random variables. Building on Voiculescu's theory of free entropy and free Fisher information, we formulate diffusion and reverse processes governed by operator-valued stochastic dynamics whose spectral measures evolve by additive convolution. Using tools from free stochastic analysis -- including a Malliavin calculus and a Clark--Ocone representation -- we derive the reverse-time stochastic differential equation driven by the conjugate variable, the analogue of the classical score function. The resulting dynamics admit a gradient-flow structure in the noncommutative Wasserstein space, establishing an information-geometric link between entropy production, transport, and deconvolution. We further construct a variational scheme analogous to the Jordan--Kinderlehrer--Otto (JKO) formulation and prove convergence toward the semicircular equilibrium. The framework provides functional inequalities (free logarithmic Sobolev, Talagrand, and HWI) that quantify entropy dissipation and Wasserstein contraction. These results unify diffusion-based generative modeling with the geometry of operator-valued information, offering a mathematical foundation for generative learning on structured and high-dimensional data.</description>

      <title>Free energy fluctuations in SK and related spin glass models: A literature survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26960v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over the past 50 years, spin glass models have generated a broad range of literature in mathematics, physics, and computer science. There has been much progress in characterizing and proving the limiting free energy of various models, stemming from the original formulas of Parisi. Comparatively less is known about the more detailed topic of free energy fluctuations. This paper concerns a family of models in which there has been considerable progress on fluctuations, namely the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) and spherical Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SSK) models, along with their multi-species analogs. We present a survey of the literature on free energy fluctuations in these 2-spin models, discussing results from different temperature regimes, with and without an external field, including results on phase transitions.</description>

      <title>A note on large deviations for interacting particle dynamics for finding mixed Nash equilibria with applications to GANs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.15177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.15177v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finding equilibrium points in continuous minmax games has become a key problem within machine learning, in part due to its connection to the training of generative adversarial networks and reinforcement learning. Because of existence and robustness issues, recent developments have shifted from pure equilibria to focusing on mixed equilibrium points. In this work we consider a method for finding mixed equilibria in two-layer zero-sum games based on entropic regularisation, where the two competing strategies are represented by two sets of interacting particles. We show that the sequence of empirical measures of the particle system satisfies a large deviation principle as the number of particles grows to infinity, and how this implies convergence of the empirical measure and the associated Nikaid\^o-Isoda error, complementing existing law of large numbers results.</description>

      <title>Spin glass phase at zero temperature in the Edwards-Anderson model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.04112v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While the analysis of mean-field spin glass models has seen tremendous progress in the last twenty years, lattice spin glasses have remained largely intractable. This article presents the solutions to a number of questions about the Edwards-Anderson model of short-range spin glasses (in all dimensions) that were raised in the physics literature many years ago. First, it is shown that the ground state is sensitive to small perturbations of the disorder, in the sense that a small amount of noise gives rise to a new ground state that is nearly orthogonal to the old one with respect to the site overlap inner product. Second, it is shown that one can overturn a macroscopic fraction of the spins in the ground state with an energy cost that is negligible compared to the size of the boundary of the overturned region - a feature that is believed to be typical of spin glasses but clearly absent in ferromagnets. The third result is that the boundary of the overturned region in dimension $d$ has fractal dimension strictly greater than $d-1$, confirming a prediction from physics. The fourth result is that the expected size of the critical droplet of a bond grows at least like a power of the volume. The fifth result is that the correlations between bonds in the ground state can decay at most like the inverse of the distance. This contrasts with the random field Ising model, where it has been shown recently that the correlation decays exponentially in distance in dimension two. Taken together, these results comprise the first mathematical proof of glassy behavior in a short-range spin glass model.</description>

      <title>Separation rates for the detection of synchronization of interacting point processes in a mean field frame. Application to neuroscience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01919v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Permutation tests have been proposed by Albert et al. (2015) to detect dependence between point processes, modeling in particular spike trains, that is the time occurrences of action potentials emitted by neurons. Our present work focuses on exhibiting a criterion on the separation rate to ensure that the Type II errors of these tests are controlled non asymptotically. This criterion is then discussed in two major models in neuroscience: the jittering Poisson model and Hawkes processes having \(M\) components interacting in a mean field frame and evolving in stationary regime. For both models, we obtain a lower bound of the size \(n\) of the sample necessary to detect the dependency between two neurons.</description>

      <title>Fractional diffusion as the limit of a short range potential Rayleigh gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19025v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The fractional diffusion equation is rigorously derived as a scaling limit from a deterministic Rayleigh gas, where
  particles interact via short range potentials with support of size $\varepsilon$ and the background is distributed in space $\mathbb{R}^3$ according to a Poisson process with intensity $N$ and in velocity according to some fat-tailed distribution. As an intermediate step a linear Boltzmann equation is obtained in the Boltzmann-Grad limit as $\varepsilon$ tends to zero and $N$ tends to infinity with $N \varepsilon^2 =c$. The convergence of the empiric particle dynamics to the Boltzmann-type dynamics is shown using semigroup methods to describe probability measures on collision trees associated to physical trajectories in the case of a Rayleigh gas. The fractional diffusion equation is a hydrodynamic limit for times $t \in [0,T]$, where $T$ and inverse mean free path $c$ can both be chosen as some negative rational power $\varepsilon^{-k}$.</description>

      <title>The heat flow on glued spaces with varying dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09996v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new concept of glued manifolds and investigate under which conditions the canonical heat flow on these glued manifolds is ergodic and irreducible. Glued manifolds are metric spaces consisting of manifolds of varying dimension connected by a weakly doubling measure. This can be seen as a condition on the jump in dimension. From another perspective, this construction also defines the Brownian motion on these glued spaces. Using the heat flow, we construct a nonlocal perimeter functional, the heat excess, to raise the question of its ${\Gamma}$-convergence to the standard perimeter functional.
  In this context, we connect our work to the previous work on the convergence of perimeter functionals, approximations, and existence of heat kernels, as well as short-time expansions of Brownian motion.</description>

      <title>Convergence of Random Batch Method with replacement for interacting particle systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19315v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Random Batch Method (RBM) proposed in [Jin et al. J Comput Phys, 2020] is an efficient algorithm for simulating interacting particle systems (IPS). In this paper, we investigate the Random Batch Method with replacement (RBM-r), which is the same as the kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) method for the pairwise interacting particle system of size $N$. In the RBM-r algorithm, one randomly picks a small batch of size $p \ll N$, and only the particles in the picked batch interact among each other within the batch for a short time, where the weak interaction (of strength $\frac{1}{N-1}$) in the original system is replaced by a strong interaction (of strength $\frac{1}{p-1}$). Then one repeats this pick-interact process. This KMC algorithm dramatically reduces the computational cost from $O(N^2)$ to $O(pN)$ per time step, and provides an unbiased approximation of the original force/velocity field of the interacting particle system. We give a rigorous proof of this approximation with an explicit convergence rate. In detail, we show that the Wasserstein-2 distance between first marginal distributions of IPS and RBM-r has an $O(\kappa^{1/4})$ upper bound, where $\kappa$ is the time step for choosing the random batch and the bound is independent of $N$. An improved $O(\kappa^{1/2})$ rate is also obtained when there is no diffusion in the system. Notably, the techniques in our analysis can potentially be applied to study KMC for other systems, including the stochastic Ising spin system.</description>

      <title>Mechanism Learning: reverse causal inference in the presence of multiple unknown confounding through causally weighted Gaussian mixture models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20057v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A major limitation of machine learning (ML) prediction models is that they recover associational, rather than causal, predictive relationships between variables. In high-stakes automation applications of ML this is problematic, as the model often learns spurious, non-causal associations. This paper proposes mechanism learning, a simple method which uses causally weighted Gaussian Mixture Models (CW-GMMs) to deconfound observational data such that any appropriate ML model is forced to learn predictive relationships between effects and their causes (reverse causal inference), despite the potential presence of multiple unknown and unmeasured confounding. Effect variables can be very high-dimensional, and the predictive relationship nonlinear, as is common in ML applications. This novel method is widely applicable, the only requirement is the existence of a set of mechanism variables mediating the cause (prediction target) and effect (feature data), which is independent of the (unmeasured) confounding variables. We test our method on fully synthetic, semi-synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating that it can discover reliable, unbiased, causal ML predictors where by contrast, the same ML predictor trained naively using classical supervised learning on the original observational data, is heavily biased by spurious associations. We provide code to implement the results in the paper, online.</description>

      <title>On the Optimality of Gaussian Code-books for Signaling over a Two-Users Weak Gaussian Interference Channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14941v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article shows that the capacity region of a two users weak Gaussian interference channel can be achieved using single letter Gaussian code-books. The approach relies on traversing the boundary in incremental steps. Starting from a corner point with Gaussian code-books, and relying on calculus of variation, it is shown that the end point in each step is achieved using Gaussian code-books. Optimality of Gaussian code-books is first established by limiting the random coding to independent and identically distributed scalar (single-letter) samples. Then, it is shown that the value of any optimum solution for vector inputs does not exceed that of the single-letter case. It is also shown that the maximum number of phases needed to realize the optimum time-sharing is two. It is established that the solution to the Han-Kobayashi achievable rate region, with single letter Gaussian code-books, achieves the optimum boundary. Even though the article focuses on weak interference, the results are applicable to the general case.</description>

      <title>Martingale property and moment explosions in signature volatility models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17103v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the martingale property and moment explosions of a signature volatility model, where the volatility process of the log-price is given by a linear form of the signature of a time-extended Brownian motion. Excluding trivial cases, we demonstrate that the price process is a true martingale if and only if the order of the linear form is odd and a correlation parameter is negative. The proof involves a fine analysis of the explosion time of a signature stochastic differential equation. This result is of key practical relevance, as it highlights that, when used for approximation purposes, the linear combination of signature elements must be taken of odd order to preserve the martingale property. Once martingality is established, we also characterize the existence of higher moments of the price process in terms of a condition on a correlation parameter.</description>

      <title>Dynamical mean-field analysis of adaptive Langevin diffusions: Propagation-of-chaos and convergence of the linear response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15556v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by an application to empirical Bayes learning in high-dimensional regression, we study a class of Langevin diffusions in a system with random disorder, where the drift coefficient is driven by a parameter that continuously adapts to the empirical distribution of the realized process up to the current time. The resulting dynamics take the form of a stochastic interacting particle system having both a McKean-Vlasov type interaction and a pairwise interaction defined by the random disorder. We prove a propagation-of-chaos result, showing that in the large system limit over dimension-independent time horizons, the empirical distribution of sample paths of the Langevin process converges to a deterministic limit law that is described by dynamical mean-field theory. This law is characterized by a system of dynamical fixed-point equations for the limit of the drift parameter and for the correlation and response kernels of the limiting dynamics. Using a dynamical cavity argument, we verify that these correlation and response kernels arise as the asymptotic limits of the averaged correlation and linear response functions of single coordinates of the system. These results enable an asymptotic analysis of an empirical Bayes Langevin dynamics procedure for learning an unknown prior parameter in a linear regression model, which we develop in a companion paper.</description>

      <title>Improvement of effective Erdos-Wintner theorem for Zeckendorf expansions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14974v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the effective Erdos-Wintner theorem for Zeckendorf expansions. Drmota and the author obtained a uniform Kolmogorov bound whose error involves $T\sum_{j&gt;L-2h}|f(F_j)|$, which assumes absolute convergence of the linear tail $\sum_j f(F_j)$. We remove this assumption. Grouping the transfer matrices in pairs and working to second order on the logarithm of the product, after extracting the common linear phase along the dominant direction, yields a quadratic tail $T^2\sum_{j&gt;L-2h} f(F_j)^2$, or, in a flexible variant, the split tail $T\sum_{|f(F_j)|&gt;1/T}|f(F_j)| + T^2\sum_{|f(F_j)|\le 1/T} f(F_j)^2$. Either form requires only $\sum f(F_j)^2&lt;\infty$.</description>

      <title>Rogue waves and large deviations for 2D pure gravity deep water waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15159v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rogue waves are extreme ocean events characterized by the sudden formation of anomalously large crests, and remain an important subject of investigation in oceanography and mathematics. A central problem is to quantify the probability of their formation under random Gaussian sea initial data. In this work, we rigorously characterize the tail-probability for the formation of rogue waves of the pure gravity water wave equations in deep water, the most accurate quasilinear PDE modeling waves in open ocean. This large deviation result rigorously proves various conjectures from the oceanography literature in the weakly nonlinear regime. Moreover, the result holds up to the optimal timescales allowed by deterministic well-posedness theory. The proof shows that rogue waves most likely arise through "dispersive focusing", where phase quasi-synchronization produces constructive amplification of the water crest. The main difficulty in justifying this mechanism is propagating statistical information over such long timescales, which we overcome by combining normal forms and probabilistic methods. Unlike prior work, this novel approach does not require approximate solutions to be Gaussian. Our general method tracks the tail probability of solutions to Hamiltonian PDEs with an integrable normal form and random Gaussian initial data over very long times, even in the absence of (quasi-)invariant measures.</description>
