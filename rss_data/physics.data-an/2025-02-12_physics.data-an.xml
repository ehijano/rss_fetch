      <title>Towards energy-insensitive and robust neutron/gamma classification: a learning-based frequency-domain parametric approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutron/gamma discrimination has been intensively researched in recent years, due to its unique scientific value and widespread applications. With the advancement of detection materials and algorithms, nowadays we can achieve fairly good discrimination. However, further improvements rely on better utilization of detector raw signals, especially energy-independent pulse characteristics. We begin by discussing why figure-of-merit (FoM) is not a comprehensive criterion for high-precision neutron/gamma discriminators, and proposing a new evaluation method based on adversarial sampling. Inspired by frequency-domain analysis in existing literature, parametric linear/nonlinear models with minimum complexity are created, upon the discrete spectrum, with tunable parameters just as neural networks. We train the models on an open-source neutron/gamma dataset (CLYC crystals with silicon photomultipliers) preprocessed by charge normalization to discover and exploit energy-independent features. The performance is evaluated on different sampling rates and noise levels, in comparison with the frequency classification index and conventional methods. The frequency-domain parametric models show higher accuracy and better adaptability to variations of data integrity than other discriminators. The proposed method is also promising for online inference on economical hardware and portable devices.</description>

      <title>Explainable Multimodal Machine Learning for Revealing Structure-Property Relationships in Carbon Nanotube Fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we propose Explainable Multimodal Machine Learning (EMML), which integrates the analysis of diverse data types (multimodal data) using factor analysis for feature extraction with Explainable AI (XAI), for carbon nanotube (CNT) fibers prepared from aqueous dispersions. This method is a powerful approach to elucidate the mechanisms governing material properties, where multi-stage fabrication conditions and multiscale structures have complex influences. Thus, in our case, this approach helps us understand how different processing steps and structures at various scales impact the final properties of CNT fibers. The analysis targeted structures ranging from the nanoscale to the macroscale, including aggregation size distributions of CNT dispersions and the effective length of CNTs. Furthermore, because some types of data were difficult to interpret using standard methods, challenging-to-interpret distribution data were analyzed using Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) for extracting key features that determine the outcome. Contribution analysis with SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) demonstrated that small, uniformly distributed aggregates are crucial for improving fracture strength, while CNTs with long effective lengths are significant factors for enhancing electrical conductivity. The analysis also identified thresholds and trends for these key factors to assist in defining the conditions needed to optimize CNT fiber properties. EMML is not limited to CNT fibers but can be applied to the design of other materials derived from nanomaterials, making it a useful tool for developing a wide range of advanced materials. This approach provides a foundation for advancing data-driven materials research.</description>

      <title>A multiscale Bayesian approach to quantification and denoising of energy-dispersive x-ray data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectrum imaging yields compositional information with a spatial resolution down to the atomic level. However, experimental limitations often produce extremely sparse and noisy EDX spectra. Under such conditions, every detected X-ray must be leveraged to obtain the maximum possible amount of information about the sample. To this end, we introduce a robust multiscale Bayesian approach that accounts for the Poisson statistics in the EDX data and leverages their underlying spatial correlations. This is combined with EDX spectral simulation (elemental contributions and Bremsstrahlung background) into a Bayesian estimation strategy. When tested using simulated datasets, the chemical maps obtained with this approach are more accurate and preserve a higher spatial resolution than those obtained by standard methods. These properties translate to experimental datasets, where the method enhances the atomic resolution chemical maps of a canonical tetragonal ferroelectric PbTiO3 sample, such that ferroelectric domains are mapped with unit-cell resolution.</description>

      <title>Efficient method for profiling core-periphery structures in complex networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Profiling core-periphery structures in networks has attracted significant attention, leading to the development of various methods. Among these, the rich-core method is distinguished for being entirely parameter-free and scalable to large networks; however, the cores it identifies are not always optimal. Here, we propose an improved method building upon the rich-core framework. Instead of relying solely on node degree, our approach incorporates both the node's coreness $k$ and its centrality within the $k$-core. We apply the approach to twelve real-world networks, and find that the cores identified are generally denser compared to those derived from previous rich-core method. Additionally, we demonstrate that the proposed method provides a natural way for identifying an exceptionally dense core, i.e., a clique, which often approximates or even matches the maximum clique in many real-world networks. Furthermore, we extend the method to multiplex networks, and show its effectiveness in identifying dense multiplex cores across several well-studied datasets. Our study may offer valuable insights into exploring the meso-scale properties of complex networks.</description>

      <title>SymbolFit: Automatic Parametric Modeling with Symbolic Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09851v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce SymbolFit, a framework that automates parametric modeling by using symbolic regression to perform a machine-search for functions that fit the data, while simultaneously providing uncertainty estimates in a single run. Traditionally, constructing a parametric model to accurately describe binned data has been a manual and iterative process, requiring an adequate functional form to be determined before the fit can be performed. The main challenge arises when the appropriate functional forms cannot be derived from first principles, especially when there is no underlying true closed-form function for the distribution. In this work, we address this problem by utilizing symbolic regression, a machine learning technique that explores a vast space of candidate functions without needing a predefined functional form, treating the functional form itself as a trainable parameter. Our approach is demonstrated in data analysis applications in high-energy physics experiments at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC). We demonstrate its effectiveness and efficiency using five real proton-proton collision datasets from new physics searches at the LHC, namely the background modeling in resonance searches for high-mass dijet, trijet, paired-dijet, diphoton, and dimuon events. We also validate the framework using several toy datasets with one and more variables.</description>
