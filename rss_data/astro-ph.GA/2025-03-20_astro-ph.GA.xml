      <title>Slitless Areal Pure-Parallel HIgh-Redshift Emission Survey (SAPPHIRES): Early Data Release of Deep JWST/NIRCam Images and Spectra in MACS J0416 Parallel Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the early data release (EDR) of SAPPHIRES, a JWST Cycle-3 Treasury imaging and spectroscopic survey using the powerful NIRCam wide-field slitless spectroscopic (WFSS) mode in pure parallel. SAPPHIRES will obtain NIRCam imaging and WFSS data in many cosmological deep fields totaling a telescope charged time of 709 hours (557-hour exposures). In this EDR, we present NIRCam imaging and WFSS data obtained in parallel to the Frontier Field galaxy cluster MACS J0416.1-2403, which are attached to primary observations JWST-GO-4750. With a total dual-channel exposure time of 47.2 hours, we obtain deep NIRCam imaging in 13 bands at 0.6--5.0 micron and deep WFSS at 3.1-5.0 micron through the F356W and F444W filters with grisms in orthogonal dispersion directions. We release reduced NIRCam images, photometric catalogs of 22107 sources and WFSS spectra of 1060 sources with confirmed redshifts ($z\simeq0-8.5$). Preliminary value-added catalogs including photometric redshifts, spectroscopic redshifts and physical properties (mass, star-formation rate, etc.) are also made available. We also characterize the data quality and demonstrate scientific applications, including (1) galaxy candidates at the redshift frontier ($z\gtrsim10$), (2) the ionized gas kinematics of a galaxy reconstructed from $R\sim1500$ grism spectra at orthogonal dispersion directions, (3) massive emission-line galaxies and active galactic nuclei (AGN) around the Epoch of Reionization.</description>

      <title>Effects of Dark Matter Self Interactions on Sagittarius and Its Stream</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work explores how assumptions regarding the particle-physics nature of dark matter can alter the evolution of the Sagittarius (Sgr) dwarf spheroidal galaxy and its expansive stellar stream. We run a large suite of $N$-body simulations to model the infall of a Sgr-like dwarf, exploring how the presence of dark matter self interactions impacts its evolution. For a scattering cross section of $\sigma/m_\chi = 30 \text{ cm}^2\text{/g}$ (at orbital velocity scales), these interactions result in significantly less stellar mass and little to no dark matter bound to the progenitor at the present day. To isolate the cause of this mass loss, we introduce a novel technique for controlling which pairs of dark matter simulation particles can interact. This enables us to identify ram-pressure evaporation - the scattering of satellite and host dark matter particles - as the primary source of the enhanced mass loss. The rapid disintegration of the Sgr progenitor when self interactions are allowed alters some key properties of the resulting stellar stream, most dramatically suppressing the presence of a "spur" on the apocenter of the trailing stream arm that correlates with the mass of the satellite at last pericenter. We demonstrate how the effects on the Sgr system scale with the particular choice of self-interaction cross section, which affects the degree of ram-pressure evaporation. These findings generalize beyond the Sgr system, underscoring that dwarf stellar streams and dwarf galaxies with close passages may serve as sensitive probes for dark matter self interactions.</description>

      <title>JADES and SAPPHIRES: Galaxy Metamorphosis Amidst a Huge, Luminous Emission-line Region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of a remarkably large and luminous line-emitting nebula extending on either side of the Balmer-break galaxy JADES-GS-518794 at z=5.89, detected with JADES JWST/NIRCam imaging in [O III]$\lambda\lambda$4959,5007 and H$\alpha$ and spectroscopically confirmed with NIRCam/WFSS thanks to the pure-parallel SAPPHIRES programme. The end-to-end velocity offset is $\Delta v=830\pm130$ km s$^{-1}$. Nebulae with such large size and high luminosity (25-pkpc diameter, L[O III] = $1.2\times 10^{10}$ L$_\odot$) are routinely observed around bright quasars, unlike JADES-GS-518794. With a stellar mass of $10^{10.1}$ M$_\odot$, this galaxy is at the knee of the mass function at z=6. Its star-formation rate declined for some time (10-100 Myr prior to observation), followed by a recent (10 Myr) upturn. This system is part of a candidate large-scale galaxy overdensity, with an excess of Balmer-break galaxies compared to the field (3 $\sigma$). We discuss the possible origin of this nebula as material from a merger or gas expelled by an active galactic nucleus (AGN). The symmetry of the nebula, its bubble-like morphology, kinematics, high luminosity, and the extremely high equivalent width of [OIII] together favour the AGN interpretation. Intriguingly, there may be a physical connection between the presence of such a large, luminous nebula and the possible metamorphosis of the central galaxy towards quenching.</description>

      <title>The rise of the galactic empire: luminosity functions at $z\sim17$ and $z\sim25$ estimated with the MIDIS$+$NGDEEP ultra-deep JWST/NIRCam dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a sample of six F200W and three F277W dropout sources identified as $16&lt;z&lt;25$ galaxy candidates based on the deepest JWST/NIRCam data to date, provided by the MIRI Deep Imaging Survey (MIDIS) and the Next Generation Deep Extragalactic Exploratory Public survey (NGDEEP), reaching 5$\sigma$ depths of $\sim31.5$ mag (AB) at $\geq2$ $\mu$m. We estimate ultraviolet (UV) luminosity functions and densities at $z\sim17$ and $z\sim25$. We find that the number density of galaxies with absolute magnitudes $-19&lt;M_\mathrm{UV}&lt;-18$ (AB) at $z\sim17$ ($z\sim25$) is a factor of 4 (25) smaller than at $z\sim12$; a similar evolution is observed for the luminosity density. Compared to state-of-the-art galaxy simulations, we find the need for an enhanced UV-photon production at $z=17-25$ in $\mathrm{M}_\mathrm{DM}=10^{8.5-9.5}$ M$_\odot$ dark matter halos, maybe provided by an increase in the star formation efficiency at early times and/or by intense bursts fed by very low metallicity or primordial gas. There are few robust theoretical predictions for the evolution of galaxies above $z\sim20$ in the literature, however, the continuing rapid drop in the halo mass function suggests more rapid evolution than we observe if photon production efficiencies remained constant. Our $z&gt;16$ galaxy candidates present mass-weighted ages around 30 Myr, and attenuations $\mathrm{A(V)}&lt;0.1$ mag. Their average stellar mass is $\mathrm{M}_\bigstar\sim10^{7}\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$, implying a star formation efficiency (stellar-to-baryon mass fraction) around 10%. We find three galaxies with very blue UV spectral slopes ($\beta\sim-3$) compatible with low metallicity or Pop III and young ($\lesssim10$ Myr) stars and/or high escape fractions of ionizing photons, the rest presenting slopes $\beta\sim-2.5$ similar to $z=10-12$ samples.</description>

      <title>SAPPHIRES: A Galaxy Over-Density in the Heart of Cosmic Reionization at $z=8.47$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of a galaxy proto-cluster candidate (dubbed MACS0416-OD-z8p5) at a spectroscopic redshift of $z\sim8.47$, dating back to $\sim550$Myr after the Big Bang. The observations are part of the JWST Cycle-3 treasury program, Slitless Areal Pure-Parallel HIgh-Redshift Emission Survey (SAPPHIRES) with NIRCam-grism. Using wide field slitless spectroscopy (WFSS) obtained in the MACS0416 parallel field, we robustly confirm nine galaxies at $z_{\rm spec}\sim8.47$ via emission line detections of [OIII]5008A (with $&gt;5\,\sigma$) and tentatively confirm one additional galaxy (at $\sim3\,\sigma$). This discovery represents the highest-redshift, spectroscopically confirmed galaxy over-density known to date, which is $\sim6$--$8$ times more dense than the average volume density of galaxies at the same redshift. Furthermore, a galaxy hosting a low-mass active galactic nucleus (``Little-Red-Dot'') is found as a member, suggesting an early emergence of active, massive black holes and feedback between these black holes and their surrounding environments. We also discuss the spatial structures connecting the galaxy over-density to nearby massive star-forming galaxies (separated by $\sim 5$pMpc, including MACS0416-Y1 and MACS0416-JD. This finding of a massive dark matter halo hosting a galaxy over-density at $z\sim8.5$ is surprising given that our survey covered only a small, random field ($16.5\,{\rm arcmin^2}$) as part of a pure parallel observation. The comparison with cosmological simulations shows that the likelihood of finding such a large-scale structure is $&lt;5\,\%$ under the current galaxy formation scenario and the observed survey volume. Our results demonstrate the power of WFSS observations to build a complete line-emitter sample and suggest an important role for over-densities in enhancing galaxy formation by funneling large-scale gas supplies into small cosmological volumes.</description>

      <title>The star grinder in the Galactic centre. Uncovering the highly compact central stellar-mass black hole cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Various past theoretical considerations and observational efforts suggest the presence of a population of stellar-mass black holes in the innermost parsec of the Galactic centre. In this Letter, we investigate the impact of these black holes on the composition of the embedding stellar population through their direct collisions with the individual stars. Based on the estimated collision rates, we derive an order of magnitude radial density profile of the black hole cluster. The estimates were obtained analytically, considering various possible formation channels for the black holes and the observed present-day properties of the stellar populations in the Galactic centre. We find that the collisions of the stars and the black holes can lead to the depletion of the most massive stars within the S-cluster on a timescale of a few million years. The necessary black hole cluster density is compatible with the recurrent in situ star formation in the innermost parsec of the Galactic centre. We suggest that such a depletion naturally explains the reported lack of stars of the stellar type O and of the Galactic halo hyper-velocity star counterparts within the S-cluster.</description>

      <title>Scaling relations of early-type galaxies in MOND</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the shape and morphology of early-type galaxies (ETGs) within the framework of Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND). Building on our previous studies, which demonstrated that the monolithic collapse of primordial gas clouds in MOND produces galaxies (noted throughout as 'model relics' in the context of this work) with short star formation timescales and a downsizing effect as observationally found, we present new analyses on the resulting structural and morphological properties of these systems. Initially, the monolithically formed galaxies display disk-like structures. In this study, we further analyze the transformations that occur when these galaxies merge, observing that the resulting systems (noted throughout as 'merged galaxies' in the context of this work) take on elliptical-like shapes, with the (V_rot/V_sigma) - ellipticity relations closely matching observational data across various projections. We extend this analysis by examining the isophotal shapes and rotational parameter (lambda_R) of both individual relics and merged galaxies. The results indicate that ETGs may originate in pairs in dense environments, with mergers subsequently producing elliptical structures that align well with observed kinematic and morphological characteristics. Finally, we compare both the model relics and merged galaxies with the fundamental plane and Kormendy relation of observed ETGs, finding close agreement. Together, these findings suggest that MOND provides a viable physical framework for the rapid formation and morphological evolution of ETGs.</description>

      <title>Evidence for Multiple Types of Post-Starburst Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quenching mechanisms of galaxies are not yet fully understood, but post-starburst galaxies provide one explanation for the rapid transition between star-forming and quiescent galaxies. It is generally believed that the starburst initiating the post-starburst phase is merger-driven, however, not all post-starburst galaxies show evidence of a merger, and recent studies suggest that post-starburst galaxies may be produced by multiple distinct mechanisms. This study examines whether multiple types of post-starburst galaxies actually exist $-$ i.e. whether the properties of post-starburst galaxies are multimodal $-$ using Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) to cluster post-starburst galaxies based on spectroscopic data. It is suggested that there are three types of post-starburst galaxies, which have dissimilar stacked spectral energy distributions and are separated by their H$\alpha$/[OII]$\lambda$3727 absorption with an accuracy of 91%. A comparison of various galaxy properties (e.g., emission line strengths, mass and age distributions, and morphologies) indicate that the grouping is not just an age sequence but may be correlated to the merger-histories of the galaxies. It is suggested that the three post-starburst galaxy types have different origins, some of which may not be merger-driven, and that all typical galaxies go through the post-starburst phase at turnoff.</description>

      <title>Euclid preparation. Spatially resolved stellar populations of local galaxies with Euclid: a proof of concept using synthetic images with the TNG50 simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The European Space Agency's Euclid mission will observe approximately 14,000 $\rm{deg}^{2}$ of the extragalactic sky and deliver high-quality imaging for many galaxies. The depth and high spatial resolution of the data will enable a detailed analysis of stellar population properties of local galaxies. In this study, we test our pipeline for spatially resolved SED fitting using synthetic images of Euclid, LSST, and GALEX generated from the TNG50 simulation. We apply our pipeline to 25 local simulated galaxies to recover their resolved stellar population properties. We produce 3 types of data cubes: GALEX + LSST + Euclid, LSST + Euclid, and Euclid-only. We perform the SED fitting tests with two SPS models in a Bayesian framework. Because the age, metallicity, and dust attenuation estimates are biased when applying only classical formulations of flat priors, we examine the effects of additional priors in the forms of mass-age-$Z$ relations, constructed using a combination of empirical and simulated data. Stellar-mass surface densities can be recovered well using any of the 3 data cubes, regardless of the SPS model and prior variations. The new priors then significantly improve the measurements of mass-weighted age and $Z$ compared to results obtained without priors, but they may play an excessive role compared to the data in determining the outcome when no UV data is available. The spatially resolved SED fitting method is powerful for mapping the stellar populations of galaxies with the current abundance of high-quality imaging data. Our study re-emphasizes the gain added by including multiwavelength data from ancillary surveys and the roles of priors in Bayesian SED fitting. With the Euclid data alone, we will be able to generate complete and deep stellar mass maps of galaxies in the local Universe, thus exploiting the telescope's wide field, NIR sensitivity, and high spatial resolution.</description>

      <title>The S-PLUS Fornax Project (S+FP): Mapping globular clusters systems within 5 virial radii around NGC 1399</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the largest sample ($\sim$13,000 candidates, $\sim$3000 of wich are bona-fide candidates) of globular cluster (GCs) candidates reported in the Fornax Cluster so far. The survey is centered on the NGC 1399 galaxy, extending out to 5 virial radii (\rv) of the cluster. We carried out a photometric study using images observed in the 12-bands system of the Southern Photometric Local Universe Survey (S-PLUS), corresponding to 106 pointings, covering a sky area of $\sim$208 square degrees. Studying the properties of spectroscopically confirmed GCs, we have designed a method to select GC candidates using structural and photometric parameters. We found evidence of color bimodality in 2 broad bands colors, namely $(g-i)_{0}$ and $(g-z)_{0}$, while, in the narrow bands, we did not find strong statistical evidence to confirm bimodality in any color. We analyzed the GCs luminosity functions (GCLF) in the 12-bands of S-PLUS, and we can highlight two points: a) due to the relatively shallow depth of S-PLUS, it is only possible to observe the bright end of the GCLF and, b) at that level, in all the bands it can be appreciated the log-normal distribution typical for GC systems. With the spatial coverage reached in this study, we are able for the first time explore the large scale distribution of GCs within and around a galaxy cluster. In particular, we noted that the GCs might be clustered along substructures, which traces the current cluster build up.</description>

      <title>Measuring the Resolved Star Formation Main Sequence in TNG100: Fitting Technique Matters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The resolved star formation main sequence (rSFMS) and similar spatially resolved scaling relationships are frequently measured in both observed and simulated data. However, comparisons of these measurements are hindered by various differences between studies such as spatial resolution, sample selection criteria, and fitting technique. Using maps of $\Sigma_*$ and $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ derived using simulated galaxies from TNG100, we investigate the dependence of rSFMS measurements on spatial resolution, smoothing scale, and fitting technique. When the ridge line of the rSFMS is fit with a double linear function, we find that the slope of the rSFMS at low-$\Sigma_*$ is independent (within $2\sigma$) of spatial resolution and smoothing scale. We demonstrate that this method offers significant benefits over fitting the rSFMS with a single linear function using ordinary least squares.</description>

      <title>Cyclic C$_4^+$ as the carrier of the diffuse interstellar band at 503.9 nm?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The diffuse interstellar bands (DIBs) have remained a mystery in astronomy since their discovery over a century ago. The only currently known carrier is C$_{60}^+$ responsible for five DIBs, while more than 550 are yet to be interpreted. The spectra of short carbon chain cations C$_n^+$, which are considered one of the most promising classes of species for the role of carriers of DIBs, are successfully recorded using He-tagging spectroscopy. The comparison of laboratory spectra with the observations demonstrates a close match of two absorption bands of C$_4^+$ with the broad DIB at 503.9 nm. This defines a high abundance of these ions in the interstellar medium (ISM), which should exceed those of other similar-sized carbon chain cations. It is anticipated that all other short carbon chain cations will exhibit linear geometry and, as a consequence, will have a long vibrational progression. However, the distinctive cyclic geometry of C$_4^+$ is postulated to underpin the elevated abundance of these ions in the ISM, as well as the distinctive spectrum of this ion, which displays a single strong, relatively narrow absorption band that exceeds in intensity all other absorption bands in the visible range.</description>

      <title>TONGS: A Treasury Of Nearby Galaxy Surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The beginning of the 21st century marked the "modern era of galaxy surveys" in astronomy. Rapid innovation in observing technology, combined with the base built by galaxy catalogs and atlases dating back centuries, sparked an explosion of new observational programs driven by efforts to understand the different processes driving galaxy evolution. This review aims to answer the following science questions: (1) how have galaxy surveys evolved in the past 20 years, and how have traditional observational programs been affected by the rise of large panoramic surveys, (2) can the term "nearby" be quantified in the context of galaxy surveys, and (3) how complete is the coverage of the nearby universe and what areas hold the largest opportunity for future work? We define a galaxy survey as a systematically obtained data set which aims to characterize a set of astronomical objects. Galaxy surveys can further be subdivided based on the methods used to select the objects to observe, the properties of the survey samples (e.g. distance or morphology), or the observing strategies used. We focus on \textit{pointed} nearby galaxy surveys, which we define as surveys which observe a specific sample of target galaxies. Through a study of 43 nearby galaxy surveys, we find no standardized quantitative definition for "nearby" with surveys covering a wide range of distances. We observe that since 2003, traditional targeted galaxy surveys have undergone a dramatic evolution, transitioning from large, statistical surveys to small, ultra-specific projects which complement the rise of large high resolution panoramic surveys. While wavelength regimes observable from the ground (such as radio or optical wavelengths) host numerous surveys, the largest opportunity for future work is within the less covered space-based wavelength regimes (especially ultraviolet and X-ray).</description>

      <title>Detection for Intermediate-mass Binary Black Holes in Population III Star Clusters with TianQin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Population III star clusters are predicted to form in unenriched dark matter halos. Direct N-body simulation of Pop III clusters implies the possible formation and merger of intermediate-mass binary black holes (IMBBHs). The gravitational wave signals could be detected by space-borne gravitational wave detectors like TianQin. Aims. This study evaluates the potential of TianQin in detecting IMBBHs from Pop III star clusters, focusing on key factors such as the detection horizon, detection number, and Fisher uncertainty. Methods. A Monte Carlo simulation is employed to derive IMBBH sources, utilizing the IMRPhenomD waveform model to simulate catalogs of observable IMBBH mergers. The mass and redshift distributions are derived from direct N-body simulations of IMBBHs in Population III star clusters. Detection numbers are determined by calculating the signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) of the simulated signals and applying thresholds for detection. Fisher uncertainty is obtained through Fisher information matrix analysis. Results. The findings suggest that TianQin could achieve detection numbers within 5 years ranging from 1 in the most pessimistic scenario to 253 in the most optimistic scenario. Furthermore, TianQin can precisely constrain the IMBBH mass with a relative uncertainty of $10^{-6}$, coalescence time $t_c$ within 1 second, and sky location $\bar{\Omega}_S$ within 1 $\rm{deg}^2$. However, the luminosity distance $D_L$ and inclination angle $\iota$ exhibit substantial degeneracies, limiting their precise estimation.</description>

      <title>Preparing for Rubin-LSST -- Detecting Brightest Cluster Galaxies with Machine Learning in the LSST DP0.2 simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The future Rubin Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) is expected to deliver its first data release in the current of 2025. The upcoming survey will provide us with images of galaxy clusters in the optical to the near-infrared, with unrivalled coverage, depth and uniformity. The study of galaxy clusters informs us on the effect of environmental processes on galactic formation, which directly translates onto the formation of the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG). These massive galaxies present traces of the whole merger history of their host clusters, which can be in the shape of intra-cluster light (ICL) that surrounds them, tidal streams, or simply by the accumulated stellar mass that has been acquired over the past 10 billion years as they have cannibalized other galaxies in their surroundings. In an era where new data is being generated faster than humans can deal with, new methods involving machine learning have been emerging more and more in the most recent years. In the aim of preparing for the future LSST data release which will allow the observations of more than 20000 clusters and BCGs, we present in this paper different methods based on machine learning to detect these BCGs on LSST-like optical images. This study is done by making use of the simulated LSST Data Preview images. We find that the use of machine learning allows to accurately identify the BCG in up to 95% of clusters in our sample. Compared to more conventional red sequence extraction methods, the use of machine learning appears to be faster, more efficient and consistent, and does not require much, if any, pre-processing.</description>

      <title>Linking Photometry and spectroscopy: profiling multiple populations in globular clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our understanding of multiple populations in globular clusters (GCs) largely comes from photometry and spectroscopy: appropriate photometric diagrams can disentangle first and second populations (1P and 2P)-1P having chemical signatures similar to field stars, and 2P stars showing unique light-element variations-while spectroscopy enables detailed chemical abundances analyses of these populations. We combine multi-band photometry with extensive spectroscopic data to investigate the chemical composition of multiple populations across 38 GCs, yielding a chemical abundance dataset for stars with precise population tagging. This dataset provides the most extensive analysis of C, N, O, Na, Mg, and Al variations, revealing the largest sample yet of light-element spreads across GCs. GC mass correlates with light-element variations, supporting earlier photometric studies. We investigated iron differences among 1P stars, confirming their presence in 19 GCs, and finding a spread consistent with prediction based on photometry. Notably, in eight of them we detected a correlation between [Fe/H] and the position in iron-sensitive photometric diagrams. More massive GCs display larger lithium depletion among 2P stars, which is consistent with zero at smaller masses. Notably, some 2P stars with the most extreme chemical differences compared to 1P stars still show Li comparable to 1P, suggesting that the 1P polluters have produced some amount of this element. We analyzed the anomalous stars, a population characterized by enrichment in iron, s-process elements, and C+N+O, in ten GCs. NGC1851, NGC5139, NGC6656, and NGC 6715 display light-element inhomogeneities similar to 1P and 2P stars. Iron and barium enrichment varies widely-negligible in some clusters and much larger than errors in others. Generally, these elemental spreads correlate with GC mass.</description>

Abstract: Spectra of vibrational overtone and combination bands from vibrational ground state of HCNH+ were measured using an action spectroscopy technique with active background suppression in a cryogenic 22 pole radio frequency ion trap apparatus. Spectroscopic constants for the upper vibrational levels of the transitions were determined with vibrational band origins being 6846.77981(90) $\text{cm}^{-1}$ ($2\nu_1$ , NH stretch), 6640.47624(43) $\text{cm}^{-1}$ ($\nu_1 + \nu_2$), 6282.03578(63) $\text{cm}^{-1}$ ($2\nu_2$, CH stretch), and 6588.4894(20) $\text{cm}^{-1}$ ($\nu_2 + \nu_3 + 2\nu_5^0$). State of the art ab initio VCI calculations up to 10000 $\text{cm}^{-1}$ complement the experimental data.</description>

      <title>Distributions and Physical Properties of Molecular Clouds in the G24 Region of the Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the spatial distribution and physical characteristics of molecular clouds in the G24 region, which is located near the intersection of the Milky Way's Galactic bar with the Norma arm and the 3 kpc arm. Utilizing molecular line data from the Milky Way Imaging Scroll Painting (MWISP) project, including $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, and C$^{18}$O, along with our own observations of HCO$^{+}$ line using the Purple Mountain Observatory (PMO) 13.7 m telescope, we have revealed the complex architecture of molecular clouds in the G24 region. Seven giant molecular clouds, each with a mass exceeding $10^4$ $M_\odot$ and a typical H$_2$ column density of $10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$, have been identified through observations of CO and its isotopes. The conversion factor $X_{\text{CO}}$ for the G24 region is estimated to be 8.25 $\times$ 10$^{19}$ cm$^{-2}$ (K km s$^{-1}$)$^{-1}$, aligning with the typical values observed in other regions. Adopting the GaussClumps algorithm, we have identified a total of 257, 201, and 110 clumps in $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO and C$^{18}$O within G24 region, respectively. The derived physical properties (including effective radius, mass, and virial parameter) indicate that the majority of these clumps are gravitationally bound, with a subset possessing the potential to form massive stars. Examination of gas infall activities within these clumps further suggests ongoing massive star formation. The complex physical and kinematic environment, shaped by the G24 region's unique location within the Milky Way, has limited the clear detection of gas outflows.</description>

      <title>Subaru Hyper-Supreme Cam observations of IC 1396: Source catalogue, member population, and sub-clusters of the complex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To identify member populations of IC 1396, we employ the random forest (RF) classifier of machine learning technique. Random forest classifier is an ensemble of individual decision trees suitable for large, high-dimensional datasets. The training set used in this work is derived from previous Gaia-based studies, where the member stars are younger than $\sim$ 10~Myr. However, its sensitivity is limited to $\sim$ 20~mag in the $\rm r_2$ band, making it challenging to identify candidates at the fainter end. In this analysis, in addition to magnitudes and colours, we incorporate several derived parameters from the magnitude and colour of the sources to identify candidate members of the star-forming complex. By employing this method, we are able to identify promising candidate member populations of the star-forming complex. We discuss the associated limitations and caveats in the method and for improvment in future studies.
  In this analysis, we identify 2425 high-probability low-mass stars distributed within the entire star-forming complex, of which 1331 are new detections. Comparison of these identified member populations shows a high retrieval rate with Gaia-based literature sources, as well as sources detected through methods based on optical spectroscopy, Spitzer, $\rm H_{\alpha}/X-ray$ emissions, optical, and 2MASS photometry. The mean age of the member populations is $\rm \sim 2-4~Myr$, consistent with findings from previous studies. Considering the identified member populations, we present preliminary results by exploring the presence of sub-clusters within IC 1396, assessing the possible mass limit of the member populations, and providing a brief discussion on the star formation history of the complex.</description>

      <title>On the spatial distribution of luminous blue variables in the M33 galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the current paper, we present a study of the spatial distribution of luminous blue variables (LBVs) and various LBV candidates (cLBVs) with respect to OB associations in the M33 galaxy. The identification of blue star groups was based on the LGGS data and was carried out by two clustering algorithms with initial parameters determined during simulations of random stellar fields. We have found that the distribution of distances to the nearest OB association obtained for the LBV/cLBV sample is close to that for massive stars with $M_{\rm init}&gt;20\,M_\odot$ and Wolf-Rayet stars. This result is in good agreement with the standard assumption that luminous blue variables represent an intermediate stage in the evolution of the most massive stars. However, some objects from the LBV/cLBV sample, particularly Fe$\,$II-emission stars, demonstrated severe isolation compared to other massive stars, which, together with certain features of their spectra, implicitly indicates that the nature of these objects and other LBVs/cLBVs may differ radically.</description>

      <title>Euclid: Early Release Observations -- Interplay between dwarf galaxies and their globular clusters in the Perseus galaxy cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analysis of globular clusters (GCs) of dwarf galaxies in the Perseus galaxy cluster to explore the relationship between dwarf galaxy properties and their GCs. Our focus is on GC numbers ($N_{\rm GC}$) and GC half-number radii ($R_{\rm GC}$) around dwarf galaxies, and their relations with host galaxy stellar masses ($M_*$), central surface brightnesses ($\mu_0$), and effective radii ($R_{\rm e}$). Interestingly, we find that at a given stellar mass, $R_{\rm GC}$ is almost independent of the host galaxy $\mu_0$ and $R_{\rm e}$, while $R_{\rm GC}/R_{\rm e}$ depends on $\mu_0$ and $R_{\rm e}$; lower surface brightness and diffuse dwarf galaxies show $R_{\rm GC}/R_{\rm e}\approx 1$ while higher surface brightness and compact dwarf galaxies show $R_{\rm GC}/R_{\rm e}\approx 1.5$-$2$. This means that for dwarf galaxies of similar stellar mass, the GCs have a similar median extent; however, their distribution is different from the field stars of their host. Additionally, low surface brightness and diffuse dwarf galaxies on average have a higher $N_{\rm GC}$ than high surface brightness and compact dwarf galaxies at any given stellar mass. We also find that UDGs (ultra-diffuse galaxies) and non-UDGs have similar $R_{\rm GC}$, while UDGs have smaller $R_{\rm GC}/R_{\rm e}$ (typically less than 1) and 3-4 times higher $N_{\rm GC}$ than non-UDGs. Examining nucleated and not-nucleated dwarf galaxies, we find that for $M_*&gt;10^8M_{\odot}$, nucleated dwarf galaxies seem to have smaller $R_{\rm GC}$ and $R_{\rm GC}/R_{\rm e}$, with no significant differences between their $N_{\rm GC}$, except at $M_*&lt;10^8M_{\odot}$ where the nucleated dwarf galaxies tend to have a higher $N_{\rm GC}$. Lastly, we explore the stellar-to-halo mass ratio (SHMR) of dwarf galaxies and conclude that the Perseus cluster dwarf galaxies follow the expected SHMR at $z=0$ extrapolated down to $M_*=10^6M_{\odot}$.</description>

      <title>The OGLE Collection of Variable Stars. Over 75 000 Eclipsing and Ellipsoidal Binary Systems in the Magellanic Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an updated collection of eclipsing and ellipsoidal binary systems in the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds (LMC and SMC), as observed by the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) survey. The catalog comprises a total of 75 400 binary systems, including 63 252 in the LMC and 12 148 in the SMC. The sample is categorized into 67 971 eclipsing and 7429 ellipsoidal variables. For all stars, we provide I-band and V-band photometric time series collected between 2010 and 2024 during the fourth phase of the OGLE project (OGLE-IV). We discuss methods used to identify binary systems in the OGLE data and present objects of particular interest, including double periodic variables, transient eclipsing binaries, double eclipsing binaries, and binary systems with pulsating stars. We present a comparative analysis based on the most comprehensive catalogs of variable stars in the Magellanic System, compiled from surveys like Gaia, ASAS-SN, and EROS-2, and included in the International Variable Star Index.</description>

      <title>Simulating Chemical Abundances in the Circumstellar Nebula of the Late Stage Binary RY Scuti</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: RY Scuti, thought to be a Wolf-Rayet (WR) progenitor, is a massive, post-main-sequence, binary star system undergoing Roche lobe overflow (RLOF). SOFIA (+FORCAST) spectroscopy of the inner, ionized region of RY Scuti's double ringed toroidal nebula affirms the previous detection of the well-studied 12.81 $\mu$m Ne II forbidden transition and reveals four distinct emission lines, including three previously undetected transitions, S III, Fe III, and S III. Cloudy photoionization modeling of the four neon, sulfur, and iron lines was performed to derive fractional abundances (log($\frac{X}{H}$)) of neon at -3.19 $\pm$ 0.0251, sulfur at -3.76 $\pm$ 0.0487, and iron at -2.23 $\pm$ 0.0286. All three species are overabundant with respect to fiducial solar chemical abundances, especially iron. Our analysis suggests that the outer envelope of the primary star in the RY Scuti system is being stripped away via RLOF, leaving helium-rich and hydrogen-poor material visible to observation. This material also exhibits elevated neon, sulfur, and iron fractional abundances, consistent with RY Scuti evolving toward a WR object.</description>

      <title>Evolution of binary stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Binary stars are pairs of stars that are gravitationally bound, providing in some cases accurate measurements of their masses and radii. As such, they serve as excellent testbeds for the theory of stellar structure and evolution. Moreover, binary stars that orbit each other at a sufficiently small distance will interact during their lifetimes, leading to a multitude of different evolutionary pathways that are not present in single star evolution. Among other outcomes, this can lead to the production of stellar mergers, rejuvenated and chemically contaminated accreting stars, stars stripped of their hydrogen envelopes and gravitational wave sources. For stars massive enough to undergo a supernova, binary interaction is expected to impact the evolution of most of them, making the understanding of binary evolution a critical element to comprehend stellar populations and their impact at large scales.</description>

      <title>3D radio data visualisation in open science platforms for next-generation observatories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Next-generation telescopes will bring groundbreaking discoveries but they will also present new technological challenges. The Square Kilometre Array Observatory (SKAO) will be one of the most demanding scientific infrastructures, with a projected data output of 700 PB per year to be distributed to a network of SKA Regional Centres. Current tools are not fully suited to manage such massive data volumes, therefore, new research is required to transform science archives from data providers into service providers. In this paper we examine how a science archive can deliver advanced visualisation capabilities for the SKA science archive. In particular, we have conducted a thorough exploration of existing visualisation software for astronomy and other fields to identify tools capable of addressing Big Data requirements. Using selected technologies, we have developed a prototype archive that provides access to interactive visualisations of 3D radio data through web-based interfaces, adhering to International Virtual Observatory Alliance (IVOA) recommendations to favour interoperability and Open Science practices. In addition, we discuss how current IVOA recommendations support these visualisation capabilities and how they could be expanded. Our prototype archive includes a service to generate 3D models on the fly as a server operation, enabling remote visualisations in a flexible manner; for instance, a set of parameters can be used to customise the models and their visualisation. We have used SKA precursor and pathfinder data to test its usability and scalability, concluding that remote visualisation is a viable solution for handling high-volume data. However, our prototype is constrained by memory limitations, requiring techniques to reduce memory usage.</description>

      <title>The First Model-Independent Chromatic Microlensing Search: No Evidence in the Gravitational Wave Catalog of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The lensing of Gravitational Waves (GWs) due to intervening matter distribution in the universe can lead to chromatic and achromatic signatures in the wave-optics and geometrical-optics limit respectively. This makes it difficult to model for the unknown mass distribution of the lens and hence requires a model-independent lensing detection technique from GW data. We perform the first model-independent microlensing search in the wave-optics limit on the 80 GW events observed with both the LIGO detectors from the third observation catalog GWTC-3 of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA using the analysis method $\mu$-\texttt{GLANCE}. These unmodelled searches pick up one plausible candidate $\rm GW190408\_181802$ with a slightly above threshold residual amplitude compared to the residual expected from detector noise. However, exploring the microlensing modulation signatures on this event, we do not find any conclusive evidence of the microlensing signal in the data. With this, we confidently rule out the presence of any statistically significant microlensing signal in the 80 events of GWTC-3 in a model-independent way.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Himalayas: The Highest Quasar Density Peak Identified in a 10,000 deg$^2$ Sky with Spatial Discrepancies between Galaxies, Quasars, and IGM HI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15963v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the identification of a quasar overdensity in the BOSSJ0210 field, dubbed Cosmic Himalayas, consisting of 11 quasars at $z=2.16-2.20$, the densest overdensity of quasars ($17\sigma$) in the $\sim$10,000 deg$^2$ of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We present the spatial distributions of galaxies and quasars and an HI absorption map of the intergalactic medium (IGM). On the map of 465 galaxies selected from the MAMMOTH-Subaru survey, we find two galaxy density peaks that do not fall on the quasar overdensity but instead exist at the northwest and southeast sides, approximately 25 $h^{-1}$ comoving-Mpc apart from the quasar overdensity. With a spatial resolution of 15 $h^{-1}$ comoving Mpc in projection, we produce a three-dimensional HI tomography map by the IGM Ly$\alpha$ forest in the spectra of 23 SDSS/eBOSS quasars behind the quasar overdensity. Surprisingly, the quasar overdensity coincides with neither an absorption peak nor a transmission peak of IGM HI but lies near the border separating opaque and transparent volumes, with the more luminous quasars located in an environment with lesser IGM HI. Hence remarkably, the overdensity region traced by the 11 quasars, albeit all in coherently active states, has no clear coincidence with peaks of galaxies or HI absorption densities. Current physical scenarios with mixtures of HI overdensities and quasar photoionization cannot fully interpret the emergence of Cosmic Himalayas, suggesting this peculiar structure is an excellent laboratory to unveil the interplay between galaxies, quasars, and the IGM.</description>

      <title>The abundance and nature of high-redshift quiescent galaxies from JADES spectroscopy and the FLAMINGO simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14773v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use NIRSpec/MSA spectroscopy and NIRCam imaging to study a sample of 18 massive ($\log\; M_{*}/M_{\odot} \gt 10\;$dex), central quiescent galaxies at $2\leq z \leq 5$ in the GOODS fields, to investigate their number density, star-formation histories, quenching timescales, and incidence of AGN. The data depth reaches $\log M_*/M_\odot \approx 9\;$dex, yet the least-massive central quiescent galaxy found has $\log M_*/M_\odot \gt 10\;$dex, suggesting that quenching is regulated by a physical quantity that scales with $M_*$. With spectroscopy, we assess the completeness and purity of photometric samples, finding number densities 10 times higher than predicted by galaxy formation models, confirming earlier photometric studies. We compare our number densities to predictions from FLAMINGO, the largest-box full-hydro simulation suite to date. We rule out cosmic variance at the 3-$\sigma$ level, providing spectroscopic confirmation that galaxy formation models do not match observations at $z&gt;3$. Using FLAMINGO, we find that the vast majority of quiescent galaxies' stars formed in situ, with these galaxies not having undergone multiple major dry mergers. This is in agreement with the compact observed size of these systems and suggests that major mergers are not a viable channel for quenching most massive galaxies. Several of our observed galaxies are old, with four galaxies displaying 4000-\r{A} breaks with formation and quenching redshifts of $z\geq8$ and $z\geq6$. Using tracers, we find that 8 galaxies host AGN, including old systems suggesting a high AGN duty cycle with a continuing trickle of gas to fuel accretion.</description>

      <title>On the origin of the Hercules group: I. chemical signatures indicating the outer bar origin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19085v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Hercules kinematic group is a kinematic anomaly of stars observed in the solar neighbourhood (SNd). In this series of papers, we present a comprehensive study of this structure. This paper focuses on its chemical signatures over several groups of elements. The next paper discusses its kinematical properties. While studies suggested a non-native origin of Hercules stars due to the distinct chemical and kinematic features, previous studies focussed mainly on the Fe abundances. We adopt chemical data with abundances of elements from GALAH and APOGEE to seek further chemical implications on the origin. Our analysis reveals that the low alpha population of the low angular momentum Hercules group is significantly enhanced in iron-peak (Fe, Ni, Mn) and Odd-Z (Na, Al) elements, and slightly deficient in alpha elements (O, Ca, Ti) compared to kinematically local stars. The super enhancement in iron-peak elements and deficiency in alpha elements support their origin from the outer thin bar in the inner Galaxy. Moreover, the enhancement in Na and Al indicates these stars as the youngest stars in the old sequence from the inner thick disc. Hence, the origin of these stars can be related to the outer bar region. These chemical signatures require the underlying dynamical mechanism that forms the Hercules group to be capable of transporting stars in the inner Galaxy out to the SNd. The next paper will consider the Trojan orbits as the favoured mechanism.</description>

      <title>The SOFIA Massive (SOMA) Star Formation Survey. V. Clustered Protostars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11792v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present $\sim8-40\,\mu$m SOFIA-FORCAST images of seven regions of ``clustered" star formation as part of the SOFIA Massive (SOMA) Star Formation Survey. We identify a total of 34 protostar candidates and build their spectral energy distributions (SEDs). We fit these SEDs with a grid of radiative transfer models based on the Turbulent Core Accretion (TCA) theory to derive key protostellar properties, including initial core mass, $M_c$, clump environment mass surface density, $\Sigma_{\rm cl}$, and current protostellar mass, $m_*$. We also carry out empirical graybody (GB) estimation of $\Sigma_{\rm cl}$, which allows a case of restricted SED fitting within the TCA model grid. We also release version 2.0 of the open-source Python package \emph{sedcreator}, designed to automate the aperture photometry and SED building and fitting process for sources in clustered environments, where flux contamination from close neighbors typically complicates the process. Using these updated methods, SED fitting yields values of $M_c\sim30-200\:M_{\odot}$, $\Sigma_{\text{cl,SED}}\sim0.1-3\:{\rm{g\:cm}}^{-2}$, and $m_*\sim4-50\:M_{\odot}$. The graybody fitting yields smaller values of $\Sigma_{\text{cl,GB}}\lesssim1\:{\rm{g\:cm}}^{-2}$. From these results, we do not find evidence for a critical $\Sigma_{\rm{cl}}$ needed to form massive ($\gtrsim 8\:M_\odot$) stars. However, we do find tentative evidence for a dearth of the most massive ($m_*\gtrsim30\:M_\odot$) protostars in the clustered regions suggesting a potential impact of environment on the stellar initial mass function.</description>

Abstract: Star formation quenching in galaxies is a critical process in galaxy formation. It is widely believed that the quenching process is dominated by the mass of galaxies and/or their environment. In Paper V, we addressed the challenge to disentangle the effects of mass and environment by employing the PAC method, which combines spectroscopic and deep photometric surveys. This approach enabled us to measure the excess surface density of blue and red galaxies around massive central galaxies down to $10^{9.0}M_{\odot}$. However, it is not straightforward to completely separate the two effects. To address this issue, in this paper, we derive the average quenched fraction of central (isolated) galaxies, $\bar{f}_{\mathrm{q}}^{\mathrm{cen}}(M_{*})$, by combining the 3D quenched fraction distribution $f^{\mathrm{sat}}_{\mathrm{q}}(r; M_{*,\mathrm{cen}}, M_{*,\mathrm{sat}})$, reconstructed from the $\bar{n}_2w_{\mathrm{p}}(r_{\mathrm{p}})$ measurements, with the stellar mass-halo mass relation in N-body simulations from Paper IV, and the observed total quenched fraction, $\bar{f}_{\mathrm{q}}^{\mathrm{all}}(M_{*})$. Using $f^{\mathrm{sat}}_{\mathrm{q}}(r;M_{*,\mathrm{cen}},M_{*,\mathrm{sat}})$, $\bar{f}_{\mathrm{q}}^{\mathrm{cen}}(M_{*})$, and the galaxy-halo connection, we assign a quenched probability to each (sub)halo in the simulation, enabling a comprehensive study of galaxy quenching. We find that the mass-quenched fraction increases from 0.3 to 0.87 across the stellar mass range $[10^{9.5}, 10^{11.0}]M_{\odot}$, while the environmental quenched fraction decreases from 0.17 to 0.03. The mass effect dominates galaxy quenching across the entire stellar mass range we studied. Moreover, more massive host halos are more effective at quenching their satellite galaxies, while satellite stellar mass has minimal influence on environmental quenching.</description>

      <title>SpecDis: Value added distance catalogue for 4 million stars from DESI Year-1 data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02291v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the SpecDis value added stellar distance catalogue accompanying DESI DR1. SpecDis trains a feed-forward Neural Network (NN) on a large sample of stars with Gaia parallaxes, but without applying selections on parallax error or signal-to-noise (S/N) of the stellar spectra. We incorporate parallax error into the loss function for training. This approach ensures the training sample not suffering from biases. Moreover, SpecDis predicts the reciprocal of the square root of luminosity, which is linearly proportional to parallax and helps to avoid excluding negative parallaxes. To enhance the precision of distance predictions, we employ Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the noise and dimensionality of stellar spectra. Validated by independent external samples of member stars with precise distances from globular clusters, dwarf galaxies, and stellar streams, combined with BHB stars, we demonstrate that our distance measurements show no significant bias up to 100 kpc, and are much more precise than Gaia parallax beyond 7 kpc. The median distance uncertainties are 23 %, 19 %, 11 % and 7 % for S/N$&lt;$20, 20$\leq$S/N$&lt;$ 60, 60$\leq$ S/N $&lt;$ 100 and S/N$\geq$100. Selecting stars with $\log g&lt;3.8$ and distance uncertainties smaller than 25 %, we have more than 74,000 giant candidates within 50 kpc to the Galactic center and 1,500 candidates beyond this distance. Additionally, we develop a Gaussian mixture model to identify binaries and identify 120,000 possible binaries, and discover that the binary fraction increases with [Fe/H] and $\log g$ and declines with [$\alpha$/Fe] and $T_\mathrm{eff}$, indicating stars with low Fe and high $\alpha$, which form early, may have experienced more encounters and tidal effects to disrupt binaries. Our final catalogue provides distances and distance uncertainties for $&gt;$4 million stars, offering a valuable resource for Galactic astronomy.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the globular clusters of NGC1052-DF2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03404v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ultra-diffuse galaxy (UDG) NGC1052-DF2 has captured the interest of astronomers ever since the low velocity dispersion measured from ten globular clusters (GCs) suggested a low dark matter fraction. Also, its GC system was found to be unusually bright, with a GC luminosity function peak at least one magnitude brighter than expected for a galaxy at a distance of 20 Mpc. In this work we present an updated view of the GC system of NGC1052-DF2. We analysed archival MUSE data of NGC1052-DF2 to confirm the membership of four additional GCs based on their radial velocities, thereby raising the number of spectroscopically confirmed GCs to 16. We measured the ages and metallicities of 11 individual GCs, finding them to be old ($&gt; 9$ Gyr) and with a range of metallicities from [M/H] = $-0.7$ to $-1.8$ dex. The majority of GCs are found to be more metal-poor than the host galaxy, with some metal-rich GCs sharing the metallicity of the host ([M/H] = $-$1.09$^{+0.09}_{-0.07}$ dex). The host galaxy shows a flat age and metallicity gradient out to 1 $R_\text{e}$. Using a distance measurement based on the internal GC velocity dispersions ($D = 16.2$ Mpc), we derived photometric GC masses and find that the peak of the GC mass function compares well with that of the Milky Way. From updated GC velocities, we estimated the GC system velocity dispersion of NGC1052-DF2 with a simple kinematic model and find $\sigma_\text{GCS} = 14.86^{+3.89}_{-2.83}$ km s$^{-1}$. However, this value is reduced to $\sigma_\text{GCS} = 8.63^{+2.88}_{-2.14}$ km s$^{-1}$ when the GC that has the highest relative velocity based on a low S/N spectrum is considered an interloper. We discuss the possible origin of NGC1502-DF2, taking the lower distance, spread in GC metallicities, flat stellar population profiles, and dynamical mass estimate into consideration.</description>

      <title>Exploring the hardness of the ionizing radiation with the infrared softness diagram. II. Bimodal distributions in both the ionizing continuum slope and the excitation in active galactic nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09267v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: After exploring the infrared softness diagram to characterize the hardness of the incident ionizing radiation in star-forming regions, we exploit the availability of high-excitation lines in the same spectral regime to explore its use for studying the narrow-line regions in AGN. We adapted the IR softness diagram to consider very high-excitation lines, such as [Ne V] 14.3,24.3 $\mu$m or [O IV] 25.9$\mu$m. The measured emission-line ratios were included as inputs for the code HCm-Teff-IR, in order to provide a quantification for both the ionization and the $\alpha_{\rm OX}$ parameters. The latter is sensitive to the spectral shape of the incident continuum in AGN. We applied this to a large AGN sample including different spectral types with available Spitzer/IRS, Herschel/PACS and/or SOFIA/FIFI-LS mid-IR spectroscopic observations. The combination of the ([Ne II] 12.8 $\mu$m+[Ne III] 15.6$\mu$m)/[Ne V] 14.3$\mu$m and [O III] 52,88 $\mu$m/[O IV] 25.9$\mu$m emission line ratios is a robust proxy for the shape of the ionizing continuum in AGN. An alternative based on the [S III] 18.7 $\mu$m+[S IV] 10.5$\mu$m lines can be used instead. The inclusion of very high-excitation lines in HCm-Teff-IR, to derive both $\alpha_{\rm OX}$ and $U$ for the studied sample, points to a bimodal distribution of galaxies. One of the peaks is characterized by relatively harder values of $\alpha_{\rm OX}$ around -1.4 in combination with low values for log $U$ around -2.4, while the other peak shows a softer $\alpha_{\rm OX}$ around -1.7 and high values of log $U$ around-1.5. This result is consistent with the existence of two very marked AGN populations., one with a softer ionizing continuum, possibly dominated by a radiatively efficient accretion disk in bright Seyfert nuclei. In contrast, we observe a harder radiation field in low-luminosity AGN, where the accretion disk is expected to recede.</description>

      <title>ChemicalUniverseMachine I: Uncovering the Cosmic Evolution of Metals in the Galaxy-ISM-CGM Ecosystem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10999v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an empirical chemical evolution model that explains the distribution of metals in the interstellar medium (ISM) and the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of galaxies based on the UniverseMachine and NeutralUniverseMachine models in the framework of $\Lambda$CDM structure formation. We parameterize the fractions of outflowing metals returned and mixed into the multi-phase ISM of the star-forming regions ($f_{\rm H2}$) and into the neutral gas regions ($f_{\rm HI}$); metal production, transfer, and dilution are caused by star formation, galaxy mergers, and gas inflow from the inter-galactic medium, respectively, with rates determined by the (Neutral)UniverseMachine models. Using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm, we explore the posterior distributions of metal return and mixing consistent with observed mass-metallicity relations in HII regions (at $0&lt;z&lt;5$), HI damped Lyman-alpha systems (at $1&lt;z&lt;4$), and the CGM (at $z=0$). We find that the fraction of metals present in the ISM, $f_{\rm H2}+f_{\rm HI}$, increases with halo mass from $\sim20$\% at $10^{10}M_\odot$ to $\sim80$\% at $10^{13}M_\odot$. These fractions increase mildly at higher redshifts, to $\sim30$\% at $10^{10}M_\odot$ and $\sim80$\% at $10^{13}M_\odot$ at $z=5$. Interestingly, there is no significant redshift evolution of $f_{\rm H2}+f_{\rm HI}$ at fixed circular velocity, suggesting that metal distribution between the ISM and CGM is universally determined by the halo potential well depth. CGM metal enrichment is thus slow in high-$z$ halos with deep potential wells. While $f_{\rm H2}$ monotonically increases with halo mass, $f_{\rm HI}$ peaks at $\sim10^{12}-10^{13} M_\odot$, suggesting that reinfall may be inefficient in larger-mass halos.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04174v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern machine learning will allow for simulation-based inference from reionization-era 21cm observations at the Square Kilometre Array. Our framework combines a convolutional summary network and a conditional invertible network through a physics-inspired latent representation. It allows for an efficient and extremely fast determination of the posteriors of astrophysical and cosmological parameters, jointly with well-calibrated and on average unbiased summaries. The sensitivity to non-Gaussian information makes our method a promising alternative to the established power spectra.</description>

      <title>High-redshift, small-scale tests of ultralight axion dark matter using Hubble and Webb galaxy UV luminosities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11071v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We calculate the abundance of UV-bright galaxies in the presence of ultralight axion (ULA) dark matter (DM), finding that axions suppress their formation with a non-trivial dependence on redshift and luminosity. We set limits on axion DM using both Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) and UV luminosity function (UVLF) data. We exclude a single axion as all the DM for $m_{ax} &lt; 10^{-21.6}$ eV and limit axions with $-26 &lt; \log( m_{ax}/{eV}) &lt; -23$ to be less than $22\%$ of the DM (both limits at $95\%$ credibility). These limits use UVLF measurements from 24,000 sources from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) that probe small-scale structure at redshifts $4 &lt; z &lt; 10$. We marginalize over a parametric model that connects halo mass and UV luminosity that has been shown to match hydrodynamical simulations. Our results bridge a window in axion mass and DM fraction previously unconstrained by cosmological data, between large-scale CMB and galaxy clustering and the small-scale Lyman-$\alpha$ forest. These high-$z$ measurements provide a powerful consistency check of low-$z$ tests of axion DM, which include the recent hint for a sub-dominant ULA DM fraction in Lyman-$\alpha$ forest data. We also consider a sample of 25 spectroscopically-confirmed high-$z$ galaxies from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). We find that these data are consistent with the HST UVLF assuming $\Lambda$CDM and our flexible parametric model of UV luminosity. Combining HST and JWST UVLF data does not improve our constraints beyond HST alone, but future JWST measurements have the potential to improve these results significantly. We also find an excess of low-mass halos ($&lt; 10^9 M_\odot$) at $z &lt; 3$, which could be probed by sub-galactic structure probes (e.g., stellar streams, satellite galaxies and strong lensing).</description>

      <title>The Anomalous Acceleration of PSR J2043+1711: Long-Period Orbital Companion or Stellar Flyby?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06482v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Based on the rate of change of its orbital period, PSR J2043+1711 has a substantial peculiar acceleration of 3.5 $\pm$ 0.8 mm/s/yr, which deviates from the acceleration predicted by equilibrium Milky Way models at a $4\sigma$ level. The magnitude of the peculiar acceleration is too large to be explained by disequilibrium effects of the Milky Way interacting with orbiting dwarf galaxies ($\sim$1 mm/s/yr), and too small to be caused by period variations due to the pulsar being a redback. We identify and examine two plausible causes for the anomalous acceleration: a stellar flyby, and a long-period orbital companion. We identify a main-sequence star in \textit{Gaia} DR3 and Pan-STARRS DR2 with the correct mass, distance, and on-sky position to potentially explain the observed peculiar acceleration. However, the star and the pulsar system have substantially different proper motions, indicating that they are not gravitationally bound. However, it is possible that this is an unrelated star that just happens to be located near J2043+1711 along our line of sight (chance probability of 1.6\%). Therefore, we also constrain possible orbital parameters for a circumbinary companion in a hierarchical triple system with J2043+1711; the changes in the spindown rate of the pulsar are consistent with an outer object that has an orbital period of 80 kyr, a companion mass of 0.3 $M_\odot$ (indicative of a white dwarf or low-mass star), and a semi-major axis of 2000 AU. Continued timing and/or future faint optical observations of J2043+1711 may eventually allow us to differentiate between these scenarios.</description>

Abstract: The Aether Scalar Tensor (AeST) theory is an extension of general relativity(GR) successful at reproducing galactic rotational curves, gravitational lensing, linear large scale structure and cosmic microwave background power spectrum observations. We solve the most general static spherically symmetric vacuum equations in the strong-field regime of AeST and find two classes of stealth black hole solutions -- those with exact GR geometries -- containing non-trivial secondary hair. In particular, one of these can be continuously joined to the cosmological solution of AeST. We also derive a non-black hole solution with zero spatial component in the vector field. This result proves the existence of mathematically and observationally consistent candidates for black holes in AeST, and creates a basis for testing the theory in the strong-field regime.</description>

      <title>Limb-Brightened Jet in M87 from Anisotropic Nonthermal Electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14862v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Very long baseline interferometry observations reveal that relativistic jets like the one in M87 have a limb-brightened, double-edged structure. Analytic and numerical models struggle to reproduce this limb-brightening. We propose a model in which we invoke anisotropy in the distribution function of synchrotron-emitting nonthermal electrons such that electron velocities are preferentially directed parallel to magnetic field lines, as suggested by recent particle-in-cell simulations of electron acceleration and the effects of synchrotron cooling. We assume that the energy injected into nonthermal electrons is proportional to the jet Poynting flux, and we account for synchrotron cooling via a broken power-law energy distribution. We implement our emission model in both general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations and axisymmetric force-free electrodynamic (GRFFE) jet models and produce simulated jet images at multiple scales and frequencies using polarized general relativistic radiative transfer. We find that the synchrotron emission is concentrated parallel to the local helical magnetic field and that this feature produces limb-brightened jet images on scales ranging from tens of microarcseconds to hundreds of milliarcseconds in M87. We present theoretical predictions for horizon-scale M87 jet images at 230 and 345 GHz that can be tested with next generation instruments. Due to the scale-invariance of the GRMHD and GRFFE models, our emission prescription can be applied to other targets and serve as a foundation for a unified description of limb-brightened synchrotron images of extragalactic jets.</description>

      <title>A new mass estimate method with hydrodynamical atmospheres for very massive WNh stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14957v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Very massive stars with masses over 100 Msun are key objects in the Universe for our understanding of chemical and energetic feedback in the Universe, but their evolution and fate are almost entirely determined by their wind mass loss. We aim to determine the mass of the most massive star known in the Local Group R136a1. For this we compute the first hydrodynamically consistent non-local thermodynamical equilibrium atmosphere models for both R136a1 (WN5h) as well as the binary system R144 (WN5/6h+WN6/7h) in the Tarantula nebula. Using the Potsdam Wolf-Rayet code, we simultaneously empirically derive and theoretically predict mass-loss rates and wind velocities. By fitting synthetic spectra derived from these models to multi-wavelength observations, we constrain the stellar and wind properties of R144 and R136a1. We first determine the clumping stratification required by our hydro-models to fit the spectra of R144 by using the available dynamical mass estimates for the two components. We then utilise this clumping stratification in hydrodynamic models of R136a1 and estimate a mass of $M_\mathrm{Hydro}$ of 233 Msun. Remarkably, the estimated mass is close to and entirely consistent with chemical homogeneous mass relations. This present-day mass of 233 Msun provides a lower limit to the initial stellar mass, that could be far higher due to previous wind mass loss.</description>

Abstract: SN 2023ixf is one of the brightest Core Collapse Supernovae of the 21st century and offers a rare opportunity to investigate the late stage of a Supernova through nebular phase spectroscopy. We present four nebular phase spectra from day +291 to +413 after explosion. This is supplemented with high cadence early phase spectroscopic observations and photometry covering the first 500 days to investigate explosion parameters. The narrow and blue-shifted nebular Oxygen emission lines are used to infer an ejected Oxygen mass of $&lt;0.65M_\odot$, consistent with models of a relatively low mass ($M_{ZAMS}&lt;15M_\odot$) progenitor. An energy of 0.3 to $1.4 \times10^{51}$ erg and a light curve powered by an initial $^{56}$Ni mass of $0.049 \pm 0.005 M_\odot$ appear consistent with a relatively standard Type II explosion, while an incomplete $\gamma$-ray trapping (with timescale of $240\pm4$ days) suggests a lower ejecta mass. Assuming a typical explosion, the broad Hydrogen and Calcium profiles suggest a common origin within a lower mass, partially stripped envelope. Hydrogen emission broadens with time, indicating contribution from an additional power source at an extended distance; while the emergence of high velocity ($\sim$6,000 km s$^{-1}$) Hydrogen emission features (beginning around day +200) may be explained by Shock Interaction with a dense Hydrogen-rich region located at $\sim1.5 \times 10^{16}$cm. Such envelope mass loss for a low mass progenitor may be explained through theoretical models of Binary interaction.</description>
