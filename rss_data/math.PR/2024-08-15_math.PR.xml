      <title>Collision location for hard spheres in stationary regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider two balls with radius $r&gt;0$ whose centers are at a distance $2$, positioned symmetrically with respect to the origin in ${\mathbb{R}}^d$. Suppose that the initial velocities are independent standard normal vectors. When $r\to0$, the collision probability goes to 0 as $r^{d-1}$, and the asymptotic collision location distribution is a (defective) $t$-distribution. This distribution is rotationally symmetric about the origin for no apparent reason.</description>

      <title>Time correlations in the inverse-gamma polymer with flat initial condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temporal correlations in the KPZ universality class have gained significant attention, following the conjectures in [Ferr-Spoh'16]. Building on prior work in the zero temperature setting [Basu-Gang-Zhan'21], we address the time correlation problem with flat initial conditions in the positive temperature regime. Our study focuses on the inverse-gamma polymer, where we establish an upper bound for the correlation between two free energies whose endpoints are far apart in time. In contrast to the previous work [Basu-Gang-Zhan'21], our work not only extends the result to positive temperatures but also eliminates the reliance on integrable probability inputs related to the Airy process. This advancement allows us to address local scales, where the short time remains fixed while the large time grows arbitrarily, a scenario beyond the reach of the Airy scaling limit.</description>

      <title>Existence and Convergence of Interacting Particle Systems on Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a general existence and convergence result for interacting particle systems on locally finite graphs with possibly unbounded degrees or jump rates. We allow the local state space to be Polish, and the jumps at a site to affect the states of its neighbours. The two common assumptions on interacting particle systems are uniform bounds on degrees and jump rates. However, in this paper, we relax these assumptions and allow for vertices with high degrees or rapid jumps. We introduce new assumptions that ensure that such vertices are placed sufficiently apart from each other and hence the process does not explode. Our proofs use graphical construction involving an analysis of certain subsets of the set of all self-avoiding walks on the $2$-step graph of the underlying graph. For some random graph models, if the jump rates are bounded by powers of vertex degrees, we give readily verifiable sufficient conditions on the underlying graph itself, under which our assumptions hold almost surely. These conditions involve exponential growth of the average number of self-avoiding walks from each vertex and that of moments of the vertex degrees. Using these conditions, we show the existence of interacting particle systems like sandpile models on random graphs such as the long-range percolation model and the geometric random graph -- models which lack uniform bounds on degrees and jump rates.</description>

      <title>A Tamed Euler Scheme for SDEs with Non-Locally Integrable Drift Coefficient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we show that for SDEs with a drift coefficient that is non-locally integrable, one may define a tamed Euler scheme that converges in $L^p$ at rate $1/2$ to the true solution. The taming is required in this case since one cannot expect the regular Euler scheme to have finite moments in $L^p$. We additionally show that our setting applies to the case of two scalar valued particles with singular interaction kernel. To the best of the author's knowledge, this is the first work we are aware of to prove strong convergence of an Euler-type scheme in the case of non-locally integrable drift.</description>

      <title>Solutions and stochastic averaging for delay-path-dependent stochastic variational inequalities in infinite dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a very general stochastic variational inequality(SVI) having jumps, random coefficients, delay, and path dependence, in infinite dimensions. Well-posedness in terms of the existence and uniqueness of a solution is established, and a stochastic averaging principle on strong convergence of a time-explosion SVI to an averaged equation is obtained, both under non-Lipschitz conditions. We illustrate our results on general but concrete examples of finite dimension and infinite dimension respectively, which cover large classes of particle systems with electro-static repulsion, nonlinear stochastic partial differential equations with jumps, semilinear stochastic partial differential equations (especially stochastic reaction-diffusion equations) with delays, and others.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that interlacing triangular arrays, introduced by Aggarwal-Borodin-Wheeler to study certain probability measures, can be used to compute structure constants for multiplying Schubert classes in the $K$-theory of Grassmannians, in the cohomology of their cotangent bundles, and in the cohomology of partial flag varieties. Our results are achieved by establishing a splitting lemma, allowing for interlacing triangular arrays of high rank to be decomposed into arrays of lower rank, and by constructing a bijection between interlacing triangular arrays of rank 3 with certain proper vertex colorings of the triangular grid graph that factors through generalizations of Knutson-Tao puzzles. Along the way, we prove one enumerative conjecture of Aggarwal-Borodin-Wheeler and disprove another.</description>

      <title>Monotonicity in Quadratically Regularized Linear Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In optimal transport, quadratic regularization is a sparse alternative to entropic regularization: the solution measure tends to have small support. Computational experience suggests that the support decreases monotonically to the unregularized counterpart as the regularization parameter is relaxed. We find it useful to investigate this monotonicity more abstractly for linear programs over polytopes, regularized with the squared norm. Here, monotonicity can be stated as an invariance property of the curve mapping the regularization parameter to the solution: once the curve enters a face of the polytope, does it remain in that face forever? We show that this invariance is equivalent to a geometric property of the polytope, namely that each face contains the minimum norm point of its affine hull. Returning to the optimal transport problem and its associated Birkhoff polytope, we verify this property for low dimensions, but show that it fails for dimension $d\geq25$. As a consequence, the conjectured monotonicity of the support fails in general, even if experiments suggest that monotonicity holds for many cost matrices.</description>

      <title>Optimal control problems with generalized mean-field dynamics and viscosity solution to Master Bellman equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study an optimal control problem of generalized mean-field dynamics with open-loop controls, where the coefficients depend not only on the state processes and controls, but also on the joint law of them. The value function $V$ defined in a conventional way, but it does not satisfy the Dynamic Programming Principle (DPP for short). For this reason we introduce subtly a novel value function $\vartheta$, which is closely related to the original value function $V$, such that, a description of $\vartheta$, as a solution of a partial differential equation (PDE), also characterizes $V$. We establish the DPP for $\vartheta$. By using an intrinsic notion of viscosity solutions, initially introduced in Burzoni, Ignazio, Reppen and Soner [8] and specifically tailored to our framework, we show that the value function $\vartheta$ is a viscosity solution to a Master Bellman equation on a subset of Wasserstein space of probability measures. The uniqueness of viscosity solution is proved for coefficients which depend on the time and the joint law of the control process and the controlled process. Our approach is inspired by Buckdahn, Li, Peng and Rainer [7], and leads to a generalization of the mean-field PDE in [7] to a Master Bellman equation in the case of controls.</description>

      <title>Fluctuations in the non-linear supersymmetric hyperbolic sigma model with long-range interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a class of non-linear supersymmetric hyperbolic sigma models with long-range interactions on boxes in $\mathbb{Z}^d$ and on a hierarchical lattice. We prove that the random field associated to a marginal in horospherical coordinates has asymptotically arbitrarily small fluctuations for large enough interactions, uniformly in the size of the boxes. This can be viewed as a strong version of spontaneous breaking of the Lorentz boost symmetry.</description>

      <title>Incorporating Local Step-Size Adaptivity into the No-U-Turn Sampler using Gibbs Self Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adapting the step size locally in the no-U-turn sampler (NUTS) is challenging because the step-size and path-length tuning parameters are interdependent. The determination of an optimal path length requires a predefined step size, while the ideal step size must account for errors along the selected path. Ensuring reversibility further complicates this tuning problem. In this paper, we present a method for locally adapting the step size in NUTS that is an instance of the Gibbs self-tuning (GIST) framework. Our approach guarantees reversibility with an acceptance probability that depends exclusively on the conditional distribution of the step size. We validate our step-size-adaptive NUTS method on Neal's funnel density and a high-dimensional normal distribution, demonstrating its effectiveness in challenging scenarios.</description>

      <title>About the Hardy-Ramanujan partition function asymptotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Hardy-Ramanujan partition function asymptotics is a famous result in the asymptotics of combinatorial sequences. It was originally derived using complex analysis and number-theoretic ideas by Hardy and Ramanujan. It was later re-derived by Paul Erd\H{o}s using real analytic methods. Later still, D.J.~Newman used just the usual Hayman saddle-point approach, ubiquitous in asymptotic analysis. Fristedt introduced a probabilistic approach, which was further extended by Dan Romik, for restricted partition functions. Our perspective is that the Laplace transform changes the essentially algebraic generating function into an exponential form. Using this, we carry out the exercise of deriving the leading order asymptotics, following the Fristedt-Romik approach. We also give additional examples of the Laplace transform method.</description>

Abstract: Granville-Soundararajan, Harper-Nikeghbali-Radziwill, and Heap-Lindqvist independently established an asymptotic for the even natural moments of partial sums of random multiplicative functions defined over integers. Building on these works, we study the even natural moments of partial sums of Steinhaus random multiplicative functions defined over function fields. Using a combination of analytic arguments and combinatorial arguments, we obtain asymptotic expressions for all the even natural moments in the large field limit and large degree limit, as well as an exact expression for the fourth moment.</description>

Abstract: We study large deviations for random walks on stratified (Carnot) Lie groups. For such groups, there is a natural collection of vectors which generates their Lie algebra, and we consider random walks with increments in only these directions. Under certain constraints on the distribution of the increments, we prove a large deviation principle for these random walks with a natural rate function adapted to the sub-Riemannian geometry of these spaces.</description>

Abstract: The renewal contact process, introduced in $2019$ by Fontes, Marchetti, Mountford, and Vares, extends the Harris contact process in $\mathbb{Z}^d$ by allowing the possible cure times to be determined according to independent renewal processes (with some interarrival distribution $\mu$) and keeping the transmission times determined according to independent exponential times with a fixed rate $\lambda$. We investigate sufficient conditions on $\mu$ to have a process with a finite critical value $\lambda_c$ for any spatial dimension $d \geq 1$. In particular, we show that $\lambda_c$ is finite when $\mu$ is continuous with bounded support or when $\mu$ is absolutely continuous and has a decreasing hazard rate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.13400v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this short note, we establish Malliavin differentiability of McKean-Vlasov Stochastic Differential Equations (MV-SDEs) with drifts satisfying both a locally Lipschitz and a one-sided Lipschitz assumption, and where the diffusion coefficient is assumed to be uniformly Lipschitz in its variables.
  As a secondary contribution, we investigate how Malliavin differentiability transfers across the interacting particle system associated with the McKean-Vlasov equation to its limiting equation. This final result requires both spatial and measure differentiability of the coefficients and doubles as a standalone result of independent interest since the study of Malliavin derivatives of weakly interacting particle systems seems novel to the literature. The presentation is didactic and finishes with a discussion on mollification techniques for the Lions derivative.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.07373v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For algorithms based on interacting particle systems that admit a mean-field description, convergence analysis is often more accessible at the mean-field level. In order to transpose convergence results obtained at the mean-field level to the finite ensemble size setting, it is desirable to show that the particle dynamics converge in an appropriate sense to the corresponding mean-field dynamics. In this paper, we prove quantitative mean-field limit results for two related interacting particle systems: Consensus-Based Optimization and Consensus-Based Sampling. Our approach extends Sznitman's classical argument: in order to circumvent issues related to the lack of global Lipschitz continuity of the coefficients, we discard an event of small probability, the contribution of which is controlled using moment estimates for the particle systems.</description>

      <title>Reaction-diffusion equations with transport noise and critical superlinear diffusion: Global well-posedness of weakly dissipative systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.06897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.06897v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the global well-posedness of reaction-diffusion systems with transport noise on the $d$-dimensional torus. We show new global well-posedness results for a large class of scalar equations (e.g. the Allen-Cahn equation), and dissipative systems (e.g. equations in coagulation dynamics). Moreover, we prove global well-posedness for two weakly dissipative systems: Lotka-Volterra equations for $d\in\{1, 2, 3, 4\}$ and the Brusselator for $d\in \{1, 2, 3\}$. Many of the results are also new without transport noise. The proofs are based on maximal regularity techniques, positivity results, and sharp blow-up criteria developed in our recent works, combined with energy estimates based on It\^o's formula and stochastic Gronwall inequalities. Key novelties include the introduction of new $L^{\zeta}$-coercivity/dissipativity conditions and the development of an $L^p(L^q)$-framework for systems of reaction-diffusion equations, which are needed when treating dimensions $d\in \{2, 3\}$ in the case of cubic or higher order nonlinearities.</description>

      <title>Depth Degeneracy in Neural Networks: Vanishing Angles in Fully Connected ReLU Networks on Initialization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.09712v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite remarkable performance on a variety of tasks, many properties of deep neural networks are not yet theoretically understood. One such mystery is the depth degeneracy phenomenon: the deeper you make your network, the closer your network is to a constant function on initialization. In this paper, we examine the evolution of the angle between two inputs to a ReLU neural network as a function of the number of layers. By using combinatorial expansions, we find precise formulas for how fast this angle goes to zero as depth increases. These formulas capture microscopic fluctuations that are not visible in the popular framework of infinite width limits, and leads to qualitatively different predictions. We validate our theoretical results with Monte Carlo experiments and show that our results accurately approximate finite network behaviour. \review{We also empirically investigate how the depth degeneracy phenomenon can negatively impact training of real networks.} The formulas are given in terms of the mixed moments of correlated Gaussians passed through the ReLU function. We also find a surprising combinatorial connection between these mixed moments and the Bessel numbers that allows us to explicitly evaluate these moments.</description>

      <title>Small error algorithms for tropical group testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.07264v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a version of the classical group testing problem motivated by PCR testing for COVID-19. In the so-called tropical group testing model, the outcome of a test is the lowest cycle threshold (Ct) level of the individuals pooled within it, rather than a simple binary indicator variable. We introduce the tropical counterparts of three classical non-adaptive algorithms (COMP, DD and SCOMP), and analyse their behaviour through both simulations and bounds on error probabilities. By comparing the results of the tropical and classical algorithms, we gain insight into the extra information provided by learning the outcomes (Ct levels) of the tests. We show that in a limiting regime the tropical COMP algorithm requires as many tests as its classical counterpart, but that for sufficiently dense problems tropical DD can recover more information with fewer tests, and can be viewed as essentially optimal in certain regimes.</description>

      <title>A Conditional Extension of the Park-Pham Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17872v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neglecting many motivating details for the Park-Pham theorem (previously known as the Kahn-Kalai conjecture), the result starts with a finite set $X$, a non-trivial upper set $\mathcal{F} \subseteq 2^X$, and a particular parameterized family of random variables $X_p$, then proceeds to provide an upper bound on the value $p_c(\mathcal{F})$ such that $\mathbb{P}(X_{p_c(\mathcal{F})} \in \mathcal{F}) = 1/2$. A natural question to ask is if there is an analog to the Park-Pham theorem for upper sets in finite posets other than $2^X$ and other parameterized families of random variables taking values in them. In this short note, we show that there is, with minor adjustments, in at least one circumstance. This is done by producing a conditional version of the $\epsilon$-dependent form of the Park-Pham theorem, which has practical implications for the study of large neural networks and may also be interesting in its own right.</description>

      <title>Hoeffding and Bernstein inequalities for weighted sums of exchangeable random variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06457v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to establish Hoeffding and Bernstein type concentration inequalities for weighted sums of exchangeable random variables. A special case is the i.i.d. setting, where random variables are sampled independently from some distribution (and are therefore exchangeable). In contrast to the existing literature on this problem, our results provide a natural unified view of both the i.i.d. and the exchangeable setting.</description>

      <title>Poisson stability of solutions for stochastic evolution equations driven by fractional Brownian motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04313v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of Poisson stability of solutions for stochastic semi-linear evolution equation driven by fractional Brownian motion \mathrm{d} X(t)= \left( AX(t) + f(t, X(t)) \right) \mathrm{d}t + g\left(t, X(t)\right)\mathrm{d}B^H_{Q}(t), where A is an exponentially stable linear operator acting on a separable Hilbert space \mathbb{H}, coefficients f and g are Poisson stable in time, and B^H_Q (t) is a Q-cylindrical fBm with Hurst index H. First, we establish the existence and uniqueness of the solution for this equation. Then, we prove that under the condition where the functions f and g are sufficiently "small", the equation admits a solution that exhibits the same character of recurrence as f and g. The discussion is further extended to the asymptotic stability of these Poisson stable solutions. Finally, we include an example to validate our results.</description>
