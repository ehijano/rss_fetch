      <title>A counterexample to a conjecture by Salez and Youssef</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Remarkable progress has been made in recent years to establish log-Sobolev type inequalities under the assumption of discrete Ricci curvature bounds. More specfically, Salez and Youssef have proven that the log-Sobolev constant can be lower bounded by the Bakry Emery curvature lower bound divided by the logarithm of the sparsity parameter. They conjectured that the same holds true when replacing Bakry Emery by Ollivier curvature which is often times easier to compute in practice. In this paper, we show that this conjecture is wrong by giving a counter example on birth death chains of increasing length.</description>

      <title>Non-existance of minimizers for Fourth order Willmore energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a fourth-order Willmore-type problem for closed four-dimensional submanifolds immersed in $\mathbb{R}^n$ and establish a connected sum energy reduction for the general fourth-order Willmore energy, analogous to the seminal result of Bauer and Kuwert. Furthermore, we demonstrate the non-existence of minimizers for this Willmore-type problem-a striking departure from the geometric behavior observed in the classical Willmore setting.</description>

      <title>Approximating the Nonlocal Curvature of Planar Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we establish several results on the nonlocal curvature of planar curves. First we show how to express the nonlocal curvature of a curve relative to a point in terms of the nonlocal curvatures of simpler components of that curve relative to the same point. To obtain these results, it is necessary to extend the definition of nonlocal curvature to points off of the curve. We also find a formula for the nonlocal curvature of a line segment relative to any point in the plane in terms of the incomplete beta function. These results are then used to prove an approximation theorem, which states that the nonlocal curvature of a planar curve with some H\"older regularity can be approximated by the nonlocal curvature of a linear interpolating spline associated with the curve.</description>

      <title>Gap Theorem on locally conformally flat manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study a gap phenomenon in locally conformally flat Riemannian manifolds with non-negative Ricci curvature. We construct complete solutions to the Yamabe flow that exhibit instantaneous bounded curvature as they evolve. Using this, we demonstrate that if the curvature decays quickly enough in an integral sense, then the manifold must be flat. This partially generalizes the results of Chen-Zhu and Ma.</description>

      <title>The uniqueness of Poincar\'e type extremal K\"ahler metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $D$ be a smooth divisor on a closed K\"ahler manifold $X$. Suppose that $Aut_0(D)=\{Id\}$. We prove that the Poincar\'e type extremal K\"ahler metric with a cusp singularity at $D$ is unique up to a holomorphic transformation on $X$ that preserves $D$. This generalizes Berman-Berndtson's work on the uniqueness of extremal K\"ahler metrics from closed manifolds to some complete and noncompact manifolds.</description>

      <title>On the anisotropic partitioning problem in Euclidean convex domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the variational problem of minimizing an anisotropic perimeter functional under a volume constraint in a Euclidean convex domain. We extend to this setting analytical properties of the isoperimetric profile, topological features about the minimizers and sharp isoperimetric inequalities with respect to convex cones. Besides some geometric measure theory results about the existence and regularity of minimizers, the proofs rely on a second variation formula for the anisotropic area of hypersurfaces with non-empty boundary.</description>

      <title>Flat Hermitian Lie algebras are K\"ahler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1976, Milnor classified all Lie groups admitting a flat left-invariant metric. They form a special type of unimodular 2-step solvable groups. Considering Lie groups with Hermitian structure, namely, a left-invariant complex structure and a compatible left-invariant metric, in 2006, Barberis-Dotti-Fino obtained among other things full classification of all Lie groups with Hermitian structure that are K\"ahler and flat. In this note, we examine Lie groups with a Hermitian structure that are flat, and show that they actually must be K\"ahler, or equivalently speaking, a flat Hermitian Lie algebra is always K\"ahler. In the proofs we utilized analysis on the Hermitian geometry of 2-step solvable Lie groups developed by Freibert-Swann and by Chen and the second named author.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we obtain the Bossel-Daners inequality for the first eigenvalue of the p-Laplacian with Robin boundary conditions on complete Riemannian manifolds with lower Ricci curvature bounds. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the Bossel-Daners inequality extends to compact submanifolds within complete Riemannian manifolds characterized by positive asymptotic volume ratio and non-negative intermediate Ricci curvature.</description>

Abstract: The aim of this paper is to show that the fundamental group of any smooth complex algebraic variety cannot be realized as a lattice of any simply connected nilpotent Lie group whose Lie algebra is $p$-filiform Lie algebra such that neither abelian nor $2$-step nilpotent. Moreover, we provide a sufficient condition for a lattice in a simply connected nilpotent Lie group of dimension up to $6$ not to be isomorphic to the fundamental group of any smooth complex algebraic variety.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we compute the deformations of Clarke-Oliveira's instantons on the Bryant-Salamon $Spin(7)$-Manifold. The Bryant-Salamon $Spin(7)$-Manifold -- the negative spinor bundle of $S^4$ -- is an asymptotically conical manifold where the link is the squashed $7$-sphere. We use the deformation theory developed by the author in a previous paper to calculate the deformations of Clarke-Oliveira's instantons and calculate the virtual dimensions of the moduli spaces.</description>

      <title>Bondi Mass, Memory Effect And Balance Law of Polyhomogeneous Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spacetimes with metrics admitting an expansion in terms of a combination of powers of 1/r and ln r are known as polyhomogeneous spacetimes. The asymptotic behaviour of the Newman-Penrose quantities for these spacetimes is presented under certain gauges. The Bondi mass is revisited via the Iyer-Wald formalism. The memory effect of the gravitational radiation in the polyhomogeneous spacetimes is also discussed. It is found that the appearance of the logarithmic terms does not affect the balance law and it remains unchanged as the one of spacetimes with metrics admitting an expansion in terms of powers of 1/r.</description>

      <title>Spectral Networks and Betti Lagrangians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and develop the theory of spectral networks in real contact and symplectic topology. First, we establish the existence and pseudoholomorphic characterization of spectral networks for Lagrangian fillings in the cotangent bundle of a smooth surface. These are proven via analytic results on the adiabatic degeneration of Floer trajectories and the explicit computation of continuation strips. Second, we construct a Family Floer functor for Lagrangian fillings endowed with a spectral network and prove its equivalence to the non-abelianization functor. In particular, this implies that both the framed 2d-4d BPS states and the Gaiotto-Moore-Neitzke non-abelianized parallel transport are realized as part of the $A_\infty$-operations of the associated 4d partially wrapped Fukaya categories. To conclude, we present a new construction relating spectral networks and Lagrangian fillings using Demazure weaves, and show the precise relation between spectral networks and augmentations of the Legendrian contact dg-algebra.</description>

      <title>Proof of Chern conjecture for flat affine manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.04852</link>
      <description>arXiv:1504.04852v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove Chern's conjecture that the Euler characteristic vanishes for closed flat affine manifolds $(M,\nabla)$. The key innovation is a deformation argument for the Euler form: we construct a one-parameter family of connections $\nabla^t$ between $\nabla$ and a Levi-Civita connection, where each $\nabla^t$ is pointwise metric-compatible with respect to carefully chosen local metrics $h^{t,x} = (1-t)h^x + tg$. By lifting to $M \times [0,1]$ and exploiting the global metric-compatibility of the pullback connection $p^*\nabla^t$, we show via Stokes' theorem that the Chern-Weil integrand for $\chi(M)$ becomes exact. This approach, combined with a rigidity theorem for the associated holonomy groups (extending work of Cocos~\cite{MCocos}), forces $\chi(M) = 0$. </description>

      <title>Heat kernel and local index theorem for open complex manifolds with $\mathbb{C}^{\ast }$-action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11037v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a complex manifold $\Sigma $ with $\mathbb{C}^{\ast }$-action, we define the $m$-th $\mathbb{C}^{\ast }$ Fourier-Dolbeault cohomology group and consider the $m$-index on $\Sigma $. By applying the method of transversal heat kernel asymptotics, we obtain a local index formula for the $m$-index. We can reinterpret Kawasaki's Hirzebruch-Riemann-Roch formula for a compact complex orbifold with an orbifold holomorphic line bundle by our integral formulas over a (smooth) complex manifold and finitely many complex submanifolds arising from singular strata. We generalize $\mathbb{C}^{\ast }$-action to complex reductive Lie group $G$-action on a compact or noncompact complex manifold. Among others, we study the nonextendability of open group action and the space of all $G$-invariant holomorphic $p$-forms. Finally, in the case of two compatible holomorphic $\mathbb{C}^{\ast }$-actions, a mirror-type isomorphism is found between two linear spaces of holomorphic forms, and the Euler characteristic associated with these spaces can be computed by our $\mathbb{C}^{\ast }$ local index formula on the total space. In the perspective of the equivariant algebraic cobordism theory $\Omega _{\ast }^{\mathbb{C}^{\ast }}(\Sigma ),$ a speculative connection is remarked. Possible relevance to the recent development in physics and number theory is briefly mentioned.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23525v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article studies the deformation problem for compact special Lagrangians with boundary in a Calabi--Yau manifold, with each boundary component constrained along a given Lagrangian submanifold. The tangent vectors generating such deformations are identified with harmonic 1-forms vanishing on the boundary of the special Lagrangian, and the deformation generated by any such tangent vector is unobstructed. Consequently, the moduli space of special Lagrangians with boundary is a smooth manifold whose dimension equals the dimension of the first relative cohomology of the special Lagrangian.</description>

      <title>Bregman-Wasserstein divergence: geometry and applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.05833v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Bregman-Wasserstein divergence is the optimal transport cost when the underlying cost function is given by a Bregman divergence, and arises naturally in fields such as statistics and machine learning. We establish fundamental properties of the Bregman-Wasserstein divergence and propose a novel generalized transport geometry that promotes the Bregman geometry to the space of probability distributions. We provide a probabilistic interpretation involving exponential families and define generalized displacement interpolations compatible with the Bregman geometry. These interpolations are used to derive a generalized Pythagorean inequality, which is of independent interest. Furthermore, we construct a generalized dualistic geometry that lifts the differential geometry of the Bregman divergence to an infinite-dimensional statistical manifold. On the computational side, we demonstrate how Bregman-Wasserstein optimal transport maps can be estimated using neural approaches, establish the well-posedness of Bregman-Wasserstein barycenters, and relate them to Bayesian learning. Finally, we introduce the Bregman-Wasserstein JKO scheme for discretizing Riemannian Wasserstein gradient flows.</description>

Abstract: Let $M$ be a relatively compact $C^2$ domain in a complex manifold $\mathcal M$ of dimension $n$. Assume that $H^{1}(M,\Theta)=0$ where $\Theta$ is the sheaf of germs of holomorphic tangent fields of $M$. Suppose that the Levi-form of the boundary of $M$ has at least 3 negative eigenvalues or at least $n-1$ positive eigenvalues pointwise. We first construct a homotopy formula for $\Theta$-valued $(0,1)$-forms on $\overline M$. We then apply a Nash-Moser iteration scheme to show that if a formally integrable almost complex structure of the H\"{o}lder-Zygmund class $\Lambda^r$ on $\overline M$ is sufficiently close to the complex structure on $ M$ in the H\"{o}lder-Zygmund norm $\Lambda^{r_0}(\overline M)$ for some $r_0&gt;5/2$, then there is a diffeomorphism $F$ from $\overline M$ into $\mathcal M$ that transforms the almost complex structure into the complex structure on $F(M)$, where $F \in \Lambda^s(M)$ for all $s&lt;r+1/2$.</description>
