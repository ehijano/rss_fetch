      <title>Some stochastic process techniques applied to deterministic models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic mathematical models are essential tools for understanding and predicting complex phenomena. The purpose of this work is to study the exit times of a stochastic dynamical system-specifically, the mean exit time and the distribution of exit times of the stochastic process within a bounded domain. These quantities are obtained by solving elliptic and parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs), respectively. To support practical applications, we propose a numerical scheme implemented in FreeFEM, emphasizing its effectiveness in two- and three-dimensional cases due to the software's limitations in higher dimensions. The examples provided illustrate the theoretical results, which extend known one-dimensional solutions to higher-dimensional settings. This contribution bridges theoretical and computational approaches for analyzing stochastic processes in multidimensional domains, offering insights into their behavior and potential applications.</description>

      <title>A probabilistic look at the infinite hat-guessing game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we look at a hat-guessing game, in which each player must guess the color of their own hat while only seeing the hats of the other players. We focus on the case of two hat colors and a countably infinite number of players. By strategizing in advance, the players can, in some ways, do much better than random guessing; using the axiom of choice, they can in fact achieve highly counter-intuitive success. We review some of these results. Then, we use tools from probability to obtain bounds on how successful a strategy can be under a measurability hypothesis, in terms of the asymptotic density of the set of correctly guessing players. As we discuss, this illustrates that the full axiom of choice is truly necessary for the counter-intuitively successful strategies, and that there is a wide gap between what can be achieved with and without choice.</description>

      <title>Towards a Banach Space Chernoff Bound for Markov Chains via Chaining Arguments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\{Y_i\}_{i=1}^{\infty}$ be a stationary reversible Markov chain with state space $[N]$, let $(X, \| \cdot \|)$ be a real-valued Banach space and let $f_1, \ldots, f_n: [N] \rightarrow X$ be functions with mean $0$ such that $\|f_i(v)\| \leq 1$ for all $i$ and $v$. We prove bounds on the expected value of and deviation bounds for the random variable $\|f_1(Y_1)+\cdots+f_n(Y_n)\|$. For large enough $n$ that depends on the Banach space (and not $N$), these bounds behave similarly as known bounds for independent random variables. When the Banach space in question is the set of matrices equipped with the $\ell_2 \rightarrow \ell_2$ operator norm, for large enough $n$, our bounds on the expected value improve upon known bounds and match what is known for independent random variables up to a factor in the spectral gap.</description>

      <title>Strong solutions to singular SDEs and application to the Lennard-Jones potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove existence and uniqueness of strong solutions to a large class of autonomous stochastic differential equations on an open domain, where the drift exhibits a singular behaviour at the boundary. The main result involves a drift composed of the gradient of a singular potential and an additional possibly singular force. In order to achieve the well-posedness of the model, we employ a probabilistic regularization approach. Under suitable conditions, it is shown that the explosion time of the solution process is infinite. The result is finally applied to the case of an interacting particle system subject to a Lennard-Jones potential, which is singular at the origin.</description>

      <title>Quenching time and probability estimates for a stochastic reaction-diffusion system with coupled inner singular absorption terms driven by mixed noises</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates a stochastic parabolic system under Robin boundary conditions, for which the deterministic counterpart exhibits finite quenching. The stochastic system incorporates mixed noise, combining standard one-dimensional Brownian motion and fractional Brownian motion. Under appropriate assumptions, we derive explicit lower and upper bounds for the quenching time of the solution and establish the global existence of a weak solution. Leveraging Malliavin calculus, we further obtain a quantifiable lower and upper bound on the quenching probability. To complement the theoretical analysis, we design a numerical scheme tailored to the system and present results that validate the analytical predictions, offering insights into the interplay between noise and quenching behaviour.</description>

      <title>It\^{o}-Stratonovich Conversion in Infinite Dimensions for Unbounded, Time-Dependent, Nonlinear Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that a solution, in a variational framework, to the Stratonovich stochastic partial differential equation with noise $G\left(t, \Psi_t\right) \circ dW_t$ is given by a solution to the It\^{o} equation with It\^{o}-Stratonovich corrector $\frac{1}{2}\sum_{i=1}^\infty D_uG_i\left(t, \Psi_t\right)\left[G_i(t,\Psi_t)\right]dt$. Here $G_i$ denotes the action of $G$ on the $i^{th}$ component of the cylindrical noise, and $D_uG_i$ its Fr\'{e}chet partial derivative in the Hilbert space for which the It\^{o} form is satisfied. The noise operator $G$ may be time-dependent, nonlinear, and unbounded in the sense of differential operators; in the latter case, one must pass to a larger space in order to solve the Stratonovich equation. Our proof relies on martingale techniques, and the results apply to fluid equations with time-dependent and nonlinear transport noise.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing the Probability Measure of a Curie-Weiss Model Observing the Realisations of a Subset of Spins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of reconstructing the probability measure of the Curie-Weiss model from a sample of the voting behaviour of a subset of the population. While originally used to study phase transitions in statistical mechanics, the Curie-Weiss or mean-field model has been applied to study phenomena, where many agents interact with each other. It is useful to measure the degree of social cohesion in social groups, which manifests in the way the members of the group influence each others' decisions. In practice, statisticians often only have access to survey data from a representative subset of a population. As such, it is useful to provide methods to estimate social cohesion from such data. The estimators we study have some positive properties, such as consistency, asymptotic normality, and large deviation principles. The main advantages are that they require only a sample of votes belonging to a (possibly very small) subset of the population and have a low computational cost. Due to the wide application of models such as Curie-Weiss, these estimators are potentially useful in disciplines such as political science, sociology, automated voting, and preference aggregation.</description>

      <title>Phase Transitions in a Particle Model for the Self-Adaptive Response to Cancer Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a probabilistic analysis of a dynamical particle model for the self-adaptive immune response to cancer, as proposed by the first author in a previous work. The model is motivated by the interplay between immune surveillance and cancer evolution. We rigorously confirm the sharp phase transition in immune system learning predicted in the original work. Additionally, we compute the expected amount of information acquired by the immune system about cancer cells over time. Our analysis relies on time-reversal techniques.</description>

      <title>Bulk Universality for Sparse Complex non-Hermitian Random Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the local eigenvalue statistics in the bulk for complex random matrices with independent entries whose $r$-th absolute moment decays as $N^{-1-(r-2)\epsilon}$ for some $\epsilon&gt;0$ are universal. This includes sparse matrices whose entries are the product of a Bernouilli random variable with mean $N^{-1+\epsilon}$ and an independent complex-valued random variable. By a standard truncation argument, we can also conclude universality for complex random matrices with $4+\epsilon$ moments. The main ingredient is a sparse multi-resolvent local law for products involving any finite number of resolvents of the Hermitisation and deterministic $2N\times2N$ matrices whose $N\times N$ blocks are multiples of the identity.</description>

      <title>Fast Computation of Path Integrals of Killed Processes Using Confined Stochastic Bridges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Expectations of path integrals of killed stochastic processes play a central role in several applications across physics, chemistry, and finance. Simulation-based evaluation of these functionals is often biased and numerically expensive due to the need to explicitly approximate stochastic paths and the challenge of correctly modeling them in the neighborhood of the killing boundary. We consider It\^{o} processes killed at the boundary of some set in the $n$-dimensional space and introduce a novel stochastic method with negligible bias and lower computational cost to evaluate path integrals without simulated paths. Our approach draws a connection between stochastic bridges and killed processes to sample only exit times and locations instead of the full path. We apply it to a Wiener process killed in the $n$-ball and explicitly derive the density of the Brownian bridge confined to the $n$-ball for $n = 1, 2, 3$. Finally, we present two numerical examples that demonstrate the efficiency and negligible bias of the novel procedure compared to an evaluation using the standard Euler-Maruyama method.</description>

      <title>Diffusive behavior of transport noise on $\mathbb{S}^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate transport theoretically and numerically noise-induced diffusion in flows on the sphere. Previous analysis on the torus demonstrated that suitably chosen transport noise in the Euler equations leads to diffusive behavior resembling the Navier--Stokes equations. Here, we analyze dynamics on the sphere with noise-induced differential elliptic operator dissipation and characterize their energy and enstrophy decay properties. Through structure-preserving numerical simulations with the Zeitlin discretization, we demonstrate that appropriately scaled transport noise induces energy dissipation while preserving enstrophy and coadjoint orbits. The presented analysis lays a groundwork for further theoretical investigation of transport noise and supports the calibration of transport noise models as a parametrization for unresolved processes in geophysical fluid simulations.</description>

      <title>Cholesky decomposition for symmetric matrices, Riemannian geometry, and random matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For each $n \geq 1$ and sign pattern $\epsilon \in \{ \pm 1 \}^n$, we introduce a cone of real symmetric matrices $LPM_n(\epsilon)$: those with leading principal $k \times k$ minors of signs $\epsilon_k$. These cones are pairwise disjoint and their union $LPM_n$ is a dense cone in all symmetric matrices; they subsume positive and negative definite matrices, and symmetric (P-,) N-, PN-, almost P-, and almost N- matrices. We show that each $LPM_n$ matrix $A$ admits an uncountable family of Cholesky-type factorizations - yielding a unique lower triangular matrix $L$ with positive diagonals - with additional attractive properties: (i) each such factorization is algorithmic; and (ii) each such Cholesky map $A \mapsto L$ is a smooth diffeomorphism from $LPM_n(\epsilon)$ onto an open Euclidean ball.
  We then show that (iii) the (diffeomorphic) balls $LPM_n(\epsilon)$ are isometric Riemannian manifolds as well as isomorphic abelian Lie groups, each equipped with a translation-invariant Riemannian metric (and hence Riemannian means/barycentres). Moreover, (iv) this abelian metric group structure on each $LPM_n(\epsilon)$ - and hence the log-Cholesky metric on Cholesky space - yields an isometric isomorphism onto a finite-dimensional Euclidean space. The complex version of this also holds.
  In the latter part, we show that the abelian group $PD_n$ of positive definite matrices, with its bi-invariant log-Cholesky metric, is precisely the identity-component of a larger group with an alternate metric: the dense cone $LPM_n$. This also holds for Hermitian matrices over several subfields $\mathbb{F} \subseteq \mathbb{C}$. As a result, (v) the groups $LPM_n^{\mathbb{F}}$ and $LPM_\infty^{\mathbb{F}}$ admit a rich probability theory, and the cones $LPM_n(\epsilon), TPM_n(\epsilon)$ admit Wishart densities with signed Bartlett decompositions.</description>

      <title>Polynomial complexity sampling from multimodal distributions using Sequential Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a sequential Monte Carlo algorithm to sample from the Gibbs measure with a non-convex energy function at a low temperature. We use the practical and popular geometric annealing schedule, and use a Langevin diffusion at each temperature level. The Langevin diffusion only needs to run for a time that is long enough to ensure local mixing within energy valleys, which is much shorter than the time required for global mixing. Our main result shows convergence of Monte Carlo estimators with time complexity that, approximately, scales like the forth power of the inverse temperature, and the square of the inverse allowed error. We also study this algorithm in an illustrative model scenario where more explicit estimates can be given.</description>

      <title>Random Walks and the Meeting Time for Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider a random walk on a tree $G=(V,E)$. For $v,w \in V$, let the hitting time $H(v,w)$ denote the expected number of steps required for the random walk started at $v$ to reach $w$, and let $\pi_v = \mathrm{deg}(v)/2|E|$ denote the stationary distribution for the random walk. We characterize the extremal tree structures for the meeting time $T_{\mathrm{meet}}(G) = \max_{w \in V} \sum_{v \in V} \pi_v H(v,w)$. For fixed order $n$ and diameter $d$, the meeting time is maximized by the broom graph. The meeting time is minimized by the balanced double broom graph, or a slight variant, depending on the relative parities of $n$ and $d$.</description>

      <title>The asymptotic rank of adjacency matrices of weighted configuration models over arbitrary fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic rank of adjacency matrices of a large class of edge-weighted configuration models. Here, the weight of a (multi-)edge can be any fixed non-zero element from an arbitrary field, as long as it is independent of the (multi-)graph. Our main result demonstrates that the asymptotic behavior of the normalized rank of the adjacency matrix neither depends on the fixed edge-weights, nor on which field they are chosen from. Our approach relies on a novel adaptation of the component exploration method of \cite{janson2009new}, which enables the application of combinatorial techniques from \cite{coja2022rank, HofMul25}.</description>

      <title>Filtering and 1/3 Power Law for Optimal Time Discretisation in Numerical Integration of Stochastic Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the numerical integration of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) which govern diffusion processes driven by a standard Wiener process. With the latter being replaced by a sequence of increments at discrete moments of time, we revisit a filtering point of view on the approximate strong solution of the SDE as an estimate of the hidden system state whose conditional probability distribution is updated using a Bayesian approach and Brownian bridges over the intermediate time intervals. For a class of multivariable linear SDEs, where the numerical solution is organised as a Kalman filter, we investigate the fine-grid asymptotic behaviour of terminal and integral mean-square error functionals when the time discretisation is specified by a sufficiently smooth monotonic transformation of a uniform grid. This leads to constrained optimisation problems over the time discretisation profile, and their solutions reveal a 1/3 power law for the asymptotically optimal grid density functions. As a one-dimensional example, the results are illustrated for the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process.</description>

      <title>Integrable multispecies totally asymmetric stochastic interacting particle systems with homogeneous rates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study one dimensional stochastic particle systems with exclusion interaction that each site can be occupied by at most one particle, and homogeneous jumping rates. Alimohammadi and Ahmadi previously classified 28 Yang-Baxter integrable two-particle interaction rules for the two species models with homogeneous rates. In this work, we show that 7 of these 28 cases can be naturally extended to integrable models with an arbitrary number of species $N \geq 2$. Moreover, we discover new integrable models with one or two parameters that generalize these 7 cases. For 8 of the remaining 21 cases, we propose an alternative extension scheme that yields integrable $N$ species models.</description>

      <title>Temporal Exploration of Random Spanning Tree Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Temporal Graph Exploration problem (TEXP) takes as input a temporal graph, i.e., a sequence of graphs $(G_i)_{i\in \mathbb{N}}$ on the same vertex set, and asks for a walk of shortest length visiting all vertices, where the $i$-th step uses an edge from $G_i$. If each such $G_i$ is connected, then an exploration of length $n^2$ exists, and this is known to be the best possible up to a constant. More fine-grained lower and upper bounds have been obtained for restricted temporal graph classes, however, for several fundamental classes, a large gap persists between known bounds, and it remains unclear which properties of a temporal graph make it inherently difficult to explore.
  Motivated by this limited understanding and the central role of the Temporal Graph Exploration problem in temporal graph theory, we study the problem in a randomised setting. We introduce the Random Spanning Tree (RST) model, which consists of a set of $n$-vertex trees together with an arbitrary probability distribution $\mu$ over this set. A random temporal graph generated by the RST model is a sequence of independent samples drawn from $\mu$.
  We initiate a systematic study of the Temporal Graph Exploration problem in such random temporal graphs and establish tight general bounds on exploration time. Our first main result proves that any RST model can, with high probability (w.h.p.), be explored in $O(n^{3/2})$ time, and we show that this bound is tight up to a constant factor. This demonstrates a fundamental difference between the adversarial and random settings. Our second main result shows that if all trees of an RST are subgraphs of a fixed graph with $m$ edges then, w.h.p.\ , it can be explored in $O(m)$ time.</description>

Abstract: We study the long time statistics of a two-dimensional Hamiltonian system in the presence of Gaussian white noise. While the original dynamics is known to exhibit finite time explosion, we demonstrate that under the impact of the stochastic forcing as well as a deterministic perturbation, the solutions are exponentially attractive toward the unique invariant probability measure. This extends previously established results in which the system is shown to be noise-induced stable in the sense that the solutions are bounded in probability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05043v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the discrete Fokker-Planck equation associated with the mean-field dynamics of a particle system called the dispersion process. For different regimes of the average number of particles per site (denoted by $\mu &gt; 0$), we establish various quantitative long-time convergence guarantees toward the global equilibrium (depending on the sign of $\mu - 1$), which is also confirmed by numerical simulations. The main novelty/contribution of this manuscript lies in the careful and tricky analysis of a nonlinear Volterra-type integral equation satisfied by a key auxiliary function.</description>

      <title>Deformations of biorthogonal ensembles and universality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15830v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a large class of deformations of continuous and discrete biorthogonal ensembles and investigate their behavior in the limit of a large number of particles. We provide sufficient conditions to ensure that if a biorthogonal ensemble converges to a (universal) limiting process, then the deformed biorthogonal ensemble converges to a deformed version of the same limiting process. To construct the deformed version of the limiting process, we rely on a procedure of marking and conditioning. Our approach is based on an analysis of the probability generating functionals of the ensembles and is conceptually different from the traditional approach via correlation kernels. Thanks to this method, our sufficient conditions are rather mild and do not rely on much regularity of the original ensemble and of the deformation. As a consequence of our results, we obtain probabilistic interpretations of several Painlev\'e-type kernels that have been constructed in the literature, as deformations of classical sine and Airy point processes.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions for contact processes on one-dimensional networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16858v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the survival/extinction phase transition for contact processes with quenched disorder. The disorder is given by a locally finite random graph with vertices indexed by the integers that is assumed to be invariant under index shifts and augments the nearest-neighbour lattice by additional long-range edges. We provide sufficient conditions that imply the existence of a subcritical phase and therefore the non-triviality of the phase transition. Our results apply to instances of scale-free random geometric graphs with any integrable degree distribution. The present work complements previously developed techniques to establish the existence of a subcritical phase on Poisson--Gilbert graphs and Poisson--Delaunay triangulations (M\'enard et al., Ann. Sci. \'Ec. Norm. Sup\'er., 2016), on Galton--Watson trees (Bhamidi et al., Ann. Probab., 2021) and on locally tree-like random graphs (Nam et al., Trans. Am. Math. Soc., 2022), all of which require exponential decay of the degree distribution. Two applications of our approach are particularly noteworthy: Firstly, for Gilbert graphs derived from stationary point processes on $\mathbb{R}$ marked with i.i.d. random radii, our results are sharp. We show that there is a non-trivial phase transition if and only if the graph is locally finite. Secondly, for independent Bernoulli long-range percolation on $\mathbb{Z}$, with coupling constants $J_{x,y}\asymp |x-y|^{-\delta}$, we verify a conjecture of Can (Electron. Commun. Probab., 2015) stating the non-triviality of the phase transition whenever $\delta&gt;2$. We believe that the results are indicative of the behaviour of contact processes on spatial random graphs also in dimensions $d &gt; 1$ as long as the degree distribution of the underlying network has at least finite $d$-th moment. We support this by proving that no phase transition exists if the $d$-th moment is infinite.</description>

      <title>Cutoff for East models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05760v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the East model in $\mathbb Z^d$, an example of a kinetically constrained interacting particle system with oriented constraints, together with one of its natural variant. Under any ergodic boundary condition it is known that the mixing time of the chain in a box of side $L$ is $\Theta(L)$ for any $d\ge 1$. Moreover, with minimal boundary conditions and at low temperature, i.e. low equilibrium density of the facilitating vertices, the chain exhibits cutoff around the mixing time of the $d=1$ case. Here we extend this result to high equilibrium density of the facilitating vertices. As in the low density case, the key tool is to prove that the speed of infection propagation in the $(1,1,\dots,1)$ direction is larger than $d$ $\times$ the same speed along a coordinate direction. By borrowing a technique from first passage percolation, the proof links the result to the precise value of the critical probability of oriented (bond or site) percolation in $\mathbb Z^d$.</description>

      <title>Time multidimensional Markov Renewal chains -- An algebraic approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01891v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, a new extension of the Markov Renewal theory is introduced by allowing time to evolve in multiple dimensions. The resulting chains are referred to as multi-time Markov Renewal chains and since this extension is new, the state space is assumed to be finite to cover the theoretical framework of applications, where the possible number of states of a physical system is finite. The flexibility of Markov renewal theory is still present in multiple time dimensions by allowing the sojourn times in the different states of the system to be arbitrarily selected from a multidimensional distribution. The convolution product of multidimensional matrix sequences plays a particular role in the development of the theory and some of its algebraic properties are given and explored, paying particular attention to the existence, the representation and the computation of the convolutional inverse. Some basic definitions and properties of this new class are given as well as the multi-time Markov renewal equations associated to the resulting processes. The practical implementation is achieved very efficiently through a novel adaptation of the Gauss-Jordan algorithm for multidimensional matrix sequences.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.14545v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conformal dimension is a fundamental invariant of metric spaces, particularly suited to the study of self-similar spaces, such as spaces with an expanding self-covering (e.g. Julia sets of complex rational functions). The dynamics of these systems are encoded by the associated iterated monodromy groups, which are examples of contracting self-similar groups. Their amenability is a well-known open question. We show that if $G$ is an iterated monodromy group, and if the (Alfhors-regular) conformal dimension of the underlying space is strictly less than 2, then every symmetric random walk with finite second moment on $G$ has the Liouville property. As a corollary, every such group is amenable. This criterion applies to all examples of contracting groups previously known to be amenable, and to many new ones. In particular, it implies that for every sub-hyperbolic complex rational function $f$ whose Julia set is not the whole sphere, the iterated monodromy group of $f$ is amenable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09800v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a conformal field theory (CFT) description of the probabilistic model of boundary effects in the wired uniform spanning tree (UST) and its algebraic content, concerning the entire first row of the Kac table with central charge $c=-2$. Namely, we prove that all boundary-to-boundary connection probabilities for (potentially fused) branches in the wired UST converge in the scaling limit to explicit CFT quantities, expressed in terms of determinants, which can also be viewed as conformal blocks of degenerate primary fields in a boundary CFT with central charge $c=-2$.
  Moreover, we verify that the Belavin-Polyakov-Zamolodchikov (BPZ) PDEs (i.e., Virasoro degeneracies) of arbitrary orders hold, and we also reveal an underlying valenced Temperley-Lieb algebra action on the space of boundary correlation functions of primary fields in this model. To prove these results, we combine probabilistic techniques with representation theory.</description>

      <title>Telegrapher's Generative Model via Kac Flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20641v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We break the mold in flow-based generative modeling by proposing a new model based on the damped wave equation, also known as telegrapher's equation. Similar to the diffusion equation and Brownian motion, there is a Feynman-Kac type relation between the telegrapher's equation and the stochastic Kac process in 1D. The Kac flow evolves stepwise linearly in time, so that the probability flow is Lipschitz continuous in the Wasserstein distance and, in contrast to diffusion flows, the norm of the velocity is globally bounded. Furthermore, the Kac model has the diffusion model as its asymptotic limit. We extend these considerations to a multi-dimensional stochastic process which consists of independent 1D Kac processes in each spatial component. We show that this process gives rise to an absolutely continuous curve in the Wasserstein space and compute the conditional velocity field starting in a Dirac point analytically. Using the framework of flow matching, we train a neural network that approximates the velocity field and use it for sample generation. Our numerical experiments demonstrate the scalability of our approach, and show its advantages over diffusion models.</description>

      <title>On the Fourier transform of random Bernoulli convolutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21605v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate random Bernoulli convolutions, namely, probability measures given by the infinite convolution
  \[
  \mu_\omega = \mathop{\circledast}_{k=1}^{\infty} \left( \frac{\delta_0 + \delta_{\lambda_1 \lambda_2 \ldots \lambda_{k-1} \lambda_k}}{2} \right),
  \] where $\omega=(\lambda_k)$ is a sequence of i.i.d. random variables each following the uniform distribution on some fixed interval. We study the regularity of these measures and prove that when $\exp\mathbb{E}\left( \log \lambda_1\right)&gt;\frac{2}{\pi}, $ the Fourier transform $\widehat{\mu}_\omega$ is an $L^{1}$ function almost surely. This in turn implies that the corresponding random self-similar set supporting $\mu_{\omega}$ has non-empty interior almost surely. This improves upon a previous bound due to Peres, Simon and Solomyak. Furthermore, under no assumptions on the value of $\exp \mathbb{E}(\log \lambda_1), $ we prove that $\widehat \mu_\omega$ will decay to zero at a polynomial rate almost surely.</description>
