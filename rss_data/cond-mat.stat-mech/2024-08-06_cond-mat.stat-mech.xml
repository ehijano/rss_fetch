      <title>Self-similarity in partial differential equations and critical phenomena: renormalization group theory for interfacial hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01793v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-similar dynamics, often described by partial differential equations (PDEs) without noise terms, have been widely observed in nature and have attracted considerable attention from researchers in various fields, including physics, fluid mechanics, applied mathematics, and chemical engineering. The concept of universality class and the renormalization group (RG) theory, emerged from critical phenomena, which also have been widely observed in nature, are pillars of modern physics, with guiding the recent development of physics. While self-similarity appearing in fluid dynamics reminds physicists of critical phenomena, deep connections between them have not been explored. Here, we focus on a variation of a daily phenomenon, a drop falling from a faucet, and demonstrate self-similar dynamics for the shape of liquid-air interface in confined space with a scaling law for a characteristic length scale, which leads to a clear correspondence between the present self-similar dynamics and critical phenomena by identifying critical exponents, which define a universality class. We not only show that the observed master curve describing the self-similar shape is a solution to the Navier-Stokes equations, but also develop a renormalization group (RG) theory for the governing PDE to show the fixed point of RG corresponds to the solution, which becomes stable with time due to a scaling crossover. Our results will impact on our understanding of critical, scaling, and singular behaviors widely observed in nature.</description>

      <title>What will be the Euclidean dimension of an Ising ferromagnetic cubic shell?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The equilibrium and nonequilibrium properties of an Ising ferromagnetic cubic shell have been extensively studied by Monte Carlo simulation using Metropolis single spin flip algorithm. Although geometrically the Euclidean dimension of the cubical shell is three, interestingly, the Ising ferromagnetic cubic shell undergoes ferromagnetic phase transition at a temperature which is very close to that for two-dimensional Ising ferromagnet. Surprisingly, the Ising ferromagnetic cubic shell shows a strange (neither exponential nor stretched exponential) kind of relaxation behaviour, instead of exponential relaxation as usually observed in the two dimensional Ising ferromagnet. The metastable lifetime of a ferromagnetic Ising cubical shell is studied as a function of the applied magnetic field. Here also, the cubic shell behaves more likely a two-dimensional object as found from statistical analysis and comparison with Becker-D\"oring prediction of classical nucleation theory.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic hierarchical equations of motion and their application to Carnot engine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We developed a computer code for the thermodynamic hierarchical equations of motion (T-HEOM) derived from a spin subsystem coupled to multiple Drude baths at different temperatures, which are connected to or disconnected from the subsystem as a function of time. The code can simulate the reduced dynamics of the subsystem under isothermal, isentropic, thermostatic, and entropic conditions. The thermodynamic extensive and intensive variables were calculated as physical observables, and the Gibbs and Helmholtz energies were evaluated as intensive and extensive work. The contribution of energies from the system-bath interaction was evaluated separately from the subsystem using the hierarchical elements of T-HEOM. The accuracy of the calculated results for the equilibrium distribution and two-body correlation functions of the subsystem was verified by comparison with the results obtained from the time-convolution-less Redfield equation. Non-Markovian effects in thermostatic processes were investigated by sequentially turning on and off the baths of different temperatures with different switching times and system-bath coupling. As a demonstration, a comparison was made by simulating the case where the temperature of one bath was varied over time and the case where similar temperature changes were achieved by turning on and off the baths at different temperatures. In addition, the Carnot engine was simulated under quasi-static conditions. To analyze the work done for the subsystem in the cycle, thermodynamic work diagrams were plotted as functions of intensive and extensive variables. The C++ source codes are provided as supplementary material.</description>

      <title>Calculation of Some Integrals over Gaussian Measure with Nuclear Covariance Operator in Separable Hilbert Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The main purpose of this paper is to construct convergent series for the approximate calculation of certain integrals over the Gaussian measure with a nuclear covariance operator, nonlocal propagator, in separable Hilbert space. Such series arise, for example, in the model with the interaction Lagrangian $\sinh^{2(p+1)}\varphi$, where $p \in \mathbb{N}$ and $\varphi$ is the scalar field, although the problem can be solved in general form for a fairly wide class of Lagrangians: an even, strictly convex, continuous, non-negative function with a single zero value for $\varphi=0$ and for $|\varphi|\rightarrow +\infty$ growing faster than $\varphi^{2}$. We strictly define the scattering matrix, $\mathcal{S}$-matrix, at the zero value of the classical field, argument of the $\mathcal{S}$-matrix, of such a theory in terms of the corresponding integral, find the iterated expansion for the integrand (the Gaussian measure doesn't expand) over two orthonormal bases of functions, prove the validity of summation and integration interchange and thus find the expansion of the $\mathcal{S}$-matrix at the zero value of the classical field into the iterated series in powers of the interaction action. The individual terms of the resulting series have the form of a canonical partition function (CPF), and the methods of statistical physics are applicable to them. In particular, we express them in terms of Bell polynomials. It is important to note that such iterated series cannot be reduced to the perturbation theory (PT) series, since in the proposed model the latter diverges as $e^{n^{2}}$, where $n \in \mathbb {N}$ is the PT order. Along the way, we provide detailed mathematical background, including Beppo Levi's monotone convergence theorem (MCT) and Henri Lebesgue's dominated convergence theorem (DCT), without which the presented calculation would be significantly more complex.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic Feature of Quantum Many-Body Scar States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamical correlations of nonintegrable systems with quantum many-body scar (QMBS) states generated by a ladder operator. The spectral function of the ladder operator has an exact $\delta$-function peak induced by the QMBS states. As a concrete example, we show that in the one-dimensional (1D) spin-$1$ Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki model, the spectral function of two-magnon excitations exhibits a characteristic bow-tie shape composed of a $\delta$-function resonance peak at momentum $k=\pi$ and a continuum spectrum elsewhere. The two-magnon excitations can be observed with the resonant inelastic X-ray scattering spectroscopy on quasi-1D nickelates and other spin-$1$ antiferromagnetic materials, thus it paves the way to detecting the (approximate) QMBS states in realistic materials.</description>

      <title>Spin glass model of in-context learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models show a surprising in-context learning ability -- being able to use a prompt to form a prediction for a query, yet without additional training, in stark contrast to old-fashioned supervised learning. Providing a mechanistic interpretation and linking the empirical phenomenon to physics are thus challenging and remain unsolved. We study a simple yet expressive transformer with linear attention, and map this structure to a spin glass model with real-valued spins, where the couplings and fields explain the intrinsic disorder in data. The spin glass model explains how the weight parameters interact with each other during pre-training, and most importantly why an unseen function can be predicted by providing only a prompt yet without training. Our theory reveals that for single instance learning, increasing the task diversity leads to the emergence of the in-context learning, by allowing the Boltzmann distribution to converge to a unique correct solution of weight parameters. Therefore the pre-trained transformer displays a prediction power in a novel prompt setting. The proposed spin glass model thus establishes a foundation to understand the empirical success of large language models.</description>

      <title>Intermittent Run Motility of Bacteria in Gels Exhibits Power-Law Distributed Dwell Times</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While bacterial swimming has been well characterized in uniform liquid environments, only little is known about how bacteria propagate through complex environments, such as gel-like matrices or porous media that are typically encountered in tissue or soil. Here, we study swimming motility of the soil bacterium Pseudomonas putida (P. putida) in polysaccharide matrices formed by different concentrations of agar. P. putida cells display intermittent run-motility in the gel, where run times are exponentially distributed and intermittently occurring dwell times follow a waiting-time distribution with a power-law decay. An analysis of the turn angle distribution suggests that both, flagella mediated turning as well as mechanical trapping in the agar matrix play a role in the overall swimming pattern. Based on the experimentally observed motility pattern and measured waiting-time distributions, we propose a minimal active particle model which correctly describes the observed time dependence of the mean square displacement of the bacterial swimmers.</description>

      <title>Explosive neural networks via higher-order interactions in curved statistical manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Higher-order interactions underlie complex phenomena in systems such as biological and artificial neural networks, but their study is challenging due to the lack of tractable standard models. By leveraging the maximum entropy principle in curved statistical manifolds, here we introduce curved neural networks as a class of prototypical models for studying higher-order phenomena. Through exact mean-field descriptions, we show that these curved neural networks implement a self-regulating annealing process that can accelerate memory retrieval, leading to explosive order-disorder phase transitions with multi-stability and hysteresis effects. Moreover, by analytically exploring their memory capacity using the replica trick near ferromagnetic and spin-glass phase boundaries, we demonstrate that these networks enhance memory capacity over the classical associative-memory networks. Overall, the proposed framework provides parsimonious models amenable to analytical study, revealing novel higher-order phenomena in complex network systems.</description>

      <title>Magnetocaloric Effect of Topological Excitations in Kitaev Magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional magnetic sub-Kelvin cooling relies on the nearly free local moments in hydrate paramagnetic salts, whose utility is hampered by the dilute magnetic ions and low thermal conductivity. Here we propose to use instead fractional excitations inherent to quantum spin liquids (QSLs) as an alternative, which are sensitive to external fields and can induce a very distinctive magnetocaloric effect. With state-of-the-art tensor-network approach, we compute low-temperature properties of Kitaev honeycomb model. For the ferromagnetic case, strong demagnetization cooling effect is observed due to the nearly free $Z_2$ vortices via spin fractionalization, described by a paramagnetic equation of state with a renormalized Curie constant. For the antiferromagnetic Kitaev case, we uncover an intermediate-field gapless QSL phase with very large spin entropy, possibly due to the emergence of spinon Fermi surface. Potential realization of topological excitation cooling in Kitaev materials is also discussed, which may offer a promising pathway to circumvent existing limitations in the paramagnetic hydrates.</description>

      <title>Towards principles of brain network organization and function</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The brain is immensely complex, with diverse components and dynamic interactions building upon one another to orchestrate a wide range of functions and behaviors. Understanding patterns of these complex interactions and how they are coordinated to support collective neural activity and function is critical for parsing human and animal behavior, treating mental illness, and developing artificial intelligence. Rapid experimental advances in imaging, recording, and perturbing neural systems across various species now provide opportunities and challenges to distill underlying principles of brain organization and function. Here, we take stock of recent progresses and review methods used in the statistical analysis of brain networks, drawing from fields of statistical physics, network theory and information theory. Our discussion is organized by scale, starting with models of individual neurons and extending to large-scale networks mapped across brain regions. We then examine the organizing principles and constraints that shape the biological structure and function of neural circuits. Finally, we describe current opportunities aimed at improving models in light of recent developments and at bridging across scales to contribute to a better understanding of brain networks.</description>

      <title>Local ergotropy and its fluctuations across a dissipative quantum phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a two-qubit open Rabi model, focusing on local ergotropy - the maximum extractable work by acting solely on the two qubits - within a parameter regime where a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless dissipative phase transition occurs. First, we aim to define a protocol for charging, storing, and discharging the two-qubit system, interpreted as the working principle of an open quantum battery. Second, we examine the impact of the phase transition on ergotropy and identify potential markers. To achieve these goals, we construct an ad-hoc charging unitary operator, leveraging our knowledge of the ground state near the transition to bring it into a decoherence-free state during storage. Using advanced numerical techniques based on matrix product state representation, we reveal that high couplings to an external bath approximately double the local ergotropy immediately post-charging. Over time we observe oscillatory behaviors in ergotropy and its fluctuations, which undergo significant changes near the transition, signaling its occurrence. Furthermore, we optimize local ergotropy over time using a physically inspired ansatz, enabling continuous work extraction (local ergotropy never reaches zero). Our work proposes a tunable, experimentally realizable protocol for work extraction, leveraging decoherence-free states and phase transitions. Additionally, it sheds light on the complex interaction between ergotropy and quantum phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Unified Hierarchical Relationship Between Thermodynamic Tradeoff Relations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.01098v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent years have witnessed a surge of discoveries in the studies of thermodynamic inequalities: the thermodynamic uncertainty relation (TUR) and the entropic bound (EB) provide a lower bound on the entropy production (EP) in terms of nonequilibrium currents; the classical speed limit (CSL) expresses the lower bound on the EP using the geometry of probability distributions; the power-efficiency (PE) tradeoff dictates the maximum power achievable for a heat engine given the level of its thermal efficiency. In this study, we show that there exists a unified hierarchical structure encompassing all of these bounds, with the fundamental inequality given by a novel extension of the TUR (XTUR) that incorporates the most general range of current-like and state-dependent observables. By selecting more specific observables, the TUR and the EB follow from the XTUR, and the CSL and the PE tradeoff follow from the EB. Our derivations cover both Langevin and Markov jump systems, with the first proof of the EB for the Markov jump systems and a more generalized form of the CSL. We also present concrete examples of the EB for the Markov jump systems and the generalized CSL.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18531v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Universal scaling laws only apply asymptotically near critical phase transitions. We propose a general scheme, based on normal form theory of renormalization group flows, for incorporating corrections to scaling that quantitatively describe the entire neighboring phases. Expanding Onsager's exact solution of the 2D Ising model about the critical point, we identify a special coordinate with radius of convergence covering the entire physical temperature range, $0&lt;T&lt;\infty$. Without an exact solution, we demonstrate that using solely the critical singularity with low- and high-temperature expansions leads to exponentially converging approximations across all temperatures for both the 2D and 3D Ising free energies and the 3D magnetization. We discuss challenges and opportunities for future work.</description>

      <title>Optimal Control of Underdamped Systems: An Analytic Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00679v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optimal control theory deals with finding protocols to steer a system between assigned initial and final states, such that a trajectory-dependent cost function is minimized. The application of optimal control to stochastic systems is an open and challenging research frontier, with a spectrum of applications ranging from stochastic thermodynamics to biophysics and data science. Among these, the design of nanoscale electronic components motivates the study of underdamped dynamics.
  In this work, we develop analytic techniques to determine protocols steering finite time transitions at a minimum thermodynamic cost for stochastic underdamped dynamics. As cost functions, we consider two paradigmatic thermodynamic indicators. The first is the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the probability measure of the controlled process and that of a reference process. The corresponding optimization problem is the underdamped version of the Schr\"odinger diffusion problem that has been widely studied in the overdamped regime. The second is the mean entropy production during the transition, corresponding to the second law of modern stochastic thermodynamics. For transitions between Gaussian states, we show that optimal protocols satisfy a Lyapunov equation, a central tool in stability analysis of dynamical systems. For transitions between states described by general Maxwell-Boltzmann distributions, we introduce an infinite-dimensional version of the Poincar\'e-Linstedt multiscale perturbation theory around the overdamped limit. This technique fundamentally improves the standard multiscale expansion. Indeed, it enables the explicit computation of momentum cumulants, whose variation in time is a distinctive trait of underdamped dynamics and is directly accessible to experimental observation.</description>

      <title>Dynamical critical behavior on the Nishimori point of frustrated Ising models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06149v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By considering the quench dynamics of two-dimensional frustrated Ising models through numerical simulations, we investigate the dynamical critical behavior on the multicritical Nishimori point (NP). We calculate several dynamical critical exponents, namely, the relaxation exponent $z_{\rm c}$, the autocorrelation exponent $\lambda_{\rm c}$, and the persistence exponent $\theta_{\rm c}$, after a quench from the high temperature phase to the NP. We confirm their universality with respect to the lattice geometry and bond distribution. For a quench from a power-law correlated initial state to the NP, the aging dynamics are much slower. We also look up the issue of multifractality during the critical dynamics by investigating different moments of the spatial correlation function. We observe a single growth law for all the length scales extracted from different moments, indicating that the equilibrium multifractality at the NP does not affect the dynamics.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we study the stochastic thermodynamics of micro-magnetic systems. We first formulate the stochastic dynamics of micro-magnetic systems by incorporating noises into Landau-Lifshitz (LL) equation, which describes the irreversible and deterministic dynamics of magnetic moments. The resulting stochastic Landau-Lifshitz (sLL) equation obeys detailed balance, which guarantees that, with the external field fixed, the system converges to thermodynamic equilibrium with vanishing entropy production and with non-vanishing probability current. We then discuss various thermodynamic variables both at the trajectory level and at the ensemble level, and further establish both the first and the second laws of thermodynamics. Finally, we establish fluctuation theorems, and verify them using numerical simulations.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we study the stochastic dynamics of micro-magnetics interacting with a spin-current torque. We extend the previously constructed stochastic Landau-Lifshitz equation to the case with spin-current torque, and verify the conditions of detailed balance. Then we construct various thermodynamics quantities such as work and heat, and prove the second law of thermodynamics. Due to the existence of spin-torque and the asymmetry of the kinetic matrix, a novel effect of entropy pumping shows up. As a consequence, the system may behave as a heat engine which constantly transforms heat into magnetic work. Finally, we derive a fluctuation theorem for the joint probability density function of the pumped entropy and the total work, and verify it using numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Fading ergodicity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16773v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) represents a breakthrough in many-body physics since it allows to link thermalization of physical observables with the applicability of random matrix theory (RMT). Recent years were also extremely fruitful in exploring possible counterexamples to thermalization, ranging, among others, from integrability, single-particle chaos, many-body localization, many-body scars, to Hilbert-space fragmentation. In all these cases the conventional ETH is violated. However, it remains elusive how the conventional ETH breaks down when one approaches the boundaries of ergodicity, and whether the range of validity of the conventional ETH coincides with the validity of RMT-like spectral statistics. Here we bridge this gap and we introduce a scenario of the ETH breakdown in many-body quantum systems, dubbed fading ergodicity regime, which establishes a link between the conventional ETH and non-ergodic behavior. We conjecture this scenario to be relevant for the description of finite many-body systems at the boundaries of ergodicity, and we provide numerical and analytical arguments for its validity in the quantum sun model of ergodicity breaking phase transition. For the latter, we provide evidence that the breakdown of the conventional ETH is not associated with the breakdown of the RMT-like spectral statistics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17883v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the transition from trivial to non-trivial phases in a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model subjected to disorder in a quasi-periodic environment. We analytically determine the phase boundary, and characterize the localization of normal modes using their inverse participation ratio. We compute energy-dependent mobility edges and provide evidence for the emergence of a topological Anderson insulator within specific parameter ranges. Whereas the phase transition boundary is affected by the quasi-periodic modulation, the topologically insulating Anderson phase is stable with respect to the chiral disorder in a quasi-periodic setup. Additionally, our results also uncover a re-entrant topological phase transition from non-trivial to trivial phases for certain values of quasi-periodic modulation with fixed chiral disorder.</description>

      <title>Dephasing-assisted transport in a tight-binding chain with a linear potential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21715v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An environment interacting with a quantum system can enhance transport through the suppression of quantum effects responsible for localization. In this paper, we study the interplay between bulk dephasing and a linear potential in a boundary-driven tight-binding chain. A linear potential induces Wannier-Stark localization in the absence of noise, while dephasing induces diffusive transport in the absence of a tilt. We derive an approximate expression for the steady-state current as a function of both dephasing and tilt which closely matches the exact solution for a wide range of parameters. From it, we find that the maximum current occurs for a dephasing rate equal to the period of Bloch oscillations in the Wannier-Stark localized system. We also find that the current displays a maximum as a function of the system size, provided that the total potential tilt across the chain remains constant. Our results can be verified in current experimental platforms and represents a step forward in analytical studies of environment-assisted transport.</description>

      <title>Theory of elastic constants of athermal amorphous solids with internal stresses</title>

      <description>arXiv:1901.09582v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new microscopic derivation of the elastic constants of amorphous solids is presented within the framework of nonaffine lattice dynamics, which makes use of a perturbative form of the low-frequency eigenvectors of the dynamical matrix introduced in [V. Mazzacurati, G. Ruocco, M. Sampoli EPL 34, 681 (1996)]. The theory correctly recovers the shear modulus at jamming, $\mu \sim (z-2d)$, including prefactors in quantitative agreement with simulations. Furthermore, this framework allows us, for the first time, to include the effect of internal stresses. The theory shows that the Maxwell rigidity criterion $z=2d$ is violated with internal stress. In particular, $\mu \sim (z-2df)$ where $f&lt;1$ if the bonds are, on average, stretched, and the solid is thus rigid below the Maxwell isostatic limit, while $f&gt;1$ if the bonds are, on average, compressed. The coefficient $f$ is derived in analytical form and depends only on $d$ and on the average particle displacement from the interaction energy minimum.</description>

      <title>Broken Symmetries in Quasi-2D Charged Systems via Negative Dielectric Confinement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.04687v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) phenomena in symmetrically charged binary particle systems under planar nanoconfinement with negative dielectric constants.The SSB is triggered $solely$ via the dielectric confinement effect, without any external fields. The mechanism of SSB is found to be caused by the strong polarization field enhanced by nanoconfinement, giving rise to charge/field oscillations in the transverse directions. Interestingly, dielectric contrast can even determine the degree of SSB in transverse and longitudinal dimensions, forming charge-separated interfacial liquids and clusters on square lattices. Furthermore, we analytically show that the formed lattice constant is determined by the dielectric mismatch and the length scale of confinement, which is validated via molecular dynamics simulations. The novel broken symmetry mechanism may provide new insights in the study of quasi-2D systems and the design of future nanodevices.</description>

      <title>A Critical Edge Number Revealed for Phase Stabilities of Two-Dimensional Ball-Stick Polygons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.08305v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Phase behaviors of two-dimensional (2D) systems constitute a fundamental topic in condensed matter and statistical physics. Although hard polygons and interactive point-like particles are well studied, the phase behaviors of more realistic molecular systems considering intermolecular interaction and molecular shape remain elusive. Here we investigate by molecular dynamics simulation thermal stabilities of 2D ball-stick polygons, serving as simplified models for molecular systems. Below the melting temperature $T_{m}$, we identify a critical edge number $n_{c}$, at which a waving superlattice structure emerges; when n &lt; $n_{c}$,the triangular system stabilizes at a spin-ice-like glassy state; when n &gt; $n_{c}$,the polygons stabilize at crystalline states, and $T_{m}$ is higher for polygons with more edges at higher pressures but exhibits a crossover for hexagon and octagon at low pressures. A theoretical framework taking into account the competition between entropy and enthalpy is proposed to provide a comprehensive understanding of our results, which is anticipated to facilitate the design of 2D materials.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Debye scaling in the density of states of liquids under nanoconfinement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.11429v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the realm of nanoscience, the dynamic behaviors of liquids at scales beyond the conventional structural relaxation time, $\tau$, unfold a fascinating blend of solid-like characteristics, including the propagation of collective shear waves and the emergence of elasticity. However, in classical bulk liquids, where $\tau$ is typically of the order of 1 ps or less, this solid-like behavior remains elusive in the low-frequency region of the density of states (DOS). Here, we provide evidence for the emergent solid-like nature of liquids at short distances through inelastic neutron scattering measurements of the low-frequency DOS in liquid water and glycerol confined within graphene oxide membranes. In particular, upon increasing the strength of confinement, we observe a transition from a liquid-like DOS (linear in the frequency $\omega$) to a solid-like behavior (Debye law, $\sim\omega^2$) in the range of $1$-$4$ meV. Molecular dynamics simulations confirm these findings and reveal additional solid-like features, including propagating collective shear waves and a reduction in the self-diffusion constant. Finally, we show that the onset of solid-like dynamics is pushed towards low frequency along with the slowing-down of the relaxation processes upon confinement. This nanoconfinement-induced transition, aligning with k-gap theory, underscores the potential of leveraging liquid nanoconfinement in advancing nanoscale science and technology, building more connections between fluid dynamics and materials engineering.</description>

      <title>Ferromagnetic Haldane state and dimer multiplet state of quantum ferromagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.10287v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a theory of the realization of a ferromagnetic Haldane state in a spin-2 bilinear-biquadratic spin system on an orthogonal-dimer chain. The coexistence of a ferromagnetic state and a Haldane state is due to the rigorous correspondence between the eigenstates of a spin-2 model and a spin-1/2 Heisenberg model; i.e., "eigensystem embedding." Numerical exact-diagonalization calculations indicate that the ground state in the model is a fractionally magnetized M = 3/4 Haldane state. Moreover, a ferromagnetic-dimer multiplet state is an exact ground state on a lattice, where the direct product of dimer singlet states is the ground state in a spin-1/2 Heisenberg model that includes one-, two-, and three-dimensional orthogonal-dimer lattices. Eigensystem embedding demonstrates that a quantum ferromagnet can be obtained for an arbitrary spin S &gt;= 2 in any dimension and for any lattice in which anomalous ground states are realized in a spin-1/2 Heisenberg model.</description>

Abstract: Active matter systems - such as a collection of active colloidal particles - operate far from equilibrium with complex inter-particle interactions that govern their collective dynamics. Predicting the collective dynamics of such systems may aid the design of self-shaping structures comprised of active colloidal units with a prescribed dynamical function. Here, using simulations and theory, we study the collective dynamics of a chain consisting of active Brownian particles with internal interactions via trail-mediated chemicals, connected by harmonic springs in two dimensions to obtain design principles for active colloidal molecules. We show that two-dimensional confinement and chemo-repulsive interactions between the freely-jointed particles lead to an emergent rigidity of the chain in the steady-state dynamics. In the chemo-attractive regime, the chain collapses into crystals that abruptly halt their motion. Further, in a chain consisting of a binary mixture of monomers, we show that non-reciprocal chemical affinities between distinct species give rise to novel phenomena, such as chiral molecules with tunable dynamics, sustained undulatory gaits and reversal of the direction of motion. Our results suggest a novel interpretation of the role of trail-mediated interactions, in addition to providing active self-assembly principles arising due to non-reciprocal interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11360v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Notable attention has been devoted to the problem of thermalization of observables in isolated quantum setups by individual eigenstates. Here, we approach this issue from an open quantum system perspective, by considering isolated setups which consists of a small system coupled to a macroscopic bath. We argue that in such a case, even in fully integrable models, the system observables exhibit thermalization when the system-bath setup is in a typical eigenstate of its Hamiltonian (which is called weak eigenstate thermalization). This occurs unless thermalization is suppressed by localization due to strong coupling. We illustrate our claim for a single fermionic level coupled to a noninteracting fermionic bath. We further show that upon quenching the system Hamiltonian, the system occupancy typically relaxes to the thermal value corresponding to the new Hamiltonian. Finally, we demonstrate that system thermalization also arises for a system coupled to a bath initialized in a typical eigenstate of its Hamiltonian. Our findings suggest that chaos and nonintegrability are not the sole drivers of thermalization and complementary approaches are needed to offer a more comprehensive understanding of how statistical mechanics emerges.</description>

Abstract: Disordered hyperuniform structures are an exotic state of matter having suppressed density fluctuations at large length-scale similar to perfect crystals and quasicrystals but without any long range orientational order. In the past decade, an increasing number of non-equilibrium systems were found to have dynamic hyperuniform states, which have emerged as a new research direction coupling both non-equilibrium physics and hyperuniformity. Here we review the recent progress in understanding dynamic hyperuniform states found in various non-equilibrium systems, including the critical hyperuniformity in absorbing phase transitions, non-equilibrium hyperuniform fluids and the hyperuniform structures in phase separating systems via spinodal decomposition.</description>

Abstract: The initial phase of an epidemic is often characterized by an exponential increase in the number of infected individuals. In this Letter, we predict the exponential spreading rate of an epidemic on a complex network. We first find an expression of the reproduction number for a network, based on the degree distribution, the network assortativity, and the level of clustering. We then connect this reproduction number and the disease infectiousness to the spreading rate. Our result holds for a broad range of networks, apart from networks with very broad degree distribution, where no clear exponential regime is present. Our theory bridges the gap between classic epidemiology and the theory of complex network, with broad implications for model inference and policy making.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18434v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The shear viscosity is a fundamental transport property of matter. Here we derive a general theory of the viscosity of gases based on the relativistic Langevin equation (deduced from a relativistic Lagrangian) and nonaffine linear response theory. The proposed relativistic theory is able to recover the viscosity of non-relativistic classical gases, with all its key dependencies on mass, temperature, particle diameter and Boltzmann constant, in the limit of Lorentz factor $\gamma=1$. It also unveils the relativistic enhancement mechanism of viscosity. In the limit of ultrarelativistic fluids, the theory provides a new analytical formula which reproduces the cubic increase of viscosity with temperature in agreement with various estimates for hot dense matter and the QGP-type fluid.</description>

      <title>Studying the 3d Ising surface CFTs on the fuzzy sphere</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15914v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Boundaries not only are fundamental elements in nearly all realistic physical systems, but also greatly enrich the structure of quantum field theories. In this paper, we demonstrate that conformal field theory (CFT) with a boundary, known as surface CFT in three dimensions, can be studied with the setup of fuzzy sphere. We consider the example of surface criticality of the 3D Ising CFT. We propose two schemes by cutting a boundary in the orbital space or the real space to realise the ordinary and the normal surface CFTs on the fuzzy sphere. We obtain the operator spectra through state-operator correspondence. We observe integer spacing of the conformal multiplets, and thus provide direct evidence of conformal symmetry. We identify the ordinary surface primary $o$, the displacement operator $\mathrm{D}$ and their conformal descendants and extract their scaling dimensions. We also study the one-point and two-point correlation functions and extract the bulk-to-surface OPE coefficients, some of which are reported for the first time. In addition, using the overlap of the bulk CFT state and the polarised state, we calculate the boundary central charges of the 3D Ising surface CFTs non-perturbatively. Other conformal data obtained in this way also agrees with prior methods.</description>

      <title>Eigenstate Correlations in Dual-Unitary Quantum Circuits: Partial Spectral Form Factor</title>

Abstract: While the notion of quantum chaos is tied to random matrix spectral correlations, also eigenstate properties in chaotic systems are often assumed to be described by random matrix theory. Analytic insights into eigenstate correlations can be obtained by the recently introduced partial spectral form factor. Here, we study the partial spectral form factor in chaotic dual-unitary quantum circuits in the thermodynamic limit. We compute the latter for a finite subsystem in a brickwork circuit coupled to an infinite complement. For initial times, shorter than the subsystem's size, spatial locality and (dual) unitarity implies a constant partial spectral form factor, clearly deviating from the linear ramp of the random matrix prediction. In contrast, for larger times we prove, that the partial spectral form factor follows the random matrix result up to exponentially suppressed corrections. We supplement our exact analytical results by semi-analytic computations performed in the thermodynamic limit as well as with numerics for finite-size systems.</description>

      <title>Multiscalar Critical Models with Localised Cubic Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20326</link>

Abstract: Interface localised interactions are studied for multiscalar universality classes accessible with the perturbative $\varepsilon$ expansion in $4-\varepsilon$ dimensions. The associated beta functions at one loop and partially at two loops are derived, and a wide variety of interface conformal field theories (CFTs) is found, even in cases where the bulk universality class is free or as simple as the Wilson-Fisher description of the $O(N)$ model. For up to three scalar fields in the bulk, interface fixed points are classified for all bulk universality classes encountered in this case. Numerical results are obtained for interface CFTs that exist for larger numbers of multiscalar fields. Our analytic and numerical results indicate the existence of a vast space of interface CFTs, much larger than the space of defect CFTs found for line and surface defect deformations of multiscalar models in $4-\varepsilon$ dimensions. In this vast space, stable interfaces found for free and $O(N)$ bulks belong to the $F_4$ family, with global symmetries $SO(3), SU(3), Sp(6)$ and $F_4$, realised with $N=5,8,16,24$ scalar fields, respectively.</description>
