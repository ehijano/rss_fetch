      <title>Data-driven optimized high-order WENO schemes with low-dissipation and low-dispersion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical high-order weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) schemes are designed to achieve optimal convergence order for smooth solutions and to maintain non-oscillatory behaviors for discontinuities. However, their spectral properties are not optimal, which limits the ability to capture high-frequency waves and small-scale features. In this paper, we propose a data-driven optimized method to improve the spectral properties of the WENO schemes. By analyzing the approximate dispersion relation (ADR), the spectral error of the schemes can be bounded by the reconstructed errors of a series of trigonometric functions with different wavenumbers. Therefore, we propose the new schemes WENO5-JS/Z-NN that introduce a compensation term parameterized by a neural network to the weight function of the WENO5-JS/Z schemes. The neural network is trained such that the generated weights can minimize the reconstructed errors over a large number of spatial stencils, and furthermore, improve the spectral accuracy. Meanwhile, the Total Variation Diminishing (TVD) constraint and anti-dissipation penalization are incorporated into the loss function to enhance the shock-capturing capability and preserve stability in simulating high-frequency waves. Compared to WENO5-JS/Z, our schemes maintain the ability to capture discontinuities while providing higher resolution for fine-scale flow features. The ADR indicates that the new schemes can match the exact spectrum more accurately over a broader range of wavenumbers.</description>

      <title>On the usage of $2$-node lines in $n$-correct and $GC_n$ sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An $n$-correct set $\mathcal{X}$ in the plane is a set of nodes admitting unique
  interpolation with bivariate polynomials of total degree at most $n$. A $k$-node line is a line passing through exactly $k$ nodes of $\mathcal{X}.$ A line can pass through at most $n+1$ nodes of an $n$-correct set. An $(n+1)$-node line is called maximal line (C. de Boor, 2007). We say that a node $A\in\mathcal{X}$ uses a line $\ell,$ if $\ell$ is a factor of the fundamental polynomial of the node $A.$
  Let $\mathcal{X}$ be an $n$-correct set. One of the main problems we study in this paper is to determine the maximum possible number of used $2$-node lines that share a common node $B \in\mathcal{X}.$ We show that this number equals $n$. Moreover, if there are $n$ such $2$-node lines, then $\mathcal{X}$ contains exactly $n$ maximal lines not passing through the common node $B$. Furthermore, if $\mathcal{X}$ is $GC_n$ set, there exists an additional maximal line passing through $B$. Hence, in this case, $\mathcal{X}$ has $n+1$ maximal lines and is Carnicer~Gasca set of degree $n$. Note that Carnicer~Gasca sets of degree $n$ with a prescribed set of $n$ used $2$-node lines can be readily constructed.</description>

      <title>Surface Stokes Without Inf-Sup Condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a $d$-dimensional hypersurface of class $C^3$ without boundary, we reformulate the surface Stokes equations as a nonsymmetric indefinite elliptic problem governed by two Laplacians. We then use this elliptic reformulation as a basis for a numerical method based on lifted parametric FEM. Assuming no geometric error for simplicity, we prove its well-posedness, quasi-best approximation in a robust mesh-dependent $H^1$-norm for any polynomial degree, as well as an optimal $L^2$ error estimate for both velocity and pressure. This entails a sufficiently small mesh size that solely depends on the Weingarten map and circumvents the usual discrete inf-sup condition. We present numerical experiments for velocity-pressure pairs with equal and disparate polynomial degrees, demonstrating that the proposed method is both accurate and practical.</description>

      <title>A convergence proof for a finite element discretization of Chorin's projection method of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Chorin's projection method combined with a finite element spatial discretization for the time-dependent incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. The scheme advances the solution in two steps: a prediction step, which computes an intermediate velocity field that is generally not divergence-free, and a projection step, which enforces incompressibility by projecting this velocity onto the divergence-free subspace. We establish convergence, up to a subsequence, of the numerical approximations generated by this scheme to a Leray-Hopf weak solution of the Navier-Stokes equations, without any additional regularity assumptions beyond square-integrable initial data. A discrete energy inequality yields a priori estimates, which we combine with a new compactness result to prove precompactness of the approximations in $L^2([0,T]\times\Omega)$, where $[0,T]$ is the time interval and $\Omega$ is the spatial domain. Passing to the limit as the discretization parameters vanish, we obtain a weak solution of the Navier-Stokes equations. A central difficulty is that different a priori bounds are available for the intermediate and projected velocity fields; our compactness argument carefully integrates these estimates to complete the convergence proof.</description>

      <title>Stabilization of BiCGSTAB by the generalized residual cutting method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The residual cutting (RC) method has been proposed as an outer-inner loop iteration for efficiently solving large and sparse linear systems of equations arising in solving numerically problems of elliptic partial differential equations. Then based on RC the generalized residual cutting (GRC) method has been introduced, which can be applied to more general sparse linear systems problems. In this paper, we show that GRC can stabilize the BiCGSTAB, which is also an iterative algorithm for solving large, sparse, and nonsymmetric linear systems, and widely used in scientific computing and engineering simulations, due to its robustness. BiCGSTAB converges faster and more smoothly than the original BiCG method, by reducing irregular convergence behavior by stabilizing residuals. However, it sometimes fails to converge due to stagnation or breakdown. We attempt to emphasize its robustness by further stabililizing it by GRC, avoiding such failures.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we consider combined standard and machine learning methods to solve ODEs and PDEs. We deal with the minimisation problems for the machine learning algorithms and standard discretization methods, which are related to Runge-Kutta methods and finite difference methods. We show, that we could solve the ODEs with additional ML methods, e.g., feedforward network, such that it will accelerate the solver process.</description>

      <title>A stability-enhanced nonstandard finite difference framework for solving one and two-dimensional nonlocal differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Standard finite difference (SFD) schemes often suffer from limited stability regions, especially when applied in explicit setup to partial differential equations. To address this challenge, this study investigates the efficacy of nonstandard finite difference (NSFD) schemes in enhancing stability of explicit SFD schemes for 1D and 2D Caputo-type time-fractional diffusion equations (TFDEs). A nonstandard L1approximation is proposed for the Caputo fractional derivative, and its local truncation error is derived analytically. This nonstandard L1 formulation is used to construct the NSFD scheme for a Caputo-type time-fractional initial value problem. The absolute stability of the resulting scheme is rigorously examined using the boundary locus method, and its performance is validated through numerical simulations on test examples for various choices of denominator functions. Based on this framework, two explicit NSFD schemes are developed for 1D and 2D cases of the Caputo-type TFDE. Their stability is further assessed through the discrete energy method, with particular focus on the expansion of stability region relative to SFD schemes. The convergence of the proposed NSFD schemes is also established. Finally, a comprehensive set of numerical experiments is conducted to demonstrate the accuracy and stability advantages of proposed methods, with results presented through tables and graphical illustrations.</description>

      <title>A Cubed Sphere Fast Multipole Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13550v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work describes a new version of the Fast Multipole Method for summing pairwise particle interactions that arise from discretizing integral transforms and convolutions on the sphere. The kernel approximations use barycentric Lagrange interpolation on a quadtree composed of cubed sphere grid cells. The scheme is kernel-independent and requires kernel evaluations only at points on the sphere. Results are presented for the Poisson and biharmonic equations on the sphere, barotropic vorticity equation on a rotating sphere, and self-attraction and loading potential in tidal calculations. A tree code version is also described for comparison, and both schemes are tested in serial and parallel calculations.</description>

      <title>A kernel compression method for distributed-order fractional partial differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a kernel compression method for solving Distributed-Order (DO) Fractional Partial Differential Equations (DOFPDEs) at the cost of solving corresponding local-in-time PDEs. The key concepts are (1) discretization of the integral over the order of the fractional derivative and (2) approximation of linear combinations of integral kernels with exponential sums, expressing the non-local history term as a sum of auxiliary variables that solve a weakly coupled, local in time system of PDEs. For the second step, we introduce an improved algorithm that approximates the occurring integral kernels with double precision accuracy using only a moderate number (&lt;100) of exponential terms. After temporal discretization using implicit Runge--Kutta methods, we exploit the inherent structure of the PDE system to obtain the solution at each time step by solving a single PDE. At the same time, the auxiliary variables are computed by a linear update, not even requiring a matrix-vector multiplication. Choosing temporal meshes with a grading factor corresponding to the convergence order of the Runge--Kutta schemes, we achieve the optimal decay of the temporal discretization error. The flexibility and robustness of our numerical scheme are illustrated by recreating well-studied test cases and solving linear and nonlinear DOFPDEs in 2D and 3D with up to 40 million spatial degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>A convergent Fourier spectral Galerkin method for the fractional Camassa-Holm equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze a Fourier spectral Galerkin method for the fractional Camassa-Holm (fCH) equation involving a fractional Laplacian of exponent $\alpha \in [1,2]$ with periodic boundary conditions. The semi-discrete scheme preserves both mass and energy invariants of the fCH equation. For the fractional Benjamin-Bona-Mahony reduction, we establish existence and uniqueness of semi-discrete solutions and prove strong convergence to the unique solution in $ C^1([0, T];H^{\alpha}_{\mathrm{per}}(I))$ for given $T&gt;0$. For the general fCH equation, we demonstrate spectral accuracy in spatial discretization with optimal error estimates $\mathcal{O}(N^{-r})$ for initial data $u_0 \in H^r(I)$ with $r \geq \alpha + 2$ and exponential convergence $\mathcal{O}(e^{-cN})$ for smooth solutions. Numerical experiments validate orbital stability of solitary waves achieving optimal convergence, confirming theoretical findings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Investigation of the approximation properties, convergence, and stability of the ADER-DG method for solving an ODE system is carried out. The ADER-DG method generates a new implicit RK method, which is similar in its properties to the original ADER-DG method. The ADER-DG method has an approximation order $2N+1$ when using polynomials of degree $N$ for the numerical solution at grid nodes, and demonstrates superconvergence. The local solution obtained by the local DG predictor has an approximation order $N+1$ and has a subgrid resolution. The ADER-DG method is $A$- and $AN$-stable, $L$-stable, $B$- and $BN$-stable, and algebraically stable. Applications of the ADER-DG method demonstrated compliance with the expected theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Analysis-Aware Defeaturing of Dirichlet Features</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Feature removal from computational geometries, or defeaturing, is an integral part of industrial simulation pipelines. Defeaturing simplifies the otherwise costly or even impossible meshing process, speeds up the simulation, and lowers its memory footprint. Current defeaturing operators are often based on heuristic criteria and ignore the impact of the simplifications on the PDE solution. This work extends the mathematically rigorous framework developed by Buffa, Chanon, and V\'azquez (2022) to features subject to Dirichlet boundary conditions in Poisson problems. We derive a posteriori error estimators for negative features in the interior or on the boundary of the computational domain. The estimators' dependence on the feature size is explicit, and their evaluation only involves boundary integrals over the feature boundary. Numerical experiments in two and three dimensions showcase the validity and efficiency of the estimators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, a balancing domain decomposition by constraints (BDDC) algorithm is applied to the nonsymmetric positive definite linear system arising from the hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) discretization of an elliptic distributed optimal control problem. Convergence analysis for the BDDC preconditioned generalized minimal residual (GMRES) solver demonstrates that, when the subdomain size is small enough, the algorithm is robust with respect to the regularization parameter, and the number of iterations is independent of the number of subdomains and depends only slightly on the subdomain problem size. Numerical experiments are performed to confirm the theoretical results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with temporal convergence analysis of the recently introduced Dynamically Regularized Lagrange Multiplier (DRLM) method for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. A key feature of the DRLM approach is the incorporation of the kinetic energy evolution through a quadratic dynamic equation involving a time-dependent Lagrange multiplier and a regularization parameter. We apply the backward Euler method with an explicit treatment of the nonlinear convection term and show the unique solvability of the resulting first-order DRLM scheme. Optimal error estimates for the velocity and pressure are established based on a uniform bound on the Lagrange multiplier and mathematical induction. Numerical results confirm the theoretical convergence rates and error bounds that decay with respect to the regularization parameter.</description>

      <title>On Modeling and Solving the Boltzmann Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Boltzmann equation has been a driving force behind significant mathematical research over the years. Its challenging theoretical complexity, combined with a wide variety of current scientific and technological problems that require numerical simulations based on this model, justifies such interest. This work provides a brief overview of studies and advances related to the solution of the linear Boltzmann equation in one- and two-dimensional spatial dimensions. In particular, relevant aspects of the discrete ordinates approximation of the model are highlighted for neutron and photon transport applications, including nuclear safeguards, nuclear reactor shielding problems, and optical tomography. In addition, a short discussion on rarefied gas dynamics problems, which are relevant, for instance, in the studies of micro-electro-mechanical systems, and their connection with the linearized Boltzmann equation, is presented. A primary goal of the work is to establish as much as possible the connections between the different phenomena described by the model and the versatility of the analytical methodology, the ADO method, in providing concise and accurate solutions, which are fundamental for numerical simulations.</description>

Abstract: We generalize the $2$-tensor paraproduct decomposition result of arXiv:2503.12629 to $d$-tensors and expound on its caricatures. In particular, we show that for $A \in C^{d}, f \in \Lambda^{\alpha}([0,1]^d)$, $A(f)$ has an approximation $\tilde{A}(f) = (\sum_{\alpha=1}^d A^{\alpha}(P^{j_1,j_2, \ldots, j_d}(f)) \tilde{\mathbf{v}}^{\alpha}(f) ) $ for a fixed sequence of scales, $\mathbf{j} = (j_1, j_2, \ldots, j_d)$, and the series $\sum_{\alpha=1}^d A^{\alpha}(P^{j_1,j_2, \ldots, j_d}(f)) \tilde{\mathbf{v}}^{\alpha}(f) $ is a taylor expansion of $A$. Additionally, we show the sequence of operators $(\tilde{\mathbf{v}}^1(f),\tilde{\mathbf{v}}^2(f), \ldots, \tilde{\mathbf{v}}^d(f))$ form a basis for the subspace comprised of linear functionals of the form $A(f)$, and the residual, $\Delta(A,f) = \tilde{A}(f) - A(f) \in \Lambda^{2\alpha}([0,1]^d)$. Consequentially, we show one can obtain a Calderon-Zygmund type decomposition, $\Delta(A,f)_\lambda + \tilde{A}(f)_{\lambda}$ with the obtained paraproduct decomposition $A(f) = \Delta(A,f) + \tilde{A}(f)$. Our theoretical findings are supported by computational examples for d=2,3.</description>

      <title>GRAFT: Gradient-Aware Fast MaxVol Technique for Dynamic Data Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Training modern neural networks on large datasets is computationally and environmentally costly. We introduce GRAFT, a scalable in-training subset selection method that (i) extracts a low-rank feature representation for each batch, (ii) applies a Fast MaxVol sampler to select a small, diverse subset that spans the batch's dominant subspace, and (iii) dynamically adjusts the subset size using a gradient-approximation criterion. By operating in low-rank subspaces and training on carefully chosen examples instead of full batches, GRAFT preserves the training trajectory while reducing wall-clock time, energy consumption, and $\mathrm{CO}_2$ emissions. Across multiple benchmarks, GRAFT matches or exceeds recent selection baselines in both accuracy and efficiency, providing a favorable trade-off between accuracy, efficiency, and emissions.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Minnaert Resonances in High-contrast acoustic Structures and Applications to Invisibility Cloaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13659v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates a novel quasi-Minnaert resonance phenomenon in acoustic wave propagation through high-contrast medium in both two and three dimensions, occurring in the sub-wavelength regime. These media are characterized by physical properties significantly distinct from those of a homogeneous background. The quasi-Minnaert resonance is defined by two primary features: boundary localization, where the $L^2$-norms of the internal total field and the external scattered field exhibit pronounced concentration near the boundary, and surface resonance, marked by highly oscillatory behavior of the fields near the boundary. In contrast to classical Minnaert resonances, which are associated with a discrete spectral spectrum tied to physical parameters, quasi-Minnaert resonances exhibit analogous physical phenomena but with a continuous spectral spectrum. Using layer potential theory and rigorous asymptotic analysis, we demonstrate that the coupling between a high-contrast material structure, particularly with radial geometries, and a carefully designed incident wave is critical for inducing quasi-Minnaert resonances. Extensive numerical experiments, involving radial geometries (e.g., unit disks and spheres) and general-shaped geometries (e.g., hearts, Cassini ovals, and clovers in $\mathbb{R}^2$, and spheres in $\mathbb{R}^3$), validate the occurrence of these resonances. Furthermore, we numerically demonstrate that quasi-Minnaert resonances induce an invisibility cloaking effect in the high-contrast medium. These findings have significant implications for mathematical material science and the development of acoustic cloaking technologies.</description>

      <title>A Screw Approach to the Approximation of the Local Geometry of the Configuration Space and of the set of Configurations of Certain Rank of Lower Pair Linkages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A motion of a mechanism is a curve in its configuration space (c-space). Singularities of the c-space are kinematic singularities of the mechanism. Any mobility analysis of a particular mechanism amounts to investigating the c-space geometry at a given configuration. A higher-order analysis is necessary to determine the finite mobility. To this end, past research lead to approaches using higher-order time derivatives of loop closure constraints assuming (implicitly) that all possible motions are smooth. This continuity assumption limits the generality of these methods. In this paper an approach to the higher-order local mobility analysis of lower pair multi-loop linkages is presented. This is based on a higher-order Taylor series expansion of the geometric constraint mapping, for which a recursive algebraic expression in terms of joint screws is presented. An exhaustive local analysis includes analysis of the set of constraint singularities (configurations where the constraint Jacobian has certain corank). A local approximation of the set of configurations with certain rank is presented, along with an explicit expression for the differentials of Jacobian minors in terms of instantaneous joint screws. The c-space and the set of points of certain corank are therewith locally approximated by an algebraic variety determined algebraically from the mechanism's screw system. Results are shown for a simple planar 4-bar linkage, which exhibits a bifurcation singularity, and for a planar three-loop linkage exhibiting a cusp in c-space. The latter cannot be treated by the higher-order local analysis methods proposed in the literature.</description>

      <title>OpenLB-UQ: An Uncertainty Quantification Framework for Incompressible Fluid Flow Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is crucial in computational fluid dynamics to assess the reliability and robustness of simulations, given the uncertainties in input parameters. OpenLB is an open-source lattice Boltzmann method library designed for efficient and extensible simulations of complex fluid dynamics on high-performance computers. In this work, we leverage the efficiency of OpenLB for large-scale flow sampling with a dedicated and integrated UQ module. To this end, we focus on non-intrusive stochastic collocation methods based on generalized polynomial chaos and Monte Carlo sampling. The OpenLB-UQ framework is extensively validated in convergence tests with respect to statistical metrics and sample efficiency using selected benchmark cases, including two-dimensional Taylor--Green vortex flows with up to four-dimensional uncertainty and a flow past a cylinder. Our results confirm the expected convergence rates and show promising scalability, demonstrating robust statistical accuracy as well as computational efficiency. OpenLB-UQ enhances the capability of the OpenLB library, offering researchers a scalable framework for UQ in incompressible fluid flow simulations and beyond.</description>

      <title>Quantum Sampling and Moment Estimation for Transformed Gaussian Random Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a quantum algorithm for efficiently sampling transformed Gaussian random fields on $d$-dimensional domains, based on an enhanced version of the classical moving average method. Pointwise transformations enforcing boundedness are essential for using Gaussian random fields in quantum computation and arise naturally, for example, in modeling coefficient fields representing microstructures in partial differential equations. Generating this microstructure from its few statistical parameters directly on the quantum device bypasses the input bottleneck. Our method enables an efficient quantum representation of the resulting random field and prepares a quantum state approximating it to accuracy $\mathtt{tol} &gt; 0$ in time $\mathcal{O}(\operatorname{polylog} \mathtt{tol}^{-1})$. Combined with amplitude estimation and a quantum pseudorandom number generator, this leads to algorithms for estimating linear and nonlinear observables, including mixed and higher-order moments, with total complexity $\mathcal{O}(\mathtt{tol}^{-1} \operatorname{polylog} \mathtt{tol}^{-1})$. We illustrate the theoretical findings through numerical experiments on simulated quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Nearly Optimal Bounds on the Fourier sampling numbers of Besov Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb{T}^d$ denote the $d$-dimensional torus. We consider the problem of optimally recovering a target function $f^*:\mathbb{T}^d\rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ from samples of its Fourier coefficients. We make classical smoothness assumptions on $f^*$, specifically that $f^*$ lies in a Besov space $B^s_\infty(L_q)$ with $s &gt; 0$ and $1\leq q\leq \infty$, and measure recovery error in the $L_p$-norm with $1\leq p\leq \infty$. Abstractly, the optimal recovery error is characterized by a `restricted' version of the Gelfand widths, which we call the Fourier sampling numbers. Up to logarithmic factors, we determine the correct asymptotics of the Fourier sampling numbers in the regime $s/d &gt; 1 - 1/p$. We also give a description of nearly optimal Fourier measurements and recovery algorithms in each of these cases. In the other direction, we prove a novel lower bound showing that there is an asymptotic gap between the Fourier sampling numbers and the Gelfand widths when $q = 1$ and $p_0 &lt; p\leq 2$ with $p_0 \approx 1.535$. Finally, we discuss the practical implications of our results, which imply a sharper recovery of edges, and provide numerical results demonstrating this phenomenon.</description>

      <title>GDNSQ: Gradual Differentiable Noise Scale Quantization for Low-bit Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantized neural networks can be viewed as a chain of noisy channels, where rounding in each layer reduces capacity as bit-width shrinks; the floating-point (FP) checkpoint sets the maximum input rate. We track capacity dynamics as the average bit-width decreases and identify resulting quantization bottlenecks by casting fine-tuning as a smooth, constrained optimization problem. Our approach employs a fully differentiable Straight-Through Estimator (STE) with learnable bit-width, noise scale and clamp bounds, and enforces a target bit-width via an exterior-point penalty; mild metric smoothing (via distillation) stabilizes training. Despite its simplicity, the method attains competitive accuracy down to the extreme W1A1 setting while retaining the efficiency of STE.</description>

      <title>Finite Expression Method for Solving High-Dimensional Partial Differential Equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.10121v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Designing efficient and accurate numerical solvers for high-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs) remains a challenging and important topic in computational science and engineering, mainly due to the "curse of dimensionality" in designing numerical schemes that scale in dimension. This paper introduces a new methodology that seeks an approximate PDE solution in the space of functions with finitely many analytic expressions and, hence, this methodology is named the finite expression method (FEX). It is proved in approximation theory that FEX can avoid the curse of dimensionality. As a proof of concept, a deep reinforcement learning method is proposed to implement FEX for various high-dimensional PDEs in different dimensions, achieving high and even machine accuracy with a memory complexity polynomial in dimension and an amenable time complexity. An approximate solution with finite analytic expressions also provides interpretable insights into the ground truth PDE solution, which can further help to advance the understanding of physical systems and design postprocessing techniques for a refined solution.</description>

      <title>Breaking quadrature exactness: A spectral method for the Allen--Cahn equation on spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.04820v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel spectral method for the Allen-Cahn equation on spheres, eliminating the reliance on conventional quadrature exactness conditions. By replacing these conditions with a restricted isometry relation derived from Marcinkiewicz--Zygmund quadrature systems, our method achieves precise control over quadrature errors for polynomial integrands. This theoretical advancement enables the use of substantially more choices of quadrature points than classical spectral methods while maintaining rigorous error bounds. The proposed method requires only mild constraints on the polynomial degree of numerical solutions to establish both the maximum principle and energy stability, representing a considerable departure from existing techniques that depend on restrictive time stepping sizes, Lipschitz property of the nonlinear term, or $L^{\infty}$ boundedness of numerical solutions. Notably, our method permits time stepping sizes independent of the diffusion coefficient, making it suitable for long-time simulations. Inspired by the effective maximum principle proposed by Li (Ann. Appl. Math., 37(2): 131--290, 2021), we develop an almost sharp maximum principle that allows controllable deviation of numerical solutions from the sharp bound with large time stepping sizes. Furthermore, we prove that when the quadrature rule attains sufficient exactness, our method preserves energy stability and coincides mathematically with the Galerkin method. In addition, we propose an energy-stable mixed-quadrature scheme which works well even with randomly sampled initial condition data. Our numerical experiments on $\mathbb{S}^2$ validate the theoretical results about the energy stability and the almost sharp maximum principle.</description>

      <title>Stokes-Brinkman-Darcy models for fluid-porous systems: derivation, analysis and validation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16577v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Flow interaction between a plain-fluid region in contact with a porous layer attracted significant attention from modelling and analysis sides due to numerous applications in biology, environment and industry. In the most widely used coupled model, fluid flow is described by the Stokes equations in the free-flow domain and Darcy's law in the porous medium, and complemented by the appropriate interface conditions. However, traditional coupling concepts are restricted, with a few exceptions, to one-dimensional flows parallel to the fluid-porous interface. In this work, we use an alternative approach to model interaction between the plain-fluid domain and porous medium by considering a transition zone, and propose the full- and hybrid-dimensional Stokes-Brinkman-Darcy models. In the first case, the equi-dimensional Brinkman equations are considered in the transition region, and the appropriate interface conditions are set on the top and bottom of the transition zone. In the latter case, we perform a dimensional model reduction by averaging the Brinkman equations in the normal direction and using the proposed transmission conditions. The well-posedness of both coupled problems is proved, and some numerical simulations are carried out in order to validate the concepts.</description>

      <title>On the loss of orthogonality in low-synchronization variants of reorthogonalized block classical Gram-Schmidt</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10109v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interest in communication-avoiding orthogonalization schemes for high-performance computing has been growing recently. This manuscript addresses open questions about the numerical stability of various block classical Gram-Schmidt variants that have been proposed in the past few years. An abstract framework is employed, the flexibility of which allows for new rigorous bounds on the loss of orthogonality in these variants. We first analyze a generalization of (reorthogonalized) block classical Gram-Schmidt and show that a "strong" intrablock orthogonalization routine is only needed for the very first block in order to maintain orthogonality on the level of the unit roundoff. In particular, this ``strong" first step does not have to be a reorthogonalized QR itself and subsequent steps can use less stable QR variants, thus keeping the overall communication costs low.
  Then, using this variant, which has four synchronization points per block column, we remove the synchronization points one at a time and analyze how each alteration affects the stability of the resulting method. Our analysis shows that the variant requiring only one synchronization per block column cannot be guaranteed to be stable in practice, as stability begins to degrade with the first reduction of synchronization points.
  Our analysis of block methods also provides new theoretical results for the single-column case. In particular, it is proven that DCGS2 from [Bielich, D. et al. Par. Comput. 112 (2022)] and CGS-2 from [\'{S}wirydowicz, K. et al, Num. Lin. Alg. Appl. 28 (2021)] are as stable as Householder QR. Numerical examples from the BlockStab toolbox are included throughout, to help compare variants and illustrate the effects of different choices of intraorthogonalization subroutines.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07855v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces filtered finite difference methods for numerically solving a dispersive evolution equation with solutions that are highly oscillatory in both space and time. We consider a semiclassically scaled nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with highly oscillatory initial data in the form of a modulated plane wave. The proposed methods do not need to resolve high-frequency oscillations in both space and time by prohibitively fine grids as would be required by standard finite difference methods. The approach taken here modifies traditional finite difference methods by incorporating appropriate filters. Specifically, we propose the filtered leapfrog and filtered Crank--Nicolson methods, both of which achieve second-order accuracy with time steps and mesh sizes that are not restricted in magnitude by the small semiclassical parameter. Furthermore, the filtered Crank--Nicolson method conserves both the discrete mass and a discrete energy. Numerical experiments illustrate the theoretical results.</description>

Abstract: This paper addresses two significant drawbacks of an eddy viscosity turbulence model: the issue of excessive dissipation relative to energy input and the lack of a universal parameter specification. Considering the Baldwin-Lomax model with backscatter effects, we first prove the existence and uniqueness of global weak solutions under mild conditions. Our next result shows that this model maintains energy dissipation rates consistent with energy input, thereby avoiding over-dissipation and aligning with K41 phenomenology. Additionally, we propose a range for the model's parameters.</description>

      <title>A simple and general framework for the construction of exactly div-curl-grad compatible discontinuous Galerkin finite element schemes on unstructured simplex meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24131v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new family of discontinuous Galerkin (DG) finite element schemes for the discretization of first order systems of hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDE) on unstructured simplex meshes in two and three space dimensions that respect the two basic vector calculus identities exactly also at the discrete level, namely that the curl of the gradient is zero and that the divergence of the curl is zero. The key ingredient here is the construction of two compatible discrete nabla operators, a primary one and a dual one, both defined on general unstructured simplex meshes in multiple space dimensions. Our new schemes extend existing cell-centered finite volume methods based on corner fluxes to arbitrary high order of accuracy in space. An important feature of our new method is the fact that only two different discrete function spaces are needed to represent the numerical solution, and the choice of the appropriate function space for each variable is related to the origin and nature of the underlying PDE. The first class of variables is discretized at the aid of a discontinuous Galerkin approach, where the numerical solution is represented via piecewise polynomials of degree N and which are allowed to jump across element interfaces. This set of variables is related to those PDE which are mere consequences of the definitions, derived from some abstract scalar and vector potentials, and for which involutions like the divergence-free or the curl-free property must hold if satisfied by the initial data. The second class of variables is discretized via classical continuous Lagrange finite elements of approximation degree M=N+1 and is related to those PDE which can be derived as the Euler-Lagrange equations of an underlying variational principle.</description>

      <title>Residual weighted physics informed neural network for forward and inverse problems of low grade brain tumors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07058v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A low-grade tumor is a slow-growing tumor with a lower likelihood of spreading compared to high-grade tumors. Mathematical modeling using partial differential equations (PDEs) plays a crucial role in describing tumor behavior, growth, and progression. This study employs the Burgess and extended Fisher Kolmogorov equations to investigate the dynamics of low-grade brain tumors. We introduce a new method, termed the Residual Weighted Physics-Informed Neural Network (RW PINN), designed to enhance the accuracy of PINN-based algorithms. The proposed approach assigns a weight proportional to the PDE residual, scales it accordingly, and incorporates the weighted residual into the loss function to achieve more efficient and stable convergence. Using this novel RW PINN algorithm, we develop an automated numerical solver for these models and explore their application in solving forward and inverse problems in brain tumor dynamics. The study demonstrates that RW PINN based algorithms provide advanced methodologies for modeling brain tumor dynamics by integrating deep learning with physics-informed principles. Additionally, we establish generalized error bounds in terms of training and quadrature errors, and derive the convergence and stability of the neural network for both models. Numerical experiments confirm the accuracy and efficiency of the algorithms in nonlinear cases, and a statistical analysis of the results is presented. To further validate the effectiveness of our methodology, we also implemented PINN based forward and inverse frameworks for low-grade brain tumors and performed a comparative analysis with the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Shifted Gegenbauer Integral-Pseudospectral Method for Solving Time-Fractional Benjamin-Bona-Mahony-Burgers Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23099v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a high-order hybrid shifted Gegenbauer integral-pseudospectral (HSG-IPS) method for solving the time-fractional Benjamin-Bona-Mahony-Burgers (FBBMB) equation. A key innovation of our approach is the transformation of the original equation into a fractional partial-integro differential form that contains only a first-order derivative, which can be accurately approximated using a first-order shifted Gegenbauer differentiation matrix (SGDM), while all other terms in the transformed equation are resolved using highly accurate quadrature rules. The method combines several advanced numerical techniques including the shifted Gegenbauer pseudospectral (SGPS) method, Gegenbauer-based fractional approximation (GBFA), shifted Gegenbauer integration matrix (SGIM), shifted Gegenbauer integration row vector (SGIRV), and SGDM to achieve spectral accuracy. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the HSG-IPS method outperforms existing numerical approaches, achieving significantly lower average absolute errors (AAEs) with computational times as low as 0.04-0.05 seconds. The method's robustness is validated across various fractional orders, showing excellent agreement with analytical solutions. The transformation strategy effectively circumvents the numerical instability associated with direct approximation of high-order derivatives in the original equation, while the use of shifted Gegenbauer (SG) polynomials and barycentric representations ensures numerical stability and efficiency. This work provides a powerful computational framework for modeling wave propagation, dispersion, and nonlinearity in fractional calculus applications.</description>

      <title>Convergence of kinetic Langevin samplers for non-convex potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09992v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study three kinetic Langevin samplers including the Euler discretization, the BU and the UBU splitting scheme. We provide contraction results in $L^1$-Wasserstein distance for non-convex potentials. These results are based on a carefully tailored distance function and an appropriate coupling construction. Additionally, the error in the $L^1$-Wasserstein distance between the true target measure and the invariant measure of the discretization scheme is bounded. To get an $\varepsilon$-accuracy in $L^1$-Wasserstein distance, we show complexity guarantees of order $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{d}/\varepsilon)$ for the Euler scheme and $\mathcal{O}(d^{1/4}/\sqrt{\varepsilon})$ for the UBU scheme under appropriate assumptions on the target measure. The results are applicable to interacting particle systems and provide bounds for sampling probability measures of mean-field type.</description>

      <title>Solving Semi-Linear Elliptic Optimal Control Problems with $L^1$-Cost via Regularization and RAS-Preconditioned Newton Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00546v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new parallel computational framework for the efficient solution of a class of $L^2$/$L^1$-regularized optimal control problems governed by semi-linear elliptic partial differential equations (PDEs). The main difficulty in solving this type of problem is the nonlinearity and non-smoothness of the $L^1$-term in the cost functional, which we address by employing a combination of several tools. First, we approximate the non-differentiable projection operator appearing in the optimality system by an appropriately chosen regularized operator and establish convergence of the resulting system's solutions. Second, we apply a continuation strategy to control the regularization parameter to improve the behavior of (damped) Newton methods. Third, we combine Newton's method with a domain-decomposition-based nonlinear preconditioning, which improves its robustness properties and allows for parallelization. The efficiency of the proposed numerical framework is demonstrated by extensive numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Computing sessile droplet shapes on arbitrary surfaces with a new pairwise force smoothed particle hydrodynamics model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03810v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of the shape of droplets on surfaces is an important problem in the physics of fluids and has applications in multiple industries, from agrichemical spraying to microfluidic devices. Motivated by these real-world applications, computational predictions for droplet shapes on complex substrates -- rough and chemically heterogeneous surfaces -- are desired. Grid-based discretisations in axisymmetric coordinates form the basis of well-established numerical solution methods in this area, but when the problem is not axisymmetric, the shape of the contact line and the distribution of the contact angle around it are unknown. Recently, particle methods, such as pairwise force smoothed particle hydrodynamics (PF-SPH), have been used to conveniently forego explicit enforcement of the contact angle. The pairwise force model, however, is far from mature, and there is no consensus in the literature on the choice of pairwise force profile. We propose a new pair of polynomial force profiles with a simple motivation and validate the PF-SPH model in both static and dynamic tests. We demonstrate its capabilities by computing droplet shapes on a physically structured surface, a surface with a hydrophilic stripe, and a virtual wheat leaf with both micro-scale roughness and variable wettability. We anticipate that this model can be extended to dynamic scenarios, such as droplet spreading or impaction, in the future.</description>
