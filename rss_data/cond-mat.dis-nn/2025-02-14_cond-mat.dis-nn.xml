      <title>Memorization and Generalization in Generative Diffusion under the Manifold Hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the memorization and generalization capabilities of a Diffusion Model (DM) in the case of structured data defined on a latent manifold. We specifically consider a set of $P$ mono-modal data points in $N$ dimensions lying on a latent subspace of dimension $D = \alpha_D N$, according to the Hidden Manifold Model (HMM). Our analysis leverages the recently introduced formalism based on the statistical physics of the Random Energy Model (REM). We provide evidence for the existence of an onset time $t_{o} &gt; t_c$ when traps appear in the potential without affecting the typical diffusive trajectory. The size of the basins of attraction of such traps is computed as a function of time. Moreover, we derive the collapse time $t_{c}$ at which trajectories fall in the basin of one of the training points, implying memorization. An explicit formula for $t_c$ is given as a function of $P$ and the ratio $\alpha_D$, proving that the curse of dimensionality issue does not hold for highly structured data, i.e. $\alpha_D\ll 1$, regardless of the non-linearity of the manifold surface. We also prove that collapse coincides with the condensation transition in the REM. Eventually, the degree of generalization of DMs is formulated in terms of the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the exact and the empirical distribution of the sampled configurations: we show the existence of an additional time $t_{g}&lt;t_{c}&lt;t_{o}$ such that the distance between the empirical measure of the data and the ground-truth is minimal. Counter-intuitively, the best generalization performance is found within the memorization phase of the model. We conclude that the generalization performance of DMs benefit from highly structured data since $t_g$ approaches zero faster than $t_c$ when $\alpha_D \rightarrow 0$.</description>

      <title>Superspin Renormalization and Slow Relaxation in Random Spin Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop an excited-state real-space renormalization group (RSRG-X) formalism to describe the dynamics of conserved densities in randomly interacting spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ systems. Our formalism is suitable for systems with $\textrm{U}(1)$ and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetries, and we apply it to chains of randomly positioned spins with dipolar $XX+YY$ interactions, as arise in Rydberg quantum simulators and other platforms. The formalism generates a sequence of effective Hamiltonians which provide approximate descriptions for dynamics on successively smaller energy scales. These effective Hamiltonians involve ``superspins'': two-level collective degrees of freedom constructed from (anti)aligned microscopic spins. Conserved densities can then be understood as relaxing via coherent collective spin flips. For the well-studied simpler case of randomly interacting nearest-neighbor $XX+YY$ chains, the superspins reduce to single spins. Our formalism also leads to a numerical method capable of simulating the dynamics up to an otherwise inaccessible combination of large system size and late time. Focusing on disorder-averaged infinite-temperature autocorrelation functions, in particular the local spin survival probability $\overline{S_p}(t)$, we demonstrate quantitative agreement in results between our algorithm and exact diagonalization (ED) at low but nonzero frequencies. Such agreement holds for chains with nearest-neighbor, next-nearest-neighbor, and long-range dipolar interactions. Our results indicate decay of $\overline{S_p}(t)$ slower than any power law and feature no significant deviation from the $\sim 1/ \log^2(t)$ asymptote expected from the infinite-randomness fixed-point of the nearest-neighbor model. We also apply the RSRG-X formalism to two-dimensional long-range systems of moderate size and find slow late-time decay of $\overline{S_p}(t)$.</description>

      <title>Machine-Learning Detection of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition is a typical topological phase transition defined between binding and unbinding states of vortices and antivortices, which is not accompanied by spontaneous symmetry breaking. It is known that the BKT transition is difficult to detect from thermodynamic quantities such as specific heat and magnetic susceptibility because of the absence of anomaly in free energy and significant finite-size effects. Therefore, methods based on statistical mechanics which are commonly used to discuss phase transitions cannot be easily applied to the BKT transition. In recent years, several attempts to detect the BKT transition using machine-learning methods based on image recognition techniques have been reported. However, it has turned out that the detection is difficult even for machine learning methods because of the absence of trivial order parameters and symmetry breaking. Most of the methods proposed so far require prior knowledge about the models and/or preprocessing of input data for feature engineering, which is problematic in terms of the general applicability. In this article, we introduce recent development of the machine-learning methods to detect the BKT transitions in several spin models. Specifically, we demonstrate the success of two new methods named temperature-identification method and phase-classification method for detecting the BKT transitions in the q-state clock model and the XXZ model. This progress is expected to sublimate the machine-learning-based study of spin models for exploring new physics beyond simple benchmark test.</description>

      <title>The quest for new materials: the network theory and machine learning perspectives</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding and predicting the emergence of novel materials is a fundamental challenge in condensed matter physics, materials science and technology. With the rapid growth of materials databases in both size and reliability, the challenge shifts from data collection to efficient exploration of this vast and complex space. A key strategy lies in a smart use of descriptors at multiple scales, ranging from atomic arrangements to macroscopic properties, to represent materials in high-dimensional abstract spaces. Network theory provides a powerful framework to structure and analyze these relationships, capturing hidden patterns and guiding discovery. Machine Learning complements this approach by enabling predictive modeling, dimensionality reduction, and the identification of promising material candidates. By integrating network-based methods with Machine Learning techniques, researchers can construct, analyze, and efficiently navigate the material space, uncovering novel materials with tailored properties. This review explores the synergy between network theory and ML, highlighting their role in accelerating materials discovery through a systematic and interpretable approach.</description>

      <title>Foundation Neural-Network Quantum States</title>

Abstract: Foundation models are highly versatile neural-network architectures capable of processing different data types, such as text and images, and generalizing across various tasks like classification and generation. Inspired by this success, we propose Foundation Neural-Network Quantum States (FNQS) as an integrated paradigm for studying quantum many-body systems. FNQS leverage key principles of foundation models to define variational wave functions based on a single, versatile architecture that processes multimodal inputs, including spin configurations and Hamiltonian physical couplings. Unlike specialized architectures tailored for individual Hamiltonians, FNQS can generalize to physical Hamiltonians beyond those encountered during training, offering a unified framework adaptable to various quantum systems and tasks. FNQS enable the efficient estimation of quantities that are traditionally challenging or computationally intensive to calculate using conventional methods, particularly disorder-averaged observables. Furthermore, the fidelity susceptibility can be easily obtained to uncover quantum phase transitions without prior knowledge of order parameters. These pretrained models can be efficiently fine-tuned for specific quantum systems. The architectures trained in this paper are publicly available at https://huggingface.co/nqs-models, along with examples for implementing these neural networks in NetKet.</description>

      <title>Gaussian approximation of dynamic cavity equations for linearly-coupled stochastic dynamics</title>

Abstract: Stochastic dynamics on sparse graphs and disordered systems often lead to complex behaviors characterized by heterogeneity in time and spatial scales, slow relaxation, localization, and aging phenomena. The mathematical tools and approximation techniques required to analyze these complex systems are still under development, posing significant technical challenges and resulting in a reliance on numerical simulations. We introduce a novel computational framework for investigating the dynamics of sparse disordered systems with continuous degrees of freedom. Starting with a graphical model representation of the dynamic partition function for a system of linearly-coupled stochastic differential equations, we use dynamic cavity equations on locally tree-like factor graphs to approximate the stochastic measure. Here, cavity marginals are identified with local functionals of single-site trajectories. Our primary approximation involves a second-order truncation of a small-coupling expansion, leading to a Gaussian form for the cavity marginals. For linear dynamics with additive noise, this method yields a closed set of causal integro-differential equations for cavity versions of one-time and two-time averages. These equations provide an exact dynamical description within the local tree-like approximation, retrieving classical results for the spectral density of sparse random matrices. Global constraints, non-linear forces, and state-dependent noise terms can be addressed using a self-consistent perturbative closure technique. The resulting equations resemble those of dynamical mean-field theory in the mode-coupling approximation used for fully-connected models. However, due to their cavity formulation, the present method can also be applied to ensembles of sparse random graphs and employed as a message-passing algorithm on specific graph instances.</description>

      <title>First return times on sparse random graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10530v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider random walks in the form of nearest-neighbor hopping on Erdos-Renyi random graphs of finite fixed mean degree c as the number of vertices N tends to infinity. In this regime, using statistical field theory methods, we develop an analytic theory of the first return time probability distribution. The problem turns out closely related to finding the spectrum of the normalized graph Laplacian that controls the continuum time version of the nearest-neighbor-hopping random walk. In the infinite graph limit, where loops are highly improbable, the returns operate in a manner qualitatively similar to c-regular trees, and the expressions for probabilities resemble those on random c-regular graphs. Because the vertex degrees are not exactly constant, however, the way c enters the formulas differs from the dependence on the graph degree of first return probabilities on random regular graphs.</description>

      <title>Time-translation invariance symmetry breaking hidden by finite-scale singularities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11619v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a renormalization group perspective on the quantum dynamics of a particle moving in the Euclidean $\mathbb{R}^N$ space through the complex landscape provided by a disordered Hamiltonian of type $2+p$. We focus on the large $N$ limit, where the coarse-graining procedure is unconventional: it is based on the Wigner spectrum of the rank-2 disorder. The main consequence of this choice is that canonical dimensions depend on the scale, and the flow equations fail to become autonomous, preventing the existence of global fixed points. One of the main features of the underlying renormalization group flow is the existence of finite-scale singularities for initial conditions sufficiently close to the Gaussian region and for rank-$p$ disorder intensity large enough. Using the Luttinger-Ward formalism, we show that these finite-scale singularities hide (and should be resolved by) a phase transition that breaks time-translation invariance.</description>

      <title>Linear-time classical approximate optimization of cubic-lattice classical spin glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17267v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computing low-energy configurations (i.e., approximate optimization) of classical spin glasses is of relevance to both condensed matter and combinatorial optimization. Recent theoretical work opens the possibility to make its time complexity with quantum annealing generically polynomial, and D-Wave experiments can now achieve approximate optimization of cubic-lattice classical Ising spin glasses with $\sim$$10^4$ spins. It is therefore timely to ask which short-range classical spin glasses are good candidates for demonstrating quantum advantage in the time complexity of heuristic approximate optimization. One intuition is to consider models with very rugged energy landscapes in configuration space. However, here we provide evidence that short-range classical spin glasses may be approximately optimized in linear time and space with a very simple deterministic tensor-network heuristic regardless of ruggedness. On the cubic lattice with up to 50$\times$50$\times$50 spins, we obtain energy errors of $\lesssim$3% for the $\pm J$ model used in recent D-Wave experiments, and $\lesssim$5% for much more rugged planted-solution instances. For cubic-lattice-Ising reductions of unweighted Max-Cut on random 3-regular graphs with up to 300 vertices, we find energy errors of $&lt;$1% and approximation ratios of about 72-88%. A theoretical implication of our algorithm is that only quantum algorithms with sublinear time complexity may have time-complexity quantum advantage for heuristic approximate optimization of classical spin glasses that have decaying correlations. These results inform the search for quantum advantage and suggest an efficient classical method for generating warm starts for other spin-glass optimization algorithms. Our algorithm is amenable to massive parallelization and may also allow for low-power, accelerated implementations with photonic matrix-multiplication hardware.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08526v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Avalanches in mean-field models can be mapped to memoryless branching processes defining a universality class. We present a reduced expression mapping a broad family of critical and subcriticial avalanches in mean-field models at the thermodynamic limit to rooted trees in a memoryless Poisson branching processes with random occurrence times. We derive the exact mapping for the athermal random field Ising model and the democratic fiber bundle model, where avalanche statistics progress towards criticality, and as an approximation for the self-organized criticality in slip mean-field theory. Avalanche dynamics and statistics in the three models differ only on the evolution of the field density, interaction strength, and the product of both terms determining the branching number.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional quantum breakdown model with Krylov subspace many-body localization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.10968v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a two-dimensional (2d) quantum breakdown model of hardcore bosons interacting with disordered spins which would be classical without the bosons. It resembles particles incident into supersaturated vapor. The model exhibits a set of subsystem symmetries, and has a strong fragmentation into Krylov subspaces in each symmetry sector. The Hamiltonian in each Krylov subspace maps to a single-particle problem in a Cayley tree-like graph. At zero disorder, the Krylov subspaces exhibit either (possible) integrable features, or quantum chaos with quantum scar states showing irregular energy and degeneracy patterns. At nonzero disorders, they enter a 2d many-body localization (MBL) phase beyond certain disorder strength $W_*$, as indicated by Poisson level spacing statistics and entanglement entropy growing as $\log t$ with time $t$. Our theoretical arguments suggest $W_*$ is finite or zero for boson number $N_b\lesssim L^\gamma/\log L$ ($1/2\le \gamma \le 1$) as system size $L\rightarrow\infty$. This gives a more stringent condition for MBL than that in the 1d quantum breakdown models. This model reveals the possibility of MBL in systems of quantum particles interacting with classical degrees of freedom.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14645v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Advances in engineering mesoscopic quantum devices have led to new material platforms where electronic transport can be achieved on foldable structures. In this respect, we study quantum phases and their transitions on a Kirigami structure, a Japanese craft form, where its individual building blocks are topologically non-trivial. In particular, we find that by mechanically deforming the Kirigami structure one can engineer topological phase transitions in the system. Using a multipronged approach, we show that the physics of the system can be captured within a transfer matrix formalism akin to Chalker-Coddington networks, where the junctions describe scattering between effective non-Hermitian one-dimensional edge channels. We further show that the nature of the Kirigami structure can affect the critical folding angles where the topological phase transitions occur. Our study shows the rich interplay between topological quantum phenomena and structural configuration of an underlying Kirigami network reflecting its potential as an intriguing platform.</description>

      <title>Dopant pairing in a disordered magnetic spin ladder</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01252v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I demonstrate a pairing mechanism of dopants in a magnetic lattice, emerging from the underlying high-temperature disorder of the spins. The effect is demonstrated in a mixed-dimensional model, where dopants travel along a two-leg ladder, while the spins feature Ising interactions along the rungs and the legs of the ladder. The dynamics following the sudden immersion of two nearest neighbor dopants in an infinite temperature spin lattice shows that thermal spin disorder frustrates the relative motion of the dopants and enforces them to co-propagate. The predictions are shown to be realistically testable in quantum simulation experiments.</description>

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly central to AI applications, understanding their inner workings is essential. In this work, we analyze the spectra of weight matrices in pretrained transformer models through the lens of random matrix theory (RMT) to uncover learned structures. We find that certain regions of the weight matrix spectra deviate markedly from RMT predictions, indicating richer feature encoding. By comparing the corresponding singular vectors to eigenvectors of activation covariance matrices, we observe substantial overlap precisely where the spectra deviate from RMT expectations. Our analysis further reveals the important role of small singular values in LLMs, showing that these values contain significant information, a claim supported by increased perplexity when they are removed from the model. Although these small values may appear unimportant prior to task-specific fine-tuning, removing them afterward significantly degrades performance, revealing that fine-tuning refines the model primarily in these spectral regions. These results emphasize the critical role of small singular values, suggesting that removing them in an already aligned transformer can be detrimental, as it may compromise model alignment.</description>
