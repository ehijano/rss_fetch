      <title>On linear stability of supersonic flow over a short compression corner at large ramp angles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linear stability of supersonic flow over a short compression corner with ramp angles 30 and 42 is investigated using Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) and Linear Stability Theory (LST) at Mach number 3, Reynolds number 11,200 and low Knudsen number, O(10$^{-4}$). The two-dimensional base flows feature nonzero velocity slip and temperature jump and were found to be steady and laminar at both ramp angles. Modal analysis revealed a previously unknown traveling three-dimensional global mode, the amplitude functions of which peak at the leading-edge and separation shocks and extend within the shear layer of the large laminar separation bubble formed on the short compression corner. This mode is linearly unstable at the higher ramp angle and stable at the lower one, while the known stationary three-dimensional global mode which peaks at the laminar separation is also present in the spectrum, but is (strongly) damped at both ramp angles. Three-dimensional DSMC simulations have fully confirmed the LST results, underlined (again) the significance of modeling the shock contribution in linear stability analyses of high-speed flow, and predicted the nonlinear evolution of the flow up to the generation of lambda vortices on the ramp, for the first time in the context of kinetic theory simulations.</description>

      <title>A novel instability in an elastoviscoplastic fluid flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent demonstration of drastically different turbulent flow dynamics of an EVP fluid by Abdelgawad et al. (Nat. Phys., 2023, 1-5.), we analyse the linear stability of the sliding Couette flow of an EVP fluid. After yielding, the EVP fluid behaves as an Upper Convected Maxwell (UCM) fluid. In the creeping-flow limit, in the absence of yield stress, two discrete linearly stable Gorodtsov and Leonov (GL) modes exist for an arbitrarily high value of the Weissenberg number. As yield stress effects, i.e., Bingham number increases, the GL modes become unstable, leading to the novel instability. Analysis reveals that these modes originate near the boundaries due to the `extra normal stress' arising from the interplay between yield stress and elasticity. The extra normal stress is an inherent feature of an EVP fluid. Thus, the predicted novel instability is expected to be present in wall-bounded flows.</description>

      <title>Numerical-experimental estimation of the deformability of human red blood cells from rheometrical data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: he deformability of human red blood cells (RBCs), which comprise almost 99% of the cells in whole blood, is largely related not only to pathophysiological blood flow but also to the levels of intracellular compounds. Therefore, statistical estimates of the deformability of individual RBCs are of paramount importance in the clinical diagnosis of blood diseases. Although the micro-scale hydrodynamic interactions of individual RBCs lead to non-Newtonian blood rheology, there is no established method to estimate individual RBC deformability from the rheological data of RBC suspensions, and the possibility of this estimation has not been proven. To address this issue, we conducted an integrated analysis of a model of the rheology of RBC suspensions, coupled with macro-rheological data of human RBCs suspended in plasma. Assuming a non-linear curve of the relative viscosity of the suspensions as a function of the cell volume fraction, the statistical average of the membrane shear elasticity was estimated for individual intact RBCs or hardened RBCs. Both estimated values reproduced well the experimentally observed shear-thinning non-Newtonian behavior in these suspensions. We hereby conclude that our complementary approach makes it possible to estimate the statistical average of individual RBC deformability from macro-rheological data obtained with usual rheometric tests.</description>

      <title>Investigate the efficiency of incompressible flow simulations on CPUs and GPUs with BSAMR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) is a classical technique about local refinement in space where needed, thus effectively reducing computational costs for HPC-based physics simulations. Although AMR has been used for many years, little reproducible research discusses the impact of software-based parameters on block-structured AMR (BSAMR) efficiency and how to choose them. This article primarily does parametric studies to investigate the computational efficiency of incompressible flows on a block-structured adaptive mesh. The parameters include refining block size, refining frequency, maximum level, and cycling method. A new projection skipping (PS) method is proposed, which brings insights about when and where the projections on coarser levels are safe to be omitted. We conduct extensive tests on different CPUs/GPUs for various 2D/3D incompressible flow cases, including bubble, RT instability, Taylor Green vortex, etc. Several valuable empirical conclusions are obtained to help guide simulations with BSAMR. Codes and all profiling data are available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Revisiting visualization of spiral states in a wide-gap spherical Couette flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A pioneering study conducted by Egbers and Rath [Acta Mech. 111 pp. 125--140 (1995)] experimentally captured spiral waves to elucidate the transition in the wide-gap spherical Couette flow. However, the physical field quantities of the spiral waves corresponding to light patterns of various intensities, as obtained in the experiment, remain unclear, and we have yet to move beyond the understanding that the reflected light from shear-sensitive flake tracers responds to a flow that appears at the transition. In this study, the experiment to visualize spiral waves using aluminum flakes, as performed by Egbers and Rath, was numerically reproduced by solving the translational and rotational motions of the particles in a spiral wave. First, the spiral wave in a spherical Couette flow with an aspect ratio $\eta=1/2$ was numerically calculated using the Newton--Raphson method. Subsequently, the image that was numerically reproduced from the spiral wave was compared with an experimentally visualized image. The torque acting on the inner sphere and the phase angular velocity of the spiral waves with various wavenumbers were provided. Attempts have been made to determine the instantaneous physical quantity to which the light and dark patterns obtained in the visualization corresponded, and the orientation motion of the flakes developed in the advective history of the flow is essential to yield favorable results. Exploring the correlation between flow visualization results and shear structures may provide a new avenue for quantitatively estimating spatial structures and time scales in complex and quickly time-varying flow fields, such as turbulence.</description>

      <title>An adjoint-based approach for the surgical correction of nasal septal deviations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deviations of the septal wall are widespread anatomic anomalies of the human nose; they vary significantly in shape and location, and often cause the obstruction of the nasal airways. When severe, septal deviations need to be surgically corrected by ear-nose-throat (ENT) specialists. Septoplasty, however, has a low success rate, owing to the lack of suitable standardized clinical tools for assessing type and severity of obstructions, and for surgery planning. Moreover, the restoration of a perfectly straight septal wall is often impossible and possibly unnecessary. This paper introduces a procedure, based on advanced patient-specific Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations, to support ENT surgeons in septoplasty planning. The method hinges upon the theory of adjoint-based optimization, and minimizes a cost function that indirectly accounts for viscous losses. A sensitivity map is computed on the mucosal wall to provide the surgeon with a simple quantification of how much tissue removal at each location would contribute to easing the obstruction. The optimization procedure is applied to three representative nasal anatomies, reconstructed from CT scans of patients affected by complex septal deviations. The computed sensitivity consistently identifies all the anomalies correctly. Virtual surgery, i.e. morphing of the anatomies according to the computed sensitivity, confirms that the characteristics of the nasal airflow improve significantly after small anatomy changes derived from adjoint-based optimization.</description>

      <title>Birth, interactions, and evolution over topography of solitons in Serre-Green-Naghdi model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: New evidence of surprising robustness of solitary-wave solutions of the Serre-Green-Naghdi (SGN) equations is presented on the basis of high-resolution numerical simulations conducted using a novel well-balanced finite-volume method. SGN solitons exhibit a striking resemblance with their celebrated Korteweg-deVries (KdV) counterparts. Co-moving solitons are shown to exit intact from double and triple collisions with a remarkably small wave-wake residual. The counter-propagating solitons experiencing frontal collisions and solitons hitting a wall, non-existing in KdV case configurations, are shown to also recover, but with a much larger than in co-moving case residual, confirming with higher precision the results known in the literature. Multiple SGN solitons emerging from localized initial conditions are exhibited, and it is demonstrated that SGN solitons survive hitting localized topographic obstacles, and generate secondary solitons when they encounter a rising escarpment.</description>

      <title>Reducing Spatial Discretization Error on Coarse CFD Simulations Using an OpenFOAM-Embedded Deep Learning Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a method for reducing the spatial discretization error of coarse computational fluid dynamics (CFD) problems by enhancing the quality of low-resolution simulations using a deep learning model fed with high-quality data. We substitute the default differencing scheme for the convection term by a feed-forward neural network that interpolates velocities from cell centers to face values to produce velocities that approximate the fine-mesh data well. The deep learning framework incorporates the open-source CFD code OpenFOAM, resulting in an end-to-end differentiable model. We automatically differentiate the CFD physics using a discrete adjoint code version. We present a fast communication method between TensorFlow (Python) and OpenFOAM (c++) that accelerates the training process. We applied the model to the flow past a square cylinder problem, reducing the error to about 50% for simulations outside the training distribution compared to the traditional solver in the x- and y-velocity components using an 8x coarser mesh. The training is affordable in terms of time and data samples since the architecture exploits the local features of the physics while generating stable predictions for mid-term simulations.</description>

      <title>Coherent pressure structures in turbulent channel flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2108.10833v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most of the studies on pressure fluctuations in wall-bounded turbulent flows aim at obtaining statistics as power spectra and scaling laws, especially at the walls. In the present study we study energetic coherent pressure structures of turbulent channel flows, aiming at a characterization of dominant coherent structures throughout the channel. Coherent structures are detected using spectral proper orthogonal decomposition (SPOD) and modeled using resolvent analysis, similar to related works dealing with velocity fluctuations, but using pressure fluctuations as the output of interest. The resolvent operator was considered with and without the Cess eddy viscosity model. Direct numerical simulations (DNSs) of incompressible turbulent channel flows at friction Reynolds numbers of approximately 180 and 550 were employed as databases. Three representative dominant structures emerged from a preliminary spectral analysis: near-wall, large-scale and spanwise-coherent structures. For frequency-wavenumber combinations corresponding to these three representative structures, SPOD results show a strong dominance of the leading mode, highlighting low-rank behavior of pressure fluctuations. The leading resolvent mode closely agrees with the first SPOD mode, providing support to studies that showed better performance of resolvent-based estimators when predicting pressure fluctuations compared to velocity fluctuations. The dominant mechanisms of the analyzed modes are seen to be the generation of quasi-streamwise vortices with pressure fluctuations appearing close to vortex centers. A study on the individual contributions of the nonlinear terms (treated as forcing in resolvent analysis) to the pressure output reveals that each forcing component plays a constructive role to the input-output formulation, which also helps understanding the weaker role of forcing color in driving pressure fluctuations.</description>

Abstract: We analyze two recently-introduced flow measured that are based on a single trajectory only: trajectory stretching exponent (TSE) to detect hyperbolic (stretching) behavior, and trajectory angular velocity (TRA) to detect elliptic (rotation) behavior. Haller et al. [2021] and Haller et al. [2022] introduced TSE, TRA as well as the concept of quasi-objectivity, and formulated theorems about the objectivity and quasi-objectivity of TSE and TRA. In this paper, we present two counter-examples showing that all theorems in Haller et al. [2021] and Haller et al. [2022] are incorrect.</description>

      <title>Influence of chemical environment on the transition of alternating current electroosmotic flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.05903v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electroosmotic flow (EOF) is a ubiquitous phenomenon at the solid-liquid interface when an external electric field is applied. Despite its prevalence, the characteristics and mechanisms of EOF driven by an alternating current (AC) electric field, particularly within complex chemical environments, have remained insufficiently understood, owing primarily to a scarcity of experimental data. In this investigation, we advance the comprehension of AC EOF by employing a high-resolution measurement technique - laser-induced fluorescent photobleaching anemometer (LIFPA). This method allows for precise empirical characterization of transient velocity of EOF along the electric double layer (EDL) far from electrode surfaces. We have discerned a distinct transition in AC EOF behavior - from linear to nonlinear - across a wide parameter space, such as the velocity of bulk flow, the AC electric field's frequency and intensity, and the pH of the bulk fluid. Moreover, the transition within the AC EOF is quantified by the transitional electric field intensity, $E_{A,C}$, paired with a correlated dimensionless parameter, $Z_{nlc}$. A power-law relationship between the linear term coefficient $Z_{l}$ and $Z_{nlc}$ has been established, with the scaling exponents determined by the pH value of the electrolyte solution. With these findings, we aspire not only to deepen the understanding of AC EOF transitions but also to establish a robust model that elucidates the interplay between the electric field and fluid flow in both linear and nonlinear regimes. This research potentially paves the way for more predictable and controllable electrokinetic processes in numerous applications, including micro-/nanofluidic systems, electrochemical reactions, and beyond.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.05836v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The squirmer is a popular model to analyse the fluid mechanics of a self-propelled object, such as a micro-organism. We demonstrate that some fore-aft symmetric squirmers can spontaneously self-propel above a critical Reynolds number. Specifically, we numerically study the effects of inertia on spherical squirmers characterised by an axially and fore-aft symmetric `quadrupolar' distribution of surface-slip velocity; under creeping-flow conditions, such squirmers generate a pure stresslet flow, the stresslet sign classifying the squirmer as either a `pusher' or `puller.' Assuming axial symmetry, and over the examined range of the Reynolds number $Re$ (defined based upon the magnitude of the quadrupolar squirming), we find that spontaneous symmetry breaking occurs in the pusher case above $Re \approx 14.3$, with steady swimming emerging from that threshold consistently with a supercritical pitchfork bifurcation and with the swimming speed growing monotonically with $Re$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10288v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have recently discovered stochastic resonance (SR) in chaotic inertia-less viscoelastic channel flow. SR appears just above a pure elastic instability at a critical Weissenberg number, $Wi_c=150$, of a transition regime. In this lower sub-region up to $Wi\sim 300$, only the streamwise velocity, $u$, exhibits a chaotic spectrum, $E_u$, while the spanwise velocity continues to exhibit white noise, verified by its flat spectrum, $E_w$, accompanied by weak intensity elastic waves. However, SR vanishes at the upper limit at $Wi\sim 300$, when $E_w$ becomes chaotic, indicating $Wi$ as the control parameter. Here we clarify the mechanism of SR emergence by validating the control parameters, namely $Wi$ and the rms velocity fluctuations, $u_{rms}$, measured at multiple channel locations, which determine the range of SR existence. Our experiments verify three key ingredients of the SR mechanism: chaotic $E_u$, white noise $E_w$, and weak elastic waves, which are consistent with three constituents of autonomous dynamical systems exhibiting SR.</description>

      <title>A Framework of Data Assimilation for Wind Flow Fields by Physics-informed Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17001v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Various types of measurement techniques, such as Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) devices, anemometers, and wind vanes, are extensively utilized in wind energy to characterize the inflow. However, these methods typically gather data at limited points within local wind fields, capturing only a fraction of the wind field's characteristics at wind turbine sites, thus hindering detailed wind field analysis. This study introduces a framework using Physics-informed Neural Networks to assimilate diverse sensor data types. This includes line-of-sight wind speed, velocity magnitude and direction, velocity components, and pressure. Moreover, the parameterized Navier-Stokes equations are integrated as physical constraints, ensuring that the neural networks accurately represent atmospheric flow dynamics. The framework accounts for the turbulent nature of atmospheric boundary layer flow by including artificial eddy viscosity in the network outputs, enhancing the model's ability to learn and accurately depict large-scale flow structures. The reconstructed flow field and the effective wind speed are in good agreement with the actual data. Furthermore, a transfer learning strategy is employed for the online deployment of pre-trained PINN, which requires less time than that of the actual physical flow. This capability allows the framework to reconstruct wind flow fields in real time based on live data. In the demo cases, the maximum error between the effective wind speed reconstructed online and the actual value at the wind turbine site is only 3.7%. The proposed data assimilation framework provides a universal tool for reconstructing spatiotemporal wind flow fields using various measurement data. Additionally, it presents a viable approach for the online assimilation of real-time measurements. To facilitate the utilization of wind energy, our framework's source code is openly accessible.</description>

      <title>Small-scale magnetohydrodynamic dynamos: from deterministic chaos to turbulence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02049v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is shown, using results of numerical simulations, and geophysical and solar observations, that the transition from deterministic chaos to hard turbulence in the magnetic field generated by the small-scale MHD dynamos occurs through a randomization process. This randomization process has been described using the notion of distributed chaos and the main parameter of distributed chaos has been used for quantifying the degree of randomization. The dissipative (Loitsianskii and Birkhoff-Saffman integrals) and ideal (magnetic helicity) magnetohydrodynamic invariants control the randomization process and determine the degree of randomization in different MHD flows, directly or through the Kolmogorov-Iroshnikov phenomenology (the magneto-inertial range of scales as a precursor of hard turbulence). Despite the considerable differences in the scales and physical parameters, the results of numerical simulations are in quantitative agreement with the geophysical and solar observations in the frames of this approach. The Hall magnetohydrodynamic dynamo has been also briefly discussed in this context.</description>

Abstract: Recent theoretical progress using multiscale asymptotic analysis has revealed various possible regimes of stratified turbulence. Notably, buoyancy transport can either be dominated by advection or diffusion, depending on the effective P\'eclet number of the flow. Two types of asymptotic models have been proposed, which yield measurably different predictions for the characteristic vertical velocity and length scale of the turbulent eddies in both diffusive and non-diffusive regimes. The first, termed a `single-scale model', is designed to describe flow structures having large horizontal and small vertical scales, while the second, termed a `multiscale model', additionally incorporates flow features with small horizontal scales, and reduces to the single-scale model in their absence. By comparing predicted vertical velocity scaling laws with direct numerical simulation data, we show that the multiscale model correctly captures the properties of strongly stratified turbulence within regions dominated by small-scale isotropic motions, whose volume fraction decreases as the stratification increases. Meanwhile its single-scale reduction accurately describes the more orderly, layer-like, quiescent flow outside those regions.</description>

      <title>Deep reinforcement learning-based active flow control of an elliptical cylinder: transitioning from an elliptical cylinder to a circular cylinder and a flat plate</title>

Abstract: This study investigates the effectiveness of active flow control (AFC) technology supported by deep reinforcement learning (DRL) applied to flows around an elliptical cylinder at Re = 100. We vary the aspect ratio Ar of the elliptical cylinder from an elliptical cylinder Ar = 2 to a circular cylinder Ar = 1, and ultimately to a flat plate Ar = 0. We utilize the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm to precisely control the mass flow rates of synthetic jets located on the upper and lower surfaces of a cylinder to achieve reduction in drag, minimization of lift, and suppression of vortex shedding. The robustness and adaptability of DRL-based control techniques are examined across different geometric configurations. Our research findings indicate that, for elliptical cylinders with Ar between 1.75 and 0.75, the reduction in drag coefficient ranges from 0.9 % to 15.7 %, and the reduction in lift coefficient ranges from 95.2 % to 99.7 %. The DRL-based control strategy not only significantly reduces lift and drag, but also completely suppresses vortex shedding while using less than 1 % of external excitation energy, demonstrating its efficiency and energy-saving capabilities. Additionally, for Ar from 0.5 to 0, the reduction in drag coefficient ranges from 26.9 % to 43.6 %, and the reduction in lift coefficient from 50.2 % to 68.0 %. This reflects the control strategy's significant reduction in both drag and lift coefficients, while also alleviating vortex shedding. It is expected underscore the adaptability and potential of DRL-based AFC in controlling complex fluid dynamics across diverse geometric configurations.</description>

      <title>A Meshless Solver for Blood Flow Simulations in Elastic Vessels Using Physics-Informed Neural Network</title>

Abstract: Investigating blood flow in the cardiovascular system is crucial for assessing cardiovascular health. Computational approaches offer some non-invasive alternatives to measure blood flow dynamics. Numerical simulations based on traditional methods such as finite-element and other numerical discretizations have been extensively studied and have yielded excellent results. However, adapting these methods to real-life simulations remains a complex task. In this paper, we propose a method that offers flexibility and can efficiently handle real-life simulations. We suggest utilizing the physics-informed neural network (PINN) to solve the Navier-Stokes equation in a deformable domain, specifically addressing the simulation of blood flow in elastic vessels. Our approach models blood flow using an incompressible, viscous Navier-Stokes equation in an Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian form. The mechanical model for the vessel wall structure is formulated by an equation of Newton's second law of momentum and linear elasticity to the force exerted by the fluid flow. Our method is a mesh-free approach that eliminates the need for discretization and meshing of the computational domain. This makes it highly efficient in solving simulations involving complex geometries. Additionally, with the availability of well-developed open-source machine learning framework packages and parallel modules, our method can easily be accelerated through GPU computing and parallel computing. To evaluate our approach, we conducted experiments on regular cylinder vessels as well as vessels with plaque on their walls. We compared our results to a solution calculated by Finite Element Methods using a dense grid and small time steps, which we considered as the ground truth solution. We report the relative error and the time consumed to solve the problem, highlighting the advantages of our method.</description>
