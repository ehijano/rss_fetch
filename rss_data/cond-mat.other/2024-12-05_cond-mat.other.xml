      <title>Damping Enhancement in YIG at Millikelvin Temperatures due to GGG Substrate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum magnonics aims to exploit the quantum mechanical properties of magnons for nanoscale quantum information technologies. Ferrimagnetic yttrium iron garnet (YIG), which offers the longest magnon lifetimes, is a key material typically grown on gadolinium gallium garnet (GGG) substrates for structural compatibility. However, the increased magnetic damping in YIG/GGG systems below 50$\,$K poses a challenge for quantum applications. Here, we study the damping in a 97$\,$nm-thick YIG film on a 500$\,\mu$m-thick GGG substrate at temperatures down to 30$\,$mK using ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) spectroscopy. We show that the dominant physical mechanism for the observed tenfold increase in FMR linewidth at millikelvin temperatures is the non-uniform bias magnetic field generated by the partially magnetized paramagnetic GGG substrate. Numerical simulations and analytical theory show that the GGG-driven linewidth enhancement can reach up to 6.7 times. In addition, at low temperatures and frequencies above 18$\,$GHz, the FMR linewidth deviates from the viscous Gilbert-damping model. These results allow the partial elimination of the damping mechanisms attributed to GGG, which is necessary for the advancement of solid-state quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Bulk-like structural, magnetic and optical properties of (111)- and (001)-NiO thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have grown (111)- and (001)-oriented NiO thin films on (0001)-Sapphire and (001)-MgO substrates using pulsed laser deposition (PLD), respectively. DC magnetic susceptibility measurements underline that the N\'eel temperatures of the samples are beyond room-temperature. This is further confirmed by the presence of two-magnon Raman scattering modes in these films in ambient conditions. Moreover, relative intensity of the two magnon-mode with respect to a neighboring phonon mode in the films, at least down to 30 nm thickness, is comparable to the same for bulk NiO. UV-vis spectroscopy and spectroscopic ellipsometry determined that the bandgap of the films is 3.6 eV which is well within the range for bulk NiO. Thus, these indicate that the thin films are bulk-like. Further, photoluminescence measurements on (111)-NiO films obtained two-radiative transitions at 385 and 405 nm. The linewidth of the latter broadens towards low temperatures, indicating a plausible exciton-magnon coupling. Overall, these PLD-grown oxide films hold significant technological importance due to their optical transparency and their capacity to host robust magnons at room temperature.</description>

      <title>A deep neural network approach to solve the Dirac equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the method from [Naito, Naito, and Hashimoto, Phys. Rev. Research 5, 033189 (2023)] to solve the Dirac equation not only for the ground state but also for low-lying excited states using a deep neural network and the unsupervised machine learning technique. The variational method fails because of the Dirac sea, which is avoided by introducing the inverse Hamiltonian method. For low-lying excited states, two methods are proposed, which have different performances and advantages. The validity of this method is verified by the calculations with the Coulomb and Woods-Saxon potentials.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Higher-Order Topology via Polarized Topological Charges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05505v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Higher-order topological phases (HOTPs) host exotic topological states that go beyond the traditional bulk-boundary correspondence. Up to now, there is still a lack of experimentally measurable momentum-space topological characterization for the HOTPs, which is not conducive to revealing the essential properties of these topological states and also restricts their detection in quantum simulation systems. Here, we propose a concept of polarized topological charges to characterize chiral-symmetric HOTPs in momentum space, which further facilitates a feasible experimental scheme to detect the HOTPs in $^{87}$Rb cold atomic system. Remarkably, our characterization theory not only shows that the second-order (third-order) topological phases are determined by a quarter (negative eighth) of the total polarized topological charges, but also reveals that the higher-order topological phase transitions are identified by the creation or annihilation of polarized topological charges. Particularly, these polarized topological charges can be measured by pseudospin structures of the systems. Due to theoretical simplicity and observational intuitiveness, this work shall advance the broad studies of the HOTPs in both theory and experiment.</description>

      <title>Zero external magnetic field quantum standard of resistance at the 10-9 level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13365v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum anomalous Hall effect holds promise as a disruptive innovation in condensed matter physics and metrology, as it gives access to Hall resistance quantization in terms of the von-Klitzing constant RK = h/e2 at zero external magnetic field. In this work, we study the accuracy of Hall resistance quantization in a device based on the magnetic topological insulator material (V,Bi,Sb)2Te3. We show that the relative deviation of the Hall resistance from RK at zero external magnetic field is (4.4 +/- 8.7) nohm/ohm when extrapolated to zero measurement current, and (8.6 +/- 6.7) nohm/ohm when extrapolated to zero longitudinal resistivity (each with combined standard uncertainty, k = 1), which sets a new benchmark for the quantization accuracy in topological matter. This precision and accuracy at the nohm/ohm level (or 10-9 of relative uncertainty) achieve the thresholds for relevant metrological applications and establish a zero external magnetic field quantum standard of resistance - an important step towards the integration of quantum-based voltage and resistance standards into a single universal quantum electrical reference.</description>
