      <title>Efficient stochastic simulation of gene regulatory networks using hybrid models of transcriptional bursting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-cell data reveal the presence of biological stochasticity between cells of identical genome and environment, in particular highlighting the transcriptional bursting phenomenon. To account for this property, gene expression may be modeled as a continuous-time Markov chain where biochemical species are described in a discrete way, leading to Gillespie's stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA) which turns out to be computationally expensive for realistic mRNA and protein copy numbers. Alternatively, hybrid models based on piecewise-deterministic Markov processes (PDMPs) offer an effective compromise for capturing cell-to-cell variability, but their simulation remains limited to specialized mathematical communities. With a view to making them more accessible, we present here a simple simulation method that is reminiscent of SSA, while allowing for much lower computational cost. We detail the algorithm for a bursty PDMP describing an arbitrary number of interacting genes, and prove that it simulates exact trajectories of the model. As an illustration, we use the algorithm to simulate a two-gene toggle switch: this example highlights the fact that bimodal distributions as observed in real data are not explained by transcriptional bursting per se, but rather by distinct burst frequencies that may emerge from interactions between genes.</description>

      <title>Spectral Manifold Harmonization for Graph Imbalanced Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph-structured data is ubiquitous in scientific domains, where models often face imbalanced learning settings. In imbalanced regression, domain preferences focus on specific target value ranges representing the most scientifically valuable cases; we observe a significant lack of research. In this paper, we present Spectral Manifold Harmonization (SMH), a novel approach for addressing this imbalanced regression challenge on graph-structured data by generating synthetic graph samples that preserve topological properties while focusing on often underrepresented target distribution regions. Conventional methods fail in this context because they either ignore graph topology in case generation or do not target specific domain ranges, resulting in models biased toward average target values. Experimental results demonstrate the potential of SMH on chemistry and drug discovery benchmark datasets, showing consistent improvements in predictive performance for target domain ranges.</description>

      <title>Modeling the Monty Hall Decision Problem with Reaction Kinetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15824v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the Monty Hall probability problem as a model system, we ask whether simple chemical reaction mechanisms can implement optimal strategies for non-trivial decision making. In this puzzle, a contestant chooses one of three doors (only one hides a prize), the host, knowing the content, opens another door revealing no prize, and finally the contestant must decide whether to stay with the original choice or switch to the remaining closed door. Assigning distinct molecular species to the player, initial choice, reveal step, and final decision, we encode the problem in mass-action kinetics. For pseudo-first-order conditions, tuning a single rate constant shifts the network continuously between "always-stay" (1/3 success) and "always-switch" (2/3 success) regimes. We derive closed-form, time-dependent expressions for the success kinetics, concluding with a brief discussion of proposed DNA strand-displacement implementations and kinetically hard-wired molecular decision-making.</description>
