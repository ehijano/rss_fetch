      <title>Analysis of the Picard-Newton iteration for the incompressible Boussinesq equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Picard-Newton iteration for the incompressible Boussinesq equations, which is a two-step iteration resulting from the composition of the Picard and Newton iterations. We prove that this iterative method retains Newton's quadratic convergence but has less restrictive sufficient conditions for convergence than Newton and also is unconditionally stable under a small data condition. In this sense, Picard-Newton can be considered as a Newton iteration that is nonlinearly preconditioned with Picard. Our numerical tests illustrate this quadratic convergence and stability on benchmark problems. Furthermore, the tests show convergence for significantly higher Rayleigh number than both Picard and Newton, which illustrates the larger convergence basin of Picard-Newton that the theory predicts. We also introduce Anderson acceleration into the Picard step in our Picard-Newton numerical tests, and this enables convergence for even higher Rayleigh number.</description>

      <title>Anderson acceleration with adaptive relaxation for convergent fixed-point iterations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two adaptive relaxation strategies are proposed for Anderson acceleration. They are specifically designed for applications in which mappings converge to a fixed point. Their superiority over alternative Anderson acceleration is demonstrated for linear contraction mappings. Both strategies perform well in three nonlinear fixed-point applications that include partial differential equations and the EM algorithm. One strategy surpasses all other Anderson acceleration implementations tested in terms of computation time across various specifications, including composite Anderson acceleration.</description>

      <title>Computation of highly oscillatory integrals using a Fourier extension approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The numerical evaluation of integrals of the form \begin{align*}
  \int_a^b f(x) e^{ikg(x)}\,dx \end{align*} is an important problem in scientific computing with significant applications in many branches of applied mathematics, science and engineering. The numerical approximation of such integrals using classical quadratures can be prohibitively expensive at high oscillation frequency ($k \gg 1$) as the number of quadrature points needed for achieving a reasonable accuracy must grow proportionally to $k$. To address this significant computational challenge, starting with Filon in 1930, several specialized quadratures have been developed to compute such oscillatory integrals efficiently. A crucial element in such Filon-type quadrature is the accurate evaluation of certain moments which poses a significant challenge when non-linear phase functions $g$ are involved. In this paper, we propose an equispaced-grid Filon-type quadrature for computing such highly oscillatory integrals that utilizes a Fourier extension of the slowly varying envelope $f$. This strategy is primarily aimed at significantly simplifying the moment calculations, even when the phase function has stationary points. Moreover, the proposed approach can also handle certain integrable singularities in the integrand. We analyze the scheme to theoretically establish high-order convergence rates. We also include a wide variety of numerical experiments, including oscillatory integrals with algebraic and logarithmic singularities, to demonstrate the performance of the quadrature.</description>

      <title>Fictitious null spaces for improving the solution of injective inverse problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For linear ill-posed problems with nontrivial null spaces, Tikhonov regularization and truncated singular value decomposition (TSVD) typically yield solutions that are close to the minimum norm solution. Such a bias is not always desirable, and we have therefore in a series of papers developed a weighting procedure which produces solutions with a different and controlled bias. This methodology can also conveniently be invoked when sparsity regularization is employed.
  The purpose of the present work is to study the potential use of this weighting applied to injective operators. The image under a compact operator of the singular vectors/functions associated with very small singular values will be almost zero. Consequently, one may regard these singular vectors/functions to constitute a basis for a fictitious null space that allows us to mimic the previous weighting procedure. It turns out that this regularization by weighting can improve the solution of injective inverse problems compared with more traditional approaches.
  We present some analysis of this methodology and exemplify it numerically, using sparsity regularization, for three PDE-driven inverse problems: the inverse heat conduction problem, the Cauchy problem for Laplace's equation, and the (linearized) Electrical Impedance Tomography problem with experimental data.</description>

      <title>H-Matrix Accelerated Direct Matrix Solver using Chebyshev-based Nystr\"om Boundary Integral Equation Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An H-matrix accelerated direct solver employing the high-order Chebyshev-based Boundary Integral Equation (CBIE) method has been formulated, tested, and profiled for performance on high contrast dielectric materials and electrically large perfect electric conductor objects. The matrix fill performance of the CBIE proves to be fast for small to moderately sized problems compared to its counterparts, e.g. the locally corrected Nystr\"om (LCN) method, due to the way it handles the singularities by means of a global change of variable method. However, in the case of electrically large scattering problems, the matrix fill and factorization still dominate the solution time when using a direct solution approach. To address this issue, an H-Matrix framework is employed, effectively resolving the challenge and establishing the CBIE as a competitive high-order method for solving scattering problems with poorly conditioned matrix equations. The efficacy of this approach is demonstrated through numerical results.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Growing Randomized Neural Networks for Solving Partial Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Randomized neural network (RNN) methods have been proposed for solving various partial differential equations (PDEs), demonstrating high accuracy and efficiency. However, initializing the fixed parameters remains a challenging issue. Additionally, RNNs often struggle to solve PDEs with sharp or discontinuous solutions. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called Adaptive Growing Randomized Neural Network (AG-RNN) to address these challenges. First, we establish a parameter initialization strategy based on frequency information to construct the initial RNN. After obtaining a numerical solution from this initial network, we use the residual as an error indicator. Based on the error indicator, we introduce growth strategies that expand the neural network, making it wider and deeper to improve the accuracy of the numerical solution. A key feature of AG-RNN is its adaptive strategy for determining the weights and biases of newly added neurons, enabling the network to expand in both width and depth without requiring additional training. Instead, all weights and biases are generated constructively, significantly enhancing the network's approximation capabilities compared to conventional randomized neural network methods. In addition, a domain splitting strategy is introduced to handle the case of discontinuous solutions. Extensive numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of this innovative approach.</description>

      <title>Overlapping subspaces and singular systems with application to Isogeometric Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a framework for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) motivated by isogeometric analysis (IGA) and local tensor-product splines. Instead of using a global basis for the solution space we use as generators the disjoint union of subspace bases. This leads to a potentially singular linear system, which is handled by a Krylov linear solver. The framework may offer computational advantages in dealing with spaces like Hierarchical B-splines, T-splines, and LR-splines.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An automated framework is presented for the numerical solution of optimal control problems with PDEs as constraints, in both the stationary and instationary settings. The associated code can solve both linear and non-linear problems, and examples for incompressible flow equations are considered. The software, which is based on a Python interface to the Firedrake system, allows for a compact definition of the problem considered by providing a few lines of code in a high-level language. The software is provided with efficient iterative linear solvers for optimal control problems with PDEs as constraints. The use of advanced preconditioning techniques results in a significant speed-up of the solution process for large-scale problems. We present numerical examples of the applicability of the software on classical control problems with PDEs as constraints.</description>

      <title>Subspace Diffusion Posterior Sampling for Travel-Time Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models have been widely studied as effective generative tools for solving inverse problems. The main ideas focus on performing the reverse sampling process conditioned on noisy measurements, using well-established numerical solvers for gradient updates. Although diffusion-based sampling methods can produce high-quality reconstructions, challenges persist in nonlinear PDE-based inverse problems and sampling speed. In this work, we explore solving PDE-based travel-time tomography based on subspace diffusion generative models. Our main contributions are twofold: First, we propose a posterior sampling process for PDE-based inverse problems by solving the associated adjoint-state equation. Second, we resorted to the subspace-based dimension reduction technique for conditional sampling acceleration, enabling solving the PDE-based inverse problems from coarse to refined grids. Our numerical experiments showed satisfactory advancements in improving the travel-time imaging quality and reducing the sampling time for reconstruction.</description>

Abstract: In this work we design a novel $C^1$-conforming virtual element method of arbitrary order $k \geq 2$, to solve the biharmonic problem on a domain with curved boundary and internal curved interfaces in two dimensions. By introducing a suitable stabilizing form, we develop a rigorous interpolation, stability, and convergence analysis obtaining optimal error estimates in the energy norm. Finally, we validate the theoretical findings through numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>High-order finite element methods for three-dimensional multicomponent convection-diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive and analyze a broad class of finite element methods for numerically simulating the stationary, low Reynolds number flow of concentrated mixtures of several distinct chemical species in a common thermodynamic phase. The underlying partial differential equations that we discretize are the Stokes$\unicode{x2013}$Onsager$\unicode{x2013}$Stefan$\unicode{x2013}$Maxwell (SOSM) equations, which model bulk momentum transport and multicomponent diffusion within ideal and non-ideal mixtures. Unlike previous approaches, the methods are straightforward to implement in two and three spatial dimensions, and allow for high-order finite element spaces to be employed. The key idea in deriving the discretization is to suitably reformulate the SOSM equations in terms of the species mass fluxes and chemical potentials, and discretize these unknown fields using stable $H(\textrm{div}) \unicode{x2013} L^2$ finite element pairs. We prove that the methods are convergent and yield a symmetric linear system for a Picard linearization of the SOSM equations, which staggers the updates for concentrations and chemical potentials. We also discuss how the proposed approach can be extended to the Newton linearization of the SOSM equations, which requires the simultaneous solution of mole fractions, chemical potentials, and other variables. Our theoretical results are supported by numerical experiments and we present an example of a physical application involving the microfluidic non-ideal mixing of hydrocarbons.</description>

      <title>Improved bounds for randomized Schatten norm estimation of numerically low-rank matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we analyze the variance of a stochastic estimator for computing Schatten norms of matrices. The estimator extracts information from a single sketch of the matrix, that is, the product of the matrix with a few standard Gaussian random vectors. While this estimator has been proposed and used in the literature before, the existing variance bounds are often pessimistic. Our work provides a sharper upper bound on the variance and we also give estimates of the variance that work well for numerically low-rank matrices. Our theoretical findings are supported by numerical experiments, demonstrating that the new bounds are significantly tighter than the existing ones.</description>

      <title>Detecting cluster patterns in tensor data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A tensor consists of data, $t$, equipped with a multilinear product $\langle t|u_1,\ldots, u_{\ell}\rangle$, called a tensor contraction. Each vector $u_a$ comes from a space $U_a$ called an axis (or mode), the output $\langle t|u_1,\ldots, u_{\ell}\rangle$ lies in a base space $U_0$. In applications, axes often function as linear models of input parameters to a multiparameter process. The tensor then models the complex ways these parameters interact to produce a vector in the base which models outcomes. Thus some linear methods become accessible on a nonlinear problem.
  Many applications of tensors use decompositions $U_a=X_{a,1}\oplus \cdots \oplus X_{a,k_a}$ with a prescribed subset $\Delta$ of coordinates $(i_0,i_1,\ldots, i_{\ell})$, $1\leq i_a\leq k_a$, where \[
  (i_0,i_1,\ldots, i_{\ell})\not\in \Delta
  \qquad \Longrightarrow \qquad
  \langle t|X_{1,i_1},\ldots, X_{\ell,i_{\ell}}\rangle \leq
  \sum_{j\neq i_0} X_{0,j}. \] We call $\Delta$ a cluster pattern and observe that these generalize familiar structures such as echelon forms, block diagonalization, orthogonal, eigen, and singular value decompositions, and clustering more broadly.
  This article introduces a class of efficiently computable cluster patterns that emerge from an underlying Lie theory of multilinear maps. The new family generalizes known cluster patterns such as Tucker decompositions and block diagonal decompositions but also includes decompositions that approximate curves and surfaces. The latter patterns can capture properties of data categories that do not decompose into the types of disjoint clustering for which existing methods are designed.</description>

      <title>A machine learning based material homogenization technique for in-plane loaded masonry walls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, significant advancements have been made in computational methods for analyzing masonry structures. Within the Finite Element Method, two primary approaches have gained traction: Micro and Macro Scale modeling, and their subsequent integration via Multi-scale methods based on homogenization theory and the representative volume element concept. While Micro and Multi-scale approaches offer high fidelity, they often come with a substantial computational burden. On the other hand, calibrating homogenized material parameters in Macro-scale approaches presents challenges for practical engineering problems. Machine learning techniques have emerged as powerful tools for training models using vast datasets from various domains. In this context, we propose leveraging Machine Learning methods to develop a novel homogenization strategy for the in-plane analysis of masonry structures. This strategy involves automatically calibrating a continuum nonlinear damage constitutive law and an appropriate yield criteria using relevant data derived from Micro-scale analysis. The optimization process not only enhances material parameters but also refines yield criteria and damage evolution laws to better align with existing data. To achieve this, a virtual laboratory is created to conduct micro-model simulations that account for the individual behaviors of constituent materials. Subsequently, a data isotropization process is employed to reconcile the results with typical isotropic constitutive models. Next, an optimization algorithm that minimizes the difference of internal dissipated work between the micro and macro scales is executed. We apply this technique to the in-plane homogenization of a Flemish bond masonry wall. Evaluation examples, including simulations of shear and compression tests, demonstrate the method's accuracy compared to micro modeling of the entire structure.</description>

Abstract: Managing the plan of constellation of satellites for target observation requires optimal deployment and efficient operational strategies. In this paper, we introduce a new technique based on group theory tools through multi-agent constraint optimization techniques, designed for the dynamic landscapes of satellite operations. Inspired by group actions, our method models the planning problem for observing Earth targets as a cooperative game to achieve computational efficiency while simultaneously reducing computational complexity. Designed for the complex task of planning constellation of satellites, our methodology provides a feasible solution to the inherent challenges of multi-agent optimization under state constraints and subject to uncertainties. Our approach can offer avenues for improving mission efficiency and reducing costs. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate the good performance of the approach in the presence of inter-satellite links.</description>

      <title>Hybrid CGME and TCGME algorithms for large-scale general-form regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.04078v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two new hybrid algorithms are proposed for large-scale linear discrete ill-posed problems in general-form regularization. They are both based on Krylov subspace inner-outer iterative algorithms. At each iteration, they need to solve a linear least squares problem, which is the inner least squares problem. It is proved that inner linear least squares problems, solved by LSQR, become better conditioned as k increases, so LSQR converges faster. We also prove how to choose the stopping tolerance for LSQR to guarantee that the computed and exact best regularized solutions have the same accuracy. Numerical experiments are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our new hybrid algorithms, along with comparisons to the existing algorithm.</description>

      <title>A Mini Immersed Finite Element Method for Two-Phase Stokes Problems on Cartesian Meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.00910v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a mini immersed finite element (IFE) method for solving two- and three-dimensional two-phase Stokes problems on Cartesian meshes. The IFE space is constructed from the conventional mini element, with shape functions modified on interface elements according to interface jump conditions, while keeping the degrees of freedom unchanged. Both discontinuous viscosity coefficients and surface forces are taken into account in the construction. The interface is approximated using discrete level set functions, and explicit formulas for IFE basis functions and correction functions are derived, facilitating ease of implementation.The inf-sup stability and the optimal a priori error estimate of the IFE method, along with the optimal approximation capabilities of the IFE space, are derived rigorously, with constants that are independent of the mesh size and the manner in which the interface intersects the mesh, but may depend on the discontinuous viscosity coefficients. Additionally, it is proved that the condition number has the usual bound independent of the interface. Numerical experiments are provided to confirm the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>On Kemeny's constant and stochastic complement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13201v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a stochastic matrix $P$ partitioned in four blocks $P_{ij}$, $i,j=1,2$, Kemeny's constant $\kappa(P)$ is expressed in terms of Kemeny's constants of the stochastic complements $P_1=P_{11}+P_{12}(I-P_{22})^{-1}P_{21}$, and $P_2=P_{22}+P_{21}(I-P_{11})^{-1}P_{12}$. Specific cases concerning periodic Markov chains and Kronecker products of stochastic matrices are investigated. Bounds to Kemeny's constant of perturbed matrices are given. Relying on these theoretical results, a divide-and-conquer algorithm for the efficient computation of Kemeny's constant of graphs is designed. Numerical experiments performed on real-world problems show the high efficiency and reliability of this algorithm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16554v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a time-dependent discrete network model with highly varying connectivity. The approximation by time is performed using an implicit scheme. We propose the coarse scale approximation construction of network models based on the Generalized Multiscale Finite Element Method. An accurate coarse-scale approximation is generated by solving local spectral problems in sub-networks. Convergence analysis of the proposed method is presented for semi-discrete and discrete network models. We establish the stability of the multiscale discrete network. Numerical results are presented for structured and random heterogeneous networks.</description>

      <title>On the Spline-Based Parameterisation of Plane Graphs via Harmonic Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01347v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a spline-based parameterisation framework for plane graphs. The plane graph is characterised by a collection of curves forming closed loops that fence-off planar faces which have to be parameterised individually. Hereby, we focus on parameterisations that are conforming across the interfaces between the faces. Parameterising each face individually allows for the imposition of locally differing material parameters which has applications in various engineering disciplines, such as elasticity and heat transfer. For the parameterisation of the individual faces, we employ the concept of harmonic maps. The plane graph's spline-based parameterisation is suitable for numerical simulation based on isogeometric analysis or can be utilised to extract arbitrarily dense classical meshes. Application-specific features can be built into the geometry's mathematical description either on the spline level or in the mesh extraction step.</description>

      <title>SAV-based entropy-dissipative schemes for a class of kinetic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16105v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce novel entropy-dissipative numerical schemes for a class of kinetic equations, leveraging the recently introduced scalar auxiliary variable (SAV) approach. Both first and second order schemes are constructed. Since the positivity of the solution is closely related to entropy, we also propose positivity-preserving versions of these schemes to ensure robustness, which include a scheme specially designed for the Boltzmann equation and a more general scheme using Lagrange multipliers. The accuracy and provable entropy-dissipation properties of the proposed schemes are validated for both the Boltzmann equation and the Landau equation through extensive numerical examples.</description>

      <title>A Novel Interpolation-Based Method for Solving the One-Dimensional Wave Equation on a Domain with a Moving Boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16483v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of solving the one-dimensional wave equation on a domain with moving boundary. In J.Math.Phys.11, 2679 (1970), Moore introduced an interesting method to do so. As only in rare cases, a closed analytical solution is possible, one must turn to perturbative expansions of Moore's method. We investigate the then made minimal assumption for convergence of the perturbation series, namely that the boundary position should be an analytic function of time. Though, we prove here that the latter requirement is not a sufficient condition for Moore's method to converge. We then introduce a novel numerical approach based on interpolation which also works for fast boundary dynamics. In comparison with other state-of-the-art numerical methods, our method offers greater speed if the wave solution needs to be evaluated at many points in time or space, whilst preserving accuracy. We discuss two variants of our method, either based on a conformal coordinate transformation or on the method of characteristics, together with interpolation.</description>

      <title>A Newton-CG based barrier-augmented Lagrangian method for general nonconvex conic optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.04204v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider finding an approximate second-order stationary point (SOSP) of general nonconvex conic optimization that minimizes a twice differentiable function subject to nonlinear equality constraints and also a convex conic constraint. In particular, we propose a Newton-conjugate gradient (Newton-CG) based barrier-augmented Lagrangian method for finding an approximate SOSP of this problem. Under some mild assumptions, we show that our method enjoys a total inner iteration complexity of $\widetilde{\cal O}(\epsilon^{-11/2})$ and an operation complexity of $\widetilde{\cal O}(\epsilon^{-11/2}\min\{n,\epsilon^{-5/4}\})$ for finding an $(\epsilon,\sqrt{\epsilon})$-SOSP of general nonconvex conic optimization with high probability. Moreover, under a constraint qualification, these complexity bounds are improved to $\widetilde{\cal O}(\epsilon^{-7/2})$ and $\widetilde{\cal O}(\epsilon^{-7/2}\min\{n,\epsilon^{-3/4}\})$, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on the complexity of finding an approximate SOSP of general nonconvex conic optimization. Preliminary numerical results are presented to demonstrate superiority of the proposed method over first-order methods in terms of solution quality.</description>

      <title>Time splitting and error estimates for nonlinear Schrodinger equations with a potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14816v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the nonlinear Schr{\"o}dinger equation with a potential, also known as Gross-Pitaevskii equation. By introducing a suitable spectral localization, we prove low regularity error estimates for the time discretization corresponding to an adapted Lie-Trotter splitting scheme. The proof is based on tools from spectral theory and pseudodifferential calculus in order to obtain various estimates on the spectral localization, including discrete Strichartz estimates which support the nonlinear analysis.</description>
