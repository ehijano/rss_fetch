      <title>On the Torelli problem for Calabi-Yau 3-folds, and the integral cohomology of the Fermat quintic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the cohomology of a 1-parameter family Y_t of Calabi-Yau 3-folds introduced by Aspinwall and Morrison, related to the mirror quintic family. Szendr\H{o}i proved that Y_t, Y_{xi t}, ..., Y_{xi^4 t}, where xi is a fifth root of unity, have the same rational Hodge structure but are not isomorphic, and conjectured that they are not birational or even derived equivalent. We confirm this by proving that their integral Hodge structures are different, and discuss how this fits with known Torelli-type theorems and counterexamples.
  Our main tool is a new description of the integral cohomology of the Fermat quintic 3-fold Q_0, which should be of independent interest: we show that H^3(Q_0, Z) is spanned by the Aut(Q_0)-orbit of the class alpha which is Poincar\'e dual to the set of real points.</description>

      <title>Singular Nakano positivity of direct image sheaves of adjoint bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a proper K\"ahler fibration $f \colon X \to Y$ and a singular Hermitian line bundle $(L, h)$ on $X$ with semi-positive curvature. We prove that the direct image sheaf $f_{*}(\mathcal{O}_{X}(K_{X/Y}+L) \otimes \mathcal{I}(h))$, equipped with the Narasimhan-Simha metric, is singular Nakano semi-positive in the sense that the $\overline{\partial}$-equation can be solved with optimal $L^{2}$-estimate. Our proof does not rely on the theory of Griffiths positivity for the direct image sheaf.</description>

      <title>Constant coefficient and intersection complex $L$-classes of projective varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a projective variety $X$ we have the intersection complex $L$-class defined by using the self-duality of the intersection complex and also the constant coefficient $L$-class which is the specialization at $y=1$ of the Hirzebruch characteristic class defined by taking a cubic hyperresolution. We show that these two $L$-classes differ if they do for an intersection of general hyperplane sections which has only cohomologically isolated singularities. So the study of a sufficient condition for non-coincidence is reduced to the latter case, where a necessary and sufficient condition has been obtained in terms of mixed Hodge structures on the stalks of the intersection complex in our previous paper. We also construct examples of projective varieties where the two $L$-classes differ although the constant coefficient and intersection cohomologies coincide.</description>

      <title>Moduli stacks of quiver bundles with applications to Higgs bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a general method for constructing moduli stacks whose points are diagrams of vector bundles over a fixed base, indexed by a fixed simplicial set -- that is, quiver bundles of a fixed shape. We discuss some constraints on the base for these moduli stacks to be algebraic and observe that a large class of interesting schemes satisfy these constraints. Using this construction, we provide an alternate construction of moduli stacks of Higgs bundles along with a proof of algebraicity following readily from the algebraicity of moduli stacks of quiver bundles. One feature of our approach is that, for each of the moduli stacks we discuss, there are algebraic moduli stacks parametrizing morphisms of the objects being classified. We discuss some potential applications of this in categorifying non-abelian Hodge theory in a sense we will make precise. We also discuss potential applications of our methods and perspectives to the subjects of quiver modifications, abstract moduli theory, and homotopy theory.</description>

      <title>Higher Dimensional Fourier Quasicrystals from Lee-Yang Varieties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct Fourier quasicrystals with unit masses in arbitrary dimensions. This generalizes a one-dimensional construction of Kurasov and Sarnak. To do this, we employ a class of complex algebraic varieties avoiding certain regions in $\mathbb{C}^n$, which generalize hypersurfaces defined by Lee-Yang polynomials. We show that these are Delone almost periodic sets that have at most finite intersection with every discrete periodic set.</description>

      <title>Real toric manifolds associated with chordal nestohedra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the rational Betti numbers of real toric manifolds associated with chordal nestohedra. We consider the poset topology of a specific poset induced from a chordal building set, and show its EL-shellability. Based on this, we present an explicit description using alternating $\mathcal{B}$-permutations for a chordal building set $\mathcal{B}$, transforming the computing Betti numbers into a counting problem. This approach allows us to compute the $a$-number of a finite simple graph through permutation counting when the graph is chordal. In addition, we provide detailed computations for specific cases such as real Hochschild varieties corresponding to Hochschild polytopes.</description>

      <title>Fay identities for polylogarithms on higher-genus Riemann surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A recent construction of polylogarithms on Riemann surfaces of arbitrary genus in arXiv:2306.08644 is based on a flat connection assembled from single-valued non-holomorphic integration kernels that depend on two points on the Riemann surface. In this work, we construct and prove infinite families of bilinear relations among these integration kernels that are necessary for the closure of the space of higher-genus polylogarithms under integration over the points on the surface. Our bilinear relations generalize the Fay identities among the genus-one Kronecker-Eisenstein kernels to arbitrary genus. The multiple-valued meromorphic kernels in the flat connection of Enriquez are conjectured to obey higher-genus Fay identities of exactly the same form as their single-valued non-holomorphic counterparts. We initiate the applications of Fay identities to derive functional relations among higher-genus polylogarithms involving either single-valued or meromorphic integration kernels.</description>

      <title>Invariants for level-1 phylogenetic networks under the random walk 4-state Markov model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phylogenetic networks can represent evolutionary events that cannot be described by phylogenetic trees, such as hybridization, introgression, and lateral gene transfer. Studying phylogenetic networks under a statistical model of DNA sequence evolution can aid the inference of phylogenetic networks. Most notably Markov models like the Jukes-Cantor or Kimura-3 model can been employed to infer a phylogenetic network using phylogenetic invariants. In this article we determine all quadratic invariants for sunlet networks under the random walk 4-state Markov model, which includes the aforementioned models. Taking toric fiber products of trees and sunlet networks, we obtain a new class of invariants for level-1 phylogenetic networks under the same model. Furthermore, we apply our results to the identifiability problem of a network parameter. In particular, we prove that our new class of invariants of the studied model is not sufficient to derive identifiability of quarnets (4-leaf networks). Moreover, we provide an efficient method that is faster and more reliable than the state-of-the-art in finding a significant number of invariants for many level-1 phylogenetic networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent works of the authors have demonstrated the usefulness of considering moduli spaces of Artinian reductions of a given ring when studying standard graded rings and their Lefschetz properties. This paper illuminates a key aspect of these works, the behaviour of the canonical module under deformations in this moduli space. We demonstrate that even when there is no natural geometry around, we can give a viewpoint that behaves like it, effectively constructing geometry out of nothing, giving interpretation to intersection numbers without cycles. Moreover, we explore some properties of this normalization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1608.02530v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Young flattenings, introduced by Landsberg and Ottaviani, give determinantal equations for secant varieties and their non-vanishing provides lower bounds for border ranks of tensors and in particular polynomials. We study monomial-optimal shapes for Young flattenings, which exhibit the limits of the Young flattening method. In particular, they provide the best possible lower bound for large classes of monomials including all monomials up to degree 6, monomials in 3 variables, and any power of the product of variables. On the other hand, for degree 7 and higher there are monomials for which no Young flattening can give a lower bound that matches the conjecturally tight upper bound of Landsberg and Teitler.</description>

      <title>Birational maps of Severi-Brauer surfaces, with applications to Cremona groups of higher rank</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.17123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.17123v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that any group of cardinality at most the one of $\mathbb{C}$ is a quotient of any Cremona group of rank at least $4$. This provides a definitive answer to the question of what the quotients of Cremona groups can be. As a consequence, this gives a negative answer to the question of I. Dolgachev of whether Cremona groups of all ranks are generated by involutions. As another application, we show that higher Cremona groups do not enjoy some classical group-theoretic properties (namely, the Hopfian property) which are satisfied by Cremona groups of rank $2$. Finally, we discover that the $3$-torsion of the Cremona group of rank at least $4$ is not countable.
  To deduce these properties of higher Cremona groups, we first describe the group of birational transformations of a non-trivial Severi-Brauer surface $S$ over a perfect field, proving in particular that if $S$ contains a point of degree $6$, then its group of birational self-maps is not generated by elements of finite order as it admits a surjective group homomorphism to~$\mathbb{Z}$. We then use this result to study Mori fibre spaces over the field of complex numbers, for which the generic fibre is a non-trivial Severi-Brauer surface.</description>

Abstract: This manuscript is a contributed chapter in the forthcoming CRC Press volume, titled the Handbook of Combinatorial Algebraic Geometry: Subvarieties of the Flag Variety. The book, as a whole, is aimed at a diverse audience of researchers and graduate students seeking an expository introduction to the area. In our chapter, we give an overview of some of the past research on the cohomology rings of regular nilpotent Hessenberg varieties, with no claim to being exhaustive. For the purposes of this manuscript, we focus mainly on the case of Lie type A, with some brief remarks on the general Lie types. We end the chapter with a selection of topics currently active in this area.</description>

Abstract: We construct a derived pushforward of the r-th root of the universal line bundle over the Picard stack of genus g prestable curves carrying a line bundle. We prove a number of basic properties, and give a formula in terms of standard tautological generators. After pullback, our formula recovers formulae of Mumford, of the first-named author, and of Pagani--Ricolfi--van Zelm. We apply these constructions to prove a conjecture expressing the coefficients of higher powers of r in the so-called `Chiodo classes' to the double ramification cycle, and to give a formula for the r-spin logarithmic double ramification cycle.</description>

Abstract: We classify special self-birational transformations of the smooth quadric threefold and fourfold, $Q^3$ and $Q^4$. It turns out that there is only one such example in each dimension. In the case of $Q^3$, it is given by the linear system of quadrics passing through a rational normal quartic curve. In the case of $Q^4$, it is given by the linear system of cubics passing through a non-minimal K3 surface of degree $10$ with two skew $(-1)$-lines.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.03941v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A smooth cuboid can be identified with a $3\times 3$ matrix of linear forms, with coefficients in a field $K$, whose determinant describes a smooth cubic in the projective plane. To each such matrix one can associate a group scheme over $K$. We produce isomorphism invariants of these groups in terms of their adjoint algebras, which also give information on the number of their maximal abelian subgroups. Moreover, we give a characterization of the isomorphism types of the groups in terms of isomorphisms of elliptic curves and also give a description of the automorphism group. We conclude by applying our results to the determination of the automorphism groups and isomorphism testing of finite $p$-groups of class $2$ and exponent $p$ arising in this way.</description>

      <title>The $\mu$-invariant change for abelian varieties over finite $p$-extensions of global fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.09073v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the work of Lai, Longhi, Suzuki, the first two authors and study the change of $\mu$-invariants, with respect to a finite Galois p-extension $K'/K$, of an ordinary abelian variety $A$ over a $\mathbb{Z}_p^d$-extension of global fields $L/K$ that ramifies at a finite number of places at which $A$ has ordinary reductions. In characteristic $p&gt;0$, we obtain an explicit bound for the size $\delta_v$ of the local Galois cohomology of the Mordell-Weil group of $A$ with respect to a $p$-extension ramified at a supersingular place $v$. Next, in all characteristics, we describe the asymptotic growth of $\delta_v$ along a multiple $\mathbb{Z}_p$-extension $L/K$ and provide a lower bound for the change of $\mu$-invariants of $A$ from the tower $L/K$ to the tower $LK'/K'$. Finally, we present numerical evidence supporting these results.</description>

      <title>An Explicit Uniform Mordell Conjecture over Function Fields of Characteristic Zero</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.02101v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give an explicit uniform result on the Mordell conjecture for non-isotrivial curves over function field of characteristic 0. The proof is based on Vojta's method, and make use of Zhang's admissible adelic line bundles and a quantitative proof of the Bogomolov conjecture by Looper-Silverman-Wilms.</description>

      <title>Coulomb branch surgery: Holonomy saddles, S-folds and discrete symmetry gaugings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02955v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symmetries of Seiberg-Witten (SW) geometries capture intricate physical aspects of the underlying 4d $\mathcal{N} = 2$ field theories. For rank-one theories, these geometries are rational elliptic surfaces whose automorphism group is a semi-direct product between the Coulomb branch (CB) symmetries and the Mordell-Weil group. We study quotients of the SW geometry by subgroups of its automorphism group, which most naturally become gaugings of discrete 0- and 1-form symmetries. Yet, new interpretations of these surgeries become evident when considering 5d $\mathcal{N}=1$ superconformal field theories. There, certain CB symmetries are related to symmetries of the corresponding $(p,q)$-brane web and, as a result, CB surgeries can give rise to (fractional) S-folds. Another novel interpretation of these quotients is the folding across dimensions: circle compactifications of the 5d $E_{2N_f + 1}$ Seiberg theories lead in the infrared to two copies of locally indistinguishable 4d SU(2) SQCD theories with $N_f$ fundamental flavours. This extends earlier results on holonomy saddles, while also reproducing detailed computations of 5d BPS spectra and predicting new 5d and 6d BPS quivers. Finally, we argue that the semi-direct product structure of the automorphism group of the SW geometry includes mixed 't Hooft anomalies between the 0- and 1-form symmetries, and we also present some new results on non-cyclic CB symmetries.</description>

      <title>Cohomological integrality for symmetric representations of reductive groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09218v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the integrality conjecture for quotient stacks given by a symmetric representation of a reductive group. This result will be crucial to generalise cohomological Donaldson-Thomas theory of $2$ and $3$-Calabi-Yau categories to $0$ and $(-1)$-shifted symplectic stacks respectively.</description>
