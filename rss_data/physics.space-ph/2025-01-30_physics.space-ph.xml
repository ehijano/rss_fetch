      <title>Static and Dynamic Torque Generation Analysis of a Cable-Actuated Solar Sail</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a static and dynamic torque analysis of the CABLESSail concept, which involves cables routed along the length of the flexible booms that hold the solar sail membrane in such a manner that tensioning the cables results in a bending deformation of the booms. This provides a mechanism where actuation of the cables can be used to create an imbalance in solar radiation pressure (SRP) on the sail and thus, impart SRP torques that can be used for momentum management of the solar sail. Simulation results are included that demonstrate how large SRP torques can be induced by tensioning the solar sail's cables, which can be used for momentum management. Comparisons to the existing active mass translator technology are included, along with simulations demonstrating the ability to reliably generate control torques in the presence of an uncertain sail membrane shape.</description>

      <title>Recovering Ion Distribution Functions: I. Slepian Reconstruction of VDFs from MMS and Solar Orbiter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Plasma velocity distribution functions (VDFs) constitute a fundamental observation of numerous operational and future missions. An efficient parameterization of VDFs is crucial for (1) preserving enough information to investigate macroscopic moments along with kinetic effects, (2) producing smooth distributions whereby it is possible to perform derivatives in phase space to support numerical solvers, and (3) economic data management and its storage. Previous studies have used spherical harmonics as an efficient basis for representing electron VDFs. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm targeted towards decomposing ion VDFs measured by electrostatic analyzers onboard Magnetospheric Multiscale Mission (MMS) and Solar Orbiter (SolO) spacecrafts. We use Slepian functions, custom-designed bases providing compact support in phase space, initially developed in information theory and later used for terrestrial and planetary applications. In this paper, we choose well-studied, well-measured, and complex intervals from MMS and SolO containing a range of simpler gyrotropic and agyrotropic distributions to benchmark the robustness of our reconstruction method. We demonstrate the advantages of using Slepian functions over spherical harmonics for solar wind plasma distributions. We also demonstrate that our choice of basis representation efficiently preserves phase space complexities of a 3D agyrotropic distribution function. This algorithm shown in this study will be extended to Parker Solar Probe and future missions such as Helioswarm.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Remote-sensing and In-situ Observations of Fine-scale Structure in a Pseudostreamer Coronal Mass Ejection through the Solar Corona</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coronal pseudostreamer flux systems have a specific magnetic configuration that influences the morphology and evolution of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) from these regions. Here we continue the analysis of the Wyper et al. (2024, ApJ 975, 168) magnetohydrodynamic simulation of a CME eruption from an idealized pseudostreamer configuration through the construction of synthetic remote-sensing and in-situ observational signatures. We examine the pre-eruption and eruption signatures in extreme ultraviolet and white-light from the low corona through the extended solar atmosphere. We calculate synthetic observations corresponding to several Parker Solar Probe-like trajectories at $\sim$10$R_\odot$ to highlight the fine-scale structure of the CME eruption in synthetic WISPR imagery and the differences between the in-situ plasma and field signatures of flank and central CME-encounter trajectories. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of several aspects of our simulation results in the context of interpretation and analysis of current and future Parker Solar Probe data.</description>

      <title>Generalized Expanding-Box Formulations of Reduced Magnetohydrodynamics in the Solar Wind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive a set of simplified equations that can be used for numerical studies of reduced magnetohydrodynamic turbulence within a small patch of the radially expanding solar wind. We allow the box to be either stationary in the Sun's frame or to be moving at an arbitrary velocity along the background magnetic field lines, which we take to be approximately radial. We focus in particular on the case in which the box moves at the same speed as outward-propagating Alfv\'en waves. To aid in the design and optimization of future numerical simulations, we express the equations in terms of scalar potentials and Clebsch coordinates. The equations we derive will be particularly useful for conducting high-resolution numerical simulations of reflection-driven magnetohydrodynamic turbulence in the solar wind, and may also be useful for studying turbulence within other astrophysical outflows.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of energetic particles scattered in the solar wind : Magnetohydrodynamics and test-particle simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06706v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We model the transport of solar energetic particles (SEPs) in the solar wind. We propagated relativistic test particles in the field of a steady three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulation of the solar wind. We used the code MPI-AMRVAC for the wind simulations and integrated the relativistic guiding center equations using a new third-order-accurate predictor-corrector time-integration scheme. Turbulence-induced scattering of the particle trajectories in velocity space was taken into account through the inclusion of a constant field-aligned scattering mean free path $\lambda_\parallel$. We considered mid-range SEP electrons of $81\:{\rm keV}$ injected into the solar wind at a heliocentric distance of 0.28 AU and a magnetic latitude of $24^{\circ}$. For $\lambda_\parallel =0.5\:{\rm AU}$, the simulated velocity pitch angle distributions agree qualitatively well with in situ measurements at 1 AU. More generally, for $\lambda_\parallel$ in the range 0.1 to 1\:AU, an energy-loss rate associated with the velocity drift of about $10\%$ per day is observed. The energy loss is attributable to the magnetic curvature and gradient-induced poleward drifts of the electrons against the dominant component of the electric field. In our case study, which is representative of the average solar wind conditions, the observed drift-induced energy-loss rate is fastest near a heliocentric distance of 1.2 AU. We emphasize that adiabatic cooling is the dominant mechanism during the first 1.5 hours of propagation. Only at later times does the drift-associated loss rate become dominant.</description>

      <title>Physics-Based Simulation of the 2013 April 11 Solar Energetic Particle Event</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07581v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solar energetic particles (SEPs) can pose hazardous radiation risks to both humans and spacecraft electronics in space. Numerical modeling based on first principles offers valuable insights into the underlying physics of SEPs and provides synthetic observables for SEPs at any time and location in the inner heliosphere. In this work, we present a numerical scheme, which conserves the number of particles based on integral relations for Poisson brackets \citep{sokolov2023high}, to solve the kinetic equation for particle acceleration and transport processes. We implement this scheme within the Space Weather Modeling Framework, developed at the University of Michigan. In addition, we develop a new shock-capturing tool to study the coronal mass ejection-driven shock originating from the low solar corona. These methodological advancements are applied to conduct a comprehensive study of a historical SEP event on April 11, 2013. Multi-spacecraft observations, including SOHO, SDO, GOES and ACE near Earth, and STEREO-A/B, are used for model--data comparison and validation. We show synthetic observables, including extreme ultraviolet and white-light images, proton time--intensity profiles, and energy spectra, and discuss their differences and probable explanations compared to observations. Our simulation results demonstrate the application of the Poisson bracket scheme with a particle solver to simulating a historical SEP event. We also show the capability of extracting the complex shock surface using our shock-capturing tool and understand how the complex shock surface affects the particle acceleration process.</description>
