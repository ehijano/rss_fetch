      <title>E-21 Level Instability Frequency Dissemination over 2067 km noisy Telecommunication Infrastructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The realization of ultra stable optical frequency transmission through fiber networks is critical for advancing global optical frequency standards and enabling applications such as redefining the second in the International System of Units, geophysical sensing, quantum network construction, and fundamental physics experiments. However, achieving high reliability and low instability optical frequency carrier transmission links over distances exceeding thousands of kilometers remains technically challenging, thereby limiting the scalability and reliability of such networks. In this study, we experimentally demonstrate that the noise accumulation in long distance optical links can be mitigated by narrowband purification of the optical signal's phase noise, enabling optical links of theoretically unlimited length. Additionally, we implemented digital optical phase measurement and feedback technology to calibrate noise compensation deviations caused by inconsistencies in round trip optical frequencies, enhancing link stability. By adopting digital phase measurement instead of traditional phase detectors, we expanded the dynamic noise tolerance range of the optical phase-locked loop, significantly improving system reliability. Ultimately, on a 2067 km telecommunications fiber link with a noise level exceeding 5000 rad^2/Hz.km, we achieved an optical frequency transfer with a daily instability of 2.9 E-21 without experiencing any optical cycle slips maintaining continuous operation for four days. This work establishes a technical foundation for leveraging existing fiber resources to construct global scale optical frequency standard networks.</description>

      <title>Inverse-Designed Dot Product Engine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The work presents an inverse-designed optical cavity that can direct light from two sources such that if the sources were to represent any number in the range [-1,1] with magnitude encoded through the power emitted by the source and sign by switching the direction of source current, the photocurrent generated at the two output ports is proportional to the product of the two numbers. Let us say that the two sources encode x and y, which are two numbers $\in$ [-1,1]. Multiplication is reduced to the form $(x+y)^2 - (x-y)^2 = 4xy \propto xy$. The addition and subtraction operations of the numbers are supported by constructive and destructive interference, respectively. The work shows that replacing the DDOT dot product engine of the Lightening Transformer with the optical cavity proposed to calculate the dot product can lead to a reduction in the area occupied by the photonic core by 88 \%, can reduce the power consumption by lasers by around 23.43 \%, and bring down energy consumption while training DeiT models by 0.88 \%. The cavities can generate photocurrents of the form $1.057 xy + 0.249$ with $R^2=0.88,$ thus showing a relationship of direct proportionality between the target product $xy$ and the output of the cavity in response to stimuli encoding $x$ and $y$.</description>

      <title>Large-scale compressive microscopy via diffractive multiplexing across a sensor array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microscopes face a trade-off between spatial resolution, field-of-view, and frame rate -- improving one of these properties typically requires sacrificing the others, due to the limited spatiotemporal throughput of the sensor. To overcome this, we propose a new microscope that achieves snapshot gigapixel-scale imaging with a sensor array and a diffractive optical element (DOE). We improve the spatiotemporal throughput in two ways. First, we capture data with an array of 48 sensors resulting in 48x more pixels than a single sensor. Second, we use point spread function (PSF) engineering and compressive sensing algorithms to fill in the missing information from the gaps surrounding the individual sensors in the array, further increasing the spatiotemporal throughput of the system by an additional &gt;5.4x. The array of sensors is modeled as a single large-format "super-sensor," with erasures corresponding to the gaps between the individual sensors. The array is placed at the output of a (nearly) 4f imaging system, and we design a DOE for the Fourier plane that generates a distributed PSF that encodes information from the entire super-sensor area, including the gaps. We then computationally recover the large-scale image, assuming the object is sparse in some domain. Our calibration-free microscope can achieve ~3 {\mu}m resolution over &gt;5.2 cm^2 FOVs at up to 120 fps, culminating in a total spatiotemporal throughput of 25.2 billion pixels per second. We demonstrate the versatility of our microscope in two different modes: structural imaging via darkfield contrast and functional fluorescence imaging of calcium dynamics across dozens of freely moving C. elegans simultaneously.</description>

      <title>Coherent Ising Machines: The Good, The Bad, The Ugly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analog computing using bosonic computational states is a leading approach to surpassing the computational speed and energy limitations of von Neumann architectures. But the challenges of manufacturing large-scale photonic integrated circuits (PIC) has led to hybrid solutions that integrate optical analog and electronic digital components. A notable example is the coherent Ising machine (CIM), that was primarily invented for solving quadratic binary optimization problems. In this paper, we focus on a mean-field interpretation of the dynamics of optical pulses in the CIM as solutions to Langevin dynamics, a stochastic differential equation (SDE) that plays a key role in non-convex optimization and generative AI. This interpretation establishes a computational framework for understanding the system's operation, the computational role of each component, and its performance, strengths, and limitations. We then infer that the CIM is inherently a continuous state machine, capable of integrating a broad range of SDEs, in particular for solving a continuous global (or mildly constrained) optimization problems. Nevertheless, we observe that the iterative digital-to-analog and analog-to-digital conversions within the protocol create a bottleneck for the low power and high speed of optics to shine. This observation underscores the need for major advances in PIC technologies as we envision that fully analog opto-electronic realizations of such experiments can open doors for broader applications, and orders of magnitude improvements in speed and energy consumption.</description>

      <title>Label free sub-diffraction imaging using non-linear photon avalanche backlight</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical imaging below the limit of light diffraction offers an unprecedented opportunity to study outlook, organization, interactions or in-situ functioning of sub-micrometer, highly transparent objects such as subcellular structures in vitro, thin layers or nano-engineered devices. However, most of current methodologies require to use specially designed luminescent labels, which not only may affect the properties of the sample itself, but often are (photo)toxic, susceptible to photobleaching, offer limited color combinations or specificity of labeling. Moreover, the dedicated fluorescence based super-resolution optical techniques are often technically complex and cumbersome to use. The existing non-destructive, non-invasive and label-free super-resolution imaging (SRI) methods are also challenging, complex and elusive to apply. To address these issues, here we propose and experimentally demonstrate a new concept of label-free sub-diffraction optical imaging. The transmission avalanche backlight (TAB) microscopy exploits huge optical non-linearities of photon avalanching materials, which are acting as a virtual near-field nano aperture - a diffraction limited backlight of the actual sample. Such approach enables to augment imaging contrast of highly transparent samples and thin layers, by translating small attenuation and scattering loses occurring on these translucent samples into amplified modulation of luminescence intensity of the avalanche backlighted substrate (ABS). At no additional cost, sub-diffraction imaging is achieved with simple, single beam laser scanning microscopy setup, leading to ca. 70 nm optical resolution. This far-field, label-free, raster scanning imaging technique, with augmented contrast and optical imaging resolution below diffraction limit, may become pivotal for studies in biology, physics, materials science, nanophotonics and nanoengineering</description>

      <title>Tailoring Spatial Modes Produced by Stimulated Parametric Downconversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically study and experimentally demonstrate controlled generation of spatial modes of light via stimulated parametric downconversion (StimPDC) by transferring the spatial structure of a pump beam to the stimulated idler beam. We show how the beam characteristics of the stimulated beam depends on both the pump and seed beam's characteristics, enabling experimental control over size and propagation behavior. We also show how to control and improve the fidelity of different spatial modes, and demonstrate that the angular basis ensures uniform fidelity across modes generated with StimPDC.</description>

      <title>Ultralow-V{\pi}L Silicon Electro-Optic Directional Coupler Switch with a Liquid Crystal Cladding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An ultralow-V{\pi}L photonic switch device is demonstrated utilizing the high optical and electrical field confinement in silicon slot waveguides coupled with the strong electro-optic response of nematic liquid crystals. A silicon photonic directional coupler switch with a modulation efficiency of 0.0195 Vmm and a loss-efficiency product of 0.0624 VdB is achieved. The 1.5 mm long device is based on two-mode interference within a single slot waveguide resulting in a V{\pi} of 0.013 V and an extinction ratio of ~ 9dB at 1550 nm wavelength. The power consumption of the photonic switch is estimated to be below 0.6 nW and it possesses a response time of &lt;1.5 ms. A comparative performance study between the directional coupler switch and a Mach-Zehnder Interferometer (MZI) switch is performed. The directional coupler switch is projected to have a smaller footprint and lower optical loss compared to a similar design MZI switch making it a strong candidate for switch matrix designs and applications.</description>

      <title>On-Demand Inverse Design for Narrowband Nanophotonic Structures Based on Generative Model and Tandem Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inverse design in nanophotonics remains challenging due to its ill-posed nature and sensitivity to input inaccuracies. We present a novel framework that combines a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) with a tandem network, enabling robust and efficient on-demand inverse design of photonic structures. Unlike prior approaches that use CVAEs or tandem networks in isolation, our method integrates spectral adjustment and structural prediction in a unified architecture. Specifically, the CVAE adjusts the idealized target spectra, such as Lorentzian-shaped notches, making them more physically realizable and consistent with the training data distribution. This adjusted spectrum is then passed to the tandem network, which predicts the corresponding structural parameters. The framework effectively handles both narrowband (&lt;50 nm) and highly complex spectra, while addressing the one-to-many mapping challenge inherent in inverse design. The model achieves high accuracy, and the designed spectra closely match full-wave simulation results, validating its practicality for advanced nanophotonic applications.</description>

      <title>Defect Engineered Layer Dependent Nonlinear Optical Response in Two Dimensional Muscovite for Efficient Optical Limiting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light-matter interactions in two-dimensional (2D) materials have gained significant interest due to their distinctive optical and electronic properties. Recently, silicates have emerged as a promising new class of 2D materials, but their nonlinear optical properties remain largely unexplored. In this study, we demonstrate layer-dependent nonlinear absorption and optical limiting capabilities of 2D muscovite using femtosecond laser excitation at 450 nm. The two-photon absorption (TPA) coefficient is highly sensitive to both the number of layers and excitation intensity, increasing markedly from (3.91+/-0.06)x10^3 cm GW^-1 in multilayer structures to (6.94+/-0.17)x10^5 cm GW^-1 in the monolayer limit at a peak intensity of 68 GW cm^-2, highlighting a strong layer-dependent enhancement in nonlinear absorption. Additionally, monolayer muscovite exhibits an optical limiting threshold of 1.46 mJ cm^-2, outperforming graphene and other 2D dichalcogenides. This enhanced TPA arises from quantum confinement and intrinsic lattice defects that facilitate nonlinear optical transitions. Density functional theory reveals that liquid-phase exfoliation disrupts potassium interlayers and induces oxygen vacancies, generating mid-gap electronic states that significantly enhance TPA. These insights open new avenues for designing low-fluence, high-efficiency optical limiters using 2D silicates.</description>

      <title>A focusing optical phased array for tissue interrogation with side-lobe suppression and simplified beam steering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We implement an integrated multi-electrode array on a silicon-nitride-based photonic integrated circuit for ex-vivo retinal characterization via optical stimulation. The interrogation beam formers, based on curved grating emitters and optical phased arrays, are designed to achieve transverse focusing with spot sizes in the 1 - 2 $\mu$m range to target single cells. The experimentally realized focusing optical phased arrays show suppressed side-lobes, with approximately 11.5% of the power in each side-lobe and ~60% in the main lobe, reducing unintentional cellular excitation. Additional design refinement enables further suppression of the side-lobes to a few percent of the total power. Additionally, we demonstrate a compact design of meandered thermal phase shifters implemented across the array that allow push-pull steering in the transverse direction as well as focusing and defocusing of the beam, with a total of only four control signals. Transverse angular steering by $\pm$5.1{\deg} and axial translation of the focal spot by 204 $\mu$m are demonstrated with tuning currents below 50 mA, together with longitudinal angular steering by 4.26{\deg} obtained by means of wavelength tuning in a $\pm$15 nm range centered on 525 nm.</description>

      <title>Source Wavefront Generation for a Non-Interferometric Reconfigurable Null Test using a Photonic Lantern</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A method is presented to use a fiber-optic device known as a photonic lantern to generate a reconfigurable custom wavefront for a null test of spherical, aspheric, and freeform optical surfaces. By modulating input intensity and phases at single mode fiber input ports, the wavefront of the output light field from the multimode end can be controlled to generate a custom nulling phase function. Generation of a desired wavefront is demonstrated by simulating a nineteen-port non-mode-selective photonic lantern. Using a linear response-matrix approach, a phase function with an RMS error of 44 nm from the target was generated in simulation. A compact form-factor noninterferometric null test for freeform optical surfaces is then described utilizing the photonic lantern as both a reconfigurable nulling source and a wavefront sensor.</description>

      <title>Generating and Weaving Topological Event Wavepackets in Photonic Spacetime Crystals with Fully Energy-Momentum Gapped</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel type of topological excitation topological event wavepackets (TEWs) emerging in photonic spacetime crystals (STCs) with spacetime modulated dielectric constants. These TEWs exhibit strong spatiotemporal localization and are topologically protected by a fully opened energy momentum ({\omega}k) gap, within which conventional steady states are absent. We further demonstrate that TEWs are spectrally confined within the {\omega}k-gap, providing a combined measurement for probing the emergence of TEW and the {\omega}k-gap size. Furthermore, we construct a spacetime winding number to elucidate the protection of these events. Unlike previously reported nolinearity-induced event solitons, TEWs originate from topological configuration for linear media, thereby more accessible and versatile for experimental realization. Moreover, we show that TEWs can be periodically woven to form an event lattice, enabling to suppress unwanted noise amplification. Our findings open a new pathway toward topological control in photonic spacetime-modulated systems, enabling the {\omega}k-gap band enginering for wave manipulation ranging from microwave to optical regimes.</description>

      <title>Giant Resonance Raman Scattering via Anisotropic Excitons in ReS2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anisotropic two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors recently have emerged as a promising platform for polarization-controlled Raman amplification. In this study, we probe energy-dependent resonant Raman scattering in few layer ReS2 under different polarization configurations. We identify two distinct excitation regimes, each characterized by a resonance condition where either the pump or the Stokes photon energy aligns with an excitonic transition. A two-order-of-magnitude enhancement in Raman intensity is observed when the pump energy is tuned near the exciton resonance. Under Stokes-resonant conditions, additional Raman lines accompanied by excitonic photoluminescence are observed, suggesting the participation of non-Bloch intermediate states in the scattering process. These findings shed light into the influence of excitons in modulating nonlinear optical phenomena in anisotropic 2D materials, offering valuable insights for the design of tunable photonic and optoelectronic devices based on anisotropic layered materials.</description>

      <title>Hypergraph modelling of wave scattering to speed-up material design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hypergraphs offer a generalized framework for understanding complex systems, covering group interactions of different orders beyond traditional pairwise interactions. This modelling allows for the simplified description of simultaneous interactions among multiple elements in coupled oscillators, graph neural networks, and entangled qubits. Here, we employ this generalized framework to describe wave-matter interactions for material design acceleration. By devising the set operations for multiparticle systems, we develop the hypergraph model, which compactly describes wave interferences among multiparticles in scattering events by hyperedges of different orders. This compactness enables an evolutionary algorithm with O(N1/2) time complexity and approximated accuracy for designing stealthy hyperuniform materials, which is superior to traditional methods of O(N) scaling. By hybridizing our hypergraph evolutions to the conventional collective-coordinate method, we preserve the original accuracy, while achieving substantial speed-up in approaching near the optimum. Our result paves the way toward scalable material design and compact interpretations of large-scale multiparticle systems.</description>

      <title>Nanosecond-latency all-optical fiber sensing with in-sensor computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical fiber sensing plays a crucial role in modern measurement systems and holds significant promise for a wide range of applications. This potential, though, has been fundamentally constrained by the intrinsic latency and power limitations associated with electronic signal processing. Here, we propose an all-optical fiber sensing architecture with in-sensor computing (AOFS-IC) that achieves fully optical-domain sensing signal demodulation at the speed of light. By integrating a scattering medium with an optimized diffractive optical network, AOFS-IC enables linear mapping of physical perturbations to detected intensity, and sensing results can be directly read out without electronic processing. The proposed system maintains high accuracy across various sensing tasks, providing sub-nano strain resolution and 100% torsional angle classification accuracy, as well as multiplexed sensing of multiple physical quantities, and performing multi-degree-of-freedom robot arm monitoring. AOFS-IC eliminates computing hardware requirements while providing &lt;3 ns demodulation delay, which is more than 2 orders of magnitude faster than conventional fiber optic sensing systems. This work demonstrates the potential of next-generation optical sensing systems empowered by all-optical computing, and paves the way for expanded applications of fiber sensing through the integration of fully optical components, ultrafast measurement speed, and low power consumption.</description>

      <title>Linearly-polarized few-cycle pulses drive carrier envelope phase-sensitive coherent magnetization injection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Circularly-polarized light is well-known to induce, or flip the direction of, magnetization in solids. At its heart, this arises from time-reversal symmetry breaking by the vector potential, causing inverse-Faraday or analogous physical effects. We show here that very short few-cycle pulses can cause similar phenomena even when they are linearly-polarized and off-resonant. We analyze the new effect with ab-initio calculations and demonstrate that it similarly arises due to broken time-reversal symmetry and is carrier-envelope-phase (CEP) sensitive. Coherently tuning the CEP causes the induced magnetism to oscillate from zero to few percent Bohr magneton within few femtoseconds. By changing the laser angle and intensity, the magnetization sign and magnitude can be controlled. Remarkably, due to the nature of the physical mechanism that relies on spin-orbit interactions and orbital currents, the magnetization survives CEP-averaging and the effect should be accessible even in the absence of CEP stabilization. Our work opens new routes for ultrafast coherent tuning and probing of magnetism and circumvents the need for circularly-polarized driving or external magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Spatial Hole Burning Dynamics in Monolayer WS2: Insights from Time-resolved Photoluminescence Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transport of excitons lies at the heart of excitonic devices. Probing, understanding, and manipulating excitonic transport represents a critical step prior to their technological applications. In this work, we report experimental studies on the ultrafast nonlinear transport of excitons in monolayer WS2. Under intense optical pumping, we observed an ultrafast spatial hole burning effect in the excitonic emission profile, followed by a re-brightening at even higher pumping density. By means of time- and spatially-resolved photoluminescence imaging spectroscopy, we revealed the underlying mechanism responsible for these nontrivial excitonic diffusion dynamics. Our results demonstrate that the combined effects of ultrafast exciton-exciton annihilation, efficient hole trapping by intrinsic sulfur vacancy defects, and laser-induced photo-oxidation govern the evolution of exciton transport under strong optical excitation. The observed dynamics are in excellent agreement with our diffusion model simulations, providing new insights into the nonlinear excitonic transport behaviors as well as their optical control mechanism in two-dimensional semiconductors.</description>

      <title>Quantum Optical Electron Pulse Shaper</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coherent control of ultrafast quantum phenomena benefits from the pulse-shaping capabilities allowing to modulate the envelope and instantaneous phase of optical fields on femtosecond time scales. While such control is available for optical fields, an analogy of a pulse shaper for freely propagating electrons is lacking. In this study, we theoretically demonstrate a method that enables near arbitrary light-based shaping of electron wave packets in the time domain. The method is based on the quantum phase modulation of electron waves by coherent light with time-dependent frequency leading to generation of spectrally separated electron energy side bands with shaped time-energy profiles and envelopes. Our results show that few femtosecond time durations can be achieved without additional spectral broadening of the electron wave packet, allowing one to reach the combination of high time, spatial, and spectral resolutions in ultrafast imaging and diffraction experiments with pulsed electron beams.</description>

      <title>Photonic time crystals assisted by quasi-bound states in the continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic time crystals are a class of artificial materials that have only recently been explored. They are characterized by the ultrafast modulation of the material properties in time, causing a momentum bandgap for light that propagates through such novel states of matter. However, the observation of these unique properties at optical frequencies remains elusive, as the necessary modulation amplitudes of the permittivity to show notable momentum bandgaps are relatively high, inaccessible with available materials. While it has been known that structuring photonic time crystals at the sub-wavelength scale can enhance the momentum bandgap, we push this concept to the extreme by leveraging the nanophotonic toolbox. Specifically, we demonstrate that nanophotonic structures composed of scatterers supporting quasi-bound states in the continuum can significantly reduce the required amplitude of temporal permittivity modulation by enhancing the interaction time between light and time-varying matter. This allows us to observe extremely wide momentum bandgaps despite the material properties having tiny modulation amplitudes. Our approach bridges the concepts of bound states in the continuum and time-varying metamaterials, paving the way toward realizable photonic time crystals at optical frequencies.</description>

      <title>Super-resolution AWGs based on the Moir\`e effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enhancing spectral resolution in a conventional arrayed waveguide grating AWG requires a longer differential optical path, which expands the device footprint and increases sensitivity to phase noise. To overcome this limitation, we propose an innovative approach that maintains the AWG layout and introduces an additional splitter at the device input. Leveraging the Moir\`e effect, generated by two gratings with slightly different pitches, we demonstrate that the spacing of 7 channels multiplexer/demultiplexer can be reduced to $1$ GHz at the central wavelength of 1550 nm. We present the theoretical foundation for a super-resolution AWG and provide the corresponding design guidelines.</description>

      <title>Polarization Vortex for Enhanced Refractive Index Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although all-dielectric sensors exhibit minimal absorption and a high figure of merit (FOM), their sensitivity is significantly lower compared to plasmonic sensors. One approach to enhancing the sensitivity of dielectric sensors is utilizing bound states in the continuum (BICs), which are resonant states with an infinite radiative lifetime. These states are characterized by polarization vortices in the far field, whose winding number determines the topological charge. Here, we demonstrate that the position of a BIC polarization vortex in the k-space has a square-root dependence on changes in the refractive index of the medium similar to an exceptional point. We compute the angular and spectral sensitivities of our structure and demonstrate that the angular sensitivity reaches values comparable to those of surface plasmon polariton (SPP)-based sensors. We observe a blue spectral shift of BICs as the refractive index of the surrounding medium increases, a behavior that differs from the conventional spectral response typically expected under such perturbations. Additionally, we found a distinct BIC regime exhibiting a pronounced angular sensitivity, surpassing its spectral one. Our findings pave the way for the development of dielectric sensors with high angular sensitivity and facilitate the practical observation of the optical vortex dynamics.</description>

      <title>Fourier Plane Tomographic Spectroscopy Reveals Orientation-Dependent Multipolar Plasmon Modes in Micrometer-Scale Janus Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plasmonic Janus particles, comprising dielectric cores with thin metallic caps, exhibit complex optical properties due to their asymmetric structure. Despite applications in active matter research, their orientation-dependent scattering properties remain largely unexplored. We introduce Fourier plane tomographic spectroscopy for simultaneous four-dimensional characterization of scattering from individual micrometer-scale particles across wavelength, incident angle, scattering angle, and polarization. Combining measurements with finite-element simulations, we identify discrete spectral markers in visible and near-infrared regions that evolve predictably with cap orientation. Spherical-harmonics decomposition reveals these markers arise from three distinct multipolar modes up to fifth order: axial-propagating transverse-electric, transverse-propagating transverse-electric, and transverse-propagating axial-electric, with retardation-induced splitting. We observe progressive red-shifts and linewidth narrowing of higher-order resonances, demonstrating curvature's influence on mode dispersion. Orientation-specific scattering patterns exhibit polarization-dependent features enabling optical tracking of particle rotation. Our framework applies to diverse material combinations and geometries, offering a toolkit for designing orientation-responsive nanoantennas, reconfigurable metasurfaces, and active colloidal systems with tailored light-matter interactions.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation-induced Hall-like lateral forces in a chiral-gain environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here, we demonstrate that vacuum fluctuations can induce lateral forces on a small particle positioned near a translation-invariant uniform non-Hermitian substrate with chiral gain. This type of non-Hermitian response can be engineered by biasing a low-symmetry conductor with a static electric field and is rooted in the quantum geometry of the material through the Berry curvature dipole. The chiral-gain material acts as an active medium for a particular circular polarisation handedness, while serving as a passive, dissipative medium for the other polarisation handedness. Owing to the nonreciprocity and gain characteristics, momentum is continuously exchanged in a preferred direction parallel to the surface between the test particle and the surrounding electromagnetic field, giving rise to lateral forces. Interestingly, the force can be viewed as a fluctuation-induced drag linked to the nonlinear Hall current. Indeed, although the gain is driven by an electric current, the resulting force acts perpendicular to the bias -- unlike conventional current-drag effects. This effect stems from the skewed propagation characteristics of surface modes and gain-momentum locking. Our theory reveals a Hall-like asymmetry in the field correlations and establishes a novel link between quantum geometry and fluctuation-induced phenomena, offering new possibilities for nanoscale control via tailored electromagnetic environments.</description>

      <title>Optics in spiral dislocation spacetime: Torsion as a geometric waveguide and frequency-filtering mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an exact analytical investigation of null trajectories and scalar wave propagation in a $(2+1)$-dimensional spacetime containing a spiral dislocation-a topological defect characterized by torsion in the absence of curvature. For null rays, the torsion parameter $\beta$ modifies the affine structure, enforcing a finite turning radius $r_{\min} = \sqrt{b^2 - \beta^2}$ and inducing a torsion-mediated angular deflection that decreases monotonically with increasing $\beta$. The photon trajectory deviates from the curvature-induced lensing paradigm, exhibiting a purely topological exclusion zone around the defect core. In the wave regime, we recast the Helmholtz equation into a Schr\"odinger-like form and extract a spatially and spectrally dependent refractive index $n^2(r,k)$. This index asymptotically approaches unity at large distances, but diverges strongly and negatively near the dislocation core due to torsion-induced geometric terms. The resulting refractive index profile governs the transition from propagating to evanescent wave behavior, with low-frequency modes experiencing pronounced localization and suppression. Our findings reveal that torsion alone, absent any curvature, can act as a geometric regulator of both classical and quantum propagation, inducing effective anisotropy, frequency filtering, and confinement. This framework provides a rare exact realization of light-matter interaction in a torsion-dominated background, with potential applications in analog gravity systems and photonic metamaterials engineered to replicate non-Riemannian geometries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) are central to modern display technologies and are promising candidates for low-cost energy-efficient lighting. Their performance is determined by numerous, intricate fabrication parameters, but not least by the number of emissive molecules N, which provide sites for electron-hole recombination and photon generation in the diode host matrix. Counterintuitively, larger concentrations of emitters do not always lead to brighter or more efficient OLEDs due to concentration quenching of luminescence meaning that rates of radiative electron-hole recombination can become severely reduced, negatively impacting charge-to-photon conversion efficiency. In this work we trigger steady-state superradiant light emission from a series of Fabry-P\'erot microcavity OLEDs by scaling the operating voltage of each device with emitter concentration. We demonstrate a collective enhancement in the luminance of a microcavity OLED that scales super-extensively when compared to no-cavity controls fabricated in the same run. Triggering quantum correlations between emitters via the confined cavity field allows devices with fewer emitters to match or even exceed the brightness of control OLEDs even when driven by lower voltages. Moreover, our devices show significant narrowing of their emission spectra, offering purer colours at low applied voltages. Leveraging collective effects in microcavity OLEDs provides a new approach to enable brighter, more efficient devices paving the way for next-generation displays and lighting that do not compromise performance for operational efficiency or device lifetime.</description>

      <title>Efficient ultrafast photoacoustic transduction on Tantalum thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nano-acoustic strain generation in thin metallic films via ultrafast laser excitation is widely used in material science, imaging and medical applications. Recently, it was shown that transition metals, such as Titanium, exhibit enhanced photoacoustic transduction properties compared to noble metals, such as Silver. This work presents experimental results and simulations that demonstrate that among transition metals Tantalum exhibits superior photoacoustic properties. Experiments of nano-acoustic strain generation by femtosecond laser pulses focused on thin Tantalum films deposited on Silicon substrates are presented. The nano-acoustic strains are measured via pump-probe transient reflectivity that captures the Brillouin oscillations produced by photon-phonon interactions. The observed Brillouin oscillations are correlated to the photoacoustic transduction efficiency of the Tantalum thin film and compared to the performance of Titanium thin films, clearly demonstrating the superior photoacoustic transduction efficiency of Tantalum. The findings are supported by computational results on the laser-induced strains and their propagation in these thin metal film/substrate systems using a Two-Temperature Model in combination with thermo-mechanical Finite Element Analysis. Finally, the role of the metal transducer-substrate acoustic impedance matching is discussed and the possibility to generate appropriately modulated acoustic pulse trains inside the crystalline substrate structures for the development of crystalline undulators used for {\gamma}-ray generation is presented.</description>

      <title>A Robust COTS Objective for Diffraction-Limited, High-NA, Long Front Working Distance Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a robust objective lens optimized for applications requiring both high numerical aperture (NA) and long front working distance imaging comprised of all commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) singlet lenses. Unlike traditional designs that require separate collimation and refocusing stages, our approach directly converges imaged light to the back focal plane using a single lens group. Our configuration corrects spherical aberrations and efficiently collects light to achieve diffraction-limited performance across a wide range of wavelengths while simplifying alignment and assembly. Using this approach, we design and construct an example objective lens that features a long front working distance of 61 mm and a clipped NA of 0.30 (limited by an aperture in our experimental setup). We experimentally verify that it achieves monochromatic diffraction-limited resolution at wavelengths from 375 nm to 866 nm without requiring replacement of the lenses or changing the inter-lens spacings, and its performance remains robust across a 46 mm range variation in total length (by adjusting mainly the back working distances). Additionally, we develop a quantitative method to measure the field of view (FOV) using an experimentally-calibrated pinhole target. Under 397 nm illumination (i.e. from $^{40}$Ca$^+$ ion fluorescence), the objective achieves a resolution of 0.87 $\mu$m with a 540 $\mu$m FOV. This robust, all-COTS, and versatile design is well-suited for a broad range of experiments, supporting high-precision measurements and exploring quantum phenomena.</description>

      <title>Transversality-Enforced Tight-Binding Models for 3D Photonic Crystals aided by Topological Quantum Chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.18257v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tight-binding models can accurately replicate the band structure and topology of crystalline systems. They have been widely used in solid-state physics due to their versatility and low computational cost. It is straightforward to build an accurate tight-binding model of any crystalline system using the crystal's maximally localized Wannier functions as a basis. Unfortunately, in 3D photonic crystals, the transversality condition of Maxwell's equations precludes the construction of a basis of maximally localized Wannier functions via usual techniques. As a result, building reliable tight-binding models of 3D photonic crystals has not been straightforward up to now. In this work, we show how to overcome this problem using topological quantum chemistry, allowing us to express the band structure of the photonic crystal as a difference of band representations. This can be achieved by introducing a set of auxiliary modes, as recently proposed in Christensen et al., Phys. Rev. X 12, 021066 (2022), which regularizes the Gamma-point obstruction arising from the transversality constraint of Maxwell's equations. The decomposition into elementary band representations allows us to isolate a set of pseudo-orbitals that permit us to construct an accurate transversality-enforced tight-binding model that matches the dispersion, symmetry content, and topology of the 3D photonic crystal under study. Moreover, we show how to introduce the effects of a gyrotropic bias in the framework, modeled via non-minimal coupling to a static magnetic field. Our work provides the first systematic method to analytically model the photonic bands of the lowest transverse modes over the entire Brillouin zone via a transversality-enforced tight-binding model.</description>

      <title>A reconfigurable arbitrary retarder array as complex structured matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18148v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tuneable retarder arrays, such as spatially patterned liquid crystal devices, have given rise to impressive photonic functionality, fuelling diverse applications ranging from microscopy and holography to encryption and communications. Presently these solutions are limited by the controllable degrees of freedom of structured matter, hindering applications that demand photonic systems with high flexibility and reconfigurable topologies. Here we demonstrate a compound modulator that implements a synthetic tuneable arbitrary retarder array as virtual pixels derived by cascading low functionality tuneable devices, realising full dynamic control of its arbitrary elliptical axis geometry, retardance value, and induced phase. Our approach offers unprecedented functionality that is user-defined and possesses high flexibility, allowing our modulator to act as a new beam generator, analyser, and corrector, opening an exciting path to tuneable topologies of light and matter.</description>

      <title>Continuous and Reversible Electrical Tuning of Fluorescent Decay Rate via Fano Resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20199v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the decay rates of a fluorescent molecule can be controlled by electrically shifting a transparency introduced by a Fano resonance. An auxiliary quantum object (QO), located at the hotspot of a plasmonic nanoparticle, suppresses plasmonic excitation at its level spacing {\omega}_QO. As a result, the local density of states (LDOS) associated with the plasmonic spectrum is also suppressed at {\omega}={\omega}_QO. By shifting {\omega}_QO via an applied voltage, we continuously tune the radiative and nonradiative decay rates of the fluorescent molecule by up to two orders of magnitude. This mechanism offers a valuable tool for integrated quantum technologies, enabling on-demand entanglement and single-photon sources, voltage-controlled quantum gate operations, and electrical control of superradiant-like phase transitions. The approach also holds promise for applications in super-resolution microscopy and surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS).</description>

      <title>Direct Observation of Strongly Tilted Dirac Points at General Positions in the Reciprocal Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08275v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Type-II Dirac points (DPs), which occur at the intersection of strongly tilted and touching energy bands, exhibit many intriguing physical phenomena fundamentally different from the non-tilted type-I counterparts. Over the past decade, their discovery has spurred extensive research into electronic systems and other Bloch-wave systems, such as photonic and phononic crystals. However, current studies typically focus on type-II DPs along high-symmetry directions in the first Brillouin zone (FBZ) under mirror symmetry conditions, which are highly restrictive and limit further investigations and applications. To overcome the stringent constraint, here we identify and demonstrate the emergence of type-II DPs at general positions inside the FBZ without requiring the mirror symmetry. The type-II DPs, being accidental degeneracies, are experimentally realized on a metacrystal slab with H-shaped metallic patterns. Our findings indicate that even in the absence of mirror symmetry, type-II DPs can emerge at designated locations inside the FBZ by simply rotating the H-shaped patterns and adjusting geometrical and physical parameters. Furthermore, based on the rotated type-II DPs, off-axis conical diffractions have been both realized and experimentally observed. Meanwhile, we discovered that during the rotation process, the type-II DPs transform into off-axis type-I DPs, but still strongly tilted, resulting in the emergence of negative refractions. Hence, the generic method we propose for inducing type-II or strongly tilted type-I DPs without the high-symmetry limitations opens potential avenues for related research. For example, the observed off-axis conical diffraction and negative refraction could inspire future development and applications in photonics and other Bloch-wave systems.</description>

      <title>Vortex-Free Intrinsic Orbital Angular Momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21632v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optical orbital angular momentum (OAM) has traditionally relied on vortex beams with helical phase fronts imparting quantized intrinsic OAM. Here, we introduce a fundamentally vortex_free framework where intrinsic OAM arises from the natural curvature of lights energy flow, specifically, the caustic geometry of self_accelerating beams whose curved trajectories act as orbital highways for photons. This OAM generation mechanism is independent of phase vortices but mirrors celestial orbital motion. Through numerical simulations, experimental characterization, and optomechanical measurements using optical tweezers, we demonstrate intrinsic vortex_free OAM rooted solely in beam intensity architecture. Generalizing beyond geometric caustics to arbitrary optical fields, we demonstrate OAM via curved Poynting_vector energy streamlines, unifying conventional vortex and novel vortex_free OAM under a single quantitative framework. Streamline engineering enables customizable rotational dynamics, including hybrid orbital_cyclonic motions reminiscent of tropical storms, with promising applications in precision optomechanics, optofluidics, and optical analogues of fluid dynamics. This energy-flow perspective offers a versatile platform for designing and quantifying OAM across structured light.</description>

Abstract: The nonlinear electrodynamics proposed by Bandos, Lechner, Sorokin and Townsend is a remarkable theory that unifies Maxwell, Bialynicki-Birula and ModMax theories, which are known theories invariant under conformal transformations and electromagnetic duality transformations. In the Bandos-Lechner-Sorokin-Townsend nonlinear electrodynamics, we calculate the energy flux density, dispersion relations, refractive indices, phase and group velocities of plane waves as well as the changes of the photon wavelength in the Compton scattering process in the presence of a constant uniform electromagnetic background. Our results are useful for testing and constraining this new theory of nonlinear electrodynamics.</description>

      <title>EgoEvGesture: Gesture Recognition Based on Egocentric Event Camera</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12419v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Egocentric gesture recognition is a pivotal technology for enhancing natural human-computer interaction, yet traditional RGB-based solutions suffer from motion blur and illumination variations in dynamic scenarios. While event cameras show distinct advantages in handling high dynamic range with ultra-low power consumption, existing RGB-based architectures face inherent limitations in processing asynchronous event streams due to their synchronous frame-based nature. Moreover, from an egocentric perspective, event cameras record data that includes events generated by both head movements and hand gestures, thereby increasing the complexity of gesture recognition. To address this, we propose a novel network architecture specifically designed for event data processing, incorporating (1) a lightweight CNN with asymmetric depthwise convolutions to reduce parameters while preserving spatiotemporal features, (2) a plug-and-play state-space model as context block that decouples head movement noise from gesture dynamics, and (3) a parameter-free Bins-Temporal Shift Module (BTSM) that shifts features along bins and temporal dimensions to fuse sparse events efficiently. We further establish the EgoEvGesture dataset, the first large-scale dataset for egocentric gesture recognition using event cameras. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves 62.7% accuracy tested on unseen subjects with only 7M parameters, 3.1% higher than state-of-the-art approaches. Notable misclassifications in freestyle motions stem from high inter-personal variability and unseen test patterns differing from training data. Moreover, our approach achieved a remarkable accuracy of 97.0% on the DVS128 Gesture, demonstrating the effectiveness and generalization capability of our method on public datasets. The dataset and models are made available at https://github.com/3190105222/EgoEv_Gesture.</description>

      <title>Picogram-Level Nanoplastic Analysis with Nanoelectromechanical System Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy: NEMS-FTIR</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10192v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a photothermal infrared spectroscopy-based approach for the chemical characterization and quantification of nanoplastics. By combining the high sensitivity of nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS) with the wide spectral range and ubiquity of commercially available Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometers, NEMS-FTIR offers a cost-efficient and cryogen-free option for the rapid, routine analysis of nanoplastics in aqueous samples. Polypropylene, polystyrene, and polyvinyl chloride nanoplastics with nominal diameters ranging from 54 to 262 nm were analyzed by NEMS-FTIR with limits of detection ranging from 102 pg to 355 pg. The absorptance measured by NEMS-FTIR could be further converted to absolute sample mass using the attenuation coefficient, as demonstrated for polystyrene. Thanks to the wide spectral range of NEMS-FTIR, nanoplastic particles from different polymers could be readily identified, even when present in a mixture. The potential of NEMS-FTIR for the analysis of real samples was demonstrated by identifying the presence of nanoplastics released in water during tea brewing. Polyamide leachates were identified in the brewing water without sample pre-concentration. Accelerated aging of the tea bags under elevated temperature and UV radiation showed further release of polyamide over time.</description>

      <title>Scalable Dip-Coated Bragg Mirrors for Strong Light-Matter Coupling with 2D Perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21726v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report a scalable and cost-effective method for fabricating high-performance Bragg mirrors using a bottom-up approach that combines evaporation-induced self-assembly (EISA) and dip-coating. The photonic crystals are composed of alternating mesoporous SiO$_2$ and dense TiO$_2$ layers, providing a high refractive index contrast ($\sim$0.8). This enables strong reflectance (up to 96%) with as few as five bilayers and precise control of the photonic stop band across the visible spectrum by simply adjusting the deposition parameters. Integration of a thin film of the two-dimensional perovskite (PEA)$_2$PbI$_4$ leads to strong light--matter coupling at room temperature. Angle-resolved reflectance and photoluminescence measurements reveal the formation of upper and lower polariton branches, with a Rabi splitting of 90 meV. The observed polaritonic dispersion is well described by a two-level system and Green's function formalism. This work demonstrates an efficient strategy for constructing tunable optical cavities using simple solution-based methods. The combination of high optical quality, spectral tunability, and strong coupling performance positions this platform as a promising candidate for low-threshold polariton lasers, nonlinear optics, and integrated optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Multislice Hollow Ptychography for Simultaneous Atomic-Layer-Resolved 3D Structural Imaging and Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22352v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electron matter interactions in electron microscopy produce both elastic and inelastic scattering, forming the basis for imaging and spectroscopy. However, the integration of electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) with 4D-STEM and electron ptychography remains challenging because of detector geometry conflicts. Song et al. solved this issue by introducing a hollow type pixelated detector that enables hollow ptychography and allows low angle electrons to go through to the EELS spectrometer. The single-slice approach of hollow ptychography proves effective for 2D thin materials but struggles with multiple scattering in thicker specimens. Here, we introduce multislice hollow ptychography (MHP), a robust imaging modality that overcomes these limitations by accounting for multiple scattering. MHP enables high-resolution structural imaging from hollow diffraction patterns while remaining compatible with simultaneous EELS acquisition. It potentially can provide sub-angstrom lateral resolution at intermediate doses and supports full 3D atomic-layer reconstruction at ultrahigh doses, with up to 70% of total electrons available for spectroscopy. This flexible framework facilitates correlative 3D imaging and chemical mapping in complex materials, including interfaces, defects, and dopants.</description>
