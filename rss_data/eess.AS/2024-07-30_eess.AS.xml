      <title>VoxMed: One-Step Respiratory Disease Classifier using Digital Stethoscope Sounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As respiratory illnesses become more common, it is crucial to quickly and accurately detect them to improve patient care. There is a need for improved diagnostic methods for immediate medical assessments for optimal patient outcomes. This paper introduces VoxMed, a UI-assisted one-step classifier that uses digital stethoscope recordings to diagnose respiratory diseases. It employs an Audio Spectrogram Transformer(AST) for feature extraction and a 1-D CNN-based architecture to classify respiratory diseases, offering professionals information regarding their patients respiratory health in seconds. We use the ICBHI dataset, which includes stethoscope recordings collected from patients in Greece and Portugal, to classify respiratory diseases.

      <title>ASGIR: Audio Spectrogram Transformer Guided Classification And Information Retrieval For Birds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recognition and interpretation of bird vocalizations are pivotal in ornithological research and ecological conservation efforts due to their significance in understanding avian behaviour, performing habitat assessment and judging ecological health. This paper presents an audio spectrogram-guided classification framework called ASGIR for improved bird sound recognition and information retrieval. Our work is accompanied by a simple-to-use, two-step information retrieval system that uses geographical location and bird sounds to localize and retrieve relevant bird information by scraping Wikipedia page information of recognized birds. ASGIR offers a substantial performance on a random subset of 51 classes of Xeno-Canto dataset Bird sounds from European countries with a median of 100\% performance on F1, Precision and Sensitivity metrics. Our code is available as follows: https://github.com/MainSample1234/AS-GIR .</description>

      <title>Dynamic Encoder Size Based on Data-Driven Layer-wise Pruning for Speech Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Varying-size models are often required to deploy ASR systems under different hardware and/or application constraints such as memory and latency. To avoid redundant training and optimization efforts for individual models of different sizes, we present the dynamic encoder size approach, which jointly trains multiple performant models within one supernet from scratch. These subnets of various sizes are layer-wise pruned from the supernet, and thus, enjoy full parameter sharing. By combining score-based pruning with supernet training, we propose two novel methods, Simple-Top-k and Iterative-Zero-Out, to automatically select the best-performing subnets in a data-driven manner, avoiding resource-intensive search efforts. Our experiments using CTC on both Librispeech and TED-LIUM-v2 corpora show that our methods can achieve on-par performance as individually trained models of each size category. Also, our approach consistently brings small performance improvements for the full-size supernet.</description>

      <title>ctPuLSE: Close-Talk, and Pseudo-Label Based Far-Field, Speech Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The current dominant approach for neural speech enhancement is via purely-supervised deep learning on simulated pairs of far-field noisy-reverberant speech (i.e., mixtures) and clean speech. The trained models, however, often exhibit limited generalizability to real-recorded mixtures. To deal with this, this paper investigates training enhancement models directly on real mixtures. However, a major difficulty challenging this approach is that, since the clean speech of real mixtures is unavailable, there lacks a good supervision for real mixtures. In this context, assuming that a training set consisting of real-recorded pairs of close-talk and far-field mixtures is available, we propose to address this difficulty via close-talk speech enhancement, where an enhancement model is first trained on simulated mixtures to enhance real-recorded close-talk mixtures and the estimated close-talk speech can then be utilized as a supervision (i.e., pseudo-label) for training far-field speech enhancement models directly on the paired real-recorded far-field mixtures. We name the proposed system $\textit{ctPuLSE}$. Evaluation results on the CHiME-4 dataset show that ctPuLSE can derive high-quality pseudo-labels and yield far-field speech enhancement models with strong generalizability to real data.</description>

      <title>Frequency &amp; Channel Attention Network for Small Footprint Noisy Spoken Keyword Spotting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we aim to improve the robustness of Keyword Spotting (KWS) systems in noisy environments while keeping a small memory footprint. We propose a new convolutional neural network (CNN) called FCA-Net, which combines mixer unit-based feature interaction with a two-dimensional convolution-based attention module. First, we introduce and compare lightweight attention methods to enhance noise robustness in CNN. Then, we propose an attention module that creates fine-grained attention weights to capture channel and frequency-specific information, boosting the model's ability to handle noisy conditions. By combining the mixer unit-based feature interaction with the attention module, we enhance performance. Additionally, we use a curriculum-based multi-condition training strategy. Our experiments show that our system outperforms current state-of-the-art solutions for small-footprint KWS in noisy environments, making it reliable for real-world use.</description>

      <title>Blind Acoustic Parameter Estimation Through Task-Agnostic Embeddings Using Latent Approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method for blind acoustic parameter estimation from single-channel reverberant speech. The method is structured into three stages. In the first stage, a variational auto-encoder is trained to extract latent representations of acoustic impulse responses represented as mel-spectrograms. In the second stage, a separate speech encoder is trained to estimate low-dimensional representations from short segments of reverberant speech. Finally, the pre-trained speech encoder is combined with a small regression model and evaluated on two parameter regression tasks. Experimentally, the proposed method is shown to outperform a fully end-to-end trained baseline model.</description>

      <title>RAVSS: Robust Audio-Visual Speech Separation in Multi-Speaker Scenarios with Missing Visual Cues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19224v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While existing Audio-Visual Speech Separation (AVSS) methods primarily concentrate on the audio-visual fusion strategy for two-speaker separation, they demonstrate a severe performance drop in the multi-speaker separation scenarios. Typically, AVSS methods employ guiding videos to sequentially isolate individual speakers from the given audio mixture, resulting in notable missing and noisy parts across various segments of the separated speech. In this study, we propose a simultaneous multi-speaker separation framework that can facilitate the concurrent separation of multiple speakers within a singular process. We introduce speaker-wise interactions to establish distinctions and correlations among speakers. Experimental results on the VoxCeleb2 and LRS3 datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in separating mixtures with 2, 3, 4, and 5 speakers, respectively. Additionally, our model can utilize speakers with complete audio-visual information to mitigate other visual-deficient speakers, thereby enhancing its resilience to missing visual cues. We also conduct experiments where visual information for specific speakers is entirely absent or visual frames are partially missing. The results demonstrate that our model consistently outperforms others, exhibiting the smallest performance drop across all settings involving 2, 3, 4, and 5 speakers.</description>

      <title>Navigating the United States Legislative Landscape on Voice Privacy: Existing Laws, Proposed Bills, Protection for Children, and Synthetic Data for AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Privacy is a hot topic for policymakers across the globe, including the United States. Evolving advances in AI and emerging concerns about the misuse of personal data have pushed policymakers to draft legislation on trustworthy AI and privacy protection for its citizens. This paper presents the state of the privacy legislation at the U.S. Congress and outlines how voice data is considered as part of the legislation definition. This paper also reviews additional privacy protection for children. This paper presents a holistic review of enacted and proposed privacy laws, and consideration for voice data, including guidelines for processing children's data, in those laws across the fifty U.S. states. As a groundbreaking alternative to actual human data, ethically generated synthetic data allows much flexibility to keep AI innovation in progress. Given the consideration of synthetic data in AI legislation by policymakers to be relatively new, as compared to that of privacy laws, this paper reviews regulatory considerations for synthetic data.</description>

      <title>Analyzing and reducing the synthetic-to-real transfer gap in Music Information Retrieval: the task of automatic drum transcription</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automatic drum transcription is a critical tool in Music Information Retrieval for extracting and analyzing the rhythm of a music track, but it is limited by the size of the datasets available for training. A popular method used to increase the amount of data is by generating them synthetically from music scores rendered with virtual instruments. This method can produce a virtually infinite quantity of tracks, but empirical evidence shows that models trained on previously created synthetic datasets do not transfer well to real tracks. In this work, besides increasing the amount of data, we identify and evaluate three more strategies that practitioners can use to improve the realism of the generated data and, thus, narrow the synthetic-to-real transfer gap. To explore their efficacy, we used them to build a new synthetic dataset and then we measured how the performance of a model scales and, specifically, at what value it will stagnate when increasing the number of training tracks for different datasets. By doing this, we were able to prove that the aforementioned strategies contribute to make our dataset the one with the most realistic data distribution and the lowest synthetic-to-real transfer gap among the synthetic datasets we evaluated. We conclude by highlighting the limits of training with infinite data in drum transcription and we show how they can be overcome.</description>

      <title>Wavespace: A Highly Explorable Wavetable Generator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wavetable synthesis generates quasi-periodic waveforms of musical tones by interpolating a list of waveforms called wavetable. As generative models that utilize latent representations offer various methods in waveform generation for musical applications, studies in wavetable generation with invertible architecture have also arisen recently. While they are promising, it is still challenging to generate wavetables with detailed controls in disentangling factors within the latent representation. In response, we present Wavespace, a novel framework for wavetable generation that empowers users with enhanced parameter controls. Our model allows users to apply pre-defined conditions to the output wavetables. We employ a variational autoencoder and completely factorize its latent space to different waveform styles. We also condition the generator with auxiliary timbral and morphological descriptors. This way, users can create unique wavetables by independently manipulating each latent subspace and descriptor parameters. Our framework is efficient enough for practical use; we prototyped an oscillator plug-in as a proof of concept for real-time integration of Wavespace within digital audio workspaces (DAWs).</description>

      <title>Practical and Reproducible Symbolic Music Generation by Large Language Models with Structural Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Music generation introduces challenging complexities to large language models. Symbolic structures of music often include vertical harmonization as well as horizontal counterpoint, urging various adaptations and enhancements for large-scale Transformers. However, existing works share three major drawbacks: 1) their tokenization requires domain-specific annotations, such as bars and beats, that are typically missing in raw MIDI data; 2) the pure impact of enhancing token embedding methods is hardly examined without domain-specific annotations; and 3) existing works to overcome the aforementioned drawbacks, such as MuseNet, lack reproducibility. To tackle such limitations, we develop a MIDI-based music generation framework inspired by MuseNet, empirically studying two structural embeddings that do not rely on domain-specific annotations. We provide various metrics and insights that can guide suitable encoding to deploy. We also verify that multiple embedding configurations can selectively boost certain musical aspects. By providing open-source implementations via HuggingFace, our findings shed light on leveraging large language models toward practical and reproducible music generation.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Anti-spoofing Countermeasures Robustness through Joint Optimization and Transfer Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current research in synthesized speech detection primarily focuses on the generalization of detection systems to unknown spoofing methods of noise-free speech. However, the performance of anti-spoofing countermeasures (CM) system is often don't work as well in more challenging scenarios, such as those involving noise and reverberation. To address the problem of enhancing the robustness of CM systems, we propose a transfer learning-based speech enhancement front-end joint optimization (TL-SEJ) method, investigating its effectiveness in improving robustness against noise and reverberation. We evaluated the proposed method's performance through a series of comparative and ablation experiments. The experimental results show that, across different signal-to-noise ratio test conditions, the proposed TL-SEJ method improves recognition accuracy by 2.7% to 15.8% compared to the baseline. Compared to conventional data augmentation methods, our system achieves an accuracy improvement ranging from 0.7% to 5.8% in various noisy conditions and from 1.7% to 2.8% under different RT60 reverberation scenarios. These experiments demonstrate that the proposed method effectively enhances system robustness in noisy and reverberant conditions.</description>

      <title>Emotion-Driven Melody Harmonization via Melodic Variation and Functional Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emotion-driven melody harmonization aims to generate diverse harmonies for a single melody to convey desired emotions. Previous research found it hard to alter the perceived emotional valence of lead sheets only by harmonizing the same melody with different chords, which may be attributed to the constraints imposed by the melody itself and the limitation of existing music representation. In this paper, we propose a novel functional representation for symbolic music. This new method takes musical keys into account, recognizing their significant role in shaping music's emotional character through major-minor tonality. It also allows for melodic variation with respect to keys and addresses the problem of data scarcity for better emotion modeling. A Transformer is employed to harmonize key-adaptable melodies, allowing for keys determined in rule-based or model-based manner. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of our new representation in generating key-aware harmonies, with objective and subjective evaluations affirming the potential of our approach to convey specific valence for versatile melody.</description>

      <title>RGI-Net: 3D Room Geometry Inference from Room Impulse Responses With Hidden First-Order Reflections</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.01513v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Room geometry is important prior information for implementing realistic 3D audio rendering. For this reason, various room geometry inference (RGI) methods have been developed by utilizing the time-of-arrival (TOA) or time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA) information in room impulse responses (RIRs). However, the conventional RGI technique poses several assumptions, such as convex room shapes, the number of walls known in priori, and the visibility of first-order reflections. In this work, we introduce the RGI-Net which can estimate room geometries without the aforementioned assumptions. RGI-Net learns and exploits complex relationships between low-order and high-order reflections in RIRs and, thus, can estimate room shapes even when the shape is non-convex or first-order reflections are missing in the RIRs. RGI-Net includes the evaluation network that separately evaluates the presence probability of walls, so the geometry inference is possible without prior knowledge of the number of walls.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15725v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Human language can be expressed in either written or spoken form, i.e. text or speech. Humans can acquire knowledge from text to improve speaking and listening. However, the quest for speech pre-trained models to leverage unpaired text has just started. In this paper, we investigate a new way to pre-train such a joint speech-text model to learn enhanced speech representations and benefit various speech-related downstream tasks. Specifically, we propose a novel pre-training method, text-guided HuBERT, or T-HuBERT, which performs self-supervised learning over speech to derive phoneme-like discrete representations. And these phoneme-like pseudo-label sequences are firstly derived from speech via the generative adversarial networks (GAN) to be statistically similar to those from additional unpaired textual data. In this way, we build a bridge between unpaired speech and text in an unsupervised manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate the significant superiority of our proposed method over various strong baselines, which achieves up to 15.3% relative Word Error Rate (WER) reduction on the LibriSpeech dataset.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07090v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study the impact of augmenting spoken language corpora with domain-specific synthetic samples for the purpose of training a speech recognition system. Using both a conventional neural TTS system and a zero-shot one with voice cloning ability we generate speech corpora that vary in the number of voices. We compare speech recognition models trained with addition of different amounts of synthetic data generated using these two methods with a baseline model trained solely on voice recordings. We show that while the quality of voice-cloned dataset is lower, its increased multivoiceity makes it much more effective than the one with only a few voices synthesized with the use of a conventional neural TTS system. Furthermore, our experiments indicate that using low variability synthetic speech quickly leads to saturation in the quality of the ASR whereas high variability speech provides improvement even when increasing total amount of data used for training by 30%.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Pre-trained AudioLDM for Sound Generation: A Benchmark Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.03857v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks have recently achieved breakthroughs in sound generation. Despite the outstanding sample quality, current sound generation models face issues on small-scale datasets (e.g., overfitting), significantly limiting performance. In this paper, we make the first attempt to investigate the benefits of pre-training on sound generation with AudioLDM, the cutting-edge model for audio generation, as the backbone. Our study demonstrates the advantages of the pre-trained AudioLDM, especially in data-scarcity scenarios. In addition, the baselines and evaluation protocol for sound generation systems are not consistent enough to compare different studies directly. Aiming to facilitate further study on sound generation tasks, we benchmark the sound generation task on various frequently-used datasets. We hope our results on transfer learning and benchmarks can provide references for further research on conditional sound generation.</description>

      <title>REMAST: Real-time Emotion-based Music Arrangement with Soft Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.08029v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Music as an emotional intervention medium has important applications in scenarios such as music therapy, games, and movies. However, music needs real-time arrangement according to changing emotions, bringing challenges to balance emotion real-time fit and soft emotion transition due to the fine-grained and mutable nature of the target emotion. Existing studies mainly focus on achieving emotion real-time fit, while the issue of smooth transition remains understudied, affecting the overall emotional coherence of the music. In this paper, we propose REMAST to address this trade-off. Specifically, we recognize the last timestep's music emotion and fuse it with the current timestep's input emotion. The fused emotion then guides REMAST to generate the music based on the input melody. To adjust music similarity and emotion real-time fit flexibly, we downsample the original melody and feed it into the generation model. Furthermore, we design four music theory features by domain knowledge to enhance emotion information and employ semi-supervised learning to mitigate the subjective bias introduced by manual dataset annotation. According to the evaluation results, REMAST surpasses the state-of-the-art methods in objective and subjective metrics. These results demonstrate that REMAST achieves real-time fit and smooth transition simultaneously, enhancing the coherence of the generated music.</description>

      <title>Room Acoustic Rendering Networks with Control of Scattering and Early Reflections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14658v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Room acoustic synthesis can be used in Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR) and gaming applications to enhance listeners' sense of immersion, realism and externalisation. A common approach is to use Geometrical Acoustics (GA) models to compute impulse responses at interactive speed, and fast convolution methods to apply said responses in real time. Alternatively, delay-network-based models are capable of modeling certain aspects of room acoustics, but with a significantly lower computational cost. In order to bridge the gap between these classes of models, recent work introduced delay network designs that approximate Acoustic Radiance Transfer (ART), a GA model that simulates the transfer of acoustic energy between discrete surface patches in an environment. This paper presents two key extensions of such designs. The first extension involves a new physically-based and stability-preserving design of the feedback matrices, enabling more accurate control of scattering and, more in general, of late reverberation properties. The second extension allows an arbitrary number of early reflections to be modeled with high accuracy, meaning the network can be scaled at will between computational cost and early reverb precision. The proposed extensions are compared to the baseline ART-approximating delay network as well as two reference GA models. The evaluation is based on objective measures of perceptually-relevant features, including frequency-dependent reverberation times, echo density build-up, and early decay time. Results show how the proposed extensions result in a significant improvement over the baseline model, especially for the case of non-convex geometries or the case of unevenly distributed wall absorption, both scenarios of broad practical interest.</description>

      <title>E-chat: Emotion-sensitive Spoken Dialogue System with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00475v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study focuses on emotion-sensitive spoken dialogue in human-machine speech interaction. With the advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), dialogue systems can handle multimodal data, including audio. Recent models have enhanced the understanding of complex audio signals through the integration of various audio events. However, they are unable to generate appropriate responses based on emotional speech. To address this, we introduce the Emotional chat Model (E-chat), a novel spoken dialogue system capable of comprehending and responding to emotions conveyed from speech. This model leverages an emotion embedding extracted by a speech encoder, combined with LLMs, enabling it to respond according to different emotional contexts. Additionally, we introduce the E-chat200 dataset, designed explicitly for emotion-sensitive spoken dialogue. In various evaluation metrics, E-chat consistently outperforms baseline model, demonstrating its potential in emotional comprehension and human-machine interaction.</description>

      <title>Long-form music generation with latent diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10301v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Audio-based generative models for music have seen great strides recently, but so far have not managed to produce full-length music tracks with coherent musical structure from text prompts. We show that by training a generative model on long temporal contexts it is possible to produce long-form music of up to 4m45s. Our model consists of a diffusion-transformer operating on a highly downsampled continuous latent representation (latent rate of 21.5Hz). It obtains state-of-the-art generations according to metrics on audio quality and prompt alignment, and subjective tests reveal that it produces full-length music with coherent structure.</description>

      <title>Towards Musically Informed Evaluation of Piano Transcription Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08454v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automatic piano transcription models are typically evaluated using simple frame- or note-wise information retrieval (IR) metrics. Such benchmark metrics do not provide insights into the transcription quality of specific musical aspects such as articulation, dynamics, or rhythmic precision of the output, which are essential in the context of expressive performance analysis. Furthermore, in recent years, MAESTRO has become the de-facto training and evaluation dataset for such models. However, inference performance has been observed to deteriorate substantially when applied on out-of-distribution data, thereby questioning the suitability and reliability of transcribed outputs from such models for specific MIR tasks. In this work, we investigate the performance of three state-of-the-art piano transcription models in two experiments. In the first one, we propose a variety of musically informed evaluation metrics which, in contrast to the IR metrics, offer more detailed insight into the musical quality of the transcriptions. In the second experiment, we compare inference performance on real-world and perturbed audio recordings, and highlight musical dimensions which our metrics can help explain. Our experimental results highlight the weaknesses of existing piano transcription metrics and contribute to a more musically sound error analysis of transcription outputs.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we present a novel framework for the study and design of AI assisted musical devices (AIMEs). Initially, we present a taxonomy of these devices and illustrate it with a set of scenarios and personas. Later, we propose a generic architecture for the implementation of AIMEs and present some examples from the scenarios.

      <title>Speech Bandwidth Expansion Via High Fidelity Generative Adversarial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18571v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Speech bandwidth expansion is crucial for expanding the frequency range of low-bandwidth speech signals, thereby improving audio quality, clarity and perceptibility in digital applications. Its applications span telephony, compression, text-to-speech synthesis, and speech recognition. This paper presents a novel approach using a high-fidelity generative adversarial network, unlike cascaded systems, our system is trained end-to-end on paired narrowband and wideband speech signals. Our method integrates various bandwidth upsampling ratios into a single unified model specifically designed for speech bandwidth expansion applications. Our approach exhibits robust performance across various bandwidth expansion factors, including those not encountered during training, demonstrating zero-shot capability. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to showcase this capability. The experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms previous end-to-end approaches, as well as interpolation and traditional techniques, showcasing its effectiveness in practical speech enhancement applications.</description>
