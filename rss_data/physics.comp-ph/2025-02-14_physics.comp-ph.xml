      <title>NextGenPB: an analytically-enabled super resolution and local (de)refinement Poisson-Boltzmann Equation solver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Poisson-Boltzmann equation (PBE) is a relevant partial differential equation commonly used in biophysical applications to estimate the electrostatic energy of biomolecular systems immersed in electrolytic solutions. A conventional mean to improve the accuracy of its solution, when grid-based numerical techniques are used, consists in increasing the resolution, locally or globally. This, however, usually entails higher complexity, memory demand and computational cost. Here, we introduce NextGenPB, a linear PBE, adaptive-grid, FEM solver that leverages analytical calculations to maximize the accuracy-to-computational-cost ratio. Indeed, in NextGenPB (aka NGPB), analytical corrections at the surface of the solute enhance the solution's accuracy without requiring grid adaptation. This leads to more precise estimates of the electrostatic potential, fields, and energy at no perceptible additional cost. Also, we apply computationally efficient yet accurate boundary conditions by taking advantage of local grid de-refinement. To assess the accuracy of our methods directly, we expand the traditionally available analytical case set to many non-overlapping dielectric spheres. Then, we use an existing benchmark set of real biomolecular systems to evaluate the energy convergence concerning grid resolution. Thanks to these advances, we have improved state-of-the-art results and shown that the approach is accurate and largely scalable for modern high-performance computing architectures. Lastly, we suggest that the presented core ideas could be instrumental in improving the solution of other partial differential equations with discontinuous coefficients.</description>

      <title>FAST: A Future Aircraft Sizing Tool for Advanced Aircraft and Propulsion System Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Without radical technological advancements, the global aviation industry will continue to be a major carbon emitter. To reduce aviation's carbon emissions, innovative aircraft technology, including electrified aircraft propulsion, is under development. However, current aircraft sizing tools require detailed design information that may not be available early in the development process, particularly for novel technologies. This can yield suboptimal designs and inhibits innovation. A computational tool is needed to easily and rapidly size an aircraft configuration while allowing the designer to explore the design space, examine tradeoffs, and evaluate alternative designs. The Future Aircraft Sizing Tool (FAST), developed in Matlab, addresses this challenge by rapidly sizing aircraft with any propulsion architecture, including conventional, electric, and hybrid electric systems, even with limited initial data. FAST enables engineers to explore various aircraft configurations, evaluate design alternatives, assess performance across a flight envelope, and visualize concepts during the sizing process. By supporting early stage design, FAST addresses a gap in currently available computational tools for developing sustainable aviation technologies to help reduce the industry's carbon footprint.</description>

      <title>Scalable Discrete Diffusion Samplers: Combinatorial Optimization and Statistical Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning to sample from complex unnormalized distributions over discrete domains emerged as a promising research direction with applications in statistical physics, variational inference, and combinatorial optimization. Recent work has demonstrated the potential of diffusion models in this domain. However, existing methods face limitations in memory scaling and thus the number of attainable diffusion steps since they require backpropagation through the entire generative process. To overcome these limitations we introduce two novel training methods for discrete diffusion samplers, one grounded in the policy gradient theorem and the other one leveraging Self-Normalized Neural Importance Sampling (SN-NIS). These methods yield memory-efficient training and achieve state-of-the-art results in unsupervised combinatorial optimization. Numerous scientific applications additionally require the ability of unbiased sampling. We introduce adaptations of SN-NIS and Neural Markov Chain Monte Carlo that enable for the first time the application of discrete diffusion models to this problem. We validate our methods on Ising model benchmarks and find that they outperform popular autoregressive approaches. Our work opens new avenues for applying diffusion models to a wide range of scientific applications in discrete domains that were hitherto restricted to exact likelihood models.</description>

      <title>An hp Multigrid Approach for space-time finite elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a monolithic $hp$ space-time multigrid method for tensor-product space-time finite element discretizations of the Stokes equations. Geometric and polynomial coarsening of the space-time mesh is performed, and the entire algorithm is expressed through rigorous mathematical mappings. For the discretization, we use inf-sup stable pairs $\mathbb Q_{r+1}/\mathbb P_{r}^{\text{disc}}$ of elements in space and a discontinuous Galerkin (DG$(k)$) discretization in time with piecewise polynomials of order $k$. The key novelty of this work is the application of $hp$ multigrid techniques in space and time, facilitated and accelerated by the matrix-free capabilities of the deal.II library. While multigrid methods are well-established for stationary problems, their application in space-time formulations encounter unique challenges, particularly in constructing suitable smoothers. To overcome these challenges, we employ a space-time cell-wise Vanka smoother. Extensive tests on high-performance computing platforms demonstrate the efficiency of our $hp$ multigrid approach on problem sizes exceeding a trillion degrees of freedom (dofs), sustaining throughputs of hundreds of millions of dofs per second.</description>

      <title>The quest for new materials: the network theory and machine learning perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding and predicting the emergence of novel materials is a fundamental challenge in condensed matter physics, materials science and technology. With the rapid growth of materials databases in both size and reliability, the challenge shifts from data collection to efficient exploration of this vast and complex space. A key strategy lies in a smart use of descriptors at multiple scales, ranging from atomic arrangements to macroscopic properties, to represent materials in high-dimensional abstract spaces. Network theory provides a powerful framework to structure and analyze these relationships, capturing hidden patterns and guiding discovery. Machine Learning complements this approach by enabling predictive modeling, dimensionality reduction, and the identification of promising material candidates. By integrating network-based methods with Machine Learning techniques, researchers can construct, analyze, and efficiently navigate the material space, uncovering novel materials with tailored properties. This review explores the synergy between network theory and ML, highlighting their role in accelerating materials discovery through a systematic and interpretable approach.</description>

      <title>Domain Overlapping Algorithm with Nonlinear Mapping for Collocation-Based Solutions of Eigenvalue Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents four novel domain decomposition algorithms integrated with nonlinear mapping techniques to address collocation-based solutions of eigenvalue problems involving sharp interfaces or steep gradients. The proposed methods leverage the spectral accuracy of Chebyshev polynomials while overcoming limitations of existing tools like Chebfun, particularly in preserving higher-order derivative continuity and enabling flexible node clustering near discontinuities. Key findings include the following: for algorithm Performance: The one-point overlap method demonstrated significant improvements over global mapping approaches, reducing required grid points by orders of magnitude while maintaining spectral convergence. The two-point overlap method further methods generalized the approach, allowing arbitrary node distributions and nonlinear mappings. These achieved exponential error reduction for Burgers equation) by combining Taylor expansions with Chebyshev derivatives in overlap regions. While Chebfun splitting strategy automates domain decomposition, it enforces only C0 continuity, leading to discontinuous higher derivatives. In contrast, the proposed algorithms preserved smoothness up to CN continuity, critical for eigenvalue problems in hydrodynamic stability and nonlinear BVPs. Validation on 3D channel flow with viscosity stratification and Burgers equation highlighted the methods robustness. For instance, eigenvalue calculations for miscible core-annular flows matched prior results while resolving sharp viscosity gradients with fewer nodes.</description>

      <title>Fatigue reliability analysis of offshore wind turbines under combined wind-wave excitation via DPIM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As offshore wind turbines develop into deepwater operations, accurately quantifying the impact of stochastic excitations in complex sea environments on offshore wind turbines and conducting structural fatigue reliability analysis has become challenging. In this paper, based on long-term wind-wave reanalysis data from a site in the South China Sea, a novel direct probability integral method (DPIM) is developed for the stochastic response and fatigue reliability analyses of the key components for the floating offshore wind turbine structures under combined wind-wave excitation. A 5MW floating offshore wind turbine is considered as the research object, and a fully coupled dynamic response analysis of the wind turbine system is conducted to calculate the short-term fatigue damage value of tower base and blade root. The DPIM is applied to calculate the fatigue reliability of the wind turbine structure. The accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method are validated by comparing the obtained results with those of Monte Carlo simulations. Furthermore, the results indicate that the fatigue life of floating offshore wind turbine structures under combined wind-wave excitation meets the design requirements. Notably, the fatigue reliability of the wind turbine under aligned wind-wave condition is lower compared to misaligned wind-wave condition.</description>

      <title>Magnetic mesh generation and field line reconstruction for scrape-off layer and divertor modeling in stellarators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01139v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The design of divertor targets and baffles for optimal heat and particle exhaust from magnetically confined fusion plasmas requires a combination of fast, low-fidelity models (such as EMC3-lite [1]) for scoping studies and high-fidelity ones (such as EMC3-EIRENE [2]) for verification. Both of those approaches benefit from a magnetic flux tube mesh for fast interpolation and mapping of field line segments [3]. A new mesh generator for unstructured quadrilateral flux tubes with adaptive refinement is presented and integrated into FLARE [4]. For HSX with an extended first wall, it is found that several layers of flux tubes can span the entire half field period before splitting is required. This is an advantage over the traditional setup of the EMC3-EIRENE mesh where careful construction of several sub-domains is required already for the much tighter present first wall. The divide and conquer paradigm with unstructured mesh layout offers a powerful alternative for integration into optimization workflows. Further examples for W7-X and CTH are presented.</description>

      <title>A mesh-constrained discrete point method for incompressible flows with moving boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17542v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Particle-based methods are a practical tool in computational fluid dynamics, and novel types of methods have been proposed. However, widely developed Lagrangian-type formulations suffer from the nonuniform distribution of particles, which is enhanced over time and result in problems in computational efficiency and parallel computations. To mitigate these problems, a mesh-constrained discrete point (MCD) method was developed for stationary boundary problems (Matsuda et al., 2022). Although the MCD method is a meshless method that uses moving least-squares approximation, the arrangement of particles (or discrete points (DPs)) is specialized so that their positions are constrained in background meshes to obtain a closely uniform distribution. This achieves a reasonable approximation for spatial derivatives with compact stencils without encountering any ill-posed condition and leads to good performance in terms of computational efficiency. In this study, a novel meshless method based on the MCD method for incompressible flows with moving boundaries is proposed. To ensure the mesh constraint of each DP in moving boundary problems, a novel updating algorithm for the DP arrangement is developed so that the position of DPs is not only rearranged but the DPs are also reassigned the role of being on the boundary or not. The proposed method achieved reasonable results in numerical experiments for well-known moving boundary problems.</description>
