      <title>A Novel Highway Traffic Capacity Analyzing Method under Road Region Atmospheric Environment Constrains Based on Computational Fluid Dynamics Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Highways always have a huge impact on the environment, quantifying the level of pollution and calculating the traffic capacity under environmental constraints is an important part of practicing environmental protection. Available traffic capacity methods do not focus on the traffic emissions impact on road region environment. To fill this research gap, this paper proposes a method consisting of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model and Traffic Flow Field and the Gas Flow Field coupled model for the traffic capacity model. The COPERT 5 model is adopted to simulate the traffic emissions on highways with field measurement data and traffic conditions as initial conditions. Then, these are served as the inputs, set and further calculated using coupled model in the CFD numerical simulation phase. Finally, modeling the Traffic Capacity model and calculating the traffic capacity. The experiment results in G30 Yongshan highway section demonstrate that, with the proposed method, the CFD simulation model for traffic emissions in highway region can reflect the practical conditions (the overall error is within 10%), while the traffic capacity can be well performance with the traffic capacity model under the atmospheric pollution constraints. The annual average traffic capacity of G30 Yongshan is 739,800 vehicles, and SO2 under different constraints has the greatest limitation on traffic capacity (90,9662 vehicles), which is the most dominant impact in the environmental constraints of the road region, rest are ranked in: NO2 (246,5373), PM2.5 (323,6022), CO (771,8717), CO2 (803,7217), and PM10 (2202,0013).</description>

      <title>Strong convergence of an explicit full-discrete scheme for stochastic Burgers-Huxley equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The strong convergence of an explicit full-discrete scheme is investigated for the stochastic Burgers-Huxley equation driven by additive space-time white noise, which possesses both Burgers-type and cubic nonlinearities. To discretize the continuous problem in space, we utilize a spectral Galerkin method. Subsequently, we introduce a nonlinear-tamed exponential integrator scheme, resulting in a fully discrete scheme. Within the framework of semigroup theory, this study provides precise estimations of the Sobolev regularity, $L^\infty$ regularity in space, and H\"older continuity in time for the mild solution, as well as for its semi-discrete and full-discrete approximations. Building upon these results, we establish moment boundedness for the numerical solution and obtain strong convergence rates in both spatial and temporal dimensions. A numerical example is presented to validate the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Strong convergence of a fully discrete scheme for stochastic Burgers equation with fractional-type noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate numerical approximations for the stochastic Burgers equation driven by an additive cylindrical fractional Brownian motion with Hurst parameter $H \in (\frac{1}{2}, 1)$. To discretize the continuous problem in space, a spectral Galerkin method is employed, followed by the presentation of a nonlinear-tamed accelerated exponential Euler method to yield a fully discrete scheme. By showing the exponential integrability of the stochastic convolution of the fractional Brownian motion, we present the boundedness of moments of semi-discrete and full-discrete approximations. Building upon these results and the convergence of the fully discrete scheme in probability proved by a stopping time technique, we derive the strong convergence of the proposed scheme.</description>

      <title>Approximation of the invariant measure for stochastic Allen-Cahn equation via an explicit fully discrete scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we propose an explicit fully discrete scheme to numerically solve the stochastic Allen-Cahn equation. The spatial discretization is done by a spectral Galerkin method, followed by the temporal discretization by a tamed accelerated exponential Euler scheme. Based on the time-independent boundedness of moments of numerical solutions, we present the weak error analysis in an infinite time interval by using Malliavin calculus. This provides a way to numerically approximate the invariant measure for the stochastic Allen-Cahn equation.</description>

      <title>A Numerical Technique for Coupling the Momentum and the Continuity Equations for Semi-Implicit 3D Ocean Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semi-implicit methods are powerful and efficient tools for the three-dimensional modeling of coastal and oceanic processes. A semi-implicit finite difference method for 3D hydrostatic primitive equations is presented in this paper. The governing equations are time-discretized with an implicit treatment of barotropic pressure gradient and vertical viscosity. The discretized momentum equations along a water column are coupled with the depth-integrated continuity equation of the column to construct a linear system for free-surface elevations. The novelty of this work lies in formulating an efficient method with the order of complexity O(N) for coupling the momentum and the continuity equations. In this method, the horizontal velocity components are expressed in terms of neighbor free-surface elevations by some simple recursive formulas and then are substituted in the integrated continuity equation.</description>

      <title>Unexpected fault activation in underground gas storage. Part II: 2 Definition of safe operational bandwidths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Underground gas storage is a versatile tool for managing energy resources and addressing pressing environmental concerns. While natural gas is stored in geological formations since the beginning of the 20th century, hydrogen has recently been considered as a potential candidate toward a more flexible and sustainable energy infrastructure. Furthermore, these formations can also be used to sequester environmentally harmful gases such as CO2 securely. When such operations are implemented in faulted basins, however, safety concerns may arise due to the possible reactivation of pre-existing faults, which could result in (micro)-seismicity events. In the Netherlands, it has been recently noted that fault reactivation can occur "unexpectedly" during the life of an underground gas storage (UGS) site, even when stress conditions are not expected to cause a failure. The present two-part work aims to develop a modeling framework to investigate the physical mechanisms causing such occurrences and define a safe operational bandwidth for pore pressure variation for UGS operations in the faulted reservoirs of the Rotliegend formation, the Netherlands. In this paper, we investigate in detail the mechanisms and crucial factors that result in fault reactivation at various stages of a UGS project. The mathematical and numerical model described in Part 1 is used, also accounting for the effect of geochemical dissolution on reservoir and caprock weakening. The study investigates the risks of fault activation caused by the storage of different fluids for various purposes, such as long-term CO2 sequestration, CH4 and N2 injection and extraction cycles, and N2 permanent storage. The results show how geomechanical properties and reservoir operating conditions may increase the risk of fault reactivation at various UGS stages. Finally, operational guidelines for improving secure storage operations are presented.</description>

      <title>Numerical and Lyapunov-Based Investigation of the Effect of Stenosis on Blood Transport Stability Using a Control-Theoretic PDE Model of Cardiovascular Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform various numerical tests to study the effect of (boundary) stenosis on blood flow stability, employing a detailed and accurate, second-order finite-volume scheme for numerically implementing a partial differential equation (PDE) model, using clinically realistic values for the artery's parameters and the blood inflow. The model consists of a baseline $2\times 2$ hetero-directional, nonlinear hyperbolic PDE system, in which, the stenosis' effect is described by a pressure drop at the outlet of an arterial segment considered. We then study the stability properties (observed in our numerical tests) of a reference trajectory, corresponding to a given time-varying inflow (e.g., a periodic trajectory with period equal to the time interval between two consecutive heartbeats) and stenosis severity, deriving the respective linearized system and constructing a Lyapunov functional. Due to the fact that the linearized system is time varying, with time-varying parameters depending on the reference trajectories themselves (that, in turn, depend in an implicit manner on the stenosis degree), which cannot be derived analytically, we verify the Lyapunov-based stability conditions obtained, numerically. Both the numerical tests and the Lyapunov-based stability analysis show that a reference trajectory is asymptotically stable with a decay rate that decreases as the stenosis severity deteriorates.</description>

      <title>Lattice Boltzmann for linear elastodynamics: periodic problems and Dirichlet boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new second-order accurate lattice Boltzmann formulation for linear elastodynamics that is stable for arbitrary combinations of material parameters under a CFL-like condition. The construction of the numerical scheme uses an equivalent first-order hyperbolic system of equations as an intermediate step, for which a vectorial lattice Boltzmann formulation is introduced. The only difference to conventional lattice Boltzmann formulations is the usage of vector-valued populations, so that all computational benefits of the algorithm are preserved. Using the asymptotic expansion technique and the notion of pre-stability structures we further establish second-order consistency as well as analytical stability estimates. Lastly, we introduce a second-order consistent initialization of the populations as well as a boundary formulation for Dirichlet boundary conditions on 2D rectangular domains. All theoretical derivations are numerically verified by convergence studies using manufactured solutions and long-term stability tests.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study approximation of the embedding $\ell_p^m \rightarrow \ell_{\infty}^m$, $1 \leq p \leq 2$, based on randomized adaptive algorithms that use arbitrary linear functionals as information on a problem instance. We show upper bounds for which the complexity $n$ exhibits only a $(\log\log m)$-dependence. Our results for $p=1$ lead to an example of a gap of order $n$ (up to logarithmic factors) for the error between best adaptive and non-adaptive Monte Carlo methods. This is the largest possible gap for linear problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an overarching framework for stable spectral methods on a triangle, defined by a multivariate W-system and based on orthogonal polynomials on the triangle. Motivated by the Koornwinder orthogonal polynomials on the triangle, we introduce a Koornwinder W-system. Once discretised by this W-system, the resulting spatial differentiation matrix is skew symmetric, affording important advantages insofar as stability and conservation of structure are concerned. We analyse the construction of the differentiation matrix and matrix vector multiplication, demonstrating optimal computational cost. Numerical convergence is illustrated through experiments with different parameter choices. As a result, our method exhibits key characteristics of a practical spectral method, inclusive of rapid convergence, fast computation and the preservation of structure of the underlying partial differential equation.</description>

      <title>A unified concept of the degree of ill-posedness for compact and non-compact linear operators in Hilbert spaces under the auspices of the spectral theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Covering ill-posed problems with compact and non-compact operators regarding the degree of ill-posedness is a never ending story written by many authors in the inverse problems literature. This paper tries to add a new narrative and some new facets with respect to this story under the auspices of the spectral theorem. The latter states that any self-adjoint and bounded operator is unitarily equivalent to a multiplication operator on some (semi-finite) measure space. We will exploit this fact and derive a distribution function from the corresponding multiplier, the growth behavior of which at zero allows us to characterize the degree of ill-posedness. We prove that this new concept coincides with the well-known one for compact operators (by means of their singular values), and illustrate the implications along examples including the Hausdorff moment operator and convolutions.</description>

      <title>Frequency-Explicit Shape Holomorphy in Uncertainty Quantification for Acoustic Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider frequency-domain acoustic scattering at a homogeneous star-shaped penetrable obstacle, whose shape is uncertain and modelled via a radial spectral parameterization with random coefficients. Using recent results on the stability of Helmholtz transmission problems with piecewise constant coefficients from [A. Moiola and E. A. Spence, Acoustic transmission problems: wavenumber-explicit bounds and resonance-free regions, Mathematical Models and Methods in Applied Sciences, 29 (2019), pp. 317-354] we obtain frequency-explicit statements on the holomorphic dependence of the scattered field and the far-field pattern on the stochastic shape parameters. This paves the way for applying general results on the efficient construction of high-dimensional surrogate models. We also take into account the effect of domain truncation by means of perfectly matched layers (PML). In addition, spatial regularity estimates which are explicit in terms of the wavenumber $k$ permit us to quantify the impact of finite-element Galerkin discretization using high-order Lagrangian finite-element spaces.</description>

      <title>Parametric holomorphy of elliptic eigenvalue problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of parameter-dependent partial differential equations (parametric PDEs) with countably many parameters has been actively studied for the last few decades. In particular, it has been well known that a certain type of parametric holomorphy of the PDE solutions allows the application of deep neural networks without encountering the curse of dimensionality. This paper aims to propose a general framework for verifying the desired parametric holomorphy by utilizing the bounds on parametric derivatives. The framework is illustrated with examples of parametric elliptic eigenvalue problems (EVPs), encompassing both linear and semilinear cases. As the results, it will be shown that the ground eigenpairs have the desired holomorphy. Furthermore, under the same conditions, improved bounds for the mixed derivatives of the ground eigenpairs are derived. These bounds are well known to take a crucial role in the error analysis of quasi-Monte Carlo methods.</description>

      <title>Low-Frequency Stabilizations of the PMCHWT Equation for Dielectric and Conductive Media: On a Full-Wave Alternative to Eddy-Current Solvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose here a novel stabilization strategy for the PMCHWT equation that cures its frequency and conductivity related instabilities and is obtained by leveraging quasi-Helmholtz projectors. The resulting formulation is well-conditioned in the entire low-frequency regime, including the eddy current one, and can be applied to arbitrarily penetrable materials, ranging from dielectric to conductive ones. In addition, by choosing the rescaling coefficients of the quasi-Helmholtz components appropriately, we prevent the typical loss of accuracy occurring at low frequency in the presence of inductive and capacitive type magnetic frill excitations, commonly used in circuit modeling to impose a potential difference. Finally, leveraging on quasi-Helmholtz projectors instead than on the standard Loop-Star decomposition, our formulation is also compatible with most fast solvers and is amenable to multiply connected geometries, without any computational overhead for the search for the global loops of the structure. The efficacy of the proposed preconditioning scheme when applied to both simply and multiply connected geometries is corroborated by numerical examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present paper we consider linear and isotropic Maxwell equations with inhomogeneous interface conditions. We discretize the problem with the discontinuous Galerkin method in space and with the leapfrog scheme in time. An analytical setting is provided in which we show wellposedness of the problem, derive stability estimates, and exploit this in the error analysis to prove rigorous error bounds for both the spatial and full discretization. The theoretical findings are confirmed with numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>The random timestep Euler method and its continuous dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ODE solvers with randomly sampled timestep sizes appear in the context of chaotic dynamical systems, differential equations with low regularity, and, implicitly, in stochastic optimisation. In this work, we propose and study the stochastic Euler dynamics - a continuous-time Markov process that is equivalent to a linear spline interpolation of a random timestep (forward) Euler method. We understand the stochastic Euler dynamics as a path-valued ansatz for the ODE solution that shall be approximated. We first obtain qualitative insights by studying deterministic Euler dynamics which we derive through a first order approximation to the infinitesimal generator of the stochastic Euler dynamics. Then we show convergence of the stochastic Euler dynamics to the ODE solution by studying the associated infinitesimal generators and by a novel local truncation error analysis. Next we prove stability by an immediate analysis of the random timestep Euler method and by deriving Foster-Lyapunov criteria for the stochastic Euler dynamics; the latter also yield bounds on the speed of convergence to stationarity. The paper ends with a discussion of second-order stochastic Euler dynamics and a series of numerical experiments that appear to verify our analytical results.</description>

      <title>Dilated convolution neural operator for multiscale partial differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a data-driven operator learning method for multiscale partial differential equations, with a particular emphasis on preserving high-frequency information. Drawing inspiration from the representation of multiscale parameterized solutions as a combination of low-rank global bases (such as low-frequency Fourier modes) and localized bases over coarse patches (analogous to dilated convolution), we propose the Dilated Convolutional Neural Operator (DCNO). The DCNO architecture effectively captures both high-frequency and low-frequency features while maintaining a low computational cost through a combination of convolution and Fourier layers. We conduct experiments to evaluate the performance of DCNO on various datasets, including the multiscale elliptic equation, its inverse problem, Navier-Stokes equation, and Helmholtz equation. We show that DCNO strikes an optimal balance between accuracy and computational cost and offers a promising solution for multiscale operator learning.</description>

      <title>A Novel Use of Pseudospectra in Mathematical Biology: Understanding HPA Axis Sensitivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) axis is a major neuroendocrine system, and its dysregulation is implicated in various diseases. This system also presents interesting mathematical challenges for modeling. We consider a nonlinear delay differential equation model and calculate pseudospectra of three different linearizations: a time-dependent Jacobian, linearization around the limit cycle, and dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) analysis of Koopman operators (global linearization). The time-dependent Jacobian provided insight into experimental phenomena, explaining why rats respond differently to perturbations during corticosterone secretion's upward versus downward slopes. We developed new mathematical techniques for the other two linearizations to calculate pseudospectra on Banach spaces and apply DMD to delay differential equations, respectively. These methods helped establish local and global limit cycle stability and study transients. Additionally, we discuss using pseudospectra to substantiate the model in experimental contexts and establish bio-variability via data-driven methods. This work is the first to utilize pseudospectra to explore the HPA axis.</description>

      <title>Stabilization of synchronous tridiagonal network motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a network of identical agents, coupled through linear asymmetric coupling. An important case is when each agent has an asymptotically stable periodic orbit, so that the full network inherits a synchronous periodic orbit, but also chaotic trajectories are of interest. In this work, we will restrict to "nearest-neighbor" type of couplings.
  The Master Stability Function (MSF) is a powerful tool to establish local stability of the synchronous orbit, in particular a negative MSF implies asymptotic stability. But not every network structure gives a negative MSF. Moreover, there are many situations where in order to obtain a negative MSF, symmetric networks need a coupling strength so large, that the model bears little physical interest. We make two main contributions: (i) Given a tridiagonal nearest neighbor topology, we show how it is possible to choose appropriate coupling so that the synchronous orbit is stable, and (ii) we show that this stability comes without the need of a large coupling strength if the structure is not symmetric. Our construction is based on solving inverse eigenvalue problems. We will see that the coupling of the agents cannot always be chosen to be symmetric so that the underlying graph structure is that of a directed graph with edges having different weights. We provide numerical implementation of our technique on networks of van der Pol and of chaotic R\"ossler oscillators, where the standard symmetric nearest neighbor coupling fails to give stability of the synchronous orbit.</description>

      <title>Entropy conservative discretization of compressible Euler equations with an arbitrary equation of state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study proposes a novel spatial discretization procedure for the compressible Euler equations which guarantees entropy conservation at a discrete level when an arbitrary equation of state is assumed. The proposed method, based on a locally-conservative discretization, guarantees also the spatial conservation of mass, momentum, and total energy and is kinetic energy-preserving. In order to achieve the entropy-conservation property for an arbitrary non-ideal gas, a general strategy is adopted based on the manipulation of discrete balance equations through the imposition of global entropy conservation and the use of a summation by parts rule. The procedure, which is extended to an arbitrary order of accuracy, conducts to a general form of the internal-energy numerical flux which results in a nonlinear function of thermodynamic and dynamic variables and still admits the mass flux as a residual degree of freedom. The effectiveness of the novel entropy-conservative formulation is demonstrated through numerical tests making use of some of the most popular cubic equations of state.</description>

      <title>Robust virtual element methods for coupled stress-assisted diffusion problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09714v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper aims first to perform robust continuous analysis of a mixed nonlinear formulation for stress-assisted diffusion of a solute that interacts with an elastic material, and second to propose and analyse a virtual element formulation of the model problem. The two-way coupling mechanisms between the Herrmann formulation for linear elasticity and the reaction-diffusion equation (written in mixed form) consist of diffusion-induced active stress and stress-dependent diffusion. The two sub-problems are analysed using the extended Babu\v{s}ka--Brezzi--Braess theory for perturbed saddle-point problems. The well-posedness of the nonlinearly coupled system is established using a Banach fixed-point strategy under the smallness assumption on data. The virtual element formulations for the uncoupled sub-problems are proven uniquely solvable by a fixed-point argument in conjunction with appropriate projection operators. We derive the a priori error estimates, and test the accuracy and performance of the proposed method through computational simulations.</description>

      <title>An Entropy-Stable Discontinuous Galerkin Discretization of the Ideal Multi-Ion Magnetohydrodynamics System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14615v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an entropy-stable (ES) discretization using a nodal discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method for the ideal multi-ion magneto-hydrodynamics (MHD) equations.
  We start by performing a continuous entropy analysis of the ideal multi-ion MHD system, described by, e.g., Toth (2010) [Multi-Ion Magnetohydrodynamics], which describes the motion of multi-ion plasmas with independent momentum and energy equations for each ion species. Following the continuous entropy analysis, we propose an algebraic manipulation to the multi-ion MHD system, such that entropy consistency can be transferred from the continuous analysis to its discrete approximation. Moreover, we augment the system of equations with a generalized Lagrange multiplier (GLM) technique to have an additional cleaning mechanism of the magnetic field divergence error.
  We first derive robust entropy-conservative (EC) fluxes for the alternative formulation of the multi-ion GLM-MHD system that satisfy a Tadmor-type condition and are consistent with existing EC fluxes for single-fluid GLM-MHD equations. Using these numerical two-point fluxes, we construct high-order EC and ES DG discretizations of the ideal multi-ion MHD system using collocated Legendre--Gauss--Lobatto summation-by-parts (SBP) operators. The resulting nodal DG schemes satisfy the second-law of thermodynamics at the semi-discrete level, while maintaining high-order convergence and local node-wise conservation properties.
  We demonstrate the high-order convergence, and the EC and ES properties of our scheme with numerical validation experiments. Moreover, we demonstrate the importance of the GLM divergence technique and the ES discretization to improve the robustness properties of a DG discretization of the multi-ion MHD system by solving a challenging magnetized Kelvin-Helmholtz instability problem that exhibits MHD turbulence.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we describe a new hybrid algorithm for computing all singular triplets above a given threshold and provide its implementation in MATLAB/Octave and R. The high performance of our codes and ease at which they can be used, either independently or within a larger numerical scheme, are illustrated through several numerical examples with applications to matrix completion and image compression.

      <title>A mathematical model of the visual MacKay effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07338v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the intricate connection between visual perception and the mathematical modeling of neural activity in the primary visual cortex (V1). The focus is on modeling the visual MacKay effect [D. M. MacKay, Nature, 180 (1957), pp. 849--850]. While bifurcation theory has been a prominent mathematical approach for addressing issues in neuroscience, especially in describing spontaneous pattern formations in V1 due to parameter changes, it faces challenges in scenarios with localized sensory inputs. This is evident, for instance, in MacKay's psychophysical experiments, where the redundancy of visual stimuli information results in irregular shapes, making bifurcation theory and multiscale analysis less effective. To address this, we follow a mathematical viewpoint based on the input-output controllability of an Amari-type neural fields model. In this framework, we consider sensory input as a control function, a cortical representation via the retino-cortical map of the visual stimulus that captures its distinct features. This includes highly localized information in the center of MacKay's funnel pattern "MacKay rays". From a control theory point of view, the Amari-type equation's exact controllability property is discussed for linear and nonlinear response functions. For the visual MacKay effect modeling, we adjust the parameter representing intra-neuron connectivity to ensure that cortical activity exponentially stabilizes to the stationary state in the absence of sensory input. Then, we perform quantitative and qualitative studies to demonstrate that they capture all the essential features of the induced after-image reported by MacKay.</description>

      <title>Parallel performance of shared memory parallel spectral deferred corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20135v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate parallel performance of parallel spectral deferred corrections, a numerical approach that provides small-scale parallelism for the numerical solution of initial value problems. The scheme is applied to the shallow water equation and uses an IMEX splitting that integrates fast modes implicitly and slow modes explicitly in order to be efficient. We describe parallel $\texttt{OpenMP}$-based implementations of parallel SDC in two well established simulation codes: the finite volume based operational ocean model $\texttt{ICON-O}$ and the spherical harmonics based research code $\texttt{SWEET}$. The implementations are benchmarked on a single node of the JUSUF ($\texttt{SWEET}$) and JUWELS ($\texttt{ICON-O}$) system at J\"ulich Supercomputing Centre. We demonstrate a reduction of time-to-solution across a range of accuracies. For $\texttt{ICON-O}$, we show speedup over the currently used Adams--Bashforth-2 integrator with $\texttt{OpenMP}$ loop parallelization. For $\texttt{SWEET}$, we show speedup over serial spectral deferred corrections and a second order implicit-explicit integrator.</description>

      <title>Extending DD-$\alpha$AMG on heterogeneous machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08092v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multigrid solvers are the standard in modern scientific computing simulations. Domain Decomposition Aggregation-Based Algebraic Multigrid, also known as the DD-$\alpha$AMG solver, is a successful realization of an algebraic multigrid solver for lattice quantum chromodynamics. Its CPU implementation has made it possible to construct, for some particular discretizations, simulations otherwise computationally unfeasible, and furthermore it has motivated the development and improvement of other algebraic multigrid solvers in the area. From an existing version of DD-$\alpha$AMG already partially ported via CUDA to run some finest-level operations of the multigrid solver on Nvidia GPUs, we translate the CUDA code here by using HIP to run on the ORISE supercomputer. We moreover extend the smoothers available in DD-$\alpha$AMG, paying particular attention to Richardson smoothing, which in our numerical experiments has led to a multigrid solver faster than smoothing with GCR and only 10% slower compared to SAP smoothing. Then we port the odd-even-preconditioned versions of GMRES and Richardson via CUDA. Finally, we extend some computationally intensive coarse-grid operations via advanced vectorization.</description>
