      <title>Emergent Gauge Fields and the "Choi-Spin Liquids" in Steady States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the steady states of the evolution of a class of Lindbladians can be mapped to the "Gutzwiller projected" wave functions in the doubled Hilbert space, i.e. the representation of the density matrix through the Choi-Jamiolkowski isomorphism. A Gutzwiller projection is expected to introduce emergent dynamical gauge fields to the system, hence if one starts with a gapless free fermion pure quantum state, the steady state of the Lindbladian evolution in the doubled Hilbert space is an analog of an algebraic spin liquid, which is dubbed the "Choi-spin liquid". The Choi-spin liquid can also be produced through strong measurement without post-selection. Predictions of the Choi-spin liquids can be made based on the understanding from the studies on spin liquids, and we will design the experimental protocol to test these predictions. We also demonstrate that if one starts with a Chern insulator, the steady state of the Lindbladian evolution is expected to have a spontaneous "strong-to-weak" U(1) symmetry breaking, which corresponds to a superconductor in the doubled Hilbert space.</description>

      <title>Dynamical kinetic energy quenching in the antiferromagnetic quantum critical metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of critical spin fluctuations and hot electrons at the metallic antiferromagnetic quantum critical points with $Z_2$ and $O(2)$ spin symmetries, building upon earlier works on the $O(3)$ symmetric theory. The interacting theories in $2+1$ dimensions are approached from $3+1$-dimensional theories in the $\epsilon$-expansion that tunes the co-dimension of Fermi surface as a control parameter. The low-energy physics of the $Z_2$ and $O(2)$ theories qualitatively differ from each other and also from that of the $O(3)$ theory. The difference is caused by higher-order quantum corrections beyond the one-loop order that are important even to the leading order in $\epsilon$. The naive loop-expansion breaks down due to dynamical quenching of kinetic energy: the speed of the collective mode ($c$) and the Fermi velocity perpendicular to the magnetic ordering vector ($v$) become vanishingly small at low energies. What sets the three theories apart is the hierarchy that emerges between the quenched kinetic terms. At the infrared fixed point, $c/v$ becomes $0$, $1$ and $\infty$ in the $Z_2$, $O(2)$ and $O(3)$ theories, respectively. At intermediate energy scales, the slow renormalization group (RG) flows of $c$ and $v$ toward their fixed point values create approximate scale invariance controlled by approximate marginal parameters. The manifold of those quasi-fixed points and the RG flow therein determines crossovers from scaling behaviours with transient critical exponents at intermediate energy scales to the universal scaling in the low-energy limit. If the symmetry group is viewed as a tuning parameter, the $O(2)$ theory corresponds to a multi-critical point which has one additional quasi-marginal parameter than the other two theories.</description>

      <title>Failure of the Crystalline Equivalence Principle for Weak Free Fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interacting crystalline SPT phases were first classified by Thorngren and Else through the crystalline equivalence principle, suggesting that a spatial group symmetry can be treated as if it were an internal symmetry group. Using techniques from topology we elucidate how this principle holds for one of the proposals for the interacting bosonic case and yet fails for weak free fermion phases. Last we show how a variant of the principle does hold for strong crystalline free fermion phases.</description>

      <title>Missing spectral weight in a paramagnetic heavy-fermion system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The competition between the Kondo spin-screening effect and the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction in heavy-fermion systems drives the quantum phase transition between the magnetically ordered and the heavy-Fermi-liquid ground states. Despite intensive investigations of heavy quasiparticles on the Kondo-screened side of the quantum phase transition and of their breakdown at the quantum critical point, studies on the magnetically ordering side are scarce. Using terahertz time-domain spectroscopy, we report a suppression of the Kondo quasiparticle weight in CeCu6-xAux samples on the antiferromagnetic side of the quantum phase transition at temperatures as much as two orders of magnitude above the Neel temperature TN. The suppression results from a quantum frustration effect induced by the temperature-independent RKKY interaction. Hence, our results emphasize that besides critical fluctuations, the RKKY interaction may play an important role in the quantum-critical scenario.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Stripe-shaped Charge Modulations in Doped Mott Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by recent experimental findings, we investigate various scenarios of the doped Hubbard model with impurity potentials. We calculate the lattice Green's function in a finite-size cluster and then map it to the continuum real space, which allows for a direct comparison with scanning-tunneling-microscopy measurements on the local density of states. Our simulations successfully reproduce experimental data, including the characteristic stripe- and ladder-shaped structures observed in cuprate systems. Moreover, our results establish a connection between previous numerical findings on stripe-ordered ground states and experimental observations, thereby providing new insights into doped Mott insulators.</description>

      <title>A method for reconstructing the self-energy from the spectral function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fundamental question about the nature of quantum materials such as High-T$_c$ systems remain open to date -- it is unclear whether they are (some variety of) Fermi liquids, or (some variety of) non Fermi liquids. A direct avenue to determine their nature is to study the (imaginary part of the) self-energy at low energies. Here we present a method to extract this low $\omega$ self-energy from experimentally derived spectral functions. The method seems suited for implementation with high quality angle resolved photoemission data. It is based on a helpful Theorem proposed here, which assures us that the method has minimal (or vanishing) error at the lowest energies. We provide numerical examples showing that a few popular model systems yield distinguishably different low energy self-energies.</description>

      <title>Vestigial Gapless Boson Density Wave Emerging between $\nu = 1/2$ Fractional Chern Insulator and Finite-Momentum Supersolid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The roton-triggered charge-density-wave (CDW)is widely studied in fractional quantum Hall (FQH) and fractional Chern insulator (FCI) systems, and there also exist field theoretical and numerical realizations of continuous transition from FCI to superfluid (SF). However, the theory and numerical explorations of the transition between FCI and supersolid (SS) are still lacking. In this work, we study the topological flat-band lattice models with $\nu$ = 1/2 hard-core bosons, where the previous studies have discovered the existence of FCI states and possible direct FCI-SS transitions. While the FCI is robust, we find the direct FCI-SS transition is absent, and there exist more intriguing scenarios. In the case of checkerboard lattice, we find an intermediate gapless CDW state without SF, sandwiched between FCI and SS. This novel state is triggered by the roton instability in FCI and it further continuously brings about the intertwined finite-momentum SF fluctuation when the CDW order is strong enough, eventually transiting into an unconventional finite-momentum SS state. The intermediate gapless CDW state is a vestige from the SS state, since the increasing quantum fluctuation melts only the Larkin-Ovchinnikov-type SF order in SS but its (secondary) product -- the CDW order -- survives. On honeycomb lattice, we find no evidence of SS, but discover an interesting sequence of FCI-Solid I-Solid II transitions, with both solids incompressible. Moreover, in contrast to previous single-roton condensation, this sequence of FCI-Solid I-Solid II transitions is triggered by the softening of multi-roton modes in FCI. Considering the intertwined wave vectors of the CDW orders, Solid I is a vestige of Solid II. Our work provides new horizon not only for the quantum phase transitions in FCI but also for the intertwined orders and gapless states in bosonic systems, which will inspire future studies.</description>

      <title>Slow approach to adiabaticity in many-body non-Hermitian systems: the Hatano-Nelson Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the near adiabatic dynamics in a non-Hermitian quantum many-body system by investigating a finite-time ramp of the imaginary vector potential in the interacting Hatano-Nelson model. The excess energy, the Loschmidt echo, and the density imbalance are analyzed using bosonization and exact diagonalization. The energy becomes complex valued, despite the instantaneous Hamiltonian having the same real spectrum throughout. The adiabatic limit is approached very slowly through damped oscillations. The decay scales with $\tau^{-1}$ with $\tau$ the ramp duration, while the oscillation period is $2L/v$ with $v$ the Fermi velocity and $L$ the system length. Yet, without the need for auxiliary controls, a shortcut to adiabaticity is found for ramp times commensurate with the period. Our work highlights the intricate interplay of adiabaticity and non-Hermitian many-body physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the microcanonical thermal pure quantum (mTPQ) method, the canonical ensemble is derived using Taylor series expansions. We prove that the truncation error decreases exponentially with system size when the effective temperature of the mTPQ state is smaller than the target temperature, and otherwise, the error remains constant. We also show the discipline to set the mTPQ parameter by considering the trade-off between the error and the numerical cost.</description>

      <title>Creating two-qudit maximally entangled quantum link through bulk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We design a set-up for creating maximally entangled two-qudit links between distant nodes which are weakly coupled with interacting spin-s bulk (processor). We exhibit that such quantum links of arbitrary spin quantum number can be formed when the system is prepared at a very low temperature. We find that the Heisenberg and the bilinear-biquadratic (BBQ) spin-s models are the potential candidates to achieve the maximal entanglement in equilibrium. By eliminating the equilibrium requirement, we show that a completely polarized state in the bulk and a suitable qudit state in the link can evolve over time to produce a highly entangled state, as per the BBQ Hamiltonian with nearest- and next-nearest neighbor interactions. When the number of sites in the bulk grows, so does the maximum entanglement produced in dynamics. Further, both the static and the dynamical protocols presented here remain efficient even if the spin quantum numbers of the bulk and the connection are unequal.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Correlations and Pairing Tendencies of the Hybrid Stacking Nickelate Superlattice La$_7$Ni$_5$O$_{17}$ (La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$/La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$) under Pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent rapid progress in high-$T_c$ nickelate superconductors, we comprehensively study the physical properties of the alternating bilayer trilayer stacking nickelate La$_7$Ni$_5$O$_{17}$. The high-symmetry phase of this material, without the tilting of oxygen octahedra, is not stable at ambient conditions but becomes stable under high pressure, where a small hole pocket $\gamma_0$, composed of the $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ states in the trilayer sublattice, appears. This pocket was identified in our previous work for trilayer La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ as important to develop superconductivity. Moreover, using random-phase approximation calculations, we find a leading $s^\pm$ pairing state for the high-symmetry phase under pressure with similar pairing strength as that obtained previously for the bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ compound, suggesting a similar or higher superconducting transition temperature $T_c$. In addition, we find that the dominant magnetic fluctuations in the system driving this pairing state have antiferromagnetic structure both in-plane and between the planes of the top and bottom trilayer and bilayer sublattices, while the middle trilayer is magnetically decoupled.</description>

      <title>Dynamical correlations and order in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.08529v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In magic angle twisted bilayer graphene, transport, thermodynamic and spectroscopic experiments pinpoint at a competition between distinct low-energy states with and without electronic order. We use Dynamical Mean Field Theory (DMFT) on the topological heavy Fermion (THF) model of twisted bilayer graphene to investigate the emergence of electronic correlations and long-range order in the absence of strain. We contrast moment formation, Kondo screening and ordering on a temperature basis and explain the nature of emergent correlated states based on three central phenomena: (i) the formation of local spin and valley isospin moments around 100K, (ii) the ordering of the local isospin moments around 10K preempting Kondo screening, and (iii) a cascadic redistribution of charge between localized and delocalized electronic states upon doping. At integer fillings, we find that low energy spectral weight is depleted in the symmetric phase, while we find insulating states with gaps enhanced by exchange coupling in the zero-strain ordered phases. Doping away from integer filling results in distinct metallic states: a "bad metal" above the ordering temperature, where scattering off the disordered local moments suppresses electronic coherence, and a "good metal" in the ordered states with coherence of quasiparticles facilitated by isospin order. This finding reveals coherence from order as the microscopic mechanism behind the Pomeranchuk effect observed experimentally. Upon doping, there is a periodic charge reshuffling between localized and delocalized electronic orbitals leading to cascades of doping-induced Lifshitz transitions, local spectral weight redistributions and periodic variations of the electronic compressibility. Our findings provide a unified understanding of the most puzzling aspects of scanning tunneling spectroscopy, transport, and compressibility experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07533v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large-scale moir\'e systems are extraordinarily sensitive, with even minute atomic shifts leading to significant changes in electronic structures. Here, we investigate the lattice relaxation effect on moir\'e band structures in twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ with two approaches: (a) large-scale plane-wave basis first principle calculation down to $2.88^{\circ}$, (b) transfer learning structure relaxation + local-basis first principles calculation down to $1.1^{\circ}$. We use two types of van der Waals corrections: the D2 method of Grimme and the density-dependent energy correction, and find that the density-dependent energy correction yields a continuous evolution of bandwidth with twist angles. Based on the above results. we develop a more complete continuum model with a single set of parameters for a wide range of twist angles, and perform many-body simulations at $\nu=-1,-2/3, -1/3$.</description>

      <title>Exponential acceleration of macroscopic quantum tunneling in a Floquet Ising model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17814v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The exponential suppression of macroscopic quantum tunneling (MQT) in the number of elements to be reconfigured is an essential element of broken symmetry phases. This suppression is also a core bottleneck in quantum algorithms, such as traversing an energy landscape in optimization, and adiabatic state preparation more generally. In this work, we demonstrate exponential acceleration of MQT through Floquet engineering with the application of a uniform, high frequency transverse drive field. Using the ferromagnetic phase of the transverse field Ising model in one and two dimensions as a prototypical example, we identify three phenomenological regimes as a function of drive strength. For weak drives, the system exhibits exponentially decaying tunneling rates but robust magnetic order; in the crossover regime at intermediate drive strength, we find polynomial decay of tunnelling alongside vanishing magnetic order; and at very strong drive strengths both the Rabi frequency and time-averaged magnetic order are approximately constant with increasing system size. We support these claims with extensive full wavefunction and tensor network numerical simulations, and theoretical analysis. An experimental test of these results presents a technologically important and novel scientific question accessible on NISQ-era quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Localized dopant motion across the 2D Ising phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11608v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I investigate the motion of a single hole in 2D spin lattices with square and triangular geometries. While the spins have nearest neighbor Ising spin couplings $J$, the hole is allowed to move only in 1D along a single line in the 2D lattice with nearest neighbor hopping amplitude $t$. The non-equilibrium hole dynamics is initialized by suddenly removing a single spin from the thermal Ising spin lattice. I find that for any nonzero spin coupling and temperature, the hole is localized. This is an extension of the thermally induced localization phenomenon [Phys. Rev. Research 6, 023325 (2024)] to the case, where there is a phase transition to a long-range ordered ferromagnetic phase. The dynamics depends only on the ratio of the temperature to the spin coupling, $k_BT / |J|$, and on the ratio of the spin coupling to the hopping $J/t$. I characterize these dependencies in great detail. In particular, I find universal behavior at high temperatures, common features for the square and triangular lattices across the Curie temperatures for ferromagnetic interactions, and highly distinct behaviors for the two geometries in the presence of antiferromagnetic interactions due geometric frustration in the triangular lattice.</description>

      <title>Bipartite reweight-annealing algorithm to extract large-scale data of entanglement entropy and its derivative in high precision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05324v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) scheme able to extract large-scale data of entanglement entropy (EE) and its derivative with high precision and low technical barrier. We avoid directly computing the overlap of two partition functions within different spacetime manifolds and instead obtain them separately via reweight-annealing scheme. The incremental process can be designed along the path of real physical parameters in this frame, and all intermediates are EEs of corresponding parameters, so the algorithm efficiency is improved by more than $10^4$ of times. The calculation of EE becomes much cheaper and simpler. It opens a way to numerically detect the novel phases and phase transitions by scanning EE in a wide parameter-region in two and higher dimensional systems. We then show the feasibility of using EE and its derivative to find phase transition points and to probe novel phases.</description>

      <title>Spin-Phonon Coupling in Transition Metal Insulators II: Spin-Orbital Moments, Chiral Phonons and Application to $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00660v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply a recently developed first-principles based approach for treating generic spin-phonon couplings in materials with strong spin-orbit coupling to study $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$. Of particular focus is the potential for this material to exhibit a phonon thermal Hall effect induced by spin-phonon interactions. We find that spin-orbit coupling significantly enriches the form of these interactions, and imbues them with chirality that is conducive to generating finite phonon Berry curvatures. We show that this leads to a phonon thermal Hall effect that qualitatively reproduces the measured field dependence of $\kappa_{xy}$ without requiring a field-induced spin liquid.</description>

      <title>Taming spin susceptibilities in frustrated quantum magnets: Mean-field form and approximate nature of the quantum-to-classical correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09401v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In frustrated magnetism, the empirically found quantum-to-classical correspondence (QCC) matches the real-space static susceptibility pattern of a quantum spin-$1/2$ model with its classical counterpart computed at a certain elevated temperature. This puzzling relation was observed via bold line diagrammatic Monte Carlo simulations in dimensions two and three. The matching was within error bars and seemed valid down to the lowest accessible temperatures $T$ about an order of magnitude smaller than the exchange coupling $J$. Here we employ resummed spin diagrammatic perturbation theory to show analytically that the QCC breaks at fourth order in $J/T$ and provide the approximate mapping between classical and quantum temperatures. Our treatment further reveals that QCC is an indication of the surprising accuracy with which static correlators can be approximated by a simple renormalized mean-field form. We illustrate this for all models discussed in the context of QCC so far, including a recent example of the $S=1$ material $\mathrm{K}_2\mathrm{Ni}_2(\mathrm{SO}_4)_3$. The success of the mean-field form is traced back to partial diagrammatic cancellations.</description>

      <title>Low-energy peak in the one-particle spectral function of the electron gas at metallic densities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09746v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on a nonperturbative scheme to determine the self-energy \Sigma(k,iw_n) with automatically satisfying the Ward identity and the total momentum conservation law, a fully self-consistent calculation is done in the electron gas at various temperatures T to obtain G(k,iw_n) the one-particle Green's function with fulfilling all known conservation laws, sum rules, and correct asymptotic behaviors; here, T is taken unprecedentedly low, namely, T/E_F down to 10^{-4} with E_F the Fermi energy, and tiny mesh as small as 10^{-4}k_F is chosen near the Fermi surface in k space with k_F the Fermi momentum. By analytically continuing G(k,iw_n) to the retarded function G^R(k,w), we find a novel low-energy peak, in addition to the quasiparticle (QP) peak and one- and two-plasmon high-energy satellites, in the spectral function A(k,w)[= -Im G^R(k,w)/\pi] for T less than about 10^{-3}E_F in the simple-metal density region (2&lt;r_s&lt;6 with r_s the dimensionless density parameter). This new peak is attributed to the effect of excitonic attraction on \Sigma(k,iw_n) arising from multiple excitations of tightly bound electron-hole pairs in the polarization function \Pi(q,iw_q) for |q| equal to about 2k_F and |w_q| &lt;&lt; E_F and thus it is dubbed ``excitron''. Although this excitron peak height is only about a one-hundredth of that of QP, its excitation energy is about a half of that of QP for |k| equal to about k_F, seemingly in contradiction to the Landau's hypothesis as to the one-to-one correspondence of low-energy excitations between a free Fermi gas and an interacting normal Fermi liquid. As for the QP properties, our results of both the effective mass m^* and the renormalization factor z^* are in good agreement with those provided by recent quantum Monte Carlo simulations and available experiments.</description>

      <title>Engineering Fractional Chern Insulators through Periodic Strain in Monolayer Graphene and Transition Metal Dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12411v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose the realization of interaction-driven insulators in periodically strained monolayer graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). By analyzing the tunable band structure and band geometry via strain, and performing extensive many-body exact diagonalization of a realistic model, we present compelling evidence for realizing various fractional Chern insulators in both strained monolayer graphene and TMDs. Our thorough analysis across different strain parameters, accounting for experimental variability, reveals that a broad spectrum of fractional Chern insulators, including the Laughlin states, Halperin 112, 332 and 111 states, and Chern number |C| = 2 states, can be stabilized in distinct regions of the phase diagram. These findings suggest that periodically strained monolayer graphene and TMDs provide promising platforms for engineering fractional Chern insulators.</description>

      <title>$^{19}$F NMR and defect spins in vacuum-annealed LaO$_{0.5}$F$_{0.5}$BiS$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06284v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report results of magnetization and $^{19}$F NMR measurements in the normal state of as-grown LaO$_{0.5}$F$_{0.5}$BiS$_2$. The magnetization is dominated by a temperature-independent diamagnetic component and a field- and temperature-dependent paramagnetic contribution $M_\mu(H,T)$ from a $\sim$1000~ppm concentration of local moments, an order of magnitude higher than can be accounted for by measured rare-earth impurity concentrations. $M_\mu(H,T)$ can be fit by the Brillouin function $B_J(x)$ or, perhaps more realistically, a two-level $\tanh(x)$ model for magnetic Bi $6p$ ions in defect crystal fields. Both fits require a phenomenological Curie-Weiss argument $x = \mu_\mathrm{eff}H/(T + T_W)$, $T_W \approx 1.7$ K. There is no evidence for magnetic order down to 2 K, and the origin of $T_W$ is not clear. $^{19}$F frequency shifts, linewidths, and spin-lattice relaxation rates are consistent with purely dipolar $^{19}$F/defect-spin interactions. The defect-spin correlation time $\tau_c(T)$ obtained from $^{19}$F spin-lattice relaxation rates obeys the Korringa relation $\tau_cT = \text{const.}$, indicating the relaxation is dominated by conduction-band fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Simulating the Transverse Field Ising Model on the Kagome Lattice using a Programmable Quantum Annealer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.06698v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The presence of competing interactions due to geometry leads to frustration in quantum spin models. As a consequence, the ground state of such systems often displays a large degeneracy that can be lifted due to thermal or quantum effects. One such example is the antiferromagnetic Ising model on the Kagome lattice. It was shown that while the same model on the triangular lattice is ordered at zero temperature for small transverse field due to an order by disorder mechanism, the Kagome lattice resists any such effects and exhibits only short range spin correlations and a trivial paramagnetic phase. We embed this model on the latest architecture of D-Wave's quantum annealer, the Advantage2 prototype, which uses the highly connected Zephyr graph. Using advanced embedding and calibration techniques, we are able to embed a Kagome lattice with mixed open and periodic boundary conditions of 231 sites on the full graph of the currently available prototype. Through forward annealing experiments, we show that under a finite longitudinal field the system exhibits a one-third magnetization plateau, consistent with a classical spin liquid state of reduced entropy. An anneal-pause-quench protocol is then used to extract an experimental ensemble of states resulting from the equilibration of the model at finite transverse and longitudinal field. This allows us to construct a partial phase diagram and confirm that the system exits the constrained Hilbert space of the classical spin liquid when subjected to a transverse field. We connect our results to previous theoretical results and quantum Monte Carlo simulation, which helps us confirm the validity of the quantum simulation realized here, thereby extracting insight into the performance of the D-Wave quantum annealer to simulate non-trivial quantum systems in equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Many-body quantum interference route to the two-channel Kondo effect: Inverse design for molecular junctions and quantum dot devices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.14775v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Molecular junctions -- whether actual single molecules in nanowire break junctions or artificial molecules realized in coupled quantum dot devices -- offer unique functionality due to their orbital complexity, strong electron interactions, gate control, and many-body effects from hybridization with the external electronic circuit. Inverse design involves finding candidate structures that perform a desired function optimally. Here we develop an inverse design strategy for generalized quantum impurity models describing molecular junctions, and as an example, use it to demonstrate that many-body quantum interference can be leveraged to realize the two-channel Kondo critical point in simple 4- or 5-site molecular moieties. We show that remarkably high Kondo temperatures can be achieved, meaning that entropy and transport signatures should be experimentally accessible.</description>

      <title>Topological Orders Beyond Topological Quantum Field Theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.03353v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Systems displaying quantum topological order feature robust characteristics that are very attractive to quantum computing schemes. Topological quantum field theories have proven to be powerful in capturing the quintessential attributes of systems displaying topological order including, in particular, their anyon excitations. Here, we investigate systems that lie outside this common purview, and present a rich class of models exhibiting topological orders with distance-dependent interactions between anyons. As we illustrate, in some instances, the gapped lowest-energy excitations are comprised of anyons that densely cover the entire system. This leads to behaviors not typically described by topological quantum field theories. We examine these models by performing exact dualities to systems displaying conventional (i.e., Landau) orders. Our approach enables a general method for mapping generic Landau-type theories to dual models with topological order of the same spatial dimension. The low-energy subspaces of our models can be made more resilient to thermal effects than those of surface codes.</description>

      <title>Interpolating many-body wave functions for accelerated molecular dynamics on the near-exact electronic surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11097v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While there have been many developments in computational probes of both strongly-correlated molecular systems and machine-learning accelerated molecular dynamics, there remains a significant gap in capabilities in simulating accurate non-local electronic structure over timescales on which atoms move. We develop an approach to bridge these fields with a practical interpolation scheme for the correlated many-electron state through the space of atomic configurations, whilst avoiding the exponential complexity of these underlying electronic states. With a small number of accurate correlated wave functions as a training set, we demonstrate provable convergence to near-exact potential energy surfaces for subsequent dynamics with propagation of a valid many-body wave function and inference of its variational energy whilst retaining a mean-field computational scaling. This represents a profoundly different paradigm to the direct interpolation of potential energy surfaces in established machine-learning approaches. We combine this with modern electronic structure approaches to systematically resolve molecular dynamics trajectories and converge thermodynamic quantities with a high-throughput of several million interpolated wave functions with explicit validation of their accuracy from only a few numerically exact quantum chemical calculations. We also highlight the comparison to traditional machine-learned potentials or dynamics on mean-field surfaces.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a metallic room-temperature d-wave altermagnet KV2Se2O</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00320v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Beyond conventional ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism, altermagnetism is a recently discovered unconventional magnetic phase characterized by time-reversal symmetry breaking and spin-split band structures in materials with zero net magnetization. This distinct magnetic phase not only enriches the understanding of fundamental physical concepts but also has profound impacts on condense-matter physics research and practical device applications. Spin-polarized band structures have been recently observed in semiconductors MnTe and MnTe2 with vanishing net magnetization, confirming the existence of this unconventional magnetic order. Metallic altermagnets have unique advantages for exploring novel physical phenomena related to low-energy quasiparticle excitations and for applications in spintronics as electrical conductivity in metals allows the direct manipulation of spin current through electric field. Here, through comprehensive characterization and analysis of the magnetic and electronic structures of KV2Se2O, we have unambiguously demonstrated a metallic room-temperature altermaget with d-wave spin-momentum locking. The highly anisotropic spin-polarized Fermi surfaces and the spin-density-wave order emerging in the altermagnetic phase make it an extraordinary platform for designing high-performance spintronic devices and studying many-body effects coupled with the unconventional magnetism.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Coexistence of Spin States in [Fe-(tpy-ph)$_2$]$^{2+}$ Complexes on Au(111) using ab initio calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07014v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we systematically study the electronic structure and stability of spin states of the [Fe-(tpy-ph)$_2$]$^{2+}$ molecule in both gas phase and on a Au(111) substrate using density functional theory +U (DFT+U) calculations. We find that the stability of the Fe$^{2+}$ ion's spin states is significantly influenced by the Hubbard U parameter. In the gas phase, the low-spin (LS, S=0) state is found to be energetically favorable for U(Fe) $\leq$ 3 eV, whereas the high-spin (HS, S=2) state is stabilized for U(Fe) &gt; 3 eV. Interaction with the Au(111) substrate is found to elevate the critical U for the spin-state transition to 3.5 eV. Additionally, we perform L-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) calculations based on time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) for both HS and LS states. The calculated XAS suggests that the HS state more closely aligns with the experimental observations, indicating the potential coexistence of the HS state as the initial state during the X-ray excitation process. These findings enrich our understanding of spin-state dynamics in [Fe-(tpy-ph)$_2$]$^{2+}$.</description>
