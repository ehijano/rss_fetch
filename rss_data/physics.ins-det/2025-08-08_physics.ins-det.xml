      <title>A mobile high spatial-resolution Muography hodoscope based on large-area Micromegas detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Muon radiography is an imaging technique based on muon absorption in matter that allows measurement of internal details in hidden objects or structures. This technique relies on measuring cosmic-ray muons tracks accurately, which reflects the incoming muon flux from both the target object and the open sky. In this paper, we report on the construction of a high spatial resolution muography hodoscope based on Micromegas detectors. Using four layers of 40cm {\times} 40 cm Micromegas detectors, channel multiplexing circuits, and the versatile readout system, a moveable muography hodoscope named {\mu}STC-R400 was designed and constructed. Results show that the channel multiplexing circuits can resolve hit positions correctly, and the spatial resolution of the detector is approximately 190 {\mu}m. Experiments were conducted at an under-construction subway tunnel and outdoors near a mountain, demonstrating the {\mu}STC-R400's ability to maintain high spatial resolution outside the laboratory and its robustness in harsh environments.</description>

      <title>Phonon-blocked junction calorimeter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces a cold-electron microcalorimeter based on phonon-blocked junctions, integrating on-chip electron cooling and boundary phonon isolation to achieve exceptional energy resolution and rapid thermal response. A general theoretical framework is presented, along with derived approximate analytical expressions for key performance metrics, including cooling efficiency, thermal time constant, and energy resolution. The work examines the influence of device parameters, including non-ideal effects such as subgap tunneling and heat backflow, and offers insights into optimizing detector performance. The findings highlight the potential of phonon-blocked junction microcalorimeters to rival or outperform the state-of-art technologies, such as transition-edge sensors, paving the way for applications requiring precise and fast energy detection.</description>

      <title>Neural Field-Based 3D Surface Reconstruction of Microstructures from Multi-Detector Signals in Scanning Electron Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The scanning electron microscope (SEM) is a widely used imaging device in scientific research and industrial applications. Conventional two-dimensional (2D) SEM images do not directly reveal the three-dimensional (3D) topography of micro samples, motivating the development of SEM 3D surface reconstruction methods. However, reconstruction of complex microstructures remains challenging for existing methods due to the limitations of discrete 3D representations, the need for calibration with reference samples, and shadow-induced gradient errors. Here, we introduce NFH-SEM, a neural field-based hybrid SEM 3D reconstruction method that takes multi-view, multi-detector 2D SEM images as input and fuses geometric and photometric information into a continuous neural field representation. NFH-SEM eliminates the manual calibration procedures through end-to-end self-calibration and automatically disentangles shadows from SEM images during training, enabling accurate reconstruction of intricate microstructures. We validate the effectiveness of NFH-SEM on real and simulated datasets. Our experiments show high-fidelity reconstructions of diverse, challenging samples, including two-photon lithography microstructures, peach pollen, and silicon carbide particle surfaces, demonstrating precise detail and broad applicability.</description>

      <title>Malter-Driven Electron Emission as a Source of Noise in LXe TPCs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01023v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Persistent single-electron emission ("hot spots") has been observed in multiple liquid xenon (LXe) time projection chambers (TPCs), often persisting long after ionizing events. Although typically discussed in operational terms, the behavior is consistent with Malter-type emission triggered by ion accumulation on resistive oxide surfaces. In this note, we discuss such effects and recommend material choices and design strategies to mitigate them in future detectors. This mechanism is especially relevant to experiments targeting ultra-low energy thresholds, where even small background emissions can limit sensitivity.</description>

      <title>The Fast Stochastic Matching Pursuit for Neutrino and Dark Matter Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03156v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) are widely deployed at neutrino and dark matter experiments for photon counting. When multiple photons hit a PMT consecutively, their photo-electron (PE) pulses pile up to hinder the precise measurements of the count and timings. We introduce Fast Stochastic Matching Pursuit (FSMP) to analyze the PMT signal waveforms into individual PEs with the strategy of reversible-jump Markov-chain Monte Carlo. We demonstrate that FSMP improves the energy and time resolution of PMT-based experiments and gains acceleration on GPUs. It is suitable for dynode PMTs, and is extensible to microchannel-plate (MCP) PMTs. In the condition of our laboratory characterization of 8-inch MCP-PMTs, FSMP improves the energy resolution by up to 10% from the conventional method of waveform integration.</description>

      <title>Community Report from the 2025 SNOLAB Future Projects Workshop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11368v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: SNOLAB hosts a biannual Future Projects Workshop (FPW) with the goal of encouraging future project stakeholders to present ideas, concepts, and needs for experiments or programs that could one day be hosted at SNOLAB. The 2025 FPW was held in the larger context of a 15-year planning exercise requested by the Canada Foundation for Innovation. This report collects input from the community, including both contributions to the workshop and contributions that could not be scheduled in the workshop but nonetheless are important to the community.</description>
