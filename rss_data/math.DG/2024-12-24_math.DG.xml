      <title>Sasaki structures on general contact manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the concept of a Sasakian structure on a cooriented contact manifold, given by a compatibility between the contact form $\eta$ and a Riemannian metric $g_M$ on $M$, to the case of a general contact structure understood as a contact distribution. Traditionally, the compatibility can be expressed as the fact that the symplectic form $\omega=\mathrm{d}(s^2\eta)$ and the metric $g(x,s)=\mathrm{d} s\otimes\mathrm{d} s+s^2g_M(x)$ define on the cone $\mathcal{M}=M\times\mathbb{R}_+$ a K\"ahler structure. Since general contact structures can be realized as homogeneous symplectic structures $\omega$ on $\mathrm{GL}(1;\mathbb{R})$-principal bundles $P\to M$, it is natural to understand Sasakian structures in full generality as related to `homogeneous K\"ahler structures' on $P$. The difficulty is that, even locally, contact distributions do not provide any preferred contact form, so the standard approach cannot be directly applied. However, we succeeded in characterizing homogeneous K\"ahler structures on $(P,\omega)$ and discovering a canonical lift of Riemannian metrics from the contact manifold $M$ to $P$, which allowed us to define Sasakian structures for general contact manifolds. This approach is completely conceptual and avoids ad hoc choices. Moreover, it provides a natural concept of Sasakian manifold products which we develop in detail.</description>

      <title>The Geometry of Loop Spaces IV: Closed Sasakian Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a one-parameter family of pairwise non-isometric metrics $h_{\rho}, \rho &gt; 0,$ on any closed Sasakian manifold $M^{4k+1}$ such that $\pi_1({\rm Isom}(M, h_\rho))$ is infinite. On $S^{4k+1}$, $h_0$ is the standard metric, so $\pi_1({\rm Isom}(S^{4k+1}, h_\rho)) = {\mathbb Z}_2$ is finite only at $\rho = 0.$ We also give a new proof that $\pi_1({\rm Diff}_{\eta,str} (S^{4k+1}))$ is infinite, where ${\rm Diff}_{\eta,str} (S^{4k+1})$ is the infinite dimensional group of diffeomrophisms which are strict contact transformations of the standard contact structure on $S^{4k+1}.$</description>

      <title>Unknottedness of free boundary minimal surfaces and self-shrinkers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study unknottedness for free boundary minimal surfaces in a three-dimensional Riemannian manifold with nonnegative Ricci curvature and strictly convex boundary, and for self-shrinkers in the three-dimensional Euclidean space. For doing so, we introduce the concepts of boundary graph for free boundary minimal surfaces and of graph at infinity for self-shrinkers. We prove that these surfaces are unknotted in the sense that any two such surfaces with isomorphic boundary graph or graph at infinity are smoothly isotopic.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a continuous 3-parameter family of non-shrinking Ricci solitons complex line bundles $O(k)$ over $\mathbb{CP}^{2m+1}$, where the base space is not necessarily K\"ahler--Einstein. Each $O(k)$ with $k\in [3,2m+1]$ admits at least one asymptotically conical (AC) Ricci-flat metric in this family. For each $O(k)$ with $k\geq 3$, the family includes infinitely many asymptotically paraboloidal (AP) steady Ricci soliton.</description>

      <title>Foliation of constant harmonic mean curvature surfaces in asymptotic Schwarzschild spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the volume-preserving harmonic mean curvature flow in asymptotically Schwarzschild spaces. We demonstrate the long-time existence and exponential convergence of this flow with a coordinate sphere of large radius serving as the initial surface in the asymptotically flat end, which eventually converges to a constant harmonic mean curvature surface. We also establish that these surfaces form a foliation of the space outside a large ball. Finally, we utilize this foliation to define the center of mass, proving that it agrees with the center of mass defined by the ADM formulation of the initial data set.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the uniform doubling property holds for every Lie group which can be written as a quotient group of $\operatorname{SU}(2) \times \mathbb{R}^n$ for some $n$. In particular, this class includes the four-dimensional unitary group $\operatorname{U}(2)$. As this class contain non-compact as well as compact Lie groups, we discuss a number of analytic and spectral consequences for the corresponding heat kernels.</description>

      <title>Affine vector fields on compact pseudo-K\"ahler manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that a Killing field on a compact pseudo-K\"ahler manifold is necessarily (real) holomorphic, as long as the manifold satisfies some relatively mild additional conditions. We provide two further proofs of this fact and discuss the natural open question whether the same conclusion holds for affine -- rather than Killing -- vector fields. The question cannot be settled by invoking the Killing case: Boubel and Mounoud [Trans.Amer. Math. Soc. 368, 2016, 2223--2262] constructed examples of non-Killing affine vector fields on compact pseudo-Riemannian manifolds. We show that an affine vector field v is necessarily symplectic, and establish some algebraic and differential properties of the Lie derivative of the metric along v, such as its being parallel, antilinear and nilpotent as an endomorphism of the tangent bundle. As a consequence, the answer to the above question turns out to be `yes' whenever the underlying manifold admits no nontrivial holomorphic quadratic differentials, which includes the case of compact almost homogeneous complex manifolds with nonzero Euler characteristic.</description>

      <title>Mannheim-d'Ocagne-Koenderink type formulas for asymptotic directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a surface embedded in the Euclidean 3-space and fix a tangential vector $v$ at a given point $p$ on the surface. In this paper, we first review a history of the formula obtained by Mannheim, d'Ocagne and Koenderink, which asserts that the Gaussian curvature of the surface at $p$ can be obtained if one knows "the normal curvature at $p$ with respect to $v$" and "the curvature of the contour line $L$ of the surface at $p$" with respect to the orthogonal projection induced by $v$. Unfortunately, this formula does not work when $v$ points in an asymptotic direction. When $v$ is just the case, we give anlogues of the formula, which include an invariant of cusp singular points of $L$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the Minkowski space, we consider a spacelike hypersurface with boundary, which can be written as a graph. We prove that, if its $k$-th mean curvature is constant, and its boundary is on a hyperplane with constant intersection angles, then the hypersurface must be a part of the hyperboloid. This result can be seen as an analog of the sphere theorem for the hypersurface of constant $k$-th mean curvature in the Euclidean space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct asymptotic foliations of asymtotically Schwarzschildean lightcones by surfaces of constant spacetime mean curvature (STCMC). Our construction is motivated by the approach of Huisken-Yau for the Riemannian setting in employing a geometric flow. We prove that initial data within a sufficient a-priori class converges exponentially to an STCMC surface under area preserving null mean curvature flow. Further, we show that the resulting STCMC surfaces form an asymptotic foliation that is unique within the a-priori class.</description>

      <title>A vanishing theorem in $K$-theory for spectral projections of a non-periodic magnetic Schr\"odinger operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Schr\"odinger operator $H(\mu) = \nabla_{\bf A}^*\nabla_{\bf A} + \mu V$ on a Riemannian manifold $M$ of bounded geometry, where $\mu&gt;0$ is a coupling parameter, the magnetic field ${\bf B}=d{\bf A}$ and the electric potential $V$ are uniformly $C^\infty$-bounded, $V\geq 0$. We assume that, for some $E_0&gt;0$, each connected component of the sublevel set $\{V&lt;E_0\}$ of the potential $V$ is relatively compact. Under some assumptions on geometric and spectral properties of the connected components, we show that, for sufficiently large $\mu$, the spectrum of $H(\mu)$ in the interval $[0,E_0\mu]$ has a gap, the spectral projection of $H(\mu)$, corresponding to the interval $(-\infty,\lambda]$ with $\lambda$ in the gap, belongs to the Roe $C^*$-algebra $C^*(M)$ of the manifold $M$, and its class in the $K$ theory of $C^*(M)$ is trivial.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we consider operators of the form $\partial_s\xi+A(s)\xi$ where $s$ lies in an interval $[-T,T]$ and $s\mapsto A(s)$ is continuous. Without boundary conditions these operators are not Fredholm. However, using interpolation theory one can define suitable boundary conditions for these operators so that they become Fredholm. We show that in this case the Fredholm index is given by the spectral flow of the operator path $A$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1960, J.F. Adams introduced secondary cohomology operations that are defined on cohomology elements on which sufficiently many Steenrod algebra elements vanish. This led to his theorem on singly generated cohomology rings, which in turn led to his celebrated resolution of the Hopf invariant one problem. Here we advertise a conjecture that would extend Adams' result and prove it in a special case.</description>

      <title>A localized construction of Kasner-like singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct local, in spacetime, singular solutions to the Einstein vacuum equations that exhibit Kasner-like behavior in their past boundary. Our result can be viewed as a localization (in space) of the construction in \cite{FL}. We also prove a refined uniqueness statement and give a simple argument that generates general asymptotic data for Kasner-like singularities, enjoying all expected degrees of freedom, albeit only locally in space. The key difference of the present work with \cite{FL} is our use of a first order symmetric hyperbolic formulation of the Einstein vacuum equations, relative to the connection coefficients of a parallelly propagated orthonormal frame which is adapted to the Gaussian time foliation. This makes it easier to localize the construction, since elliptic estimates are no longer required to complete the energy argument.</description>

      <title>On the Bauer--Furuta construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the six-functor formalism for sheaves of spectra on topological spaces, we provide a novel construction of the Bauer--Furuta invariant, as well as its family version. This approach avoids the conventional arguments based on approximations by finite-dimensional subspaces, and we instead employ the Borel--Moore homology spectra relative to Fredholm maps between Banach spaces. A key observation here is that $C^1$-differentiable Fredholm maps between Banach manifolds are locally proper, thereby defining the shriek functors, whose dualizing objects may be described as the Thom spectra of the Atiyah--Singer families index.
  We also outline a possible candidate for the stable homotopy theory of genuine equivariant sheaves on topological spaces with Lie group actions. In this context, we investigate the proper pushforward functor, which accommodates the genuine equivariant Bauer--Furuta invariant.</description>

      <title>Maximal symplectic torus actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There are several different notions of maximal torus actions on smooth manifolds, in various contexts: symplectic, Riemannian, complex. In the symplectic context, for the so-called isotropy-maximal actions, as well as for the weaker notion of almost isotropy-maximal actions, we give classifications up to equivariant symplectomorphism. These classification results give symplectic analogues of recent classifications in the complex and Riemannian contexts. Moreover, we deduce that every almost isotropy-maximal symplectic torus action is equivariantly diffeomorphic to a product of a symplectic toric manifold and a torus, answering a question of Ishida. The proof of the classification theorem involves tools from Duistermaat and Pelayo's classification of symplectic torus actions with coisotropic orbits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the half-form corrected geometric quantization of symplectic toric manifolds with respect to mixed toric polarizations $\mathcal{P}_{\infty}$. These polarizations are obtained at infinite geodesic time along Mabuchi rays of toric K\"ahler polarizations generated by the norm square of the moment map of a torus subgroup.
  The geodesic rays are lifted to the quantum bundle via generalized coherent state transforms (gCST) and define equivariant isomorphisms between Hilbert spaces for the K\"ahler polarizations and the Hilbert space for the mixed polarization.</description>

      <title>Conformal transformations and equivariance in unbounded KK-theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend unbounded Kasparov theory to encompass conformal group and quantum group equivariance. This new framework allows us to treat conformal actions on both manifolds and noncommutative spaces. As examples, we present unbounded representatives of Kasparov's $\gamma$-element for the Lorentz groups and display the conformal $SL_q(2)$-equivariance of the standard spectral triple of the Podle\'s sphere. In pursuing descent for conformally equivariant cycles, we are led to a new framework for representing Kasparov classes. Our new representatives are unbounded, possess a dynamical quality, and also include known twisted spectral triples. We define an equivalence relation on these new representatives whose classes form an abelian group surjecting onto KK. The technical innovation which underpins these results is a novel multiplicative perturbation theory. By these means, we obtain Kasparov classes from the bounded transform with minimal side conditions.</description>

      <title>Local Boundary Conditions for Dirac-type operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider Dirac-type operators on manifolds with boundary, and set out to determine all local smooth boundary conditions that give rise to (strongly) regular self-adjoint operators. By combining the general theory of boundary value problems for Dirac operators as in [BB12] and pointwise considerations, for local smooth boundary conditions the question of being self-adjoint resp. regular is fully translated into linear-algebraic language at each boundary point. We analyse these conditions and classify them in low dimensions and ranks. In particular, we classify all local self-adjoint regular boundary conditions for Dirac spinors (four spinor components) in dimensions $3$ and $4$. With the same techniques we can also treat transmission boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>An efficient volume-preserving MBO scheme for data clustering and classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose and study a novel efficient algorithm for clustering and classification tasks based on the famous MBO scheme. On the one hand, inspired by Jacobs et al. [J. Comp. Phys. 2018], we introduce constraints on the size of clusters leading to a linear integer problem. We prove that the solution to this problem is induced by a novel order statistic. This viewpoint allows us to develop exact and highly efficient algorithms to solve such constrained integer problems. On the other hand, we prove an estimate of the computational complexity of our scheme, which is better than any available provable bounds for the state of the art. This rigorous analysis is based on a variational viewpoint that connects this scheme to volume-preserving mean curvature flow in the big data and small time-step limit.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of conformal-harmonic maps on locally conformally flat 4-manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.05874v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the theory of harmonic maps on Riemannian surfaces, conformal-harmonic maps between two Riemannian manifolds $M$ and $N$ were introduced in search of a natural notion of harmonicity for maps defined on a general even dimensional Riemannian manifold $M$. They are critical points of a conformally invariant energy functional and reassemble the GJMS operators when the target is the set of real or complex numbers. On a four dimensional manifold, conformal-harmonic maps are the conformally invariant counterparts of the intrinsic bi-harmonic maps and a mapping version of the conformally invariant Paneitz operator for functions.
  In this paper, we consider conformal-harmonic maps from certain locally conformally flat 4-manifolds into spheres. We prove a quantitative uniqueness result for such conformal-harmonic maps as an immediate consequence of convexity for the conformally-invariant energy functional. To this end, we are led to prove a version of second order Hardy inequality on manifolds, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Dirac-harmonic maps with trivial index</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.04106v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a homotopy class $[u]$ of maps between a closed Riemannian manifold $M$ and a general manifold $N$, we want to find a Dirac-harmonic map with the map component in the given homotopy class. Most known results require the index to be nontrivial. When the index is trivial, the few known results are all constructive and produce uncoupled solutions. In this paper, we define a new quantity. As a byproduct of proving the homotopy invariance of this new quantity, we find a new simple proof for the fact that all Dirac-harmonic spheres in surfaces are uncoupled. More importantly, by using the homotopy invariance of this new quantity, we prove the existence of Dirac-harmonic maps from manifolds in the trivial index case. In particular, when the domain is a closed Riemann surface, we prove the short-time existence of the $\alpha$-Dirac-harmonic map flow in the trivial index case. Together with the density of the minimal kernel, we get an existence result for Dirac-harmonic maps from closed Riemann surfaces to K\"ahler manifolds, which extends the previous result of the first and third authors. This establishes a general existence theory for Dirac-harmonic maps in the context of trivial index.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we fix the complex structure and explore the moduli space of the heterotic system by considering two different yet "dual" deformation paths starting from a K\"ahler solution. They correspond to deformation along the Bott-Chern cohomology class and the Aeppli cohomology class respectively. Using the implicit function theorem, we prove the local existence of heterotic solutions along these two paths and hence establish an initial step to construct local moduli coordinates around a K\"ahler solution.</description>

Abstract: In this work, optimal rigidity results for eigenvalues on K\"ahler manifolds with positive Ricci lower bound are established. More precisely, for those K\"ahler manifolds whose first eigenvalue agrees with the Ricci lower bound, we show that the complex projective space is the only one with the largest multiplicity of the first eigenvalue. Moreover, there is a specific gap between the largest and the second largest multiplicity. In the K\"ahler--Einstein case, almost rigidity results for eigenvalues are also obtained.</description>

      <title>Four-dimensional gradient Ricci solitons with (half) nonnegative isotropic curvature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19627v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This is a sequel to our paper [24], in which we investigated the geometry of 4-dimensional gradient shrinking Ricci solitons with half positive (nonnegative) isotropic curvature. In this paper, we mainly focus on 4-dimensional gradient steady Ricci solitons with nonnegative isotropic curvature (WPIC) or half nonnegative isotropic curvature (half WPIC). In particular, for 4D complete ancient solutions with WPIC, we are able to prove the 2-nonnegativity of the Ricci curvature and bound the curvature tensor Rm by |Rm|\leq R. For 4D gradient steady solitons with WPIC, we obtain a classification result. We also give a partial classification of 4D gradient steady Ricci solitons with half WPIC. Moreover, we obtain a preliminary classification result for 4D complete gradient expanding Ricci solitons with WPIC. Finally, motivated by the recent work [59], we improve our earlier results in [24] on 4D gradient shrinking Ricci solitons with half PIC or half WPIC, and also provide a characterization of complete gradient Kaehler-Ricci shrinkers in complex dimension two among 4-dimensional gradient Ricci shrinkers.</description>

Abstract: We consider the magnetic Steklov eigenvalue problem on compact Riemannian manifolds with boundary for generic magnetic potentials and establish various results concerning the spectrum. We provide equivalent characterizations of magnetic Steklov operators which are unitarily equivalent to the classical Steklov operator and study bounds for the smallest eigenvalue. We prove a Cheeger-Jammes type lower bound for the first eigenvalue by introducing magnetic Cheeger constants. We also obtain an analogue of an upper bound for the first magnetic Neumann eigenvalue due to Colbois, El Soufi, Ilias and Savo. In addition, we compute the full spectrum in the case of the Euclidean $2$-ball and $4$-ball for a particular choice of magnetic potential given by Killing vector fields, and discuss the behavior. Finally, we establish a comparison result for the magnetic Steklov operator associated with the manifold and the square root of the magnetic Laplacian on the boundary, which generalizes the uniform geometric upper bounds for the difference of the corresponding eigenvalues in the non-magnetic case due to Colbois, Girouard and Hassannezhad.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19121v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In his book "Metric structures for Riemannian and non-Riemannian spaces", Gromov defined two properties of Riemannian manifolds, ellipticity and quasiregular ellipticity, and suggested that there may be a connection between the two. Since then, groups of researchers working independently have proved strikingly similar results about these two concepts. We obtain new topological obstructions to the two properties: most notably, we show that closed manifolds of both types must have virtually abelian fundamental group. We also give the first examples of open manifolds which are elliptic but not quasireguarly elliptic and vice versa. Whether there is a direct connection between these properties -- and, in particular, whether they are equivalent for closed manifolds -- remains elusive.</description>

Abstract: We give an explicit description of the Fefferman metric for twistor CR manifolds in terms of Riemannian structures on the base conformal $3$-manifolds. As an application, we prove that chains and null chains on twistor CR manifolds project to conformal geodesics, and that any conformal geodesic has lifts both to a chain and a null chain. By using this correspondence, we give a variational characterization of conformal geodesics in dimension three which involves the total torsion functional.</description>

Moreover, we show that affine Anosov representations of any word hyperbolic group in $\mathsf{SO}(n,n-1)\ltimes\mathbb{R}^{2n-1}$ are infinitesimal versions of such special Anosov representations. Finally, using the above two results we interpret Margulis spacetimes as infinitesimal versions of quotient manifolds of $\mathbb{H}^{n,n-1}$.
  In the appendix, we give a description of the appropriate cross-ratios in our setting and their infinitesimal versions.</description>

      <title>Projective model structures on diffeological spaces and smooth sets and the smooth Oka principle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.12845v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the first part of the paper, we prove that the category of diffeological spaces does not admit a model structure transferred via the smooth singular complex functor from simplicial sets, resolving in the negative a conjecture of Christensen and Wu, in contrast to Kihara's model structure on diffeological spaces constructed using a different singular complex functor. Next, motivated by applications in quantum field theory and topology, we embed diffeological spaces into sheaves of sets (not necessarily concrete) on the site of smooth manifolds and study the proper combinatorial model structure on such sheaves transferred via the smooth singular complex functor from simplicial sets. We show the resulting model category to be Quillen equivalent to the model category of simplicial sets. We then show that this model structure is cartesian, all smooth manifolds are cofibrant, and establish the existence of model structures on categories of algebras over operads. Finally, we use these results to establish analogous properties for model structures on simplicial presheaves on smooth manifolds, as well as presheaves valued in left proper combinatorial model categories, and prove a generalization of the smooth Oka principle established in arXiv:1912.10544. We apply these results to establish classification theorems for differential-geometric objects like closed differential forms, principal bundles with connection, and higher bundle gerbes with connection on arbitrary cofibrant diffeological spaces.</description>

      <title>Finiteness and the Emergence of Dualities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03640v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We argue that the finiteness of quantum gravity amplitudes in fully compactified theories (at least in supersymmetric cases) leads to a bottom-up prediction for the existence of non-trivial dualities. In particular, finiteness requires the moduli space of massless fields to be compactifiable, meaning that its volume must be finite or at least grow no faster than that of Euclidean space. Moreover, we relate the compactifiability of moduli spaces to the condition that the lattice of charged objects transform in a semisimple representation under the action of the duality group. These ideas are supported by a wide variety of string theory examples.</description>
