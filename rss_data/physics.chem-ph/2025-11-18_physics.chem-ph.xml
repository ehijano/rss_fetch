      <title>Omics-scale polymer computational database transferable to real-world artificial intelligence applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing large-scale foundational datasets is a critical milestone in advancing artificial intelligence (AI)-driven scientific innovation. However, unlike AI-mature fields such as natural language processing, materials science, particularly polymer research, has significantly lagged in developing extensive open datasets. This lag is primarily due to the high costs of polymer synthesis and property measurements, along with the vastness and complexity of the chemical space. This study presents PolyOmics, an omics-scale computational database generated through fully automated molecular dynamics simulation pipelines that provide diverse physical properties for over $10^5$ polymeric materials. The PolyOmics database is collaboratively developed by approximately 260 researchers from 48 institutions to bridge the gap between academia and industry. Machine learning models pretrained on PolyOmics can be efficiently fine-tuned for a wide range of real-world downstream tasks, even when only limited experimental data are available. Notably, the generalisation capability of these simulation-to-real transfer models improve significantly as the size of the PolyOmics database increases, exhibiting power-law scaling. The emergence of scaling laws supports the "more is better" principle, highlighting the significance of ultralarge-scale computational materials data for improving real-world prediction performance. This unprecedented omics-scale database reveals vast unexplored regions of polymer materials, providing a foundation for AI-driven polymer science.</description>

      <title>Differentiable Electrochemistry: A paradigm for uncovering hidden physical phenomena in electrochemical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the long history of electrochemistry, there is a lack of quantitative algorithms that rigorously correlate experiment with theory. Electrochemical modeling has had advanced across empirical, analytical, numerical, and data-driven paradigms. Data-driven machine learning and physics based electrochemical modeling, however, have not been explicitly linked. Here we introduce Differentiable Electrochemistry, a mew paradigm in electrochemical modeling that integrates thermodynamics, kinetics and mass transport with differentiable programming enabled by automatic differentiation. By making the entire electrochemical simulation end-to-end differentiable, this framework enables gradient-based optimization for mechanistic discovery from experimental and simulation data, achieving approximately one to two orders of improvement over gradient-free methods. We develop a rich repository of differentiable simulators across diverse mechanisms, and apply Differentiable Electrochemistry to bottleneck problems in kinetic analysis. Specifically, Differentiable Electrochemistry advances beyond Tafel and Nicholson method by removing several limitations including Tafel region selection, and identifies the electron transfer mechanism in Li metal electrodeposition/stripping by parameterizing the full Marcus-Hush-Chidsey formalism. In addition, Differentiable Electrochemistry interprets Operando X-ray measurements in concentrated electrolyte by coupling concentration and velocity theories. This framework resolves ambiguity when multiple electrochemical theories intertwine, and establishes a physics-consistent and data-efficient foundation for predictive electrochemical modeling.</description>

      <title>Socrates-Mol: Self-Oriented Cognitive Reasoning through Autonomous Trial-and-Error with Empirical-Bayesian Screening for Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular property prediction is fundamental to chemical engineering applications such as solvent screening. We present Socrates-Mol, a framework that transforms language models into empirical Bayesian reasoners through context engineering, addressing cold start problems without model fine-tuning. The system implements a reflective-prediction cycle where initial outputs serve as priors, retrieved molecular cases provide evidence, and refined predictions form posteriors, extracting reusable chemical rules from sparse data. We introduce ranking tasks aligned with industrial screening priorities and employ cross-model self-consistency across five language models to reduce variance. Experiments on amine solvent LogP prediction reveal task-dependent patterns: regression achieves 72% MAE reduction and 112% R-squared improvement through self-consistency, while ranking tasks show limited gains due to systematic multi-model biases. The framework reduces deployment costs by over 70% compared to full fine-tuning, providing a scalable solution for molecular property prediction while elucidating the task-adaptive nature of self-consistency mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Martini Mapper: An Automated Fragment-Based Framework for Developing Coarse-Grained Models within the Martini 3 Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coarse-graining (CG) reduces molecular details to extend the time and length scales of molecular dynamics simulations to microseconds and micrometers. However, the CG approaches have long been limited by the difficulty of constructing both accurate and transferable models efficiently, considering the large diversity of chemical structures of materials. Among CG force fields, Martini is the most widely used, as it retains essential chemical features while offering substantial computational efficiency. Its most recent version, Martini 3, expands chemical resolution through a much broader bead set, particularly for small molecules. Still, this flexibility also complicates the mapping of organic molecules because of context-dependent rules and the lack of standardized procedures. To address this issue, we present an automated framework that builds Martini 3 models directly from SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) strings by combining a curated bead dictionary with a hierarchical, rule-based algorithm. Our framework generated Martini 3 models for more than 5,000 molecules across four chemically diverse datasets. A curated subset of 1,081 mapped structures was benchmarked through octanol-water free-energy ($\Delta G_{OW}$) and partition-coefficient ($\log P$) calculations, yielding strong agreement with experimental values. The workflow can also map large molecules containing up to 126 heavy atoms, exceeding the capabilities of existing automated approaches. The algorithm and the complete set of more than 5,000 mapped itp/top files are available at the \href{https://github.com/eliobaby/Martini_mapping}{Martini Mapper}. Our framework, therefore, enables systematic and scalable Martini 3 structures for high-throughput simulations relevant to drug discovery and materials design.</description>

      <title>Chemistry-Enhanced Diffusion-Based Framework for Small-to-Large Molecular Conformation Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Obtaining 3D conformations of realistic polyatomic molecules at the quantum chemistry level remains challenging, and although recent machine learning advances offer promise, predicting large-molecule structures still requires substantial computational effort. Here, we introduce StoL, a diffusion model-based framework that enables rapid and knowledge-free generation of large molecular structures from small-molecule data. Remarkably, StoL assembles molecules in a LEGO-style fashion from scratch, without seeing the target molecules or any structures of comparable size during training. Given a SMILES input, it decomposes the molecule into chemically valid fragments, generates their 3D structures with a diffusion model trained on small molecules, and assembles them into diverse conformations. This fragment-based strategy eliminates the need for large-molecule training data while maintaining high scalability and transferability. By embedding chemical principles into key steps, StoL ensures faster convergence, chemically rational structures, and broad configurational coverage, as confirmed against DFT calculations.</description>

      <title>Slater-Condon Rules and Spin-Orbit Couplings: 2-(2-(2,5-Dimethoxybenzylidene)hydrazineyl)-4-(trifluoromethyl)thiazole as a test case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light-atom chromophores can display properties often associated with heavy-atom compounds, such as intersystem crossing leading to phosphorescence and singlet oxygen generation, yet their use remains comparatively underexplored. Here, we report the synthesis of HM610, a derivative of the benzylidenehydrazinylthiazole light-atom chromophore backbone. Spin-orbit couplings (SOCs), computed with the sf-X2C-S-TDDFT method, follow Slater-Condon rules and predict moderate values. Trajectory surface hopping simulations further illustrate the role of dynamical effects in promoting ISC, yet these results together establish that HM610 has only limited potential as a triplet sensitizer without further structural modification, such as heavy atom substitution. Based on the benchmarked (TD)DFT protocol, a computational set studying six systematic analogues allowed us to study the influence of electron-donating (-OMe) and electron-withdrawing (-CF3) substituents on the common backbone, revealing the impact of substitution on the geometry and photophysics of light-atom analogues of HM610 and paving the way for future studies where the introduction of heavy atoms and their impact on triplet sensitization by this family of chromophores can be probed.</description>

      <title>Breaking the Air-Water Paradigm: Ion Behavior at Hydrophobic Solid-Water Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrophobic solid-water interfaces underpin processes in nanofluidics, electrochemistry, and energy technologies. Microscopic insights into these systems are often inferred from our understanding of the air-water interface, which is assumed to exhibit similar behavior. Here, we challenge this paradigm by combining heterodyne-detected vibrational sum-frequency generation spectroscopy with machine-learning molecular dynamics simulations at first-principles accuracy to investigate the graphene-NaCl(aq) interface as a prototypical hydrophobic solid-water system. Spectroscopic results suggest that ions have a minimal effect on the structure of the interfacial water, while simulations reveal that Na$^{+}$ and Cl$^{-}$ accumulate densely at the surface. Together, these findings reveal a new adsorption mechanism that departs from the established air-water interface paradigm, where interfacial ion adsorption is typically associated with, and often detected through, pronounced alteration of the interfacial water alignment and orientation. This difference arises because ions cannot penetrate the solid boundary and reside at a similar depth as the interfacial water molecules. As a consequence, large ion populations can be accommodated within the extended two-dimensional hydrogen-bond network at the interface, causing only minor local distortions but significant changes to its longer-range connectivity. These results reveal a distinct mechanism of electrolyte organization at aqueous-carbon interfaces, relevant to energy applications, where performance is highly sensitive to the local organization of interfacial water.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Physics-Driven Neural Network Force Field for Liquid Electrolytes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrolyte design plays an important role in the development of lithium-ion batteries and sodium-ion batteries. Battery electrolytes feature a large design space composed of different solvents, additives, and salts, which is difficult to explore experimentally. High-fidelity molecular simulation can accurately predict the bulk properties of electrolytes by employing accurate potential energy surfaces, thus guiding the molecule and formula engineering. At present, the overly simplified classic force fields rely heavily on experimental data for fine-tuning, thus its predictive power on microscopic level is under question. In contrast, the newly emerged machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP) can accurately reproduce the ab initio data, demonstrating excellent fitting ability. However, it is still haunted by problems such as low transferrability, insufficient stability in the prediction of bulk properties, and poor training cost scaling. Therefore, it cannot yet be used as a robust and universal tool for the exploration of electrolyte design space. In this work, we introduce a highly scalable and fully bottom-up force field construction strategy called PhyNEO-Electrolyte. It adopts a hybrid physics-driven and data-driven method that relies only on monomer and dimer EDA (energy deomposition analysis) data. With a careful separation of long/short-range and non-bonding/bonding interactions, we rigorously restore the long-range asymptotic behavior, which is critical in the description of electrolyte systems. Through this approach, we significantly improve the data efficiency of MLIP training, allowing us to achieve much larger chemical space coverage using much less data while retaining reliable quantitative prediction power in bulk phase calculations. PhyNEO-electrolyte thus serves as an important tool for future electrolyte optimization.</description>

      <title>Projection-based DMRG-in-DFT embedding corrected by non-additive exchange-correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The projection-based wave function (WF)-in-DFT embedding enables an efficient description of both the energetics and properties of large and complex chemical systems, with accuracy exceeding that of pure DFT. Recently, we have proposed using the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) as the WF method for molecules containing strongly correlated fragments [Beran, P. et al. J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 2023, 14, 3, 716-722]. In this work, we demonstrate that the accuracy of the DMRG-in-DFT approach is primarily limited by the approximate treatment of the coupling between the active component and its environment through nonadditive exchange-correlation functionals. To address this issue, we combine exact exchange to reduce the nonadditive exchange error with a multireference adiabatic connection (AC) scheme to recover nonadditive correlation. The performance of the improved DMRG-in-DFT embedding is illustrated on two prototypical strongly correlated systems: the dissociation of the H20 chain and the cleavage of a triple CN bond in propionitrile.</description>

      <title>An Automated Framework for Analyzing Structural Evolution in On-the-fly Non-adiabatic Molecular Dynamics Using Autoencoder and Multiple Molecular Descriptors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A major challenge in nonadiabatic molecular dynamics is to automatically and objectively identify the key reaction coordinates that drive molecules toward distinct excited-state decay channels. Traditional manual analyses are inefficient and rely heavily on expert intuition, creating a bottleneck for interpreting complex photochemical processes. To overcome this, we introduce a fully automated machine-learning framework that directly extracts these coordinates from on-the-fly trajectory surface hopping data. By combining an Autoencoder for nonlinear dimensionality reduction with clustering and information entropy analysis, our method autonomously maps reaction channels and pinpoints their governing structural motions. When applied to keto isocytosine and the methaniminium cation, the framework objectively revealed invovled reaction channels and corresponding active coordinates with high efficiency and accuracy. This work establishes an effective paradigm for mechanistic insight in excited-state dynamics, transforming raw trajectory data into clear, interpretable reaction mechanisms.</description>

      <title>The (110) surface is the key to the high ice nucleation efficiency of potassium feldspar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mineral dust aerosols strongly influence Earth's climate by acting as ice-nucleating particles (INPs). Feldspar minerals, particularly K-feldspar, are recognized as dominant INPs, and a previous study attributed this behavior to (100) surfaces exposed at defects. Using machine-learning molecular dynamics simulations, we systematically investigate ice nucleation on all K-feldspar surfaces. We identify the (110) surface, exposed at defects such as steps, as the most active plane for ice formation. This surface uniquely structures interfacial water into an arrangement resembling that on the (110) surface of cubic ice, providing an optimal template for nucleation. Using advanced sampling, we directly observe the formation of clusters with cubic-ice structure and their orientation agrees with experiment. These results provide a microscopic explanation of how ice forms in our planet's atmosphere.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast electron diffractive imaging of the dissociation of pre-excited molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gas phase ultrafast electron diffraction (GUED) has become a powerful technique to directly observe the structural dynamics of photoexcited molecules. GUED reveals information about the nuclear motions that is complementary to the information on the electronic states provided by spectroscopic measurements. GUED experiments so far have utilized a single laser pulse to excite the molecules and an electron pulse to probe the dynamics. This limits the excited states which can be studied to only those that can be reached by absorption of a photon from the ground state or in some cases simultaneous absorption of multiple photons. A broader class of experiments and dynamics can be accessed using two time-delayed laser pulses to access unexplored regions of the potential energy surfaces. As a proof-of-principle experiment using a double excitation, we studied the photodissociation of trifluoroiodomethane molecules that are pre-excited with an infrared (800 nm) femtosecond laser pulse before photo-dissociation is triggered with an ultraviolet (266 nm) femtosecond laser pulse. We have observed significant differences in the dissociation dynamics, with pre-excitation resulting in a slower dissociation process. This new capability can offer new insights on the evolution of nuclear wavepackets in regions of the excited potential energy surface which are inaccessible in single photon excitation. We present a methodology to carry out the measurement, analyze and interpret the data that could be applied to a broad class of experiments.</description>

      <title>Formation of HNC and HCN isomers in molecular plasmas revealed by frequency comb and quantum cascade laser spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrogen cyanide (HCN) is a well-known product in combustion, astrophysical, and plasma environments, but its isomer, hydrogen isocyanide (HNC), remains unexplored in molecular plasmas. Here, we report on the detection and quantification of both HNC and HCN isomers in low-temperature plasmas generated from N$_2$/H$_2$/CH$_4$ mixtures using quantum cascade laser and frequency comb absorption spectroscopy. The identification of HNC is confirmed by comparison with molecular spectroscopic databases. The observed [HNC]/[HCN] abundance ratio of $\sim 10^{-4}$ is far lower than reported values in interstellar media, where ratios can reach unity. We attribute this stark difference to fundamentally different kinetics, dominated by an interplay between formation of vibrationally 'hot' intermediates (HCN* and HNC*) and their subsequent stabilization and destruction. This mechanism contrasts with cold interstellar environments, where dissociative recombination reactions dominate and the formed HNC persists and accumulates over astrochemical timescales. Our results highlight the overlooked role of HNC in plasma chemistry containing carbon, nitrogen and hydrogen, with implications for plasma-assisted HCN synthesis and nitrogen-carbon plasma processes in surface modification and material treatments.</description>

      <title>Electron Correlation by Exchange Mapping in Electronic Structure Calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A method for increasing the accuracy of configuration interaction (CI) calculations of molecules and other electronic systems is proposed. The energy defect of a given calculation is associated with the electron pair origin of configurations not yet generated and this defect is mapped onto the exchange interaction for the corresponding pair of spatial molecular orbitals. The orbitals can be of opposite spin and thus the contribution includes the self-energy and differs from fermion exchange due to antisymmetry. A single parameter multiplying the exchange integral, is determined from the exact thermodynamic energy of a few reference molecules. The value of the parameter depends on the basis and level of configuration interaction but is the same for all molecules. Calculated energies are compared with experimental thermodynamic data for a set of forty mainly organic molecules representing a wide range of bonding environments. Results are reported for two types of multi- reference CI calculations: 1) a triple-zeta basis plus d-type functions for C, N, O and F and an s, p basis for H, and 2) a severely truncated virtual space in which higher spherical harmonic basis functions are removed. The error of the initial CI calculations is large, however, including the exchange-based contribution brings calculated CI energies into much closer agreement with exact values.</description>

      <title>Open-shell frozen natural orbital approach for quantum eigensolvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an open-shell frozen natural orbital (FNO) approach, which utilizes the second-order Z-averaged perturbation theory (ZAPT2), to reduce the restricted opten-shell Hartree-Fock virtual space size with controllable accuracy. Our ZAPT2 frozen natural orbital (ZAPT-FNO) selection scheme significantly outperforms the canonical molecular orbital virtual space truncation scheme based on Hartree-Fock orbital energies, especially when using large multiple-polarized and augmented basis sets. We demonstrate that the ZAPT-FNO-selected virtual orbitals lead to a systematic convergence of the correlation energies, but more importantly to the singlet-triplet T$_1$-S$_ 0$ energy gaps with respect to the complete active space (CAS) [occupied + virtual] size. We confirm our findings by simulating T$_1$-S$_ 0$ gaps in H$_2$O$_2$ and O$_2$ molecules using the traditional complete active space configuration interaction (CASCI) approach, as well as in stretched CH$_2$, for which we also employed the iterative qubit coupled cluster (iQCC) method as a quantum eigensolver. Finally, we applied the iQCC method with ZAPT-FNO-selected active space to the phosphorescent Ir(ppy)$_3$ complex with 260 electrons, where extended basis sets are required to achieve chemical (ca. 1 m$E_h$) accuracy. In this case, CASCI results are not available; however, the iQCC-computed T$_1$-S$_ 0$ gaps show robust convergence with enlarging basis set and CAS size, approaching the experimental value. Thus, the ZAPT-FNO method is very promising for improving the accuracy of quantum chemical modelling in a resource-efficient manner, and opens the door to simulating open-shell states of large materials within realistic active space sizes and without compromising on basis-set quality.</description>

      <title>Error-Mitigation Enabled Multicomponent Quantum Simulations Beyond the Born-Oppenheimer Approximation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.11941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a multicomponent unitary coupled cluster framework for quantum simulations of molecular systems that incorporate both electronic and nuclear quantum effects beyond the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. Using the nuclear-electronic orbital formalism, we construct mcUCC ans\"atze for positronium hydride and molecular hydrogen with a quantum proton, and analyze hardware requirements for different excitation truncations. To further reduce resource costs effectively, we employ the local unitary cluster Jastrow ansatz and implement it experimentally on IBM Q's Heron superconducting hardware. With the Physics-Inspired Extrapolation error mitigation protocol, the computed ground-state energies remain within chemical accuracy, consistent with the stated uncertainty level. These results provide the first demonstration of error-mitigated multicomponent correlated simulations on quantum hardware and outline a path toward scalable algorithms unifying electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Hyperfine-Resolved Spectroscopy of Dysprosium Monoxide (DyO) for Precision Measurements of the Nuclear Schiff Moment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform laser spectroscopy of dysprosium monoxide (DyO) to determine the hyperfine structure of the ground X8 and excited [17.1]7 states in the $^{161}$Dy and $^{163}$Dy isotopologues. These dysprosium nuclei have non-zero nuclear spin and dynamical octupole deformation, which gives them high sensitivity to time-reversal-violating new physics via the nuclear Schiff moment (NSM). The DyO molecule was recently identified as being amenable to optical cycling -- the basis for many laser cooling and quantum control techniques -- which makes it a practical candidate for NSM searches. The measurements reported here are prerequisites to implementing optical cycling, designing precision measurement protocols, and benchmarking calculations of molecular sensitivity to symmetry-violating effects. The measured hyperfine parameters are interpreted using simple molecular orbital diagrams and show excellent agreement with relativistic quantum chemical calculations.</description>

      <title>A Global Spacetime Optimization Approach to the Real-Space Time-Dependent Schr\"odinger Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation (TDSE) in real space is fundamental to understanding the dynamics of many-electron quantum systems, with applications ranging from quantum chemistry to condensed matter physics and materials science. However, solving the TDSE for complex fermionic systems remains a significant challenge, particularly due to the need to capture the time-evolving many-body correlations, while the antisymmetric nature of fermionic wavefunctions complicates the function space in which these solutions must be represented. We propose a general-purpose neural network framework for solving the real-space TDSE, Fermionic Antisymmetric Spatio-Temporal Network, which treats time as an explicit input alongside spatial coordinates, enabling a unified spatiotemporal representation of complex, antisymmetric wavefunctions for fermionic systems. This approach formulates the TDSE as a global optimization problem, avoiding step-by-step propagation and supporting highly parallelizable training. The method is demonstrated on four benchmark problems: a 1D harmonic oscillator, interacting fermions in a time-dependent harmonic trap, 3D hydrogen orbital dynamics, and a laser-driven H$_2$ molecule, achieving excellent agreement with reference solutions across all cases. These results confirm our method's scalability, accuracy, and flexibility across various dimensions and interaction regimes, while demonstrating its ability to accurately simulate long-time dynamics in complex systems. Our framework offers a highly expressive alternative to traditional basis-dependent or mean-field methods, opening new possibilities for ab initio simulations of time-dependent quantum systems, with applications in quantum dynamics, molecular control, and ultrafast spectroscopy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conservation of symmetries plays a crucial role in both classical and quantum simulations of many-body systems, enabling the tracking of states with specific symmetry properties and leading to substantial reductions in the number of optimization parameters. The design of efficient quantum circuits that enforce all symmetries typically encountered in chemistry has remained elusive, mainly due to the interplay of point group and spin symmetries. By exploiting Lie algebraic techniques, we derive exact product formulas representing symmetry-adapted unitaries. These decompositions allow us to design the most efficient symmetry-preserving quantum circuits to date. Finally, we introduce a minimum universal symmetry-adapted operator pool to further reduce the required quantum resources.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Hydrovoltaic Power Generation through Coupled Heat and Light-Driven Surface Charge Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08953v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Harnessing natural evaporation offers a sustainable and untapped pathway for next-generation energy technologies. Here, we present a unified physical and experimental framework for evaporation-driven hydrovoltaic (EDHV) systems that decouples and systematically controls the key interfacial processes underlying electricity generation from ambient heat and sunlight. By introducing an intermediate ion-conducting layer, we spatially and functionally separate the evaporative top interface from the silicon-dielectric nanopillar array at the bottom, enabling independent modulation of evaporation, ion transport, and interfacial chemical equilibrium. This decoupling strategy enhances device performance, facilitating the study of thermal and photo-induced charge generation, and improving ion migration and electricity generation. We develop a predictive equivalent electrical circuit model that captures the coupling between these processes through a transfer capacitance term, which we derive analytically as a function of geometric and material parameters. Our study reveals that capacitive photocharging and thermally modulated surface equilibria, rather than Faradaic or photothermal effects, are the dominant drivers of energy conversion when interfacial environments are adequately engineered. The device achieves a state-of-the-art open-circuit voltage of 1 V and a peak power density of 0.25 W/m2 at a 0.1 M salt concentration. Strategic variation of doping reveals that increasing silicon doping enhances voltage by 28% and power by 1.6 times, while switching the dielectric shell from TiO2 to Al2O3 boosts voltage (power) by up to 1.9 times (3.6 times). These findings offer insights for enhancing EDHV devices and suggest strategies that consider environmental conditions, water salinity, and material engineering to better harness waste heat and sunlight.</description>

      <title>Chemical and Conformational Control of the Spectroscopic Properties of Multi-Layer and Multi-Defect Carbon Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16520v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Carbon dots (CDs) are renowned for their bright and tunable photoluminescence (PL), stability, and biocompatibility, yet it remains challenging to link their heterogeneous structures to their spectroscopic properties. This study utilizes density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) to systematically investigate how the spectroscopic properties of complex CDs with multiple layers and multiple defects are determined by their structures and compositions. Calculations reveal that strongly oxidizing defects, such as carbonyl and carbonyl acetate, significantly redshift absorption and emission spectra. In contrast, less oxidizing defects, such as hydroxyl, behave as spectators with minimal impact on absorption and emission, except when they interact strongly with more oxidizing defects. We find that not only the excitation energy but also the excitation character itself is impacted by the presence of specific defects, and the pH-dependence of the spectroscopic properties can be attributed to their protonation state-dependent excitation character. We show that the twisting, sliding, and linker-mediated folding of surface-functionalized layers in CDs markedly alter excitation energies and characters, offering a molecular explanation for experimentally observed emission intermittency and polarization fluctuations. These insights provide strategies for optimizing CDs for various applications, including bioimaging, photocatalysis, and optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Pruning for Increased Robustness and Reduced Computational Overhead in Gaussian Process Accelerated Saddle Point Searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06030v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gaussian process (GP) regression provides a strategy for accelerating saddle point searches on high-dimensional energy surfaces by reducing the number of times the energy and its derivatives with respect to atomic coordinates need to be evaluated. The computational overhead in the hyperparameter optimization can, however, be large and make the approach inefficient. Failures can also occur if the search ventures too far into regions that are not represented well enough by the GP model. Here, these challenges are resolved by using geometry-aware optimal transport measures and an active pruning strategy using a summation over Wasserstein-1 distances for each atom-type in farthest-point sampling, selecting a fixed-size subset of geometrically diverse configurations to avoid rapidly increasing cost of GP updates as more observations are made. Stability is enhanced by permutation-invariant metric that provides a reliable trust radius for early-stopping and a logarithmic barrier penalty for the growth of the signal variance. These physically motivated algorithmic changes prove their efficacy by reducing to less than a half the mean computational time on a set of 238 challenging configurations from a previously published data set of chemical reactions. With these improvements, the GP approach is established as, a robust and scalable algorithm for accelerating saddle point searches when the evaluation of the energy and atomic forces requires significant computational effort.</description>

      <title>ELECTRA: A Cartesian Network for 3D Charge Density Prediction with Floating Orbitals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08305v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the Electronic Tensor Reconstruction Algorithm (ELECTRA) - an equivariant model for predicting electronic charge densities using floating orbitals. Floating orbitals are a long-standing concept in the quantum chemistry community that promises more compact and accurate representations by placing orbitals freely in space, as opposed to centering all orbitals at the position of atoms. Finding the ideal placement of these orbitals requires extensive domain knowledge, though, which thus far has prevented widespread adoption. We solve this in a data-driven manner by training a Cartesian tensor network to predict the orbital positions along with orbital coefficients. This is made possible through a symmetry-breaking mechanism that is used to learn position displacements with lower symmetry than the input molecule while preserving the rotation equivariance of the charge density itself. Inspired by recent successes of Gaussian Splatting in representing densities in space, we are using Gaussian orbitals and predicting their weights and covariance matrices. Our method achieves a state-of-the-art balance between computational efficiency and predictive accuracy on established benchmarks. Furthermore, ELECTRA is able to lower the compute time required to arrive at converged DFT solutions - initializing calculations using our predicted densities yields an average 50.72 % reduction in self-consistent field (SCF) iterations on unseen molecules.</description>

      <title>Thermally Activated Snap-through Transitions Controlled by Tunable Metastability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14658v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The effects of thermal fluctuations on the morphology of two-dimensional materials are hard to harness. We propose that a geometrically constrained graphene nanoribbon (GNR) can exhibit thermally activated snap-through transitions with a predictable and controllable transition rate constant. The energetics and kinetics of such transitions can be fully captured by combining enhanced sampling methods and generalized transition state theory. Using well-tempered metadynamics, we determine the free energy landscape and a pair of asymmetric transition pathways of the GNR system. Notably, generalized transition state theory accurately captures how the transition rate constant responds to temperature and the tunable free energy landscape of our system. This work offers a theoretical framework for elastic metastability, introduces rare event methods into thermalized nanomechanical systems, and provides potential applications in designing nanoscale thermal switches and thermal actuators.</description>

      <title>Optimal parallelisation strategies for flat histogram Monte Carlo sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11562v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Flat histogram methods, such as Wang-Landau sampling, provide a means for high-throughput calculation of phase diagrams of atomistic/lattice model systems. Many parallelisation schemes with varying degrees of complexity have been proposed to accelerate such sampling simulations. In this study, several widely used schemes are benchmarked - both in isolation and in combination - to establish best practice. The schemes studied include energy domain decomposition with both static sizing of energy sub-domains, as well as a dynamic sub-domain sizing scheme which we propose. We also assess the benefits both of replica exchange and of including multiple random walkers per sub-domain, to determine which factors have the largest impact on parallel efficiency. Additionally, the influence of energy sub-domain overlap regions is discussed. As an illustrative test case, we implement and apply the aforementioned strategies to a lattice-based model describing the internal energies of the AlTiCrMo refractory high-entropy superalloy, which is understood to crystallographically order into a B2 (CsCl) structure with decreasing temperature. We find that - while all of the proposed strategies confer a non-negligible speedup - parallelisation across energy domains which are non-uniform in size offers the most appreciable performance improvements. This work offers concrete recommendations for which parallelisation strategies should be prioritised to optimally accelerate flat-histogram Monte Carlo simulations.</description>
