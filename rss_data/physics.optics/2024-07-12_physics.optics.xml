      <title>Generalized flux trajectories: New insights into partially coherent Airy beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The propagation of Airy beams in free space is characterized by being non dispersive, which warrants the shape invariance of their intensity distribution, and self-accelerating along the transverse direction. These distinctive traits are still present in partially coherent Airy beams as long as the reach of their back tail (and hence their energy content) is not importantly reduced. To investigate the effects associated with the decrease of the beam coherence and its power content (by smoothly reducing the reach of their back tails), here we introduce a novel and insightful methodology based on a generalization of the concept of flux trajectory for paraxial partially coherent beams. This methodologies emphasizes the role of phase relations, thus helping to clarify why and how the beam smears out spatially along its propagation. This formalism, though, is general enough to tackle other types of structured light beams with whatever degree of partial coherence, from full coherence to total incoherence.</description>

      <title>Chiral bulk solitons in photonic graphene with decorated boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a chiral bulk soliton in a nonlinear photonic lattice with decorated boundaries, presenting a novel approach to manipulate photonic transport without extensive bulk modifications. Unlike traditional methods that rely on topological edge and corner modes, our strategy leverages the robust chiral propagation of bulk modes. By introducing nonlinearity into the system, we find a stable bulk soliton, akin to the topological valley Hall effects. The chiral bulk soliton exhibits remarkable stability; the energy does not decay even after a long-distance propagation; and the corresponding Fourier spectrum confirms the absence of inter-valley scattering indicating a valley-locking property. Our findings not only contribute to the fundamental understanding of nonlinear photonic systems but also hold significant practical implications for the design and optimization of photonic devices.</description>

      <title>An avalanche model for femtosecond optical response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Experiments on Indium Tin Oxide (ITO) have revealed that a relatively broad 200THz pump pulse, roughly 30 cycles in width, can switch ITO from a transparent to a reflecting state within one or two optical cycles, a few Femtoseconds. So far the rapid switching has remained unexplained by theory. Here a very simple bare bones theory explains the key experimental features in terms of an avalanche model suggested by avalanche diodes.</description>

      <title>Magic silicon dioxide for widely tunable integrated photonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated photonic circuits have transformed data communication, biosensing, and light detection and ranging, and hold wide-ranging potential for optical computing, optical imaging and signal processing. These applications often require tunable and reconfigurable photonic components, most commonly accomplished through the thermo-optic effect. However, the resulting tuning window is limited for standard optical materials such as silicon dioxide and silicon nitride. Most importantly, bidirectional thermal tuning on a single platform has not been realized. For the first time, we show that by tuning and optimizing the deposition conditions in inductively-coupled plasma chemical vapor deposition (ICPCVD) of silicon dioxide, this material can be used to deterministically tune the thermo-optic properties of optical devices without introducing significant losses. We demonstrate that we can deterministically integrate positive and negative wavelength shifts on a single chip, validated on amorphous silicon carbide (a-SiC), silicon nitride (SiN) and silicon-on-insulator (SOI) platforms. We observe up to a 10-fold improvement of the thermo-optic tunability and, in addition, demonstrate athermal ring resonators with shifts as low as 1.5 pm/{\deg}C. This enables the fabrication of a novel tunable coupled ring optical waveguide (CROW) requiring only a single heater. In addition, the low-temperature deposition of our silicon dioxide cladding can be combined with lift-off to isolate the optical devices resulting in a decrease in thermal crosstalk by at least two orders of magnitude. Our method paves the way for novel photonic architectures incorporating bidirectional thermo-optic tunability.</description>

      <title>Inverse-designed 3D laser nanoprinted phase masks to extend the depth of field of by systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In optical imaging, achieving high resolution often comes at the expense of a shallow depth of field. This means that when using a standard microscope, any minor movement of the object along the optical axis can cause the image to become blurry. To address this issue, we exploit inverse design techniques to optimise a phase mask which, when inserted into a standard microscope, extends the depth of field by a factor of approximately four without compromising the microscope's resolution. Differentiable Fourier optics simulations allow us to rapidly iterate towards an optimised design in a hybrid fashion, starting with gradient-free Bayesian optimisation and proceeding to a local gradient-based optimisation. To fabricate the device, a commercial two-photon 3D laser nanoprinter is used, in combination with a two-step pre-compensation routine, providing high fabrication speed and much better than subwavelength accuracy. We find excellent agreement between our numerical predictions and the measurements upon integrating the phase mask into a microscope and optically characterising selected samples. The phase mask enables us to conduct simultaneous multiplane imaging of objects separated by distances that cannot be achieved with the original microscope.</description>

      <title>Detecting and Focusing on a Nonlinear Target in a Complex Medium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wavefront shaping techniques allow waves to be focused on a diffraction-limited target deep inside disordered media. To identify the target position, a guidestar is required that typically emits a frequency-shifted signal. Here we present a noninvasive matrix approach operating at a single frequency only, based on the variation of the field scattered by a nonlinear target illuminated at two incident powers. The local perturbation induced by the nonlinearity serves as a guide for identifying optimal incident wavefronts. We demonstrate maximal focusing on electronic devices embedded in chaotic microwave cavities and extend our approach to temporal signals. Finally, we exploit the programmability offered by reconfigurable smart surfaces to enhance the intensity delivered to a nonlinear target. Our results pave the way for deep imaging protocols that use any type of nonlinearity as feedback, requiring only the measurement of a monochromatic scattering matrix.</description>

      <title>Symmetries and singular behaviors with Bohmian trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum mechanics is able to produce challenging behaviors even in the simplest situations. This is possible because of the important dynamical role that phase plays in the evolution of quantum systems, very similar, nonetheless, to effects observable in analogous optical systems. The present work focuses on how Bohmian mechanics proves to be a rather convenient theoretical framework to analyze phase-based phenomena, since the phase constitutes the central element in this hydrodynamical formulation of quantum mechanics. More specifically, it allows us to understand how spatial phase variations give rise to velocity fields that eventually rule the dynamical behavior of quantum systems, and that, when integrated in time locally (i.e., taking into account specific positions), they provide us with a neat local (point by point) description of the system evolution in the configuration space. Indeed, it will also be seen that this idea transcends the quantum realm and can be profitably used to describe the behavior of optical analogs with rather singular behaviors. With this purpose, two interesting phenomena that take place in free space are considered, namely, the self-acceleration and shape-invariance of Airy beams, and spontaneous self-focusing.</description>

      <title>Harnessing quantum light for microscopic biomechanical imaging of cells and tissues</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The biomechanical properties of cells and tissues play an important role in our fundamental understanding of the structures and functions of biological systems at both the cellular and subcellular levels. Recently, Brillouin microscopy, which offers a label-free spectroscopic means of assessing viscoelastic properties in vivo, has emerged as a powerful way to interrogate those properties on a microscopic level in living tissues. However, susceptibility to photo-damage and photo-bleaching, particularly when high-intensity laser beams are used to induce Brillouin scattering, poses a significant challenge. This article introduces a transformative approach designed to mitigate photo-damage in biological and biomedical studies, enabling non-destructive, label-free assessments of mechanical properties in live biological samples. By leveraging quantum-light-enhanced stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) imaging contrast, the signal-to-noise ratio is significantly elevated, thereby increasing sample viability and extending interrogation times without compromising the integrity of living samples. The tangible impact of this novel methodology is evidenced by a notable three-fold increase in sample viability observed after subjecting the samples to three hours of continuous squeezed-light illumination, surpassing the traditional coherent light-based approaches. The quantum-enhanced SBS imaging holds promise across diverse fields, such as cancer biology and neuroscience where preserving sample vitality is of paramount significance. By mitigating concerns regarding photo-damage and photo-bleaching associated with high-intensity lasers, this technological breakthrough expands our horizons for exploring the mechanical properties of live biological systems, paving the way for a new era of research and clinical applications.</description>

      <title>Magnon squeezing via reservoir-engineered optomagnomechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show how to prepare magnonic squeezed states in an optomagnomechanical system, in which magnetostriction induced mechanical displacement couples to an optical cavity via radiation pressure. We discuss two scenarios depending on whether the magnomechanical coupling is linear or dispersive. We show that in both cases the strong mechanical squeezing obtained via two-tone driving of the optical cavity can be efficiently transferred to the magnon mode. In the linear coupling case, stationary magnon squeezing is achieved; while in the dispersive coupling case, a transient magnonic squeezed state is prepared in a two-step protocol. The proposed magnonic squeezed states find promising applications in quantum information processing and quantum sensing using magnons.</description>

      <title>Spatially-extended nonlinear generation of short-wavelength spin waves in YIG nanowaveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We experimentally study nonlinear propagation of spin waves in microscopic yttrium iron garnet waveguides, where the dispersion spectrum is engineered to enable efficient four-magnon interactions over a wide range of wavelengths. We show that under these conditions, the initial monochromatic spin wave nonlinearly generates co-propagating spin waves with well-defined, discrete frequencies. This process is characterized by a low energy threshold and can be observed in a wide range of frequencies and excitation powers. Thanks to the engineered dispersion, the process allows the generation of waves with short wavelengths that cannot be excited directly by a linear excitation mechanism. The nonlinearly generated short-wavelength spin waves continuously acquire the energy from the initial pump wave during co-propagation, which results in compensation of their propagation losses over significant distances. The observed phenomena can be used to implement frequency- and wavelength-conversion operations in magnonic nanodevices and circuits.</description>

      <title>Mirror-induced effects in cavity polaritonics: influence on edge states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical cavities are widely used to induce strong light-matter coupling and thereby enable the presence of polaritons. While polaritons are at the source of most of the observed physics, the mirrors forming the cavity may also themselves be responsible for a number of phenomena, independently of the strong light-matter coupling regime. Here, we use a toy model of a chain of dipolar emitters coupled to a cuboidal cavity. We unveil several effects originating solely from the boundary conditions imposed by the cavity mirrors, that are dominant when the distances of the emitters to the cavity walls are of the order of the interdipole separation. In particular, we show that mirrors in the direction transverse to the chain may act as effective defects, leading to the emergence of Tamm edge states. Considering a topological chain, we demonstrate that such transverse mirrors may also protect edge states against the effects of the strong light-matter coupling. Finally, we find that mirrors parallel to the chain, by the image charges they involve, induce topological phase transitions even in the case of highly off-resonant photons.</description>

      <title>Skin Effect of Nonlinear Optical Responses in Antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear optics plays important roles in the research of fundamental physics and the applications of highperformance optoelectronic devices. The bulk nonlinear optical responses arise from the uniform light absorption in noncentrosymmetric crystals, and hence are usually considered to be the collective phenomena of all atoms. Here we show, in contrast to this common expectation, the nonlinear optical responses in antiferromagnets can be selectively accumulated near the surfaces, representing a skin effect. This is because the inversion symmetry, despite being broken globally, is barely violated locally deeply inside these antiferromagnets. Using A-type layered antiferromagnets as the representatives, we predict that the spatial-dependent nonlinear optical responses, such as bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) and second harmonic generation (SHG), are notable in the top- and bottom-most layers and decay rapidly when moving away from the surfaces. Such a phenomenon exists in a broad range of antiferromagnets composed of centrosymmetric sublattices, offering promising device applications using these antiferromagnets. Our work uncovers a previously overlooked property of nonlinear optical responses and opens new opportunities for high-performance antiferromagnetic optospintronics.</description>

      <title>Spin-valley-locked Electroluminescence for High-Performance Circularly-Polarized Organic Light-Emitting Diodes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Circularly polarized (CP) organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) have attracted attention in potential applications including novel display and photonic technologies. However, conventional approaches cannot meet the requirements of device performance, such as high dissymmetry factor, high directionality, narrowband emission, simplified device structure and low costs. Here, we demonstrate spin-valley-locked CP-OLEDs without chiral emitters, but based on photonic spin-orbit coupling, where photons with opposite CP characteristics are emitted from different optical valleys. These spin-valley locked OLEDs exhibit a narrowband emission of 16 nm, a high EQE of 3.65, a maximum luminance of near 98000 cd/m2 and a gEL of up to 1.80, which are among the best performances of active single-crystal CP-OLEDs, achieved with a simple device structure. This strategy opens an avenue for practical applications towards three-dimensional displays and on-chip CP-OLEDs.</description>

      <title>Generative Inverse Design of Metamaterials with Functional Responses by Interpretable Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00003v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Metamaterials with functional responses, such as wave-based responses or deformation-induced property variation under external stimuli, can exhibit varying properties or functionalities under different conditions. Herein, we aim at rapid inverse design of these metamaterials to meet target qualitative functional behaviors. This inverse problem is challenging due to its intractability and the existence of non-unique solutions. Past works mainly focus on deep-learning-based methods that are data-demanding, require time-consuming training and hyperparameter tuning, and are non-interpretable. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Random-forest-based Interpretable Generative Inverse Design (RIGID), an iteration-free, single-shot inverse design method to achieve the fast generation of metamaterial designs with on-demand functional behaviors. Unlike most existing methods, by exploiting the interpretability of the random forest, we eliminate the need to train an inverse model mapping responses to designs. Based on the likelihood of target satisfaction derived from the trained forward model, one can sample design solutions using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. The RIGID method therefore functions as a generative model that captures the conditional distribution of satisfying solutions given a design target. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of RIGID on both acoustic and optical metamaterial design problems where only small datasets (less than 250 training samples) are available. Synthetic design problems are created to further illustrate and validate the mechanism of likelihood estimation in RIGID. This work offers a new perspective on solving on-demand inverse design problems, showcasing the potential for incorporating interpretable machine learning into generative design and eliminating its large data requirement.</description>

      <title>Aluminium nanoparticle-based ultra-wideband high-performance polarizer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06873v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The polarizer-based device industry is expanding quickly, requiring high-quality research on nanoscale wideband polarizers. Here, we investigated the possibility of utilizing Al dimer nanostructures on broad-band polarizers. Metals are always considered promising candidates for reflection-based polarizer development because of their high extinction ratio. This study proposes a nanoparticle polarizer comprised of semi-immersed Al nanodimers with a 200 nm radius on a CaF_2 substrate. Our proposed polarizer has effective polarization anisotropy in the near-infrared (NIR) and THz range. This study includes calculating performance parameters for the extraction of the proposed polarizer, including insertion loss, extinction ratio (ER), Mueller matrix values, and polarization ellipse diagram. The finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulation-based results suggested obtaining more than 55 dB extinction ratio for the 0.2 to 9 THz range. The average extinction ratio and insertion loss over the 1-1665 micrometer wavelength were 29.01 dB and ~1 dB, respectively. We have reviewed recent reports of similar nanoparticle and wire grid-based polarizers to evaluate our Al nanodimer-based polarizer and performed a comparative analysis. The idea of Al dimer and the insight gained from the results extracted from the rigorous simulation report suggested a great opportunity for developing micro-scale metallic wideband polarizers.</description>

      <title>Tunable quasi-discrete spectrum of spin waves excited by periodic laser patterns</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17889v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a concept for selective excitation of magnetostatic surface waves with quasi-discrete spectrum using spatially patterned femtosecond laser pulses inducing either ultrafast change of magnetic anisotropy or inverse Faraday effect. We micromagnetically simulate excitation of the waves with periodically patterned uni- or bipolar laser impact. Such excitation yields multiple wavepackets propagating with different group velocities, whose dispersion corresponds to the set of quasi-discrete points. In addition, we show that the frequency of the spectral peaks can be controlled by the polarity of the periodic impact and its spatial period. Presented consideration of multiple spatially periodic magnetostatic surface wave sources as a whole enables implementation of a comprehensive toolkit of spatio-temporal optical methods for tunable excitation and control of spin wave parameters</description>

      <title>Enhanced Second-Harmonic Generation in Thin-Film Lithium Niobate Circular Bragg Nanocavity</title>

Abstract: Second-order nonlinearity gives rise to many distinctive physical phenomena, e.g., second-harmonic generation, which plays an important role in fundamental science and various applications. Lithium niobate, one of the most widely used nonlinear crystals, exhibits strong second-order nonlinear effects and electro-optic properties. However, its moderate refractive index and etching sidewall angle limit its capability in confining light into nanoscales, restricting its application in nanophotonics. Here, we exploit nanocavities formed by second-order circular Bragg gratings, which support resonant anapole modes to achieve highly enhanced SHG in thin film lithium niobate. The CBG nanocavity exhibits a record-high normalized conversion efficiency of $1.21\times10^{-2}\mathrm{cm^2/GW}$ under the pump intensity of $1.9$ $\mathrm{MW/cm^2}$. An SHG enhancement of $42,000$ is realized compared to TFLN. Besides, we also show s- and p-polarization independent SHG in elliptical Bragg nanocavities. This work could inspire studying nonlinear optics at the nanoscale on TFLN as well as other novel photonic platforms.</description>

      <title>Hyperboloidal Method for Quasinormal Modes of Non-Relativistic Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01487v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recently reported compactified hyperboloidal method has found wide use in the numerical computation of quasinormal modes, with implications for fields as diverse as gravitational physics and optics. We extend this intrinsically relativistic method into the non-relativistic domain, demonstrating its use to calculate the quasinormal modes of the Schr\"odinger equation and solve related bound-state problems. We also describe how to further generalize this method, offering a perspective on the importance of non-relativistic quasinormal modes for the programme of black hole spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>High-quality entangled photon source by symmetric beam displacement design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03806v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entangled photon sources (EPSs) are pivotal in advancing quantum communication, computing and sensing. The demand for deploying efficient, robust EPSs in the field, characterized by exceptional (phase) stability, has become increasingly apparent. This work introduces a polarization-entangled photon source, leveraging type-0 spontaneous parametric down-conversion, and constructed using commercial bulk optomechanical components. Our system is versatile, enabling the generation of N00N states for sensing applications or Bell states for quantum key distribution protocols. We attained a maximal Bell inequality violation, with the average entanglement visibility exceeding 99% . The potential for further performance enhancements is also explored.</description>

      <title>Astrophotonic Technologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03981v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over the past two decades, photonics have been developed as technological solutions for astronomical instrumentation for, e.g., near-infrared spectroscopy and long baseline interferometry. With increasing instrument capabilities, large quantities of high precision optical components are required to guide, manipulate, and analyze the light from astronomical sources. Photonic integrated circuits (PICs) and fiber-based devices offer enormous potential for astronomical instrumentation, as they can reduce the amount of bulky free-space optics and pave the way for innovative solutions. Astrophotonic devices are particularly interesting for interferometry due to their compact design on the centimeter scale, even for a large number of telescope inputs. Already, astrophotonic components are integrated in high-end instruments at the VLTI and at the CHARA Array. Photonic beam combiners at wavelengths from visible to mid-infrared have been fabricated using lithographic techniques or ultrafast-laser inscription, with several components tested on-sky. This paper will provide a glimpse into the growing field of astrophotonics, its current status and potential for new technologies.</description>
