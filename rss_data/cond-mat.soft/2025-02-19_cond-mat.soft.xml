      <title>Nonmonotonic concentration dependence of the self-diffusion coefficient of surfactants in wormlike micellar solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the concentration dependence of surfactant diffusion in wormlike micellar solutions using dissipative particle dynamics simulations. The simulations show that the self-diffusion coefficient of surfactants exhibits a nonmonotonic dependence on the surfactant concentration, as observed in previous experiments. We quantitatively reveal that this nonmonotonic behavior results from the competition between micellar center-of-mass diffusion and surfactant diffusion within micelles by decomposing the mean-square displacement of surfactants into the corresponding contributions. Furthermore, our detailed analyses demonstrate how the competition between the two diffusion mechanisms is governed by the aggregation number distribution, the dynamics of individual surfactants and micelles, and the kinetics of micellar scission and recombination.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Origin of Viscosity in 2D Simple Liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shear viscosity plays a fundamental role in liquid dynamics from heavy-ion collisions to biological processes. Still, its physical origin at the individual particle kinetic level remains strongly debated. In this work, we systematically investigate the shear viscosity ($\eta$) of two-dimensional (2D) simple liquids using computer simulations of Lennard-Jones, Yukawa, and one-component plasma systems. By combining Frenkel's liquid description, consisting of solid-like quasi-harmonic vibrations interrupted by thermally activated hops, with the concept of lifetime of local atomic connectivity $\tau_{LC}$, we find a surprisingly simple formula for the kinematic viscosity that is solely determined by $\tau_{LC}$ and the average kinetic particle speed $\bar{v}_p$. The derived analytical expression provides a direct link between macroscopic and microscopic dynamics, which shows excellent agreement with the simulation data in all the 2D liquids considered. Moreover, it is discovered that, $\tau_{LC}$ in 2D liquids is universally determined by the effective potential difference between the first peak and valley of the pair correlation function, implying a direct connection between macroscopic shear transport and microscopic structure. Finally, we demonstrate that the characteristic length scale $l_p= \bar{v}_p \tau_{LC}$, which governs the macroscopic shear viscosity, aligns with the elastic length-scale that defines the propagation limit of collective shear waves in liquids. These findings establish that shear viscosity in 2D liquids arises from the diffusive transport of average particle momentum across the elastic length scale. Moreover, they highlight that shear dynamics are fundamentally governed by localized configurational excitations within the atomic connectivity network.</description>

      <title>Instability of a fluctuating biomimetic membrane driven by an applied uniform DC electric field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The linear stability of a lipid membrane under a DC electric field, applied perpendicularly to the interface, is investigated in the electrokinetic framework, taking account to the dynamics of the Debye layers formed near the membrane. The perturbed charge in the Debye layer redistributes and destabilizes the membrane via electrical surface stress interior and exterior to the membrane. The instability is suppressed as the difference in the electrolyte concentration of the solutions separated by the membrane increases, due to a weakened base state electric field near the membrane. This result contrasts with the destabilizing effect predicted using the leaky dielectric model in cases of asymmetric conductivity. We attribute this difference to the varying assumptions about the perturbation amplitude relative to the Debye length, which result in different regimes of validity for the linear stability analysis within these two frameworks.</description>

      <title>Bacterial swimming and accumulation on endothelial cell surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flagellar-driven locomotion plays a critical role in bacterial attachment and colonization of surfaces, contributing to the risks of contamination and infection. Tremendous attempts to uncover the underlying principles governing bacterial motility near surfaces have relied on idealized assumptions of surrounding inorganic boundaries. However, in the context of living systems, the role of cells from tissues and organs becomes increasingly critical, particularly in bacterial swimming and adhesion, yet it remains poorly understood. Here, we propose using biological surfaces composed of vascular endothelial cells to experimentally investigate bacterial motion and interaction behaviors. Our results reveal that bacterial trapping observed on inorganic surfaces is counteractively manifested with reduced radii of circular motion on cellular surfaces, while with two distinct modes of bacterial adhesion: tight adhesion and loose adhesion. Interestingly, the presence of living cells enhances bacterial surface enrichment, and imposed flow intensifies this accumulation via bias-swimming effect. These results surprisingly indicate that physical effects remain the dominant factor regulating bacterial motility and accumulation at the single-cell layer level in vitro, bridging the gap between simplified hydrodynamic mechanisms and complex biological surfaces, with relevance to biofilm formation and bacterial contamination.</description>

      <title>No time for surface charge: how bulk conductivity hides charge patterns from KPFM in contact-electrified surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) is a powerful tool for studying contact electrification, using an tiny tip to image voltages caused by transferred charge. It has been used in stationary studies focused on finding patterns (e.g. heterogeneity) in transferred charge, but also in dynamic studies aimed at understanding how charge escapes. Here, we show that the charge dynamics in all but the very best insulators are too fast for patterns found in stationary studies to be meaningful. Using a custom-built system, we are able to quickly (~30 s) transfer samples from our contact-charging apparatus to the atomic force microscopy (AFM). For materials at the lower end of `good insulators', we see potential decay that is shorter than the timescale of a typical KPFM scan (~10 minutes). We develop a minimal model to explain this decay based on bulk conductivity, and show that the measured timescale increases with the prediction from this model. To rule out surface conductivity, we perform additional experiments with the macroscopic method of scanning Kelvin probe microscopy. Our results highlight an important but widely overlooked consideration for dynamic vs. stationary studies in contact-electrified surfaces, and suggest that some patterns observed in the latter, e.g. charge heterogeneity, are not as widespread as previously thought.</description>

      <title>Form and function in biological filaments: A physicist's review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nature uses elongated shapes and filaments to build stable structures, generate motion, and allow complex geometric interactions. In this Review, we examine the role of biological filaments across different length scales. From the molecular scale, where cytoskeletal filaments provides a robust but dynamic cellular scaffolding, over the scale of cellular appendages like cilia and flagella, to the scale of filamentous microorganisms like cyanobacteria which are among the most successful genera on Earth, and even to the scale of elongated animals like worms and snakes, whose motility modes inspire robotic analogues. We highlight the general mechanisms that couple form and function. Physical principles, such as classical elasticity and the non-reciprocity of active matter can be used to trace unifying themes linking these systems spanning about six orders of magnitude in length.</description>

      <title>Fabrication and characterization of bimetallic silica-based and 3D-printed active colloidal cubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulations on self-propelling active cubes reveal interesting behaviors at both the individual and the collective level, emphasizing the importance of developing experimental analogs that allow to test these theoretical predictions. The majority of experimental realizations of active colloidal cubes rely on light actuation and or magnetic fields to have a persistent active mechanism, and lack material versatility. Here we propose a system of active bimetallic cubes whose propulsion mechanism is based on a catalytic reaction and study their behavior. We realize such a system from synthetic silica cuboids and 3D printed micro cubes, followed by the deposition of gold and platinum layers on their surface. We characterize the colloids dynamics for different thicknesses of the gold layer at low and high hydrogen peroxide concentrations. We show that the thickness of the base gold layer has only a minor effect on the self propulsion speed and in addition induces a gravitational torque which leads to particles with a velocity director pointing out of the plane thus effectively suppressing propulsion. We find that a higher active force can remedy the effects of torque, resulting in particle orientations that are favorable for in plane propulsion. Finally, we use 3D printing to compare our results to cubes made from a different material, size and roundness, and demonstrate that the speed scaling with increasing particle size originates from the size-dependent drag. Our experiments extend fabrication of active cubes to different materials and propulsion mechanisms and highlight that the design of active particles with anisotropic shapes requires consideration of the interplay between the shape and activity to achieve favorable sedimentation and efficient in plane propulsion.</description>

      <title>Fluorescent molecular rotor-based polymer materials for local microviscosity mapping in microfluidic channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A viscosity-sensitive monomer consisting of a methacrylate-functionalized julolidone-based molecular rotor (MECVJ) was synthesized and used to obtain viscosity-sensitive polymers (poly(DMA-\textit{s}-MECVJ)). The qualitative properties of the molecular rotor were preserved after its inclusion in the new polymer, in particular the effect of the viscosity of the surrounding medium on the fluorescence lifetime of the rotor. By grafting these polymers onto glass slides, viscosity-sensitive surfaces were obtained, showing good robustness in time after successive use and washing. As proof of concept, these surfaces were used to assemble a microfluidic chip capable of mapping viscosity of fluids flowing inside the channel.</description>

      <title>Generalized Polarization and time-resolved fluorescence provide evidence for different populations of Laurdan in lipid vesicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The solvatochromic dye Laurdan is widely used in sensing the lipid packing of both model and biological membranes. The fluorescence emission maximum shifts from about 440 nm (blue channel) in condensed membranes (So) to about 490 nm (green channel) in the liquid-crystalline phase (L{\alpha}). Although the fluorescence intensity based generalized polarization (GP) is widely used to characterize lipid membranes, the fluorescence lifetime of Laurdan, in the blue and the green channel, is less used for that purpose. Here we explore the correlation between GP and fluorescence lifetimes by spectroscopic measurements on the So and L{\alpha} phases of large unilamellar vesicles of DMPC and DPPC. A positive correlation between GP and the lifetimes is observed in each of the optical channels for the two lipid phases. Fluorescence intensities, GP and fluorescence lifetimes depend on the angle between the orientation of the linear polarization of the excitation light and the local normal to the membrane of the optical cross-section. This angular variation depends on the lipid phase and the emission channel. GP and fluorescence intensities in the blue and green channel in So and in the blue channel in L{\alpha} exhibit a minimum near 90o. Surprisingly, the intensity in the green channel in L{\alpha} reaches a maximum near 90o. The fluorescence lifetimes in the two optical channels also reach a pronounced minimum near 90o in So and L{\alpha}, apart from the lifetime in the blue channel in L{\alpha} where the lifetime is short with minimal angular variation. To our knowledge, these experimental observations are the first to demonstrate the existence of a bent conformation of Laurdan in lipid membranes, as previously suggested by molecular dynamics calculations.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic stability and pattern formation in hexatic epithelial layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the hydrodynamic stability and the formation of patterns in a continuum model of epithelial layers, able to account for the interplay between mechanical activity, lateral adhesion and the $6-$fold orientational order originating from the hexagonal morphology of the cells. Unlike in other models of active liquid crystals, the balance between energy injection and dissipation can here involve multiple length scales, resulting in a large spectrum of dynamical behaviors. When kinetic energy is dissipated by the cells' adhesive interactions at a rate higher that at which is injected by active stresses, the quiescent state of the cellular layer is generically stable: i.e. hydrodynamically stable regardless of its size. On the other hand, as the cellular layer becomes progressively more active, this homeostatic condition is altered by a hierarchy of pattern-forming instabilities, where the system organizes in an increasingly large number of counter-flowing lanes of fixed width. In two-dimensional periodic domains, the latter organization is itself unstable to the proliferation of vortices and the dynamics of the cellular layer becomes eventually chaotic and yet different from the more common active turbulence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05555v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Active fluids generate spontaneous, often chaotic mesoscale flows. Harnessing these flows to drive embedded soft materials into structures with controlled length scales and lifetimes is a key challenge at the interface between the fields of active matter and nonequilibrium self-assembly. Here, we present a simple and efficient computational approach to model soft materials advected by active fluids, by simulating particles moving in a spatiotemporally correlated noise field. To illustrate our approach, we simulate the dynamical self-organization of repulsive colloids within such an active noise field in two and three dimensions. The colloids form structures whose sizes and dynamics can be tuned by the correlation time and length of the active fluid, and range from small rotating droplets to clusters with internal flows and system-spanning sizes that vastly exceed the active correlation length. Our results elucidate how the interplay between active fluid time/length scales and emergent driven assembly can be used to rationally design functional assemblies. More broadly, our approach can be used to efficiently simulate diverse active fluids and other systems with spatiotemporally correlated noise.</description>

      <title>Arrested development and traveling waves of active suspensions in nematic liquid crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20734v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Active particles in anisotropic, viscoelastic fluids experience competing stresses which guide their trajectories. An aligned suspension of particles can trigger a hydrodynamic bend instability, but the elasticity of the fluid can drive particle orientations back towards alignment. To study these competing effects, we examine a dilute suspension of active particles in an Ericksen-Leslie model nematic liquid crystal. An anchoring strength linking the active and passive media tunes the system between active suspension theory in Newtonian fluids in one limit, and active nematic theory in another. For small active Ericksen number or particle concentration the suspension settles to an equilibrium state with uniform alignment. Beyond a critical active Ericksen number or particle concentration, the suspension instead can buckle into a steady flowing state. Rather than entering the fully developed roiling state observed in isotropic fluids, the development is arrested by fluid elasticity. Arrested states of higher wavenumber emerge at yet higher values of active Ericksen number, and a phase transition is identified at finite anchoring strength. If the active particles are motile, traveling waves emerge, including a traveling, oscillatory `thrashing' mode. Moment equations are derived, compared to kinetic theory simulations, and analyzed in asymptotic limits which admit exact expressions for the traveling wave speed and both particle orientation and director fields in the arrested state.</description>

      <title>Analysis of axisymmetric necking of a circular dielectric membrane based on a one-dimensional model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02451v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To facilitate the understanding of the mechanisms underlying the electric breakdown of dielectric elastomers, we derive a one-dimensional (1d) model for axisymmetric necking in a dielectric membrane subjected to equibiaxial stretching and an electric field, starting from the three-dimensional (3d) nonlinear electroelasticity theory. Our reduction is built on the variational asymptotic method, so that the resulting 1d model is asymptotically self-consistent. The 1d model offers an easier and more efficient way to analyze axisymmetric necking in a dielectric membrane in the linear, weakly nonlinear and fully nonlinear regimes. It delivers results identical to the 3d theory in the linear and weakly nonlinear regimes, and near-identical results in the fully nonlinear regime due to its asymptotic self-consistency. We demonstrate the straightforward implementation of this 1d model by solving it using the Rayleigh--Ritz method and validate it by comparison with finite-element simulations. The 1d model enables a precise calculation of the minimum thickness that a dielectric membrane can reach when necking instability occurs and quantitative assessment of the effects of imperfections so that the integrity of a dielectric elastomer actuator can be evaluated with respect to electric breakdown. The developed methodology is not problem-specific and can also be applied to analyze similar phenomena in other soft materials subjected to any fields (e.g., the axisymmetric necking of stretched plastic membranes).</description>

Abstract: The droplet size distribution typically decays exponentially in solutions formed by liquid-liquid phase separation. Nevertheless, a power-law distribution of nucleoli volumes has been observed in amphibian oocytes, which appears similar to the cluster size distribution in reaction-limited aggregation. In this work, we study the mechanism of power-law distributed droplet sizes and unveil a self-organized criticality driven by droplet influx and random fusion between droplets. Surprisingly, the droplet size dynamics is governed by a similar Smoluchowski equation as the cluster size in aggregation systems. The system reaches a critical state as the area fraction approaches the critical value at which the droplet size has a power-law distribution with a $1.5$ exponent. Furthermore, the system is also spatially scale-free with a divergent correlation length at the critical state, marked by giant droplet-density fluctuations and power-law decay of the pair correlation function.</description>

Abstract: Computing analytically the $n$-point density correlations in systems of interacting particles is a long-standing problem of statistical physics, with a broad range of applications, from the interpretation of scattering experiments in simple liquids, to the understanding of their collective dynamics. For Brownian particles, i.e. with overdamped Langevin dynamics, the microscopic density obeys a stochastic evolution equation, known as the Dean-Kawasaki equation. In spite of the importance of this equation, its complexity makes it very difficult to analyze the statistics of the microscopic density beyond simple Gaussian approximations. In this work, resorting to a path-integral description of the stochastic dynamics and relying on the formalism of macroscopic fluctuation theory, we go beyond the usual linearization of the Dean-Kawasaki equation, and we compute perturbatively the three-point density correlation functions, in the limit of high-density and weak interactions between the particles. This exact result opens the way to using the Dean-Kawasaki beyond the simple Gaussian treatments, and could find applications to understand many fluctuation-related effects in soft and active matter systems.</description>

      <title>Phase space contraction rate for classical mixed states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09361v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physical systems with non-reciprocal or dissipative forces evolve according to a generalization of Liouville's equation that accounts for the expansion and contraction of phase space volume. Here, we connect geometric descriptions of these non-Hamiltonian dynamics to a recently established classical density matrix theory. In this theory, the evolution of a "maximally mixed" classical density matrix is related to the well-known phase space contraction rate that, when ensemble averaged, is the rate of entropy exchange with the surroundings. Here, we extend the definition of mixed states to include statistical and mechanical components, describing both the deformations of local phase space regions and the evolution of ensembles within them. As a result, the equation of motion for this mixed state represents the rate of contraction for an ensemble of dissipative trajectories. Recognizing this density matrix as a covariance matrix, its contraction rate is another measure of entropy flow characterizing nonequilibrium steady states.</description>

      <title>Vortex Dynamics in Tubular Fluid Membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11206v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct 2D viscous flow sourced by a point vortex embedded in a thin tubular membrane, coupled to external embedding fluids. The cylinder topology enforces the creation of an additional saddle in the flow field, consistent with Poincar\'e Index Theorem. In this setup, the incompressibility of the membrane fluid can be utilized to cast the dynamics of a multi-vortex system in the form of a Hamiltonian on the cylinder, which depends on the fluid viscosities and vortex strengths. The cylinder geometry breaks the in-plane rotational symmetry of the membrane and leads to several interesting features in the multi-vortex dynamics, distinct from flat and spherical fluid membranes. For a two vortex system of same circulation, we observe closed orbits with the inter-vortex separation oscillating in time. The compact angular direction of the membrane tube also allows two distinct closed orbits instead of one, under suitable initial conditions. Vortex pairs (vortices with opposite circulation) move together along helical geodesics in accordance with a conjecture by Kimura, Proceedings of the Royal Society A, Vol 455 (1999). We also explore relative equilibria of multi-vortex systems in this setup and demonstrate vortex leapfrogging via numerical simulations. Our results will be interesting in the context of microfluidic flows arising in nature as well as experimental studies in membrane tubes similar to PNAS 108 (31) 12605-12610 (2011).</description>
