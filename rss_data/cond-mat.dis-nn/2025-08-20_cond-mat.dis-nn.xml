      <title>Emergence of non-trivial phases in interacting non-Hermitian quasiperiodic chains with power-law hopping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the last few years, several works have identified the concurrence of the spectral, delocalization-localization and topological phase transitions in non-Hermitian quasiperiodic systems in the presence of time-reversal symmetry (TRS), with or without interaction. In this work, we investigate one-dimensional interacting non-Hermitian quasiperiodic lattices with asymmetric power-law hopping and unveil that although the Hamiltonian respects the TRS, the reality of the eigenspectrum does not necessarily indicate a topologically trivial non-Hermitian many-body localization (NHMBL) regime. In fact, we reveal the emergence of a topologically trivial intermediate regime, where the states that are primarily multifractal in nature can also possess a fully real spectrum, thereby restoring the TRS before crossing over to the NHMBL phase. Moreover, in the entire intermediate regime, the interaction completely destroys the multifractal and mobility edges observed in the non-interacting counterpart. Besides, we unveil that due to the long-range nature of the hopping, the entire topologically non-trivial ergodic regime under the periodic boundary condition does not always give rise to boundary localized skin modes under the open boundary condition. Our findings thus advances and deepens the understanding about the emergence of non-trivial phases due to the interplay of interaction and long-range hopping in non-Hermitian quasiperiodic systems.</description>

      <title>Importance of Correlations for Neural Quantum States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural quantum states (NQS) have emerged as a powerful variational ansatz for representing quantum many-body wave functions. Their internal mechanisms, however, remain poorly understood. We investigate the role of correlations for NQS-like quantum state representation by employing a correlation-based interpretable neural network architecture and thereafter proving our observations based on Boolean function theory. The correlator neural network demonstrates that, even for simple product states, up to all system-size correlation orders in the chosen computational basis are required to represent a quantum state faithfully. We explain these observations using the Fourier expansion, which reveals the correlator basis as the effective basis of the internal NQS structure, the resulting necessity for high-order correlations, potential linear dependencies in constrained Hilbert spaces, and connections between spin basis-rotations and the correlator basis. Furthermore, we analyze how activation functions, network architectures, and choice of reference basis influence correlation requirements. Our results provide new insights and a better understanding of the internal structure and requirements of NQS, enabling a more systematic use of NQS in future research.</description>

      <title>Exact threshold for approximate ellipsoid fitting of random points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.05787v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem $(\rm P)$ of exactly fitting an ellipsoid (centered at $0$) to $n$ standard Gaussian random vectors in $\mathbb{R}^d$, as $n, d \to \infty$ with $n / d^2 \to \alpha &gt; 0$. This problem is conjectured to undergo a sharp transition: with high probability, $(\rm P)$ has a solution if $\alpha &lt; 1/4$, while $(\rm P)$ has no solutions if $\alpha &gt; 1/4$. So far, only a trivial bound $\alpha &gt; 1/2$ is known to imply the absence of solutions, while the sharpest results on the positive side assume $\alpha \leq \eta$ (for $\eta &gt; 0$ a small constant) to prove that $(\rm P)$ is solvable. In this work we show a universality property for the minimal fitting error achievable by ellipsoids: we show that, to leading order, it coincides with the minimal error in a so-called "Gaussian equivalent" problem, for which the satisfiability transition can be rigorously analyzed. Our main results follow from this finding, and they are twofold. On the positive side, we prove that if $\alpha &lt; 1/4$, there exists an ellipsoid fitting all the points up to a small error, and that the lengths of its principal axes are bounded above and below. On the other hand, for $\alpha &gt; 1/4$, we show that achieving small fitting error is not possible if the length of the ellipsoid's shortest axis does not approach $0$ as $d \to \infty$ (and in particular there does not exist any ellipsoid fit whose shortest axis length is bounded away from $0$ as $d \to \infty$). To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first rigorous result characterizing the expected phase transition in ellipsoid fitting at $\alpha = 1/4$. In a companion non-rigorous work, the second author and D. Kunisky give a general analysis of ellipsoid fitting using the replica method of statistical physics, which inspired the present work.</description>

      <title>Electronic structure prediction of medium and high entropy alloys across composition space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08294v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose machine learning (ML) models to predict the electron density -- the fundamental unknown of a material's ground state -- across the composition space of concentrated alloys. From this, other physical properties can be inferred, enabling accelerated exploration. A significant challenge is that the number of sampled compositions and descriptors required to accurately predict fields like the electron density increases rapidly with species. To address this, we employ Bayesian Active Learning (AL), which minimizes training data requirements by leveraging uncertainty quantification capabilities of Bayesian Neural Networks. Compared to strategic tessellation of the composition space, Bayesian-AL reduces the number of training data points by a factor of 2.5 for ternary (SiGeSn) and 1.7 for quaternary (CrFeCoNi) systems. We also introduce easy-to-optimize, body-attached-frame descriptors, which respect physical symmetries and maintain approximately the same descriptor-vector size as alloy elements increase. Our ML models demonstrate high accuracy and generalizability in predicting both electron density and energy across composition space.</description>

      <title>Analysis of discrete modern Hopfield networks in open quantum system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02883v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The modern Hopfield network, proposed by Krotov and Hopfield, is a mathematical generalization of the Hopfield network, which is a basic model of associative memory that employs higher-order interactions. This study introduces an open quantum model for discrete modern Hopfield networks that generalizes the open quantum Hopfield network. Our model integrates dissipative quantum spin systems, governed by quantum master equations, with classical hopping terms and additional quantum effects through a transverse field. We analytically examined the behavior of the stable fixed points and numerically determined the phase diagram. The results demonstrated qualitatively distinct behaviors from the open quantum Hopfield network, showing that the ferromagnetic and limit cycle phases have additional stable fixed points.</description>

      <title>An Analysis of First- and Quasi-Second-Order Optimization Algorithms in Variational Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19576v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many quantum many-body wavefunctions, such as Jastrow-Slater, tensor network, and neural quantum states, are studied with the variational Monte Carlo technique, where stochastic optimization is usually performed to obtain a faithful approximation to the ground-state of a given Hamiltonian. While first-order gradient descent methods are commonly used for such optimizations, quasi-second-order optimization formulations offer the potential of faster convergence under certain theoretical conditions, but with a similar cost per sample to first-order methods. However, the relative performance of first-order and second-order optimizers is influenced in practice by many factors, including the sampling requirements for a faithful optimization step, the influence of wavefunction quality, as well as the wavefunction parametrization and expressivity. Here we analyze these performance characteristics of first-order and quasi-second-order optimization methods for a variety of Hamiltonians, with the additional context of understanding the scaling of these methods (for good performance) as a function of system size. Our findings help clarify the role of first-order and quasi-second-order methods in variational Monte Carlo calculations and the conditions under which they should respectively be used. In particular, we find that unlike in deterministic optimization, where closeness to the variational minimum determines the suitability of second-order methods, in stochastic optimization the main factor is the overall expressivity of the wavefunction: quasi-second-order methods lead to an overall reduction in cost relative to first-order methods when the wavefunction is sufficiently expressive to represent the ground-state, even when starting far away from the ground state. This makes quasi-second-order methods an important technique when used with wavefunctions with arbitrarily improvable accuracy.</description>
