      <title>Advancing Carbon Capture using AI: Design of permeable membrane and estimation of parameters for Carbon Capture using linear regression and membrane-based equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study focuses on membrane-based systems for CO$_2$ separation, addressing the urgent need for efficient carbon capture solutions to mitigate climate change. Linear regression models, based on membrane equations, were utilized to estimate key parameters, including porosity ($\epsilon$) of 0.4805, Kozeny constant (K) of 2.9084, specific surface area ($\sigma$) of 105.3272 m$^2$/m$^3$, mean pressure (Pm) of 6.2166 MPa, viscosity ($\mu$) of 0.1997 Ns/m$^2$, and gas flux (Jg) of 3.2559 kg m$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. These parameters were derived from the analysis of synthetic datasets using linear regression. The study also provides insights into the performance of the membrane, with a flow rate (Q) of 9.8778 $\times$ 10$^{-4}$ m$^3$/s, an injection pressure (P$_1$) of 2.8219 MPa, and an exit pressure (P$_2$) of 2.5762 MPa. The permeability value of 0.045 for CO$_2$ indicates the potential for efficient separation. Optimizing membrane properties to selectively block CO$_2$ while allowing other gases to pass is crucial for improving carbon capture efficiency. By integrating these technologies into industrial processes, significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions can be achieved, fostering a circular carbon economy and contributing to global climate goals. This study also explores how artificial intelligence (AI) can aid in designing membranes for carbon capture, addressing the global climate change challenge and supporting the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set by the United Nations.</description>

      <title>Femtoliter Batch Reactors for Nanofluidic Scattering Spectroscopy Analysis of Catalytic Reactions on Single Nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Macroscopic batch reactors are a core concept in chemical synthesis and catalysis due to their ability to ensure high conversion rates of the used reactants. At the nanoscale, such reactors hold promise due to their potential to enable chemistry in confinement under well-controlled mass transport conditions, and as enablers for the characterization of catalytic reactions on tiny active surface areas, such as single nanoparticles. However, their practical implementation and the readout of reaction products if used for the study of catalytic reactions is challenging due to their tiny volume and the requirement of being able to transiently open and close such nanoscopic batch reactors. Here, we introduce a liquid phase nanofluidic batch reactor concept with a volume of 4.8 femtoliters that conveniently can be opened and closed using a bypassing N2 gas stream, and that in combination with nanofluidic scattering spectroscopy readout enables the characterization of a catalytic reaction on a single nanoparticle inside the reactor, as we demonstrate on the catalytic reduction of fluorescein by sodium borohydride on a Au catalyst.</description>

      <title>Non-unitary Variational Quantum Eigensolver with the Localized Active Space Method and Cost Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately describing strongly correlated systems with affordable quantum resources remains a central challenge for quantum chemistry applications on near and intermediate-term quantum computers. The localized active space self-consistent field (LASSCF) approximates the complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF) by generating active space-based wave functions within specific fragments while treating interfragment correlation with mean-field approach, hence is computationally less expensive. Hardware-efficient ansatzes (HEA) offer affordable and shallower circuits, yet they often fail to capture the necessary correlation. Previously, Jastrow-factor-inspired non-unitary qubit operators were proposed to use with HEA for variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) calculations (nuVQE), as they do not increase circuit depths and recover correlation beyond the mean-field level for Hartree-Fock initial states. Here, we explore running nuVQE with LASSCF as the initial state. The method, named LAS-nuVQE, is shown to recover interfragment correlations, reach chemical accuracy with a small number of gates (&lt;70) in both H4 and square cyclobutadiene. To further address the inherent symmetry-breaking in HEA, we implemented spin-constrained LAS-nuVQE to extend the capabilities of HEA further and show spin-pure results for square cyclobutadiene. We mitigate the increased measurement overhead of nuVQE via Pauli grouping and shot-frugal sampling, reducing measurement costs by up to two orders of magnitude compared to ungrouped operator, and show that one can achieve better accuracy with a small number of shots (10^3-4) per one expectation value calculation compared to noiseless simulations with one or two orders of magnitude more shots. Finally, wall clock time estimates show that, with our measurement mitigation protocols, nuVQE becomes a cheaper and more accurate alternative than VQE with HEA.</description>

      <title>Physics of droplet regulation in biological cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Droplet formation has emerged as an essential concept for the spatiotemporal organisation of biomolecules in cells. However, classical descriptions of droplet dynamics based on passive liquid-liquid phase separation cannot capture the complex situations inside cells. This review discusses three general aspects that are crucial in cells: (i) biomolecules are diverse and individually complex, implying that cellular droplets posses complex internal behaviour, e.g., in terms of their material properties; (ii) the cellular environment contains many solid-like structures that droplets can wet; (iii) cells are alive and use fuel to drive processes out of equilibrium. We illustrate how these principles control droplet nucleation, growth, position, and count to unveil possible regulatory mechanisms in biological cells and other applications of phase separation.</description>

      <title>Exploring Intrinsic Bond Orbitals in Solids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18212v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a study of the construction and spatial properties of localized Wannier orbitals in large supercells of insulating solids using plane waves as the underlying basis. The Pipek-Mezey (PM) functional in combination with intrinsic atomic orbitals (IAOs) as projectors is employed, resulting in so-called intrinsic bond orbitals (IBOs). Independent of the bonding type and band gap, a correlation between orbital spreads and geometric properties is observed. As a result, comparable sparsity patterns of the Hartree-Fock exchange matrix are found across all considered bulk 3D materials, exhibiting covalent bonds, ionc bonds, and a mixture of both bonding types. Recognizing the considerable computational effort required to construct localized Wannier orbitals for large periodic simulation cells, we address the performance and scaling of different solvers for the localization problem. This includes the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS), Conjugate-Gradient (CG), Steepest Ascent (SA) as well as the Direct Inversion in the Iterative Subspace (DIIS) method. Each algorithm performs a Riemannian optimization under unitary matrix constraint, efficiently reaching the optimum in the "curved parameter space" on geodesics. We hereby complement the literature with an introduction to this topic along with key references. Furthermore, we observe that the construction of Wannier orbitals for supercells of metal oxides presents a significant challenge, requiring approximately one order of magnitude more iteration steps than other systems studied.</description>

      <title>AI Discovering a Coordinate System of Chemical Elements: Dual Representation by Variational Autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.12090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2011.12090v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The periodic table is a fundamental representation of chemical elements that plays essential theoretical and practical roles. The research article discusses the experiences of unsupervised training of neural networks to represent elements on the 2D latent space based on their electron configurations. To emphasize chemical properties of the elements, the original data of electron configurations has been realigned towards valence orbitals. Recognizing seven shells and four subshells, the input data has been arranged as 7x4 images. Latent space representation has been performed using a convolutional beta variational autoencoder (beta-VAE). Despite discrete and sparse input data, the beta-VAE disentangles elements of different periods, blocks, groups, and types. The unsupervised representation of elements on the latent space reveals pairwise symmetries of periods and elements related to the invariance of quantum numbers of corresponding elements. In addition, it isolates outliers that turned out to be known cases of Madelung's rule violations for lanthanide and actinide elements. Considering the generative capabilities of beta-VAE, the supervised machine learning has been set to find out if there are insightful patterns distinguishing electron configurations between real elements and decoded artificial ones. Also, the article addresses the capability of dual representation by autoencoders. Conventionally, autoencoders represent observations of input data on the latent space. By transposing and duplicating original input data, it is possible to represent variables on the latent space which can lead to the discovery of meaningful patterns among input variables. Applying that unsupervised learning for transposed data of electron configurations, the order of input variables that has been arranged by the encoder on the latent space has turned out to exactly match the sequence of Madelung's rule.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian-based graph-state ansatz for variational quantum algorithms</title>

Abstract: One promising application of near-term quantum devices is to prepare trial wavefunctions using short circuits for solving different problems via variational algorithms. For this purpose, we introduce a new circuit design that combines graph-based diagonalization circuits with arbitrary single-qubit rotation gates to get Hamiltonian-based graph states ans\"atze (H-GSA). We test the accuracy of the proposed ansatz in estimating ground state energies of various molecules of size up to 12-qubits. Additionally, we compare the gate count and parameter number complexity of the proposed ansatz against previously proposed schemes and find an order magnitude reduction in gate count complexity with slight increase in the number of parameters. Our work represents a significant step towards constructing compact quantum circuits with good trainability and convergence properties and applications in solving chemistry and physics problems.</description>

      <title>Spin coupling is all you need: Encoding strong electron correlation in molecules on quantum computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18878v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The performance of quantum algorithms for eigenvalue problems, such as computing Hamiltonian spectra, depends strongly on the overlap of the initial wavefunction and the target eigenvector. In a basis of Slater determinants, the representation of energy eigenstates of systems with $N$ strongly correlated electrons requires a number of determinants that scales exponentially with $N$. On classical processors, this restricts simulations to systems where $N$ is small. Here, we show that quantum computers can efficiently simulate strongly correlated molecular systems by directly encoding the dominant entanglement structure in the form of spin-coupled initial states. This avoids resorting to expensive classical or quantum state preparation heuristics and instead exploits symmetries in the wavefunction. We provide quantum circuits for deterministic preparation of a family of spin eigenfunctions with ${N \choose N/2}$ Slater determinants with depth $\mathcal{O}(N)$ and $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ local gates. Their use as highly entangled initial states in quantum algorithms reduces the total runtime of quantum phase estimation and related fault-tolerant methods by orders of magnitude. Furthermore, we assess the application of spin-coupled wavefunctions as initial states for several heuristic quantum algorithms, namely the variational quantum eigensolver, adiabatic state preparation, and different versions of quantum subspace diagonalization (QSD) including QSD based on real-time-evolved states. We also propose a novel QSD algorithm that exploits states obtained through adaptive quantum eigensolvers. For all algorithms, we demonstrate that using spin-coupled initial states drastically reduces the quantum resources required to simulate strongly correlated ground and excited states. Our work provides a crucial component for enabling scalable quantum simulation of classically challenging electronic systems.</description>

      <title>A Roadmap for Simulating Chemical Dynamics on a Parametrically Driven Bosonic Quantum Device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13114v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chemical reactions are commonly described by the reactive flux transferring population from reactants to products across a double-well free energy barrier. Dynamics often involves barrier recrossing and quantum effects like tunneling, zero-point energy motion and interference, which traditional rate theories, such as transition-state theory, do not consider. In this study, we investigate the feasibility of simulating reaction dynamics using a parametrically driven bosonic superconducting Kerr-cat device. This approach provides control over parameters defining the double-well free energy profile, as well as external factors like temperature and the coupling strength between the reaction coordinate and the thermal bath of non-reactive degrees of freedom. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this protocol by showing that the dynamics of proton transfer reactions in prototypical benchmark model systems, such as hydrogen bonded dimers of malonaldehyde and DNA base pairs, could be accurately simulated on currently accessible Kerr-cat devices.</description>
