      <title>Turbulent mixing controls fixation of growing antagonistic populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unlike coffee and cream that homogenize when stirred, growing micro-organisms (e.g., bacteria, baker's yeast) can actively kill each other and avoid mixing. How do such antagonistic interactions impact the growth and survival of competing strains, while being spatially advected by turbulent flows? By using numerical simulations of a continuum model, we study the dynamics of two antagonistic strains that are dispersed by incompressible turbulent flows in two spatial dimensions. A key parameter is the ratio of the fluid transport time to that of biological reproduction, which determines the winning strain that ultimately takes over the whole population from an initial heterogeneous state. By quantifying the probability and mean time for fixation along with the spatial structure of concentration fluctuations, we demonstrate how turbulence raises the threshold for biological nucleation and antagonism suppresses flow-induced mixing by depleting the population at interfaces. Our work highlights the unusual biological consequences of the interplay of turbulent fluid flows with antagonistic population dynamics, with potential implications for marine microbial ecology and origins of biological chirality.</description>

      <title>Characterising rooted and unrooted tree-child networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rooted phylogenetic networks are used by biologists to infer and represent complex evolutionary relationships between species that cannot be accurately explained by a phylogenetic tree. Tree-child networks are a particular class of rooted phylogenetic networks that has been extensively investigated in recent years. In this paper, we give a novel characterisation of a tree-child network $\mathcal{R}$ in terms of cherry-picking sequences that are sequences on the leaves of $\mathcal{R}$ and reduce it to a single vertex by repeatedly applying one of two reductions to its leaves. We show that our characterisation extends to unrooted tree-child networks which are mostly unexplored in the literature and, in turn, also offers a new approach to settling the computational complexity of deciding if an unrooted phylogenetic network can be oriented as a rooted tree-child network.</description>

      <title>T(w)o patch or not t(w)o patch: A novel additional food model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17003v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A number of top down bio-control models have been proposed where the introduced predators' efficacy is enhanced via the provision of additional food (AF). However, if the predator has a pest dependent monotone functional response, pest extinction is unattainable. In the current manuscript, we propose a model where a predator with pest dependent monotone functional response is introduced into a ``patch" such as a prairie strip with AF, and then disperses or drifts into a neighboring ``patch" such as a crop field, to target a pest. We show the pest extinction state is attainable in the crop field and can be globally attracting.
  The AF model with patch structure can eliminate predator explosion present therein and can keep pest densities lower than the classical top-down bio-control model. We provide the first proof of the global stability of the interior equilibrium for the classical AF model.
  We also observe ``patch-specific chaos" - the pest occupying the crop field can oscillate chaotically, while the pest in the prairie strip oscillates periodically. We discuss these results in light of bio-control strategies that utilize state-of-the-art farming practices such as prairie strips and drift and dispersal pressures driven by climate change.</description>

      <title>Effectiveness of probabilistic contact tracing in epidemic containment: the role of super-spreaders and transmission path reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00910v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent COVID-19 pandemic underscores the significance of early-stage non-pharmacological intervention strategies. The widespread use of masks and the systematic implementation of contact tracing strategies provide a potentially equally effective and socially less impactful alternative to more conventional approaches, such as large-scale mobility restrictions. However, manual contact tracing faces strong limitations in accessing the network of contacts, and the scalability of currently implemented protocols for smartphone-based digital contact tracing becomes impractical during the rapid expansion phases of the outbreaks, due to the surge in exposure notifications and associated tests. A substantial improvement in digital contact tracing can be obtained through the integration of probabilistic techniques for risk assessment that can more effectively guide the allocation of new diagnostic tests. In this study, we first quantitatively analyze the diagnostic and social costs associated with these containment measures based on contact tracing, employing three state-of-the-art models of SARS-CoV-2 spreading. Our results suggest that probabilistic techniques allow for more effective mitigation at a lower cost. Secondly, our findings reveal a remarkable efficacy of probabilistic contact-tracing techniques in performing backward and multi-step tracing and capturing super-spreading events.</description>
