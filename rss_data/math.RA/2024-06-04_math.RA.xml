      <title>Defect Invariant Nakayama Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that for a given Nakayama algebra $\Theta$, there exist countably many cyclic Nakayama algebras $\Lambda_i$, where $i \in \mathbb{N}$, such that the syzygy filtered algebra of $\Lambda_i$ is isomorphic to $\Theta$ and we describe those algebras $\Lambda_i$. We show, among these algebras, there exists a unique algebra $\Lambda$ where the defects, representing the number of indecomposable injective but not projective modules, remain invariant for both $\Theta$ and $\Lambda$. As an application, we achieve the classification of cyclic Nakayama algebras that are minimal Auslander-Gorenstein and dominant Auslander-regular algebras of global dimension three. Specifically, by using the Auslander-Iyama correspondence, we obtain cluster-tilting objects for certain Nakayama algebras. Additionally, we introduce cosyzygy filtered algebras and show that it is dual of syzygy filtered algebra.</description>

      <title>Noncommutative projective partial resolutions and quiver varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma\in \mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{C})$ be a finite subgroup. We introduce a class of projective noncommutative surfaces $\mathbb{P}^2_I$, indexed by a set of irreducible $\Gamma$-representations. When considering the extended action of $\Gamma$ from $\mathbb{C}^2$ to $\mathbb{P}^2$, we show that these surfaces generalise both $[\mathbb{P}^2/\Gamma]$ and $\mathbb{P}^2/\Gamma$. We prove that isomorphism classes of framed torsion-free sheaves on any $\mathbb{P}^2_I$ carry a canonical bijection to the closed points of appropriate Nakajima quiver varieties. In particular, we provide geometric interpretations for a class of Nakajima quiver varieties using noncommutative geometry. Our results partially generalise several previous results on such quiver varieties.</description>

      <title>An algebraic geometry of paths via the iterated-integrals signature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17886v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Contrary to previous approaches bringing together algebraic geometry and signatures of paths, we introduce a Zariski topology on the space of paths itself, and study path varieties consisting of all paths whose iterated-integrals signature satisfies certain polynomial equations. Particular emphasis lies on the role of the non-associative halfshuffle, which makes it possible to describe varieties of paths that satisfy certain relations all along their trajectory. Specifically, we may understand the set of paths on a given classical algebraic variety in $\mathbb{R}^d$ starting from a fixed point as a path variety, e.g. paths on a sphere. While the characteristic geometric property of halfshuffle varieties is that they are stable under stopping paths at an earlier time, we furthermore study varieties which are stable under the natural (semi)group operation of concantenation of paths. We point out how the notion of dimension for path varieties crucially depends on the fact that they may be reducible into countably infinitely many subvarieties. Finally, we see that studying halfshuffle varieties naturally leads to a generalization of classical algebraic curves, surfaces and affine varieties in finite dimensional space. These generalized algebraic sets, an example being the graph of the exponential function, are now described through iterated-integral equations.

      <title>Generalized classical Yang-Baxter equation and regular decompositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04440v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The focus of the paper is on constructing new solutions of the generalized classical Yang-Baxter equation (GCYBE) that are not skew-symmetric. Using regular decompositions of finite-dimensional simple Lie algebras, we construct Lie algebra decompositions of $\mathfrak{g}(\!(x)\!) \times \mathfrak{g}[x]/x^m \mathfrak{g}[x]$. The latter decompositions are in bijection with the solutions to the GCYBE. Under appropriate regularity conditions, we obtain a partial classification of such solutions. The paper is concluded with the presentations of the Gaudin-type models associated to these solutions.</description>

      <title>Noetherianity of twisted Zhu algebra and bimodules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2103.08090v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we show that for a large natural class of vertex operator algebras (VOAs) and their modules, the Zhu algebras and bimodules (and their $g$-twisted analogs) are Noetherian. These carry important information about the representation theory of the VOA, and its fusion rules, and the Noetherian property gives the potential for (non-commutative) algebro-geometric methods to be employed in their study.</description>

      <title>Fans and polytopes in tilting theory I: Foundations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.15213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.15213v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a finite dimensional algebra $A$ over a field $k$, the 2-term silting complexes of $A$ gives a simplicial complex $\Delta(A)$ called the $g$-simplicial complex. We give tilting theoretic interpretations of the $h$-vectors and Dehn-Sommerville equations of $\Delta(A)$. Using $g$-vectors of 2-term silting complexes, $\Delta(A)$ gives a nonsingular fan $\Sigma(A)$ in the real Grothendieck group $K_0(\mathsf{proj} A)_{\mathbb{R}}$ called the $g$-fan. We give several basic properties of $\Sigma(A)$ including sign-coherence, sign decomposition, idempotent reductions, Jasso reductions, pairwise positivity and a connection with Newton polytopes of $A$-modules. Moreover, $\Sigma(A)$ gives a (possibly infinite and non-convex) polytope $P(A)$ in $K_0(\mathsf{proj} A)_{\mathbb{R}}$ called the $g$-polytope of $A$. We call $A$ $g$-convex if $P(A)$ is convex. In this case, we show that it is a reflexive polytope, and that the dual polytope is given by the 2-term simple minded collections of $A$. There are precisely 7 convex $g$-polyogons up to isomorphism. We give a classification of algebras whose $g$-polytopes are smooth Fano.
  We study $g$-fans and $g$-polytopes of two important classes of algebras. We show that the $g$-fan of a classical or generalized preprojective algebra is given by the Coxeter fan. It is $g$-convex if and only if it is of type $A$ or $B$, and in this case, its $g$-polytope is the dual polytope of the short root polytope. Moreover we classify Brauer graph algebras which are $g$-convex, and describe their $g$-polytopes as the root polytopes of type $A$ or $C$.</description>

      <title>Periodic dimensions and some homological properties of eventually periodic algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.06242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.06242v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For an eventually periodic module, we have the degree and the period of its first periodic syzygy. This paper studies the former under the name \lq\lq periodic dimension\rq\rq. We give a bound for the periodic dimension of an eventually periodic module with finite Gorenstein projective dimension. We also provide a method of computing the Gorenstein projective dimension of an eventually periodic module under certain conditions. Besides, motivated by recent results of Dotsenko, G\'elinas and Tamaroff and of the author, we determine the bimodule periodic dimension of an eventually periodic Gorenstein algebra. Another aim of this paper is to obtain some of the basic homological properties of eventually periodic algebras. We show that a lot of homological conjectures hold for this class of algebras. As an application, we characterize eventually periodic Gorenstein algebras in terms of bimodules Gorenstein projective dimensions.</description>

      <title>Tensor products and intertwining operators between two uniserial representations of the Galilean Lie algebra $\mathfrak{sl}(2)\ltimes \mathfrak{h}_n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.11383v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathfrak{sl}(2)\ltimes \mathfrak{h}_n$, $n\ge 1$, be the Galilean Lie algebra over a field of characteristic zero, here $\mathfrak{h}_{n}$ is the Heisenberg Lie algebra of dimension $2n+1$, and $\mathfrak{sl}(2)$ acts on $\mathfrak{h}_{n}$ so that $\mathfrak{h}_n\simeq V(2n-1)\oplus V(0)$ as $\mathfrak{sl}(2)$-modules (here $V(k)$ denotes the irreducible $\mathfrak{sl}(2)$-module of highest weight $k$). In this paper, we study the tensor product of two uniserial representations of $\mathfrak{sl}(2)\ltimes \mathfrak{h}_n$. We obtain the $\mathfrak{sl}(2)$-module structure of the socle of $V\otimes W$ and we describe the space of intertwining operators $\text{Hom}_{\mathfrak{sl}(2)\ltimes \mathfrak{h}_n}(V,W)$, where $V$ and $W$ are uniserial representations of $\mathfrak{sl}(2)\ltimes \mathfrak{h}_n$. The structure of the radical of $V\otimes W$ follows from that of the socle of $V^*\otimes W^*$.
  The result is subtle and shows how difficult is to obtain the whole socle series of arbitrary tensor products of uniserials. In contrast to the serial associative case, our results for $\mathfrak{sl}(2)\ltimes \mathfrak{h}_n$ reveal that these tensor products are far from being a direct sum of uniserials; in particular, there are cases in which the tensor product of two uniserial $\big(\mathfrak{sl}(2)\ltimes \mathfrak{h}_n\big)$-modules is indecomposable but not uniserial. Recall that a foundational result of T. Nakayama states that every finitely generated module over a serial associative algebra is a direct sum of uniserial modules. This article extends a previous work in which we obtained the corresponding results for the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{sl}(2)\ltimes \mathfrak{a}_m$ where $\mathfrak{a}_m$ is the abelian Lie algebra of dimension $m+1$ and $\mathfrak{sl}(2)$ acts so that $\mathfrak{a}_m\simeq V(m)$ as $\mathfrak{sl}(2)$-modules.</description>

      <title>Generalization the parameters of minimal linear codes over the ring $\mathbb{Z}_{p^l}$ and $\mathbb{Z}_{{p_1}{p_2}}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09561v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, We introduce a condition that is both necessary and sufficient for a linear code to achieve minimality when analyzed over the rings $\mathbb{Z}_{n}$.The fundamental inquiry in minimal linear codes is the existence of a $[m,k]$ minimal linear code where $k$ is less than or equal to $m$. W. Lu et al. ( see \cite{nine}) showed that there exists a positive integer $m(k;q)$ such that for $m\geq m(k;q)$ a minimal linear code of length $m$ and dimension $k$ over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$ must exist. They give the upper and lower bound of $m(k;q)$. In this manuscript, we establish both an upper and lower bound for $m(k;p^l)$ and $m(k;p_1p_2)$ within the ring $\mathbb{Z}_{p^l}$ and $\mathbb{Z}_{p_1p_2}$ respectively.</description>
