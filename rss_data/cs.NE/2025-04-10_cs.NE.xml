      <title>The Method for Storing Patterns in Neural Networks-Memorization and Recall of QR code Patterns-</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a mechanism for storing complex patterns within a neural network and subsequently recalling them. This model is based on our work published in 2018(Inazawa, 2018), which we have refined and extended in this work. With the recent advancements in deep learning and large language model (LLM)-based AI technologies (generative AI), it can be considered that methodologies for the learning are becoming increasingly well-established. In the future, we expect to see further research on memory using models based on Transformers (Vaswani, et. al., 2017, Rae, et. al., 2020), but in this paper we propose a simpler and more powerful model of memory and recall in neural networks. The advantage of storing patterns in a neural network lies in its ability to recall the original pattern even when an incomplete version is presented. The patterns we have produced for use in this study have been QR code (DENSO WAVE, 1994), which has become widely used as an information transmission tool in recent years.</description>

      <title>Learning in Spiking Neural Networks with a Calcium-based Hebbian Rule for Spike-timing-dependent Plasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how biological neural networks are shaped via local plasticity mechanisms can lead to energy-efficient and self-adaptive information processing systems, which promises to mitigate some of the current roadblocks in edge computing systems. While biology makes use of spikes to seamless use both spike timing and mean firing rate to modulate synaptic strength, most models focus on one of the two. In this work, we present a Hebbian local learning rule that models synaptic modification as a function of calcium traces tracking neuronal activity. We show how the rule reproduces results from spike time and spike rate protocols from neuroscientific studies. Moreover, we use the model to train spiking neural networks on MNIST digit recognition to show and explain what sort of mechanisms are needed to learn real-world patterns. We show how our model is sensitive to correlated spiking activity and how this enables it to modulate the learning rate of the network without altering the mean firing rate of the neurons nor the hyparameters of the learning rule. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that showcases how spike timing and rate can be complementary in their role of shaping the connectivity of spiking neural networks.</description>

      <title>Multihead self-attention in cortico-thalamic circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Both biological cortico-thalamic networks and artificial transformer networks use canonical computations to perform a wide range of cognitive tasks. In this work, we propose that the structure of cortico-thalamic circuits is well suited to realize a computation analogous to multihead self-attention, the main algorithmic innovation of transformers. We start with the concept of a cortical unit module or microcolumn, and propose that superficial and deep pyramidal cells carry distinct computational roles. Specifically, superficial pyramidal cells encode an attention mask applied onto deep pyramidal cells to compute attention-modulated values. We show how to wire such microcolumns into a circuit equivalent to a single head of self-attention. We then suggest the parallel between one head of attention and a cortical area. On this basis, we show how to wire cortico-thalamic circuits to perform multihead self-attention. Along these constructions, we refer back to existing experimental data, and find noticeable correspondence. Finally, as a first step towards a mechanistic theory of synaptic learning in this framework, we derive formal gradients of a tokenwise mean squared error loss for a multihead linear self-attention block.</description>

      <title>Controller Distillation Reduces Fragile Brain-Body Co-Adaptation and Enables Migrations in MAP-Elites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brain-body co-optimization suffers from fragile co-adaptation where brains become over-specialized for particular bodies, hindering their ability to transfer well to others. Evolutionary algorithms tend to discard such low-performing solutions, eliminating promising morphologies. Previous work considered applying MAP-Elites, where niche descriptors are based on morphological features, to promote better search over morphology space. In this work, we show that this approach still suffers from fragile co-adaptation: where a core mechanism of MAP-Elites, creating stepping stones through solutions that migrate from one niche to another, is disrupted. We suggest that this disruption occurs because the body mutations that move an offspring to a new morphological niche break the robots' fragile brain-body co-adaptation and thus significantly decrease the performance of those potential solutions -- reducing their likelihood of outcompeting an existing elite in that new niche. We utilize a technique, we call Pollination, that periodically replaces the controllers of certain solutions with a distilled controller with better generalization across morphologies to reduce fragile brain-body co-adaptation and thus promote MAP-Elites migrations. Pollination increases the success of body mutations and the number of migrations, resulting in better quality-diversity metrics. We believe we develop important insights that could apply to other domains where MAP-Elites is used.</description>

      <title>Genetic Programming for Explainable Manifold Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14139v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Manifold learning techniques play a pivotal role in machine learning by revealing lower-dimensional embeddings within high-dimensional data, thus enhancing both the efficiency and interpretability of data analysis by transforming the data into a lower-dimensional representation. However, a notable challenge with current manifold learning methods is their lack of explicit functional mappings, crucial for explainability in many real-world applications. Genetic programming, known for its interpretable functional tree-based models, has emerged as a promising approach to address this challenge. Previous research leveraged multi-objective GP to balance manifold quality against embedding dimensionality, producing functional mappings across a range of embedding sizes. Yet, these mapping trees often became complex, hindering explainability. In response, in this paper, we introduce Genetic Programming for Explainable Manifold Learning (GP-EMaL), a novel approach that directly penalises tree complexity. Our new method is able to maintain high manifold quality while significantly enhancing explainability and also allows customisation of complexity measures, such as symmetry balancing, scaling, and node complexity, catering to diverse application needs. Our experimental analysis demonstrates that GP-EMaL is able to match the performance of the existing approach in most cases, while using simpler, smaller, and more interpretable tree structures. This advancement marks a significant step towards achieving interpretable manifold learning.</description>

      <title>Algorithm Discovery With LLMs: Evolutionary Search Meets Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05108v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Discovering efficient algorithms for solving complex problems has been an outstanding challenge in mathematics and computer science, requiring substantial human expertise over the years. Recent advancements in evolutionary search with large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in accelerating the discovery of algorithms across various domains, particularly in mathematics and optimization. However, existing approaches treat the LLM as a static generator, missing the opportunity to update the model with the signal obtained from evolutionary exploration. In this work, we propose to augment LLM-based evolutionary search by continuously refining the search operator - the LLM - through reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning. Our method leverages evolutionary search as an exploration strategy to discover improved algorithms, while RL optimizes the LLM policy based on these discoveries. Our experiments on three combinatorial optimization tasks - bin packing, traveling salesman, and the flatpack problem - show that combining RL and evolutionary search improves discovery efficiency of improved algorithms, showcasing the potential of RL-enhanced evolutionary strategies to assist computer scientists and mathematicians for more efficient algorithm design.</description>
