      <title>The Structure of Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scenarios elicit possibilities that may be ignored otherwise, as well as causal relations between them. Even when too little information is available to assess reliable probabilities, the structure of linkages between evoked alternatives and perceived consequences can be analyzed by highlighting shared consequences of different alternatives or, conversely, diverging consequences of apparently similar alternatives. While according to current practice this structure is analyzed by exploring four possibilities obtained by crossing two macro-features, I illustrate the wider possibilities enabled by hypergraph analysis. An application is discussed.</description>

      <title>The Evolution of Unobserved Skill Returns in the U.S.: A New Approach Using Panel Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Economists disagree about the factors driving the substantial increase in residual wage inequality in the US over the past few decades. To identify changes in the returns to unobserved skills, we make a novel assumption about the dynamics of skills rather than about the stability of skill distributions across cohorts, as is standard. We show that our assumption is supported by data on test score dynamics for older workers in the HRS. Using survey data from the PSID and administrative data from the IRS and SSA, we estimate that the returns to unobserved skills $declined$ substantially in the late-1980s and 1990s despite an increase in residual inequality. Accounting for firm-specific pay differences yields similar results. Extending our framework to consider occupational differences in returns to skill and multiple unobserved skills, we further show that skill returns display similar patterns for workers employed in each of cognitive, routine, and social occupations. Finally, our results suggest that increasing skill dispersion, driven by rising skill volatility, explains most of the growth in residual wage inequality since the 1980s.</description>

      <title>Applying AHP and FUZZY AHP Management Methods to Assess the Level of Financial and Digital Inclusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In today's world, marked by social distancing and lockdowns, the development of digital financial services is becoming increasingly important, but there is little empirical work documenting the most important factors that contribute to the process of financial and digital inclusion. Because the speed with which states adapt to digital financial services is critical, we must ask how prepared states are for this transition and how far they have progressed in terms of financial and digital inclusion. In this context, the goal of this article is, on the one hand, to propose a financial responsibility process framework capable of raising awareness of the most important harmonized key levels of financial and digital inclusion process that, when properly managed, can lead to achieving an optimal level of financial responsibility, and, on the other hand, to assess the financial and digital inclusion process of two different age groups of individuals who are active in the financial environment (15-34 and 35-59 age groups). The Analytical Hierarchy Process AHP and Fuzzy AHP approaches are proposed as a framework for assessing the mechanism of financial and digital inclusion in five East Central European countries. The findings reflect differences between the analyzed countries in terms of the key levels of financial and digital inclusion (where digital and financial education are the most important levels), with Croatia, Czech Republic, and Poland being the most integrated and Romania being the least. According to the findings, as a country or region's level of financial and digital inclusion increases, so does its level of financial responsibility. This research can be a useful tool in raising awareness about the importance of directed behavior for financial responsibility, particularly for policymakers.</description>
