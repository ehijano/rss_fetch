      <title>A virtual airplane for fear of flying therapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fear of flying is a serious problem that affects millions of individuals. Exposure therapy for fear of flying is an effective therapy technique. However, exposure therapy is also expensive, logistically difficult to arrange, and presents significant problems of patient confidentiality and potential embarrassment. We have developed a virtual airplane for use in fear of flying therapy. Using the virtual airplane for exposure therapy is a potential solution to many of the current problems of fear of flying exposure therapy. We describe the design of the virtual airplane and present a case report on its use for fear of flying exposure therapy.</description>

      <title>Phase-sensitive modeling improves Fat DESPOT multiparametric relaxation mapping in fat-water mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: To improve on the original form of Fat DESPOT, a multiparametric mapping technique that returns the fat- and water-specific estimates of R1 (R1f , R1w ), R2 , and proton density fat fraction (PDFF) by upgrading the fat-water separation method used for selection of initial parameter guesses, and by introducing explicit model sensitivity to the phase of the water and fat signals. Methods: We compared the 3-point Dixon and Graph Cut (GC) approaches to initial guesses for Fat DESPOT in phantom experiments at 3 T in a variable fat fraction gel phantom. Also in phantom, we then compared the original Fat DESPOT approach to a magnitude approach modeling the phases of fat and water separately (Fat DESPOTm{\phi}), and an approach that models the complex data (Fat DESPOTc). The best-performing approach was then used in the lower leg of a healthy human participant. Results: In phantoms, Fat DESPOT using the 3-point Dixon and GC performed similarly in parametric estimates and precision, though the Dixon approach deviated from the overall trend in the 50% nominal fat fraction ROI. Furthermore, Fat DESPOTc showed the best agreement with reference PDFF (average error 1.5 +/- 1.2%) and the lowest combined standard deviation across ROIs, for PDFF, R1f, and R1w ({\sigma} = 0.13%, 0.19 1/s, 0.0082 1/s). Conclusion: With a higher precision of R1f and R1w , accuracy of PDFF, and more echo time versatility than other compared approaches, this work demonstrates the advantages of the GC approach for initial guesses paired with complex fitting for Fat DESPOT multiparametric imaging.</description>

      <title>Functional Spectral Imaging by Ultrasound (FSIU): A Spectral-Theoretic Basis for Functional Ultrasound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Functional Spectral Imaging (FSI) models image formation as the recovery of tissue surrogates such as density and stiffness from spectral perturbations of a self-adjoint elliptic operator. Rather than relying on reflectivity or relaxation kinetics, FSI tracks shifts of a truncated set of eigenmodes under controlled excitation, providing a non-ionizing and operator-theoretic route to contrast. Tissue heterogeneity is modeled as a small perturbation of L = -div(D grad) + gamma, with first-order Hadamard formulas linking local contrasts to eigenvalue shifts. Frechet derivatives and their adjoints yield gradients for variational inversion, stabilized by Tikhonov or total-variation regularization and modal truncation. Finite-element simulations show submillimetric localization (about 0.1-0.3 mm) and milligram-scale detectability (thresholds near 1 mg) under ideal noise. Retaining 10-15 modes preserves about 85 percent of anomaly contrast while suppressing noise. A spectral-entropy index separates compact from diffuse inclusions and acts as a morphology surrogate. FSI thus provides a mathematically controlled, non-ionizing framework for localized functional imaging, motivating validation in physical phantoms and in vivo studies.</description>

      <title>Real-time MRI-based fetal femur length measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: To develop and evaluate a real-time method for automatic planning and measurement of fetal femur length - an important indicator of antenatal growth - during MRI. While routinely assessed by ultrasound, MRI-based femur length measurements remain challenging due to bone-slice misalignment, fetal motion, and the need for manual assessment. Methods: A low-latency 3D U-Net was trained on 59 scans acquired at 0.55T (gestational age 18-40 weeks) to localise the proximal and distal endpoints of the femur. These coordinates were employed to automatically adapt a 30-second EPI sequence for in-plane femur coverage in real-time. Retrospective evaluation was performed in 72 scans (19-39 weeks, including 19 pathological cases), and real-time testing in 24 cases (17-39 weeks). Automated results were compared with manual expert annotations and, in 57/72 cases, with matched clinical ultrasound measurements. Precision was evaluated against inter-observer variability and analysed across gestational age and maternal BMI. Furthermore, bilateral femur length consistency was evaluated. Results: Retrospective analysis demonstrated a mean endpoint localisation error of 5.5 mm and femur length deviation of 3.0 mm. Among the 49/72 cases with both femora automatically extracted, the left-right difference was 2.8+-2.7 mm. Precision was unaffected by maternal BMI (p&gt;0.05), but correlated with gestational age (p&lt;0.05). Real-time planning and assessment were successful in 22/24 cases, with a mean deviation of 4.2 mm. Conclusions: A real-time, automated method for MRI-based femur length measurement was developed, enabling precise, motion-robust, and operator-independent growth assessment, supporting future large-scale evaluation in growth-compromised pregnancies.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Transmission FLASH Radiotherapy for Large-Field Post-Mastectomy Breast Treatment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated the effects of scanning speed, beam configuration, and dose-rate modeling on the FLASH effect in post-mastectomy proton transmission-beam (TB) planning and evaluated whether optimizing the spot-scanning path can enhance FLASH. Five left-sided post-mastectomy patients (32 Gy in 5 fractions) were replanned with single-energy (249 MeV) tangential TBs plus a clinical en face background beam. FLASH was evaluated with two models: Krieger's FLASH effectiveness model (FEM) and Folkerts' average dose-rate (ADR) framework. Plans used conventional pencil-beam scanning, split-field delivery, and GA-optimized spot sequences, with vertical scan speeds varied from 10 to 20 mm/ms. FLASH in normal tissues was defined as the percentage of voxels meeting the threshold (&gt;= 4 Gy at &gt;= 40 Gy/s); once a voxel met the criterion, a dose-adjustment factor of 0.67 was applied. The FLASH effect was highly sensitive to scanning pattern and model choice. Increasing vertical scan speed from 10 to 20 mm/ms increased FLASH in the CTV by 22% (ADR) and 12% (FEM); in skin it rose from 41.4% to 58.8% (ADR) and from 8.4% to 13.1% (FEM). Split-field delivery increased the temporal separation between vertical spot columns and yielded superior FLASH, including up to a 9.2 Gy reduction in CTV Dmean with ADR. GA-based optimization shortened scan time and achieved FLASH comparable to split-field delivery, with a CTV Dmean reduction of 7.87 Gy (ADR-GA) and skin Dmean reductions of 2-3 Gy. These findings indicate that FLASH outcomes depend strongly on scanning trajectory, scan speed, and model selection. In addition, path-minimizing spot-delivery optimization (e.g., GA) can further improve dose-rate distributions in healthy voxels.</description>

      <title>Optimized Single-Core PCF-Based SPR Biosensor for High-Performance Early-Stage Multi-Cancer Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we present a highly sensitive Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR)-based biosensor integrated with a circular-lattice Photonic Crystal Fiber (PCF) for early-stage cancer detection. The proposed sensor leverages the synergy between SPR and PCF technologies to overcome the bulkiness and limited sensitivity of traditional SPR systems. A thin gold (Au) layer, responsible for plasmon excitation, is deposited on the fiber structure, while a nanolayer of vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) is introduced to enhance adhesion between the gold and the silica background, improving structural stability and field confinement. The sensor is designed to detect refractive index (RI) variations in biological analytes, specifically targeting cancerous cells from skin, blood, and adrenal gland tissues. The optical characteristics and performance of the sensor were thoroughly analyzed using the Finite Element Method (FEM) in COMSOL Multiphysics 6.1, allowing for precise simulation and optimization. The sensor demonstrates high sensitivity within the RI range of 1.360-1.395, corresponding to the RI values of the target cancer cells. Remarkable wavelength sensitivities of 21,250 nm/RIU, 53,571 nm/RIU, and 103,571 nm/RIU were achieved for skin, blood, and adrenal gland cancers, respectively. In addition, a maximum figure of merit (FOM) of 306.424 RIU^-1 and a spectral resolution (SR) of 9.57x10^-7 RIU further affirm the sensor's exceptional detection capabilities. These findings indicate the proposed SPR-PCF sensor's strong potential for real-time, label-free biosensing applications, particularly in precise and early cancer diagnostics.</description>

      <title>Inverse Optimal Control of Muscle Force Sharing During Pathological Gait</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Muscle force sharing is typically resolved by minimizing a specific objective function to approximate neural control strategies. An inverse optimal control approach was applied to identify the "best" objective function, among a positive linear combination of basis objective functions, associated with the gait of two post-stroke males, one high-functioning (subject S1) and one low-functioning (subject S2). It was found that the "best" objective function is subject- and leg-specific. No single function works universally well, yet the best options are usually differently weighted combinations of muscle activation- and power-minimization. Subject-specific inverse optimal control models performed best on their respective limbs (\textbf{RMSE 178/213 N, CC 0.71/0.61} for non-paretic and paretic legs of S1; \textbf{RMSE 205/165 N, CC 0.88/0.85} for respective legs of S2), but cross-subject generalization was poor, particularly for paretic legs. Moreover, minimizing the root mean square of muscle power emerged as important for paretic limbs, while minimizing activation-based functions dominated for non-paretic limbs. This may suggest different neural control strategies between affected and unaffected sides, possibly altered by the presence of spasticity. Among the 15 considered objective functions commonly used in inverse dynamics-based computations, the root mean square of muscle power was the only one explicitly incorporating muscle velocity, leading to a possible model for spasticity in the paretic limbs. Although this objective function has been rarely used, it may be relevant for modeling pathological gait, such as post-stroke gait.</description>

      <title>Time-Embedded Algorithm Unrolling for Computational MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Algorithm unrolling methods have proven powerful for solving the regularized least squares problem in computational magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). These approaches unfold an iterative algorithm with a fixed number of iterations, typically alternating between a neural network-based proximal operator for regularization, a data fidelity operation and auxiliary updates with learnable parameters. While the connection to optimization methods dictate that the proximal operator network should be shared across unrolls, this can introduce artifacts or blurring. Heuristically, practitioners have shown that using distinct networks may be beneficial, but this significantly increases the number of learnable parameters, making it challenging to prevent overfitting. To address these shortcomings, by taking inspirations from proximal operators with varying thresholds in approximate message passing (AMP) and the success of time-embedding in diffusion models, we propose a time-embedded algorithm unrolling scheme for inverse problems. Specifically, we introduce a novel perspective on the iteration-dependent proximal operation in vector AMP (VAMP) and the subsequent Onsager correction in the context of algorithm unrolling, framing them as a time-embedded neural network. Similarly, the scalar weights in the data fidelity operation and its associated Onsager correction are cast as time-dependent learnable parameters. Our extensive experiments on the fastMRI dataset, spanning various acceleration rates and datasets, demonstrate that our method effectively reduces aliasing artifacts and mitigates noise amplification, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, we show that our time-embedding strategy extends to existing algorithm unrolling approaches, enhancing reconstruction quality without increasing the computational complexity significantly.</description>

      <title>Universal and Transferable Attacks on Pathology Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Universal and Transferable Adversarial Perturbations (UTAP) for pathology foundation models that reveal critical vulnerabilities in their capabilities. Optimized using deep learning, UTAP comprises a fixed and weak noise pattern that, when added to a pathology image, systematically disrupts the feature representation capabilities of multiple pathology foundation models. Therefore, UTAP induces performance drops in downstream tasks that utilize foundation models, including misclassification across a wide range of unseen data distributions. In addition to compromising the model performance, we demonstrate two key features of UTAP: (1) universality: its perturbation can be applied across diverse field-of-views independent of the dataset that UTAP was developed on, and (2) transferability: its perturbation can successfully degrade the performance of various external, black-box pathology foundation models - never seen before. These two features indicate that UTAP is not a dedicated attack associated with a specific foundation model or image dataset, but rather constitutes a broad threat to various emerging pathology foundation models and their applications. We systematically evaluated UTAP across various state-of-the-art pathology foundation models on multiple datasets, causing a significant drop in their performance with visually imperceptible modifications to the input images using a fixed noise pattern. The development of these potent attacks establishes a critical, high-standard benchmark for model robustness evaluation, highlighting a need for advancing defense mechanisms and potentially providing the necessary assets for adversarial training to ensure the safe and reliable deployment of AI in pathology.</description>

      <title>Foundation Models in Medical Image Analysis: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly foundation models (FMs), have revolutionized medical image analysis, demonstrating strong zero- and few-shot performance across diverse medical imaging tasks, from segmentation to report generation. Unlike traditional task-specific AI models, FMs leverage large corpora of labeled and unlabeled multimodal datasets to learn generalized representations that can be adapted to various downstream clinical applications with minimal fine-tuning. However, despite the rapid proliferation of FM research in medical imaging, the field remains fragmented, lacking a unified synthesis that systematically maps the evolution of architectures, training paradigms, and clinical applications across modalities. To address this gap, this review article provides a comprehensive and structured analysis of FMs in medical image analysis. We systematically categorize studies into vision-only and vision-language FMs based on their architectural foundations, training strategies, and downstream clinical tasks. Additionally, a quantitative meta-analysis of the studies was conducted to characterize temporal trends in dataset utilization and application domains. We also critically discuss persistent challenges, including domain adaptation, efficient fine-tuning, computational constraints, and interpretability along with emerging solutions such as federated learning, knowledge distillation, and advanced prompting. Finally, we identify key future research directions aimed at enhancing the robustness, explainability, and clinical integration of FMs, thereby accelerating their translation into real-world medical practice.</description>

      <title>A Review of Equation-Based and Data-Driven Reduced Order Models featuring a Hybrid cardiovascular application</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases are a leading cause of death in the world, driving the development of patient-specific and benchmark models for blood flow analysis. This chapter provides a theoretical overview of the main categories of Reduced Order Models (ROMs), focusing on both projection-based and data-driven approaches within a classical setup. We then present a hybrid ROM tailored for simulating blood flow in a patient-specific aortic geometry. The proposed methodology integrates projection-based techniques with neural network-enhanced data-driven components, incorporating a lifting function strategy to enforce physiologically realistic outflow pressure conditions. This hybrid methodology enables a substantial reduction in computational cost while mantaining high fidelity in reconstructing both velocity and pressure fields. We compare the full- and reduced-order solutions in details and critically assess the advantages and limitations of ROMs in patient-specific cardiovascular modeling.</description>

      <title>A Tracking prior to Localization workflow for Ultrasound Localization Microscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.02724v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultrasound Localization Microscopy (ULM) has proven effective in resolving microvascular structures and local mean velocities at sub-diffraction-limited scales, offering high-resolution imaging capabilities. Dynamic ULM (DULM) enables the creation of angiography or velocity movies throughout cardiac cycles. Currently, these techniques rely on a Localization-and-Tracking (LAT) workflow consisting in detecting microbubbles (MB) in the frames before pairing them to generate tracks. While conventional LAT methods perform well at low concentrations, they suffer from longer acquisition times and degraded localization and tracking accuracy at higher concentrations, leading to biased angiogram reconstruction and velocity estimation. In this study, we propose a novel approach to address these challenges by reversing the current workflow. The proposed method, Tracking-and-Localization (TAL), relies on first tracking the MB and then performing localization. Through comprehensive benchmarking using both in silico and in vivo experiments and employing various metrics to quantify ULM angiography and velocity maps, we demonstrate that the TAL method consistently outperforms the reference LAT workflow. Moreover, when applied to DULM, TAL successfully extracts velocity variations along the cardiac cycle with improved repeatability. The findings of this work highlight the effectiveness of the TAL approach in overcoming the limitations of conventional LAT methods, providing enhanced ULM angiography and velocity imaging.</description>

Abstract: Imaging techniques such as functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and diffuse optical tomography (DOT) achieve deep, non-invasive sensing in turbid media, but they are constrained by the photon budget. Wavefront shaping (WFS) can enhance signal strength via interference at specific locations within scattering media, enhancing light-matter interactions and potentially extending the penetration depth of these techniques. Interpreting the resulting measurements rests on the knowledge of optical sensitivity - a relationship between detected signal changes and perturbations at a specific location inside the medium. However, conventional diffusion-based sensitivity models rely on assumptions that become invalid under coherent illumination. In this work, we develop a microscopic theory for optical sensitivity that captures the inherent interference effects that diffusion theory necessarily neglects. We analytically show that under random illumination, the microscopic and diffusive treatments coincide. Using our microscopic approach, we explore WFS strategies for enhancing optical sensitivity beyond the diffusive result. We demonstrate that the input state obtained through phase conjugation at a given point inside the system leads to the largest enhancement of optical sensitivity but requires an input wavefront that depends on the target position. In sharp contrast, the maximum remission eigenchannel leads to a global enhancement of the sensitivity map with a fixed input wavefront. This global enhancement equals to remission enhancement and preserves the spatial distribution of the sensitivity, making it compatible with existing DOT reconstruction algorithms. Our results establish the theoretical foundation for integrating wavefront control with diffuse optical imaging, enabling deeper tissue penetration through improved signal strength in biomedical applications.</description>
