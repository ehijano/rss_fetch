      <title>Financial Interactions and Capital Accumulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a series of precedent papers, we have presented a comprehensive methodology, termed Field Economics, for translating a standard economic model into a statistical field-formalism framework. This formalism requires a large number of heterogeneous agents, possibly of different types. It reveals the emergence of collective states among these agents or type of agents while preserving the interactions and microeconomic features of the system at the individual level. In two prior papers, we applied this formalism to analyze the dynamics of capital allocation and accumulation in a simple microeconomic framework of investors and firms.Building upon our prior work, the present paper refines the initial model by expanding its scope. Instead of considering financial firms investing solely in real sectors, we now suppose that financial agents may also invest in other financial firms. We also introduce banks in the system that act as investors with a credit multiplier. Two types of interaction are now considered within the financial sector: financial agents can lend capital to, or choose to buy shares of, other financial firms. Capital now flows between financial agents and is only partly invested in real sectors, depending on their relative returns. We translate this framework into our formalism and study the diffusion of capital and possible defaults in the system, both at the macro and micro level.At the macro level, we find that several collective states may emerge, each characterized by a distinct level of average capital and investors per sector. These collective states depend on external parameters such as level of connections between investors or firms' productivity.The multiplicity of possible collective states is the consequence of the nature of the system composed of interconnected heterogeneous agents. Several equivalent patterns of returns and portfolio allocation may emerge. The multiple collective states induce the unstable nature of financial markets, and some of them include defaults may emerge. At the micro level, we study the propagation of returns and defaults within a given collective state. Our findings highlight the significant role of banks, which can either stabilize the system through lending activities or propagate instability through loans to investors.</description>

      <title>Assessing the Impact of Case Correction Methods on the Fairness of COVID-19 Predictive Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the central difficulties of addressing the COVID-19 pandemic has been accurately measuring and predicting the spread of infections. In particular, official COVID-19 case counts in the United States are under counts of actual caseloads due to the absence of universal testing policies. Researchers have proposed a variety of methods for recovering true caseloads, often through the estimation of statistical models on more reliable measures, such as death and hospitalization counts, positivity rates, and demographics. However, given the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on marginalized racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic groups, it is important to consider potential unintended effects of case correction methods on these groups. Thus, we investigate two of these correction methods for their impact on a downstream COVID-19 case prediction task. For that purpose, we tailor an auditing approach and evaluation protocol to analyze the fairness of the COVID-19 prediction task by measuring the difference in model performance between majority-White counties and majority-minority counties. We find that one of the correction methods improves fairness, decreasing differences in performance between majority-White and majority-minority counties, while the other method increases differences, introducing bias. While these results are mixed, it is evident that correction methods have the potential to exacerbate existing biases in COVID-19 case data and in downstream prediction tasks. Researchers planning to develop or use case correction methods must be careful to consider negative effects on marginalized groups.</description>

      <title>Cosmic rays for imaging cultural heritage objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In cultural heritage conservation, it is increasingly common to rely on non-destructive imaging methods based on the absorption or scattering of photons ($X$ or $\gamma$ rays) or neutrons. However, physical and practical issues limit these techniques: their penetration depth may be insufficient for large and dense objects, they require transporting the objects of interest to dedicated laboratories, artificial radiation is hazardous and may induce activation in the material under study. Muons are elementary particles abundantly and freely produced in cosmic-ray interactions in the atmosphere. Their absorption and scattering in matter are characteristically dependent on the density and elemental composition of the material that they traverse, which offers the possibility of exploiting them for sub-surface remote imaging. This novel technique, nicknamed "muography", has been applied in use cases ranging from geophysics to archaeology to nuclear safety, but it has been so far under-explored for a vast category of cultural heritage objects that are relatively large (from decimeters to human size) and dense (stone, metals). The development of portable muon detectors makes muography particularly competitive in cases where the items to be analysed are not transportable, or set up in a confined environment. This document reviews the relevant literature, presents some exemplary use cases, and critically assesses the strengths and weaknesses of muography in this context.</description>

      <title>Quantifying national space heating flexibility potential at high spatial resolution with heating consumption data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decarbonizing the building stock in cold countries by replacing fossil fuel boilers with heat pumps is expected to drastically increase electricity demand. While heating flexibility could reduce the impact of additional demand from heat pumps on the power system, characterizing the national spatial distribution of heating flexibility capacity to incorporate into sophisticated power system models is challenging. This paper introduces a novel method for quantifying at large scale and high spatial resolution the energy capacity and duration of heating flexibility in existing building stock based on historical heating consumption and temperature data. This method can reflect the geographic diversity of the national building stock in sophisticated power system models. The proposed heating consumption-based method was tested in Britain using national residential gas data. The results demonstrate the potential of this approach to characterize the heterogeneous distribution of heating flexibility capacity at the national scale. Assuming a 3$^\circ$C temperature flexibility window, a total thermal energy storage capacity of 500 GWh$_{th}$ is identified in the British housing stock. For an illustrative cold weather COP value of 2.5, this thermal energy storage capacity is equivalent to 200 GWh of electricity storage. Regarding heating flexibility duration, gas-heated homes have a median of 5.9 heat-free hours for 20th percentile regional daily winter temperatures from 2010 to 2022. However, extreme cold days nearly halve flexibility duration to a median of 3.6 heat-free hours. These high spatial resolution energy capacity and self-discharge parameters can account for geographic diversity at the national scale and provide a new data-based layer of information for sophisticated power system models to support energy transition.</description>

      <title>Leader-Follower Identification with Vehicle-Following Calibration for Non-Lane-Based Traffic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most car-following models were originally developed for lane-based traffic. Over the past two decades, efforts have been made to calibrate car-following models for non-lane-based traffic. However, traffic conditions with varying vehicle dimensions, intermittent following, and multiple leaders often occur and make subjective Leader-Follower (LF) pair identification challenging. In this study, we analyze Vehicle Following (VF) behavior in traffic with a lack of lane discipline using high-resolution microscopic trajectory data collected in Chennai, India. The paper's main contributions are threefold. Firstly, three criteria are used to identify LF pairs from the driver's perspective, taking into account the intermittent following, lack of lane discipline due to consideration of lateral separation, and the presence of in-between vehicles. Second, the psycho-physical concept of the regime in the Wiedemann-99 model is leveraged to determine the traffic-dependent "influence zone" for LF identification. Third, a joint and consistent framework is proposed for identifying LF pairs and estimating VF parameters. The proposed methodology outperforms other heuristic-based LF identification methods from the literature in terms of quantitative and qualitative performance measures. The proposed approach can enable robust and more realistic LF identification and VF parameter calibration with practical applications such as LOS analysis, capacity, and travel time estimation.</description>

      <title>Understanding following patterns among high-performance athletes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Professional sports enhance interaction among athletes through training groups, sponsored events and competitions. Among these, the Olympic Games represent the largest competition with a global impact, providing the participants with a unique opportunity for interaction. We studied the following patterns among highly successful athletes to understand the structure of their interactions. We used the list of Olympic medallists in the Tokyo 2020 Games to extract their follower-followee network in Twitter, finding 7,326 connections among 964 athletes. The network displayed frequent connections to similar peers in terms of their features including sex, country and sport. We quantified the influence of these features in the followees choice through a gravity approach capturing the number of connections between homogeneous groups. Our research remarks the importance of datasets built from public exposure of professional athletes, serving as a proxy to investigate interesting aspects of many complex socio-cultural systems at different scales.</description>

      <title>Organizational Selection of Innovation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Budgetary constraints force organizations to pursue only a subset of possible innovation projects. Identifying which subset is most promising is an error-prone exercise, and involving multiple decision makers may be prudent. This raises the question of how to most effectively aggregate their collective nous. Our model of organizational portfolio selection provides some first answers. We show that portfolio performance can vary widely. Delegating evaluation makes sense when organizations employ the relevant experts and can assign projects to them. In most other settings, aggregating the impressions of multiple agents leads to better performance than delegation. In particular, letting agents rank projects often outperforms alternative aggregation rules -- including averaging agents' project scores as well as counting their approval votes -- especially when organizations have tight budgets and can select only a few project alternatives out of many.</description>

      <title>On the initial value of PageRank</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.00004</link>
      <description>arXiv:1609.00004v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Google employs PageRank to rank web pages, determining the order in which search results are presented to users based on their queries. PageRank is primarily utilized for directed networks, although there are instances where it is also applied to undirected networks. In this paper, we have applied PageRank to undirected networks, showing that a vertex's PageRank relies on its initial value, often referred to as an intrinsic, non-network contribution. We have analytically proved that when the initial value of vertices is either proportional to their degrees or set to zero, the PageRank values of the vertices become directly proportional to their degrees. Simulated and empirical data are employed to bolster our research findings. Additionally, we have investigated the impact of initial values on PageRank localization.</description>

      <title>Interpersonal trust: Asymptotic analysis of a stochastic coordination game with multi-agent learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03894v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the interpersonal trust of a population of agents, asking whether chance may decide if a population ends up in a high trust or low trust state. We model this by a discrete time, random matching stochastic coordination game. Agents are endowed with an exponential smoothing learning rule about the behaviour of their neighbours. We find that, with probability one in the long run the whole population either always cooperates or always defects. By simulation we study the impact of the distributions of the payoffs in the game and of the exponential smoothing learning (memory of the agents). We find, that as the agent memory increases or as the size of the population increases, the actual dynamics start to resemble the expectation of the process. We conclude that it is indeed possible that different populations may converge upon high or low trust between its citizens simply by chance, though the game parameters (context of the society) may be quite telling.</description>

      <title>Dynamical behavior and optimal control of a stochastic SAIRS epidemic model with two saturated incidences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09982v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stochastic models are widely used to investigate the spread of epidemics in a complex environment. This paper extends a deterministic SAIRS epidemic model to a stochastic case with limited patient capacity and exposure. We first study the dynamical properties of the model under certain conditions, including persistence, extinction, and ergodic. Then, we introduce vaccination and isolation into the model as control variables. The optimal control strategies are obtained based on the Pontryagin minimum principle. Finally, numerical simulations are given to illustrate our theoretical results.</description>
