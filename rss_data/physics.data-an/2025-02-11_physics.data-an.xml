      <title>Impact of Tracking Resolutions on $\phi$-Meson Spin Alignment Measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measurements of global spin alignment of vector mesons in relativistic heavy-ion collisions can provide unique insights into spin-orbit interactions and vector meson dynamics in the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) produced in those collisions. The global spin alignment is measured by the $00^{\rm th}$ coefficient of the spin density matrix, $\rho_{00}$, via the polar angle ($\theta^{*}$) of the decay-daughter momentum in the parent rest frame with respect to the direction of the orbital angular momentum of the collision. Such measurements are affected by the angular and momentum resolutions of the reconstructed tracks in the experiment. Such effects are nontrivial because of kinematic complications caused by the boost to the parent rest frame, and could be important given that the global spin alignment signal is weak. In this paper, we investigate the effects of experimental tracking resolutions on measurements of the $\phi$(1020) meson $\rho_{00}$. We study these effects for two methods of $\rho_{00}$ measurements, the conventional method analyzing the $\phi$-meson yield versus $\cos^2 \theta^*$ and the invariant mass ($m_{\rm inv}$) method utilizing $\langle\cos^2\theta^*\rangle$ versus $m_{\rm inv}$. Using typical resolution values from experiments, we find that the effect of track resolution on $\rho_{00}$ is small, well within typical measurement uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Invariant Measures for Data-Driven Dynamical System Identification: Analysis and Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel approach for performing dynamical system identification, based upon the comparison of simulated and observed physical invariant measures. While standard methods adopt a Lagrangian perspective by directly treating time-trajectories as inference data, we take on an Eulerian perspective and instead seek models fitting the observed global time-invariant statistics. With this change in perspective, we gain robustness against pervasive challenges in system identification including noise, chaos, and slow sampling. In the first half of this paper, we pose the system identification task as a partial differential equation (PDE) constrained optimization problem, in which synthetic stationary solutions of the Fokker-Planck equation, obtained as fixed points of a finite-volume discretization, are compared to physical invariant measures extracted from observed trajectory data. In the latter half of the paper, we improve upon this approach in two crucial directions. First, we develop a Galerkin-inspired modification to the finite-volume surrogate model, based on data-adaptive unstructured meshes and Monte-Carlo integration, enabling the approach to efficiently scale to high-dimensional problems. Second, we leverage Takens' seminal time-delay embedding theory to introduce a critical data-dependent coordinate transformation which can guarantee unique system identifiability from the invariant measure alone. This contribution resolves a major challenge of system identification through invariant measures, as systems exhibiting distinct transient behaviors may still share the same time-invariant statistics in their state-coordinates. Throughout, we present comprehensive numerical tests which highlight the effectiveness of our approach on a variety of challenging system identification tasks.</description>

      <title>Distribution of singular values in large sample cross-covariance matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For two large matrices ${\mathbf X}$ and ${\mathbf Y}$ with Gaussian i.i.d.\ entries and dimensions $T\times N_X$ and $T\times N_Y$, respectively, we derive the probability distribution of the singular values of $\mathbf{X}^T \mathbf{Y}$ in different parameter regimes. This extends the Marchenko-Pastur result for the distribution of eigenvalues of empirical sample covariance matrices to singular values of empirical cross-covariances. Our results will help to establish statistical significance of cross-correlations in many data-science applications.</description>

      <title>ParquetDB: A Lightweight Python Parquet-Based Database</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional data storage formats and databases often introduce complexities and inefficiencies that hinder rapid iteration and adaptability. To address these challenges, we introduce ParquetDB, a Python-based database framework that leverages the Parquet file format's optimized columnar storage. ParquetDB offers efficient serialization and deserialization, native support for complex and nested data types, reduced dependency on indexing through predicate pushdown filtering, and enhanced portability due to its file-based storage system. Benchmarks show that ParquetDB outperforms traditional databases like SQLite and MongoDB in managing large volumes of data, especially when using data formats compatible with PyArrow. We validate ParquetDB's practical utility by applying it to the Alexandria 3D Materials Database, efficiently handling approximately 4.8 million complex and nested records. By addressing the inherent limitations of existing data storage systems and continuously evolving to meet future demands, ParquetDB has the potential to significantly streamline data management processes and accelerate research development in data-driven fields.</description>

      <title>Topological Time Frequency Analysis of Functional Brain Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel topological framework for analyzing functional brain signals using time-frequency analysis. By integrating persistent homology with time-frequency representations, we capture multi-scale topological features that characterize the dynamic behavior of brain activity. This approach identifies 0D (connected components) and 1D (loops) topological structures in the signal's time-frequency domain, enabling robust extraction of features invariant to noise and temporal misalignments. The proposed method is demonstrated on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, showcasing its ability to discern critical topological patterns and provide insights into functional connectivity. This topological approach opens new avenues for analyzing complex brain signals, offering potential applications in neuroscience and clinical diagnostics.</description>

      <title>Data-driven assessment of optimal spatiotemporal resolutions for information extraction in noisy time series data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13741v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In general, comprehension of any type of complex system depends on the resolution used to examine the phenomena occurring within it. However, identifying a priori, for example, the best time frequencies/scales to study a certain system over-time, or the spatial distances at which correlations, symmetries, and fluctuations are, most often non-trivial. Here we describe an unsupervised approach that, starting solely from the data of a system, allows learning the characteristic length scales of the dominant key events/processes and the optimal spatiotemporal resolutions to characterize them. We tested this approach on time series data obtained from simulation or experimental trajectories of various example many-body complex systems ranging from the atomic to the macroscopic scale and having diverse internal dynamic complexities. Our method automatically analyzes the system data by analyzing correlations at all relevant inter-particle distances and at all possible inter-frame intervals in which their time series can be subdivided, namely, at all space and time resolutions. The optimal spatiotemporal resolution for studying a certain system thus maximizes information extraction and classification from the system's data, which we prove to be related to the characteristic spatiotemporal length scales of the local/collective physical events dominating it. This approach is broadly applicable and can be used to optimize the study of different types of data (static distributions, time series, or signals). The concept of 'optimal resolution' has a general character and provides a robust basis for characterizing any type of system based on its data, as well as to guide data analysis in general.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal projections of hypercubes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10257v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Projections of hypercubes have been applied to visualize high-dimensional binary state spaces in various scientific fields. Conventional methods for projecting hypercubes, however, face practical difficulties. Manual methods require nontrivial adjustments of the projection basis, while optimization-based algorithms limit the interpretability and reproducibility of the resulting plots. These limitations motivate us to explore theoretically analyzable projection algorithms such as principal component analysis (PCA). Here, we investigate the mathematical properties of PCA-projected hypercubes. Our numerical and analytical results show that PCA effectively captures polarized distributions within the hypercubic state space. This property enables the assessment of the asymptotic distribution of projected vertices and error bounds, which characterize the performance of PCA in the projected space. We demonstrate the application of PCA to visualize the hypercubic energy landscapes of Ising spin systems. By adding projected hypercubic edges, these visualizations reveal pathways of correlated spin flips. Our work provides a better understanding of how PCA discovers hidden patterns in high-dimensional binary data.</description>

      <title>4D-ONIX: A deep learning approach for reconstructing 3D movies from sparse X-ray projections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09508v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The X-ray flux provided by X-ray free-electron lasers and storage rings offers new spatiotemporal possibilities to study in-situ and operando dynamics, even using single pulses of such facilities. X-ray Multi-Projection Imaging (XMPI) is a novel technique that enables volumetric information using single pulses of such facilities and avoids centrifugal forces induced by state-of-the-art time-resolved 3D methods such as time-resolved tomography. As a result, XMPI offers the potential to acquire 3D movies (4D) at least three orders of magnitude faster than current methods. However, it is exceptionally challenging to reconstruct 4D from highly sparse projections as acquired by XMPI with current algorithms. Here, we present 4D-ONIX, a Deep Learning (DL)-based approach that learns to reconstruct 3D movies (4D) from an extremely limited number of projections. It combines the computational physical model of X-ray interaction with matter and state-of-the-art DL methods. We demonstrate the potential of 4D-ONIX to generate high-quality 4D by generalizing over multiple experiments with only two to three projections per timestamp for binary droplet collisions and additive manufacturing. We envision that 4D-ONIX will become an enabling tool for 4D analysis, offering new spatiotemporal resolutions to study processes not possible before.</description>

      <title>Marine spatial planning techniques with a case study on wave-powered offshore aquaculture farms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11926v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As emerging marine technologies lead to the development of new infrastructure across the ocean, they enter an environment that existing ecosystems and industries already rely on. Although necessary to provide sustainable sources of energy and food, careful planning will be important to make informed decisions and avoid conflicts. This paper examines several techniques used for marine spatial planning, an approach for analyzing and planning the use of marine resources. Using open source software including QGIS and Python, the potential for developing wave-powered offshore aquaculture farms using the RM3 wave energy converter along the Northeast coast of the United States is assessed and several feasible sites are identified. The optimal site, located at 43.7{\deg}N, 68.9{\deg}W along the coast of Maine, has a total cost for a 5-pen farm of \$56.8M, annual fish yield of 676 tonnes, and a levelized cost of fish of \$9.23 per kilogram. Overall trends indicate that the cost greatly decreases with distance to shore due to the greater availability of wave energy and that conflicts and environmental constraints significantly limit the number of feasible sites in this region.</description>

      <title>Doppler correlation-driven vetoes for the Frequency Hough analysis in continuous gravitational-wave searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19420v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an improved method for vetoing candidates of continuous gravitational-wave sources during all-sky searches utilizing the Frequency Hough pipeline. This approach leverages linear correlations between source parameters induced by the Earth Doppler effect, which can be effectively identified through the Hough Transform. Candidates that do not align with these patterns are considered spurious and can thus be vetoed, enhancing the depth and statistical significance of follow-up analyses. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive explanation of the method calibration, which intrinsically linked to the total duration of the observing run. On average, the procedure successfully vetoes $56\%$ of candidates. To assess the method performance, we conducted a Monte-Carlo simulation injecting fake continuous-wave signals into data from the third observing run of the LIGO detectors. This analysis allowed us to infer strain amplitude upper limits at a $90\%$ confidence level. We found that the optimal sensitivity is $h_0^{90\%} = 3.62^{+0.23}_{-0.22}\times 10^{-26}$ in the [128, 200] Hz band, which is within the most sensible frequency band of the LIGO detectors.</description>
