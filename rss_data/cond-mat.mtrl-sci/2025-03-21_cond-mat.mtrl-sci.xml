      <title>Non-equilibrium Capacitance Loss in EDLC Based on Ion Flux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the loss of non-equilibrium capacitance in the electric double layer capacitor (EDLC) during continuous charging compared to equilibrium capacitance is crucial for the design of high-rate energy storage devices. Due to three major challenges, including strong ion correlations induced by high concentrations at the interface, the difficulty in representing far from equilibrium, and numerical stability issues, current numerical simulations of ion distribution based on statistical mechanics struggle to achieve long-term accurate modeling under realistic parameters. Since non-equilibrium capacitance loss is a universal macroscopic phenomenon in EDLC, which exists independently of the microscopic model of the electrolyte, this study starts from macroscopic non-equilibrium phenomena, introduces a novel perspective centered on ion flux (IF) for the first time. By deriving the relationship among the charging current, IF, and displacement current, a novel capacitance model based on IF is first established. It is further demonstrated that the current relationship and voltage relationship of EDLC, when represented by conventional circuit models, exhibit inherent contradictions. Therefore, a new interpretative framework is proposed, wherein IF and displacement current are analogized to acceleration and deformation in an elastic medium, respectively. Inspired by this insight, this study reveals that the decrease in non-equilibrium capacitance with increasing charging current originates from the inherent resistance of IF to external charging. This tendency to restore equilibrium is the fundamental cause of non-equilibrium capacitance loss.</description>

      <title>An improved peridynamic framework to eliminate unphysical stress and fictitious yield at geometry surface for geomaterials elastoplastic deformation and fracture analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an improved non-ordinary state-based peridynamics (NOSB PD) framework for modelling the elastoplastic behaviour and damage of geomaterials, such as soil, rock, and concrete, under quasi static conditions. Conventional NOSB PD for elastoplastic materials faces two primary challenges: the surface effect due to the low accuracy of the approximate deformation gradient (FPD) near boundaries and fictitious yielding during explicit time integration. These issues can lead to numerical errors, such as inaccurate crack predictions and potential simulation failure. The proposed framework thoroughly analyses the reason for the surface effect by demonstrating that FPD exhibits only first order accuracy within a horizon radius (delta) from the surface but introduces residual stresses within a larger range of 2 delta with significant surface effect. To mitigate this, a divergence formulation of the non-local differential operator (NDO) is applied to enforce a reasonable stress gradient within a 2 delta subregion, alongside a traction boundary condition consistent with the divergence of stress. Additionally, a loading balance correction algorithm is introduced to enhance the conventional explicit time integration process. The model is validated by integrating it with a modified hyperbolic-hardening Drucker-Prager model, where the stress integration is performed using the closest point projection method (CMMP). Numerical results, compared with finite element simulations and experimental data, demonstrate the effective elimination of the surface effect and false yielding, providing a robust simulation of elastoplastic deformation and progressive failure in geomaterials.</description>

      <title>Tailoring the Electronic Structure of Ni(111) by Alloying with Sb Ad-Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface alloying can alter surface electronic and magnetic properties, which are key parameters when developing new materials tailored for specific applications. A magnetic surface alloy was formed by depositing Sb on Ni(111) at elevated temperatures, yielding new electronic states at the Fermi level and modifying the Ni-derived bandstructure. In particular, it changed the electron occupancy of the spin-polarized surface resonance bands, which may affect the magnetic properties of the surface and its associated many-body effects. By fitting a finite element model to angle-dependent core level measurements, similar amounts of Sb and Ni were found within the first few atomic layers to indicate a near-surface composition similar to the bulk alloy NiSb. Annealing to higher temperatures post-growth further improved the crystalline quality of the surface. Our investigation of the surface alloy's crystallinity, chemical composition, and layer structure lays the basis for future studies of how its electronic and magnetic properties can be modified.</description>

      <title>Functionalized Cr$_2$C MXenes: Novel Magnetic Semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report an \textit{ab initio} investigation of functionalized and 3$d$-electrons doped Cr$_2$C MXenes. Upon functionalization, the Cr$_2$C becomes chemically, dynamically, and mechanically stable, and it exhibits magnetic semiconducting behavior. Cr$_2$CF$_2$ stands out as a wide band gap semiconductor, possessing super exchange interaction mediated by F atoms within the layer, however, the applied strain transforms it from an indirect to a direct band gap semiconductor. Strong spin-phonon coupling found in Cr$_2$CH$_2$ is supported by the distorted Cr spin density due to hydrogen environment. Two magnon branches, associated with two sub-lattice spins, are found in the ferromagnetic Cr$_2$CO$_2$ and antiferromagnetic Cr$_2$CF$_2$. Depending on the types of 3$d$-electron dopants and functionalization, Cr$_2$C MXenes (except for Cr$_2$CO$_2$) change from the indirect band gap magnetic semiconductor to different states of electronic and magnetic matter including exotic direct band gap magnetic bipolar semiconductor. In addition, we reveal a band inversion between the two highest valence bands in the Fe-doped Cr$_2$CCl$_2$.</description>

      <title>Collapse of the standard ferromagnetic domain structure in hybrid Co/Molecule bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that, upon the chemisorption of organic molecules, Co thin films display a number of unique magnetic properties, including the giant magnetic hardening and the violation of the Rayleigh law in magnetization reversal. These novel properties originate from the modification of the surface magnetic anisotropy induced by the molecule/film interaction: the {\pi}-d molecule/metal hybridization modifies the orbital population of the associated cobalt atoms and induces an additional and randomly oriented local anisotropy. Strong effects arise when the induced surface anisotropy is correlated over scales of a few molecules, and particularly when the correlation length of the random anisotropy field is comparable to the characteristic exchange length. This leads to the collapse of the standard domain structure and to the emergency of a glassy-type ferromagnetic state, defined by blurred pseudo-domains intertwined by diffuse and irregular domain walls. The magnetization reversal in such state was predicted to include topological vortex-like structures, successfully measured in this research by magnetic-force microscopy. Our work shows how the strong electronic interaction of standard components, Co thin films and readily available molecules, can generate structures with remarkable new magnetic properties, and thus opens a new avenue for the design of tailored-on-demand magnetic composites.</description>

      <title>Diverse electronic topography in a distorted kagome metal LaTi3Bi4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent reports on a family of kagome metals of the form LnTi3Bi4 (Ln = Lanthanide) has stoked interest due to the combination of highly anisotropic magnetism and a rich electronic structure. The electronic structure near the Fermi level is proposed to exhibit Dirac points and van Hove singularities. In this manuscript, we use angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements in combination with density functional theory calculations to investigate the electronic structure of a newly discovered kagome metal LaTi3Bi4. Our results reveal multiple van Hove singularities (VHSs) with one VHS located in the vicinity of the Fermi level. We clearly observe two flat bands, which originate from the destructive interference of wave functions within the Ti kagome motif. These flat bands and VHSs originate from Ti d orbitals and are very responsive to the polarization of the incident beam. We notice a significant anisotropy in the electronic structure, resulting from the breaking of six fold rotational symmetry in this material. Our findings demonstrate this new family of Ti based kagome material as a promising platform to explore novel emerging phenomena in the wider LnTi3Bi4 (Ln= lanthanide) family of materials.</description>

      <title>High-throughput Discovery of Anti-gap Semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional semiconductors typically have bonding states near the valence band maximum (VBM) and antibonding states near the conduction band minimum (CBM). Semiconductors with the opposite electronic configuration, namely an antibonding VBM and a bonding CBM, are here termed ``anti-gap semiconductors". They have been theoretically proposed to exhibit excellent optoelectronic properties because of their strong tolerance to defects. However, no anti-gap semiconductors have been identified so far, despite a known list of semiconductors with an antibonding VBM. Here, we use high-throughput computation to identify over 100 anti-gap semiconductors. From this group, we analyze the transition metal dichalcogenide MX$_2$ (M=Hf, Zr; X=S, Se) family in detail. In addition to verifying their defect tolerance for both electrons and holes using first-principles simulations, we also discovered that photoexcitation of charge carriers can lead to significant lattice stiffening and increased thermal conductivity in anti-gap semiconductors, which can be potentially used as photo-driven thermal switches. Our work analyzes the formation of the anti-gap electronic structure and showcases their unusual photoinduced lattice dynamics that can have a potential impact on their photophysical applications.</description>

      <title>Photocatalytic Carbon Dioxide Methanation by High-Entropy Oxides: Significance of Work Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Methane (CH4) formation from photocatalytic carbon dioxide (CO2) conversion in water is currently of interest because methane is a fuel, and it can also be transformed into other useful hydrocarbons. However, achieving high selectivity to produce methane remains a challenge because of the large number of contributing electrons (eight) in methanation. High-entropy oxides present a new pathway to tune the catalyst selectivity by arranging various cations in the lattice. This study aims to clarify the selectivity for methane formation in high-entropy photocatalysts containing hybrid d0 + d10 orbital configuration. Several oxides are designed and synthesized which have a base of 3-4 cations with d0 orbital configuration (titanium and zirconium with a valence of 4, and niobium and tantalum with a valence of 5) and incorporate 1-2 elements with d10 orbital configuration (zinc, gallium, indium, bismuth and copper). Results demonstrate that adding elements with a d10 electronic configuration is effective for methane formation, while the selectivity toward methanation is enhanced by increasing the work function of the d10 cations. Selectivity levels over 50% are achieved using these oxides, suggesting a potential strategy for designing new catalysts for methanation.</description>

      <title>Optical control of the moir\'e twist angle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Moir\'e multilayers offer a promising platform for engineering diverse functionalities in a single material via twist angle control. However, achieving reliable, high-precision control of the twist angle remains challenging. In this theoretical work, we propose an all-optical method for fast, precise manipulation of two-dimensional multilayers by transferring orbital angular momentum from phase-structured light (e.g. vortex beams) to a 2D material flake. We model the light-matter interaction, analyze the twist dynamics, and develop a phase diagram for optical twist angle switching -- transition to a neighboring metastable twist angle -- by mapping the system onto an impulsively forced nonlinear pendulum. Aided by pairwise classical potential estimates for the interlayer energy and numerical simulation, we demonstrate the feasibility of our approach with hexagonal boron nitride bilayers and extend the results to dichalcogenides with first-principles calculations. Our findings reveal a rich dynamical response -- from single-pulse twist angle control to high-order quasistable orbits pointing toward periodically driven chaotic dynamics -- and suggest a pathway for all-optical measurement of the twist potential energy. These results can be generalized to other 2D multilayers, paving the way for scalable and customizable moir\'e electronics and photonics.</description>

      <title>Influence of structural disorder on magnetic properties and electronic structure of YCo$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the changes of magnetic properties with increasing disorder in the exchange enhanced Pauli paramagnet YCo$_2$ are discussed. The structural disorder is initially introduced by rapid quenching, while further changes on micro-/nanoscale are caused by a high pressure torsion (HPT). Values of the magnetic moment determined for the plastically deformed ribbons reach 0.10 $\mu_B$/Co atom (for a sample subjected to the deformation at a pressure of 4 GPa) and 0.25 $\mu_B$/Co (6 GPa) at 2 K. Magnetic moment arise not only from the surface of nanocrystals but also from volume. Ab initio calculations explained the influence of chemical disorder and different types of structural defects on the electronic structure and magnetic properties of YCo2-based Laves phases. The calculated magnetic ground states are in qualitative agreement with experimental results for all considered structures with point defects.</description>

      <title>Normal and inverse magnetocaloric effects in structurally disordered Laves phase Y$_{1-x}$Gd$_{x}$Co$_{2}$ (0 $\leq$ x $\leq$ 1) compounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic and magnetocaloric properties of Y$_{1-x}$Gd$_{x}$Co$_{2}$ compounds, where x = 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 and 1.0, were investigated experimentally and theoretically. Crystal structures were characterized by X-ray diffraction (Rietveld analysis) and investigated samples possess the MgCu$_{2}$-type single phase with Fd-3m space group. Melt-spinning process introduced a chemical and topological disorder, which directly affected the magnetic properties. Refrigerant capacity (RC), strictly connected to the full width at half maximum $\delta$TFWHM of the $\Delta$S$_M$(T) curve and the maximum of magnetic entropy changes $\Delta$S$_{Mpk}$(T)(T,$\Delta$H), increases from 29 to 148 J/kg with replacement of Y by Gd atoms from x = 0.2 to x = 0.8. RC and $\delta$TFWHM indicate the presence of disorder. Temperature dependences of magnetic entropy change $\Delta$S$_M$(T,$\Delta$H) and RC were measured in as-quenched and annealed state for Y$_{0.4}$Gd$_{0.6}$Co$_{2}$. This particular composition was chosen for detailed investigation mainly due to its Curie point (T$_C$ = 282 K), which is close to the room temperature. After isothermal annealing ($\tau_a$ = 60 min, Ta = 700$^o$C) RC decreased from 122 to 104 J/kg, which clearly indicates the homogenization of the heat treated sample. Furthermore, observed inverse magnetocaloric effect is associated with the presence of antiferromagnetically coupled Gd and Co magnetic moments. The phase transition temperature increases with increasing Gd content from 74 to 407 K for Y$_{0.8}$Gd$_{0.2}$Co$_{2}$ and GdCo2, respectively. Within the FPLO-LDA DFT method, the non-magnetic ground state for YCo$_{2}$ and the magnetic ground state for GdCo$_{2}$ are predicted in agreement with experiment. The dependence of calculated total and species-resolved magnetic moments on Gd concentration reasonably agrees with available experimental data.</description>

      <title>Induced magnetic ordering in alloyed compounds based on Pauli paramagnet YCo$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intermetallic YCo$_2$ compound is a Pauli exchange-enhanced paramagnet. Structural and magnetic properties of rapidly quenched YCo$_2$ and YCo$_2$ alloyed with Nb or Ti are presented. Samples produced by melt spinning have been characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM). The samples crystallize in MgCu$_2$-type phase with lattice constant a changing from 7.223 A for YCo$_2$, through 7.213 A for Y$_{0.9}$Nb$_{0.1}$Co$_2$ to 7.192 A for Y$_{0.9}$Ti$_{0.1}$Co$_2$, where Y atoms are replaced by Nb or Ti atoms. Nanocrystalline phases can be produced by appropriate cooling rates for the solidification process. By the synthesis process free volumes, vacancies, and alloyed atoms are introduced into the YCo$_2$ intermetallic. Ab-initio calculations have been performed to investigate the effects of substitution on the spin-split electronic band structure in the ordered YCo$_2$. A ferrimagnetic ground state is found in the alloyed systems with substitution on the Y-site which is energetically favorable compared to point defects on Co-sites. However, the experimentally found increased magnetic ordering in alloyed YCo$_2$ appears to be based on microstructure effects.</description>

      <title>1-Adamantanamine implementation in surface engineering of biomimetic PVDF-based membranes for enhanced membrane distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Membrane distillation (MD) stands at the forefront of desalination technology, harnessing the power of phase change to separate water vapor from saline using minimal energy resources efficiently. In response to this challenge, membranes with tuned pores morphology and surface chemistry with biomimetic 3D pine-like structures with improved affinity to water (desalination) and/or hazardous VOC (VOC removal) were developed and studied systematically. By implementing VIPS-PVDF membranes and a green modifier of 1-adamantanamine for the first time, membranes with a revolutionary network architecture were generated. The modifier was introduced either physically to the polymeric matrix or chemically through covalent attachment onto the surface and inside the porous structure. As a result, membranes that defy wetting under extreme hydrostatic pressures (&gt;11.5 bar) were produced while preserving unparalleled vapor transport efficiency. The 1-adamantanamine promotes transport and enhances the affinity to the VOC, ensuring excellent membrane performance at different applications of the MD process. Transport was enhanced more than 3.6 times and separation factor beta changed from 3.48 to 15.22 for MTBE removal and from 2.0 to 3.46 for EtOH removal when comparing pristine PVDF with membrane chemically modified with 1-adamantanamine (PVDF_Ch02). The process separation index during the MTBE removal changed from 20 kg m-2 h-1 (PVDF) to 297 kg m-2 h-1 (PVDF_Ch02). All materials were highly stable and durable during the MD applications. This innovative approach not only revolutionizes desalination but also holds immense promise for diverse applications beyond, particularly in the realm of wastewater treatment. A study of the icing process on a cold plate with new membranes provided deeper insight into the icing mechanism and the role of membrane LEP in it.</description>

      <title>Lithium doping's effects on the microstructural,dielectric,energy storage,optical and electrical properties of BaTi0.89Sn0.11O3 ceramics</title>

Abstract: This research study the sol/gel synthesis of lithium-doped barium stannate titanate BaTi0.89Sn0.11O3 (BTS11) and investigates how varying composition with lithium affect its structural, morphological, ferroelectric, optical, and electrical properties. The phase of the sol/gel prepared samples with different compositions BaLixTi0.89Sn0.11O3 (BLxTS11), where x = 0%, 2%, 4%, 6%, 8, and 10%, was examined using X-ray diffraction (XRD), which showed the development of a pure perovskite structure. Furthermore, structural characterization was performed with Raman spectroscopy to identify changes in structure and chemical environment resulting from Li incorporation. The doping caused changes in the morphology and grain size of BLxTS11 pellets, as examined through SEM micrographs. These micrographs showed clear alterations in grain size that were inversely related to the lattice strain of BLxTS11. The samples were subsequently examined for their ferroelectric properties. All samples exhibited their maximum dielectric constant at approximately 45-50 {\deg}C. Furthermore, relationships between the chemical, structural, and morphological characteristics of the BLxTS11 ceramics and their energy storage capabilities were identified. Based on the P-E hysteresis behavior, the BL6TS11 ceramic (x=6%) ferroelectric exhibited superior energy-storage capabilities, featuring a recoverable energy-storage density of 225 mJ/cm3 and an energy-storage efficiency of 60%. An examination of the material's optical and electrical properties revealed that Li doping led to a reduction in the band gap values and a considerable increase in resistivity.</description>

      <title>Machine-learning potentials for structurally and chemically complex MAB phases: strain hardening and ripplocation-mediated plasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Though offering unprecedented pathways to molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of technologically-relevant materials and conditions, machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) are typically trained for ``simple'' materials and properties with minor size effects. Our study of MAB phases (MABs) - alternating transition metal boride (MB) and group A element layers - exemplifies that MLIPs for complex materials can be fitted and used in a high-throughput fashion: for predicting structural and mechanical properties across a large chemical/phase/temperature space. Considering group 4-6 transition metal based MABs, with A=Al and the 222, 212, and 314 type phases, three MLIPs are trained and tested, including lattice and elastic constants calculations at temperatures $T\in\{0,300,1200\}$ K, extrapolation grade and energy (force, stress) error analysis for $\approx{3\cdot10^6}$ ab initio MD snapshots. Subsequently, nanoscale tensile tests serve to quantify upper limits of strength and toughness attainable in single-crystal MABs at 300~K as well as their temperature evolution. In-plane tensile deformation is characterised by relatively high strength, {110}$\langle001\rangle$ type slipping, and failure by shear banding. The response to [001] loading is softer, triggers work hardening, and failure by kinking and layer delamination. Furthermore, W$_2$AlB$_2$ able to retard fracture via ripplocations and twinning from 300 up to 1200~K.</description>

      <title>A Novel Tool for Advanced Analysis of Geant4 Simulations of Charged Particles Interactions in Oriented Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel Python tool for the analysis of Geant4 simulations that enhances our understanding of coherent phenomena occurring during the interaction of charged particles with crystal planes. This tool compares the total energy of particles with the potential energy inside crystal channels, enabling a complete examination of coherent effects. By tracking the particle trajectory and classifying the dynamics at each simulation step, it provides deeper insights into how different phenomena contribute to both radiation and particle deflection. This tool can be used to improve crystal-based extraction methods and the development of gamma-ray sources using crystals.</description>

      <title>Effect of Accelerated Thermal Degradation of Poly(Vinyl Chloride): The Case of Unplasticized PVC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The thermal degradation of unplasticized poly(vinyl chloride), PVC, was comprehensively investigated through the application of spectroscopic techniques, as well as contact angle measurements (CA), dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), and size-exclusion chromatography (SEC). To study the effect of relative humidity (RH) on the deterioration of unplasticized PVC, two regimes of accelerated degradation experiments were selected: low RH (max. 30% RH) and high RH = 60% levels, which corresponds to usually the highest RH in heritage institutions equipped with an HVAC system. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) did not reveal any significant changes in the material during its degradation up to 20 weeks at temperatures ranging from 60{\deg}C to 80{\deg}C. Notable changes were observed in the Raman and UV-Vis spectra, indicative of the formation of conjugated carbon-carbon double bonds. The formation of polyenes was responsible for the yellowing of samples. Notwithstanding, the aforementioned changes did not lead to a notable decline in the mechanical properties, as evidenced by DMA and SEC measurements. EPR measurements demonstrated the formation of 2 radicals at 60{\deg}C, and in the sample degraded at 80{\deg}C the presence of radicals was evident. This indicates that a radical degradation mechanism cannot be excluded even at such low temperatures.</description>

      <title>Modulation of Charge Transport and Rectification Behavior in CsSnI3 Thin Films Through A-site Cation Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CsSnI3 perovskite is a promising thin-film semiconductor with high intrinsic conductivity for various device applications (thermoelectric, photovoltaics, etc.). Stoichiometric CsSnI3 owns high-density of defects and structural imperfections affecting device performance. In this work, we made an investigation on A-site cation engineering to evaluate the correlation between structural and transport parameters for effective operation in rectifying devices. Here, we analyzed CsSnI3 thin films modified with methylamine (MA), formamidine(FA), guanidine(GuA) and 5-ammonium valeric acid (AVA) cations, correlating structural parameters obtained by Rietveld refinement with their optoelectronic and diode characteristics. MA-, FA-, and GuA-substituted films exhibited low sheet resistance (450-2200 Ohm per sq). However, strain-induced lattice distortions and accumulated defects in GuA-substituted films significantly hindered effective charge collection and increased recombination losses. AVA substitution formed low-conductivity 2D interlayers, dramatically increasing resistance (105 Ohm per sq) and altering transient response characteristics, yet provided minimal reverse-switching losses (100 uW per cm2), beneficial for high-frequency applications. FA substitution emerged as optimal, balancing structural stability, conductivity, minimal defects, and superior diode properties. The obtained results highlight that targeted lattice modifications strongly influence the practical performance of rectifying p-i-n diodes based on CsSnI3.</description>

      <title>BaZrS$_\text{3}$ Lights Up: The Interplay of Electrons, Photons, and Phonons in Strongly Luminescent Single Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chalcogenide perovskites have emerged as a promising class of materials for the next generation of optoelectronic applications, with BaZrS$_\text{3}$ attracting significant attention due to its wide bandgap, earth-abundant composition, and thermal and chemical stability. However, previous studies have consistently reported weak and ambiguous photoluminescence (PL), regardless of synthesis method, raising questions about the intrinsic optoelectronic quality of this compound. In this work, we demonstrate strong, band-to-band-dominated PL at room temperature in high-quality BaZrS$_\text{3}$ single crystals. Using multiwavelength excitation and polarization-dependent Raman spectroscopy, along with first-principles lattice dynamics calculations, we identify all 23 theoretically predicted Raman-active modes and their symmetries, providing a comprehensive reference for future studies. Despite the narrow, single-component PL emission band, time-resolved PL measurements reveal a carrier lifetime of $1.0\pm0.2$ ns. We correlate the short carrier lifetimes with the presence of phonon-assisted carrier decay and strong electron-phonon coupling as evidenced from our DFT and Raman results. Whether compositional variations or partial cation/anion substitutions could mitigate electron-phonon coupling and enhance carrier lifetimes remains an open question. By providing a detailed reference for the intrinsic vibrational and optoelectronic properties of BaZrS$_\text{3}$, this work paves the way for further advancements in chalcogenide perovskites for energy and optoelectronic technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discover a rare structural manifestation of the Goldstone paradigm in a hexagonal polytype of the archetypal ferroelectric BaTiO3. First-principles calculations confirm the Goldstone character of the order parameter, and high-resolution diffraction measurements link this to a quasi-continuous domain texture in the vicinity of the low-temperature phase transitions. Our findings highlight how changes in structural topology may be exploited to realize rich polar topologies in bulk ferroelectric perovskites.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics-guided Numerical Modeling for Direct Reduction of Iron Ore Pellets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct reduction of iron using hydrogen-rich gas is rapidly emerging as a key strategy for green steel production. This process involves complex, multiscale phenomena, encompassing solid-state phase transformations and gas transport through pores, that must be accurately represented for predictive industrial implementation. Here, we present a thermodynamically sound pellet-scale model that describes these mechanisms and can serve as a foundation for improving the understanding of pellet reduction kinetics in H$_2$/CO-containing atmospheres. The model assumes that the gas phase remains in thermodynamic equilibrium, meaning that the composition of the gas instantaneously adjusts to any changes in the system. This reduces the number of fitting parameters drastically compared to other existing models, while maintaining a strict thermodynamic upper bound estimate. A driving force term is included in the reaction rate equation based on the partial pressure of O$_2$ in the equilibrated gas phase. This constrained equilibrium-based approach ensures that the three iron oxide reduction steps and the formation of graphite and cementite in carbon-containing gases occur only if they are thermodynamically possible. It is demonstrated that fitting kinetic parameters based on conversion degree data alone leads to overfitting. This is true both for existing models and the model introduced here, despite the fact that the latter contains fewer parameters. To overcome this overfitting problem, spatially resolved microstructural data at key reduction stages can be considered, as shown here for recently reported data for a pellet reduced in H$_2$ atmosphere.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning on Multiple Topological Materials Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A dataset of 35,608 materials with their topological properties is constructed by combining the density functional theory (DFT) results of Materiae and the Topological Materials Database. Thanks to this, machine-learning approaches are developed to categorize materials into five distinct topological types, with the XGBoost model achieving an impressive 85.2% classification accuracy. By conducting generalization tests on different sub-datasets, differences are identified between the original datasets in terms of topological types, chemical elements, unknown magnetic compounds, and feature space coverage. Their impact on model performance is analyzed. Turning to the simpler binary classification between trivial insulators and nontrivial topological materials, three different approaches are also tested. Key characteristics influencing material topology are identified, with the maximum packing efficiency and the fraction of $\textit{p}$ valence electrons being highlighted as critical features.</description>

      <title>Anatomy of torques from orbital Rashba textures: the case of Co/Al interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of orbitronics, the rising of the orbital angular momentum generated at light metal interfaces from orbital textures via orbital Rashba-Edelstein effects nowadays represent extraordinary alternatives to the usual heavy-metal spin-based materials. In the light of very recent experimental results [\textcolor{blue}{S. Krishnia \textit{et al.}, Nanoletters 2023, 23, 6785}], starting from state-of-the-art density functional theory simulations, we provide theoretical insights into the emergence of very strong orbital torques at the Co/Al interface location a strong orbital Rashba texture. By using linear response theory, we calculate the exerted orbital torque amplitudes, mainly of field-like intraband character, acting onto the ultrathin Co. Moreover, we show that an insertion of a single atomic plane of Pt between Co and Al is enough to suppress the effect which questions about the anatomy of the torque action clearly behaving differently than in the standard way. This work opens new routes to the engineering of spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Real-time simulations of laser-induced electron excitations in crystalline ZnO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate non-equilibrium electron dynamics in crystalline ZnO induced by ultrashort, relatively intense, infrared laser pulses. Our focus is on understanding the mechanism that facilitates efficient conduction band population in ZnO to enable optically pumped lasing. We consider two different pulse frequencies (in the near-infrared and mid-infrared) for which experimental data are available, and we calculate the electronic response of a ZnO crystal for a wide range of pulse intensities. We apply and compare three complementary theoretical approaches: the analytical Keldysh model, the numerical solution of the semiconductor Bloch equations, and real-time time-dependent density functional theory. We conclude that time-dependent density functional theory is a valid \textit{ab initio} approach for predicting conduction band population, that offers an accurate enough description of static and transient optical properties of solids and provides physics insight into the intermediate excitation regime, where electronic excitations are determined by the interplay of intraband tunneling, a consequence of band bending, and interband multi-photon absorption.</description>

      <title>Ion-Exchange Doping of Semiconducting Single-Walled Carbon Nanotubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) are a promising thermoelectric material with high power factors after chemical p- or n-doping. Understanding the impact of dopant counterions on charge transport and thermoelectric properties of nanotube networks is essential to further optimize doping methods and to develop better dopants. Here, we utilize ion-exchange doping to systematically vary the size of counterions in thin films of small and large diameter, polymer-sorted semiconducting SWCNTs with AuCl3 as the initial p-dopant and investigate the impact of ion size on conductivity, Seebeck coefficients and power factors. Larger anions are found to correlate with higher electrical conductivities and improved doping stability, while no significant effect on the power factors is found. Importantly, the effect of counterion size on the thermoelectric properties of dense SWCNT networks is not obscured by morphological changes upon doping. The observed trends of carrier mobilities and Seebeck coefficients can be explained by a random resistor model for the nanotube network that accounts for overlapping Coulomb potentials leading to the formation of an impurity band whose depth depends on the carrier density and counterion size. These insights can be applied more broadly to understand the thermoelectric properties of doped percolating disordered systems, including semiconducting polymers.</description>

      <title>Low-lying Electronic Structure of Rare-Earth Based Topological Nodal Line Semimetal Candidate DySbTe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lanthanide (Ln) based LnSbTe materials have garnered significant attention due to rich interplay of long range magnetic ordering and topological properties, driven by unique crystalline symmetry, 4f electron interactions, and pronounced spin-orbit coupling (SOC) effects. DySbTe, as a heavier lanthanide-based member of the LnSbTe family, stands out with its SOC and larger on site interactions on its 4f electrons, which arise due to the heavier Dy element. Here, we present a comprehensive study on the low-temperature bulk physical properties and the electronic structure of DySbTe using magnetic susceptibility, heat capacity, and electrical resistivity measurements, along with high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/S), and density functional theory calculations. Our thermodynamic measurements revealed an antiferromagnetic ordering below TN = 7.45 K and a subsequent magnetic phase transition at TN1 = 7.15 K. Our transport studies indicate a semimetallic behavior with unusual feature in the ordered state. Our ARPES measurements revealed a diamond-shaped Fermi pocket centered at the G point, with band features that evolve distinctly across various binding energies. STM/S results indicate a minimum in the density of states at around 100 meV below the Fermi level, and ARPES measurements reveal a significant gap present around the X point, differentiating DySbTe from other LnSbTe compounds. These findings enhance our understanding of the SOC effects on the electronic structure and topological properties in the LnSbTe family, highlighting DySbTe as a promising candidate for exploring the interplay between topology and magnetism.</description>

      <title>Diode and selective routing functionalities controlled by geometry in current-induced spin-orbit torque driven magnetic domain wall devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Research on current-induced domain wall (DW) motion in heavy metal/ferromagnet structures is crucial for advancing memory, logic, and computing devices. Here, we demonstrate that adjusting the angle between the DW conduit and the current direction provides an additional degree of control over the current-induced DW motion. A DW conduit with a 45{\deg} section relative to the current direction enables asymmetrical DW behaviour: for one DW polarity, motion proceeds freely, while for the opposite polarity, motion is impeded or even blocked in the 45{\deg} zone, depending on the interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction strength. This enables the device to function as a DW diode. Leveraging this velocity asymmetry, we designed a Y-shaped DW conduit with one input and two output branches at +45{\deg} and -45{\deg}, functioning as a DW selector. A DW injected into the junction exits through one branch, while a reverse polarity DW exits through the other, demonstrating selective DW routing.</description>

      <title>Valley Emission and Upconversion in Isotopically Engineered Monolayer WS$_2$ under Resonant Excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the quest to optimize the optoelectronic and valleytronic properties of 2D materials, various strategies such as strain engineering, doping, and heterostructuring have been explored. In this direction, isotope engineering also offers a potential avenue to alter electron-phonon interaction and impact quasiparticle scattering processes. In this study, we investigate the dependence of sulfur isotopes on upconversion and valley scattering phenomena by collecting the resonance photoluminescence (PL) under an applied magnetic field from 0 to 14 T at 4 K for the chemical vapor deposition-grown monolayer (1L) of W$^{N}$S$_2$, W$^{32}$S$_2$, and W$^{34}$S$_2$. The upconversion of the mixed-state sulfur 1L (W$^{N}$S$_2$) exhibits one M-phonon absorption, with an obtained optical gain of nearly 30 meV, while the pure sulfur isotope labelled 1Ls (W$^{32}$S$_2$ and W$^{34}$S$_2$) require two phonons (M and $\Gamma$), yielding a gain of around 80 meV. It is also found that the exciton degree of polarization (DOP) of W$^{N}$S$_2$ changes significantly by $\sim$ -30$\%$ as the field increases from 0 to 14 T, while for W$^{32}$S$_2$ and W$^{34}$S$_2$, the exciton DOP increases by up to $\sim$ 8$\%$. Similarly, distinct changes in the DOP are observed for trions and localized excitons among all the samples, attributed to the different valley scattering phenomena. The 1L W$^{N}$S$_2$ demonstrates a combination of intraband and interband scattering, whereas in the case of W$^{32}$S$_2$ intraband scattering is preferred; W$^{34}$S$_2$ predominantly exhibits interband scattering. Finally, a phenomenological model is proposed to describe the upconversion and valley scattering processes.</description>

      <title>Event Soliton Formation in Mixed Energy-Momentum Gaps of Nonlinear Spacetime Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the formation of a novel soliton, termed event soliton, in nonlinear photonic spacetime crystals (STCs). In these media, simultaneous spatiotemporal periodic modulation of the dielectric constant generates mixed frequency (${\omega}$) and wavevector (k) gaps. Under Kerr nonlinearity, the event solitons emerge as fully localized entities in both spacetime and energy-momentum domains, providing a tangible demonstration of the concept of event in relativity. The ${\omega}$k-gap mixture arises from the coexistence and competition between time reflected and Bragg reflected waves due to the spatiotemporal modulation. We propose a new partial differential equation to capture various spatiotemporal patterns and present numerical simulations to validate our theoretical predictions, reflecting a three-way balance among k-gap opening, ${\omega}$-gap opening, and nonlinearity. Our work opens avenues for fundamental studies and fosters experimental prospects for implementing spacetime crystals in both time-varying photonics and periodically driven condensed matter systems.</description>

      <title>Quasiparticle gap renormalization driven by internal and external screening in WS$_2$ device</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The electronic band gap of a two-dimensional semiconductor within a device architecture is sensitive to variations in screening properties of adjacent materials in the device and to gate-controlled doping. Here, we employ micro-focused angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy to separate band gap renormalization effects stemming from environmental screening and electron-doping during \textit{in situ} gating of a single-layer WS$_{2}$ device. The WS$_{2}$ is supported on hBN and contains a section that is exposed to vacuum and another section that is encapsulated by a graphene contact. We directly observe the doping-induced semiconductor-metal transition and band gap renormalization in the two sections of WS$_2$. Surprisingly, a larger band gap renormalization is observed in the vacuum-exposed section than in the graphene-encapsulated - and thus ostensibly better screened - section of the WS$_2$. Using $GW$ calculations, we determine that intrinsic screening due to stronger doping in vacuum exposed WS$_2$ exceeds the external environmental screening in graphene-encapsulated WS$_2$.</description>

      <title>Uni-3DAR: Unified 3D Generation and Understanding via Autoregression on Compressed Spatial Tokens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models and their multi-modal extensions have demonstrated the effectiveness of unifying generation and understanding through autoregressive next-token prediction. However, despite the critical role of 3D structural generation and understanding ({3D GU}) in AI for science, these tasks have largely evolved independently, with autoregressive methods remaining underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce Uni-3DAR, a unified framework that seamlessly integrates {3D GU} tasks via autoregressive prediction. At its core, Uni-3DAR employs a novel hierarchical tokenization that compresses 3D space using an octree, leveraging the inherent sparsity of 3D structures. It then applies an additional tokenization for fine-grained structural details, capturing key attributes such as atom types and precise spatial coordinates in microscopic 3D structures. We further propose two optimizations to enhance efficiency and effectiveness. The first is a two-level subtree compression strategy, which reduces the octree token sequence by up to 8x. The second is a masked next-token prediction mechanism tailored for dynamically varying token positions, significantly boosting model performance. By combining these strategies, Uni-3DAR successfully unifies diverse {3D GU} tasks within a single autoregressive framework. Extensive experiments across multiple microscopic {3D GU} tasks, including molecules, proteins, polymers, and crystals, validate its effectiveness and versatility. Notably, Uni-3DAR surpasses previous state-of-the-art diffusion models by a substantial margin, achieving up to 256\% relative improvement while delivering inference speeds up to 21.8x faster. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/dptech-corp/Uni-3DAR.</description>

      <title>Bandgap-Dependent Doping of Semiconducting Carbon Nanotube Networks by Proton-Coupled Electron Transfer for Stable Thermoelectrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Networks of semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) are a promising material for thermoelectric energy harvesting due to their mechanical flexibility, solution processability, high Seebeck coefficients and high electrical conductivities after chemical p- or n-doping. Here, we demonstrate that proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) with benzoquinone (BQ) as the oxidant and lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (Li[TFSI]) for electrolyte counterions is a promising method for p-doping of polymer-sorted semiconducting SWNT networks. The achieved doping levels, as determined from absorption bleaching, depend directly on both the pH of the aqueous doping solutions and the bandgap (i.e., diameter) of the nanotubes within the network. Fast screening of different nanotube networks under various doping conditions was enabled by a high-throughput setup for thermoelectric measurements of five samples in parallel. For small-bandgap SWNTs, PCET-doping is sufficient to reach the maximum thermoelectric power factors, which are equal to those obtained by conventional methods. In contrast to other doping methods, the electrical conductivity of PCET-doped SWNTs remains stable over at least 5 days in air. These results confirm PCET to be a suitable approach for more environmentally friendly and stable doping of semiconducting SWNTs as promising thermoelectric materials.</description>

      <title>Non-Markovian Relaxation Spectroscopy of Fluxonium Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have shown that parasitic two-level systems (TLS) in superconducting qubits, which are a leading source of decoherence, can have relaxation times longer than the qubits themselves. However, the standard techniques used to characterize qubit relaxation is only valid for measuring $T_1$ under Markovian assumptions and could mask such non-Markovian behavior of the environment in practice. Here, we introduce two-timescale relaxometry, a technique to probe the qubit and environment relaxation simultaneously and efficiently. We apply it to high-coherence fluxonium qubits over a frequency range of 0.1-0.4 GHz, which reveals a discrete spectrum of TLS with millisecond lifetimes. Our analysis of the spectrum is consistent with a random distribution of TLS in the aluminum oxide tunnel barrier of the Josephson junction chain of the fluxonium with an average density and electric dipole similar to previous TLS studies at much higher frequencies. Our study suggests that investigating and mitigating TLS in the junction chain is crucial to the development of various types of noise-protected qubits in circuit QED.</description>

Abstract: Recent advancements in thermal conductivity modulating strategies have shown promising enhancements to the thermal management capabilities of two-dimensional materials. In this article, both iterative Boltzmann transport equation solution and two-temperature model were employed to investigate the efficacy of targeted phonon excitation applied to hexagonal boron nitride. The results indicate significant modifications to hBN's thermal conductivity, achieving increases of up to 30.1% as well as decreases of up to 59.8%. These findings validate the reliability of the strategy, expand its scope of applicability, and establish it as a powerful tool for tailoring thermal properties across a wider range of fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11926v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we present a new basis set for electronic structure calculations of crystalline solids aimed at applications to Density Functional Theory (DFT) methods. In this construction we take advantage of the fact that most DFT calculations use a convergence loop in order to obtain the eigenstates of a final Khon Sham (KS) Hamiltonian matrix - that is iterate solve the KS equations till the eigenstates of the KS Hamiltonian matrix also give the appropriate electron density needed to obtain the KS potential needed for that KS Hamiltonian matrix. Here we propose that, for the basis used at each step of the iteration, we use the previous eigenstate basis, in the interstitial region, but augmented inside the Muffin Tin (MT) sphere with the solution to the spherically averaged KS Hamiltonian for the energy window of the energy of that eigenstate. Indeed to reduce the number of times the spherically averaged KS potential needs to be solved inside the MT spheres it is advantageous to use energy windows and solve the spherically averaged KS Hamiltonian inside the MT region only once per window (at the energy relevant to that window) so that the spherically averaged KS Hamiltonian needs only be solved a small number of times per iteration of the solution of the KS equations. For practical applications it is reasonable to have on the order of ten to one hundred windows. This method combines the implicit energy dependence of the basis of methods such as Projected Augmented Wave functions (PAW) with the ability of the basis set to adjust to the solid state (rather then atomic) environment which is similar to basis sets such as Linearized Augmented Plane Waves (LAPW). At each step of the iteration of the solution of the KS equations the basis is that of near eigenstates of the KS Hamiltonian for that iteration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19761v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel approach to generate a fingerprint for crystalline materials that balances efficiency for machine processing and human interpretability, allowing its application in both machine learning inference and understanding of structure-property relationships. Our proposed material encoding has two components: one representing the crystal structure and the other characterizing the chemical composition, that we call Pettifor embedding. For the latter we construct a non-orthogonal space where each axis represents a chemical element and where the angle between the axes quantifies a measure of the similarity between them. The chemical composition is then defined by the point on the unit sphere in this non-orthogonal space. We show that the Pettifor embeddings systematically outperform other commonly used elemental embeddings in compositional machine learning models. Using the Pettifor embeddings to define a distance metric and applying dimension reduction techniques, we construct a two-dimensional global map of the space of thermodynamically stable crystalline compounds. Despite their simplicity, such maps succeed in providing a physical separation of material classes according to basic physical properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21392v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To study the size and strain rate dependency of copper polycrystalline microstructures, a multi-layered copper/Al$_2$O$_3$ thin film was deposited on a Si substrate using a hybrid deposition system (combining physical vapour and atomic layer deposition). High temperature treatment was applied on the ``As Deposited" material with ultrafine-grained structure to increase the average grain size, resulting in a ``Heat Treated" state with microcrystalline structure. Focused ion beam milling was employed to create square shaped micropillars with two different sizes, that were subjected to compressive loading at various (0.001/s -- 1000/s) strain rates. Differences in the strain rate sensitivity behavior manifesting at low and high strain rates are discussed in the context of the pillar diameters and the grain size of the deformed samples. The Al$_2$O$_3$ interlayer studied by transmission electron microscopy showed excellent thermal stability and grain boundary pinning by precipitation, also resulting in the homogeneous deformation of the pillars and preventing shear localization. Geometrically necessary dislocation densities estimated by high (angular) resolution electron backscatter diffraction presented inhomogeneous dislocation distribution within the deformed pillar volumes, that is attributed to the proximity of the sample edges. Finally, the Al$_2$O$_3$ interlayers successfully suppressed any possible recrystallization processes, contributing to the excellent film stability, that makes the proposed coating ideal to be operating under extreme conditions.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative self-consistent electron-phonon spectral functions and transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00468v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electron-phonon coupling often dominates the electron spectral functions and carrier transport properties. However, studies of this effect in real materials have largely relied on perturbative one-shot methods due to the lack of a first-principles theoretical and computational framework. Here, we present a self-consistent theory and implementation for the non-perturbative calculations of spectral functions and conductivity due to electron-phonon coupling. Applying this method to monolayer InSe, we demonstrate that self-consistency qualitatively affects the spectral function and transport properties compared to state-of-the-art one-shot calculations and allow one to reconcile experimental angle-resolved photoemission experiments. The developed method can be widely applied to materials with dominant electron-phonon coupling at moderate computational cost.</description>

      <title>High-throughput computation and machine learning modeling of magnetic moments and M\"ossbauer parameters for Fe-based intermetallics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08249v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on high-throughput density functional theory calculations, we evaluate the local magnetic moments and M\"ossbauer properties for Fe-based intermetallic compounds and employ machine learning to map the local crystalline environments to such properties. It is observed that magnetic moments and M\"ossbauer parameters provide complementary insights into the local crystalline environment, where the statistical features cannot be captured using phenomenological models. Furthermore, we find that the scarcity of existing data in Materials Project (MP) poses a significant challenge in developing predictive machine learning models, whereas SOAP-based descriptors can be applied for reliable modeling of the enriched datasets with extra structural prototypes. This work advances the mapping of local crystalline structures to magnetic and spectroscopic properties, bridging the gap between empirical observations and theoretical models.</description>

      <title>Large positive magnetoconductance in carbon nanoscrolls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03518v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically demonstrate that carbon nanoscrolls -- spirally wrapped graphene layers with open endpoints -- can be characterized by a large positive magnetoconductance. We show that when a carbon nanoscroll is subject to an axial magnetic field of several Tesla, the ballistic conductance at low carrier densities of the nanoscroll has an increase of about 200%. Importantly, we find that this positive magnetoconductance is not only preserved in an imperfect nanoscroll (with disorder or mild inter-turn misalignment) but can even be enhanced in the presence of on-site disorder. We prove that the positive magnetoconductance comes about the emergence of magnetic field-induced zero energy modes, specific of rolled-up geometries. Our results establish curved graphene systems as a new material platform displaying sizable magnetoresistive phenomena.</description>

      <title>Reformulation of continuum defects in terms of the general teleparallel geometry in the language of exterior algebra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06184v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the geometric formulation of continuum defects consisting of dislocations and disclinations. After reviewing the metric affine geometry and the present geometric formulation of dislocation and disclination written in terms of torsion and full curvature (together with vanishing non-metricity), we give a new formulation of them in a novel way in terms of torsion and non-metricity (together with vanishing full curvature), the so-called general teleparallel geometry. All calculations are performed by using the exterior algebra. We obtain continuity equations explicitly for dislocation density and disclination density.</description>

      <title>Scaling Up Purcell-Enhanced Self-Assembled Nanoplasmonic Perovskite Scintillators into the Bulk Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18477v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scintillators, which convert high-energy radiation into detectable photons, play a crucial role in medical imaging and security applications. The enhancement of scintillator performance through nanophotonics and nanoplasmonics, specifically using the Purcell effect, has shown promise but has so far been limited to ultrathin scintillator films due to the localized nature of this effect. In this study, we present a method to extend nanoplasmonic scintillators to the bulk regime. By integrating 100-nm-size plasmonic spheroid and cuboid nanoparticles with perovskite scintillator nanocrystals, we enable nanoplasmonic scintillators to function effectively within bulk-scale devices. We experimentally demonstrate power and decay rate enhancements of up to (3.20 $\pm$ 0.20) and (4.20 $\pm$ 0.31) fold for plasmonic spheroid and cuboid nanoparticles, respectively, in a 5-mm thick CsPbBr$_3$ nanocrystal-polymer scintillator at RT. Theoretical modeling further predicts similar enhancements of up to (2.63 $\pm$ 0.79) and (5.62 $\pm$ 1.71) fold for the same nanoparticle shapes and dimensions. These findings provide a viable pathway for using nanoplasmonics to enhance bulk scintillator devices, advancing radiation detection technology.</description>

      <title>Broken symmetry solutions in one-dimensional lattice models via many-body perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15020v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we study self-consistent solutions in one-dimensional lattice models obtained via many-body perturbation theory. The Dyson equation is solved in a fully self-consistent manner via the algorithmic-inversion method based on the sum-over-poles representation (AIM-SOP) of dynamical operators. In particular, we focus on the GW approximation, analyzing the spectral properties and the emergence of possible magnetic- or charge-density-wave broken symmetry solutions. We start by validating our self-consistent AIM-SOP implementation by taking as test case the one-dimensional Hubbard model. We then move to the study of antiferromagnetic and charge density wave solutions in one-dimensional lattice models, taking into account a long-range Coulomb interaction between the electrons. We show that moving from local to non-local electronic interactions leads to a competition between antiferromagnetic and charge-density-wave broken symmetry solutions. Complementary, by solving the Sham-Schl\"uter equation, we can compute the non-interacting Green's function reproducing the same charge density of the interacting system. In turn, this allows for the evaluation of the derivative discontinuity of the Kohn-Sham (KS) potential, showing that its contribution to the fundamental gap can become dominating in some of the studied cases.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the Scalability and Applicability of Kohn-Sham Hamiltonians for Molecular Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19227v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Density Functional Theory (DFT) is a pivotal method within quantum chemistry and materials science, with its core involving the construction and solution of the Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian. Despite its importance, the application of DFT is frequently limited by the substantial computational resources required to construct the Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian. In response to these limitations, current research has employed deep-learning models to efficiently predict molecular and solid Hamiltonians, with roto-translational symmetries encoded in their neural networks. However, the scalability of prior models may be problematic when applied to large molecules, resulting in non-physical predictions of ground-state properties. In this study, we generate a substantially larger training set (PubChemQH) than used previously and use it to create a scalable model for DFT calculations with physical accuracy. For our model, we introduce a loss function derived from physical principles, which we call Wavefunction Alignment Loss (WALoss). WALoss involves performing a basis change on the predicted Hamiltonian to align it with the observed one; thus, the resulting differences can serve as a surrogate for orbital energy differences, allowing models to make better predictions for molecular orbitals and total energies than previously possible. WALoss also substantially accelerates self-consistent-field (SCF) DFT calculations. Here, we show it achieves a reduction in total energy prediction error by a factor of 1347 and an SCF calculation speed-up by a factor of 18%. These substantial improvements set new benchmarks for achieving accurate and applicable predictions in larger molecular systems.</description>

      <title>Altermagnetic splitting of magnons in hematite ($\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11623v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a four-sublattice spin-wave theory for the $g$-wave altermagnet candidate hematite ($\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$), considering both its easy-axis phase below and its weak ferromagnetic phase above the Morin temperature. A key question is whether the defining altermagnetic feature - magnon spin splitting (also called chirality or polarization splitting) due to nonrelativistic time-reversal symmetry breaking - remains intact when relativistic corrections, which contribute to hematite's magnetic order, are included. Using a detailed symmetry analysis supported by density functional theory, we show that capturing the magnon splitting within a Heisenberg model requires exchange interactions extending at least to the 13th neighbor. We find an altermagnetic band splitting of approximately 2 meV, which contrasts with the total band width of about 100 meV. To evaluate the experimental observability of this splitting, we analyze relativistic corrections to the magnon spectrum in both magnetic phases. We show that spin-orbit coupling - manifesting as magnetocrystalline anisotropies and the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) - does not obscure the key altermagnetic features. These findings indicate that inelastic neutron scattering can directly probe altermagnetic magnon splitting in hematite. We also discuss implications for magnon transport, particularly magnonic contributions to the thermal Hall effect (which requires spin-orbit coupling) and to spin splitter effects (which do not). Notably, we predict a third-order nonlinear magnon spin splitter effect. This result suggests that the $g$-wave magnon spin splitting in hematite enables transverse heat-to-spin conversion without requiring an external magnetic field.</description>
