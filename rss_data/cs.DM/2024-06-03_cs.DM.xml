      <title>Finite groups with geodetic Cayley graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A connected undirected graph is called \emph{geodetic} if for every pair of vertices there is a unique shortest path connecting them. It has been conjectured that for finite groups, the only geodetic Cayley graphs which occur are odd cycles and complete graphs. In this article we present a series of theoretical results which contribute to a computer search verifying this conjecture for all groups of size up to 1024. The conjecture is also verified theoretically for several infinite families of groups including dihedral and some families of nilpotent groups. Two key results which enable the computer search to reach as far as it does are: if the center of a group has even order, then the conjecture holds (this eliminates all 2-groups from our computer search); if a Cayley graph is geodetic then there are bounds relating the size of the group, generating set and center (which cuts down the number of generating sets which must be searched significantly).</description>

      <title>$\mathcal{O}(VE)$ time algorithms for the Grundy (First-Fit) chromatic number of block graphs and graphs with sufficiently large girth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Grundy (or First-Fit) chromatic number of a graph $G=(V,E)$, denoted by $\Gamma(G)$ (or $\chi_{_{\sf FF}}(G)$), is the maximum number of colors used by a First-Fit (greedy) coloring of $G$. To determine $\Gamma(G)$ is NP-complete for various classes of graphs. Also there exists a constant $c&gt;0$ such that the Grundy number is hard to approximate within the ratio $c$. We first obtain an $\mathcal{O}(VE)$ algorithm to determine the Grundy number of block graphs i.e. graphs in which every biconnected component is complete subgraph. We prove that the Grundy number of a general graph $G$ with cut-vertices is upper bounded by the Grundy number of a block graph corresponding to $G$. This provides a reasonable upper bound for the Grundy number of graphs with cut-vertices. Next, define $\Delta_2(G)={\max}_{u\in G}~ {\max}_{v\in N(u):d(v)\leq d(u)} d(v)$. We obtain an $\mathcal{O}(VE)$ algorithm to determine $\Gamma(G)$ for graphs $G$ whose girth $g$ is at least $2\Delta_2(G)+1$. This algorithm provides a polynomial time approximation algorithm within ratio $\min \{1, (g+1)/(2\Delta_2(G)+2)\}$ for $\Gamma(G)$ of general graphs $G$ with girth $g$.</description>

      <title>Guarding isometric subgraphs and Cops and Robber in planar graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the game of Cops and Robbers, one of the most useful results is that an isometric path in a graph can be guarded by one cop. In this paper, we introduce the concept of wide shadow in a subgraph, and use it to characterize all 1-guardable graphs. As an application, we show that 3 cops can capture a robber in any planar graph with the added restriction that at most two cops can move simultaneously, proving a conjecture of Yang and strengthening a classical result of Aigner and Fromme.</description>

      <title>Polynomial Bounds of CFLOBDDs against BDDs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs) are widely used for the representation of Boolean functions. Context-Free-Language Ordered Decision Diagrams (CFLOBDDs) are a plug-compatible replacement for BDDs -- roughly, they are BDDs augmented with a certain form of procedure call. A natural question to ask is, ``For a given Boolean function $f$, what is the relationship between the size of a BDD for $f$ and the size of a CFLOBDD for $f$?'' Sistla et al. established that, in the best case, the CFLOBDD for a function $f$ can be exponentially smaller than any BDD for $f$ (regardless of what variable ordering is used in the BDD); however, they did not give a worst-case bound -- i.e., they left open the question, ``Is there a family of functions $\{ f_i \}$ for which the size of a CFLOBDD for $f_i$ must be substantially larger than a BDD for $f_i$?'' For instance, it could be that there is a family of functions for which the BDDs are exponentially more succinct than any corresponding CFLOBDDs.
  This paper studies such questions, and answers the second question posed above in the negative. In particular, we show that by using the same variable ordering in the CFLOBDD that is used in the BDD, the size of a CFLOBDD for any function $f$ cannot be far worse than the size of the BDD for $f$. The bound that relates their sizes is polynomial: If BDD $B$ for function $f$ is of size $|B|$ and uses variable ordering $\textit{Ord}$, then the size of the CFLOBDD $C$ for $f$ that also uses $\textit{Ord}$ is bounded by $O(|B|^3)$.
  The paper also shows that the bound is tight: there is a family of functions for which $|C|$ grows as $\Omega(|B|^3)$.</description>

      <title>Strict Self-Assembly of Discrete Self-Similar Fractal Shapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08548v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper gives a (polynomial time) algorithm to decide whether a given Discrete Self-Similar Fractal Shape can be assembled in the aTAM model.In the positive case, the construction relies on a Self-Assembling System in the aTAM which strictly assembles a particular self-similar fractal shape, namely a variant $K^\infty$ of the Sierpinski Carpet. We prove that the aTAM we propose is correct through a novel device, \emph{self-describing circuits} which are generally useful for rigorous yet readable proofs of the behaviour of aTAMs.We then discuss which self-similar fractals can or cannot be strictly self-assembled in the aTAM. It turns out that the ability of iterates of the generator to pass information is crucial: either this \emph{bandwidth} is eventually sufficient in both cardinal directions and $K^\infty$ appears within the fractal pattern after some finite number of iterations, or that bandwidth remains ever insufficient in one direction and any aTAM trying to self-assemble the shape will end up either bounded with an ultimately periodic pattern covering arbitrarily large squares. This is established thanks to a new characterization of the productions of systems whose productions have a uniformly bounded treewidth.</description>

      <title>Packing, Hitting, and Colouring Squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.02185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.02185v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a finite family of squares in the plane, the packing problem asks for the maximum number $\nu$ of pairwise disjoint squares among them, while the hitting problem for the minimum number $\tau$ of points hitting all of them. Clearly, $\tau \ge \nu$. Both problems are known to be NP-hard, even for families of axis-parallel unit squares.
  The main results of this work provide the first non-trivial bounds for the $\tau / \nu$ ratio for not necessarily axis-parallel squares. We establish an upper bound of $6$ for unit squares and $10$ for squares of varying sizes. The worst ratios we can provide with examples are $3$ and $4$, respectively. For comparison, in the axis-parallel case, the supremum of the considered ratio is in the interval $[\frac{3}{2},2]$ for unit squares and $[\frac{3}{2},4]$ for squares of varying sizes. The methods we introduced for the $\tau/\nu$ ratio can also be used to relate the chromatic number $\chi$ and clique number $\omega$ of squares by bounding the $\chi/\omega$ ratio by $6$ for unit squares and $9$ for squares of varying sizes.
  The $\tau / \nu$ and $\chi/\omega$ ratios have already been bounded before by a constant for "fat" objects, the fattest and simplest of which are disks and squares. However, while disks have received significant attention, specific bounds for squares have remained essentially unexplored. This work intends to fill this gap.</description>

      <title>HBS Tilings extended: State of the art and novel observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.14011v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Penrose tilings are the most famous aperiodic tilings, and they have been studied extensively. In particular, patterns composed with hexagons ($H$), boats ($B$) and stars ($S$) were soon exhibited and many physicists published on what they later called $HBS$ tilings, but no article or book combines all we know about them. This work is done here, before introducing new decorations and properties including explicit substitutions. For the latter, the star comes in three versions so we have 5 prototiles in what we call the Star tileset. Yet this set yields exactly the strict $HBS$ tilings formed using 3 tiles decorated with either the usual decorations (arrows) or Ammann bar markings for instance. Another new tileset called Gemstones is also presented, derived from the Star tileset.</description>

      <title>Future Directions in the Theory of Graph Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02287v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning on graphs, especially using graph neural networks (GNNs), has seen a surge in interest due to the wide availability of graph data across a broad spectrum of disciplines, from life to social and engineering sciences. Despite their practical success, our theoretical understanding of the properties of GNNs remains highly incomplete. Recent theoretical advancements primarily focus on elucidating the coarse-grained expressive power of GNNs, predominantly employing combinatorial techniques. However, these studies do not perfectly align with practice, particularly in understanding the generalization behavior of GNNs when trained with stochastic first-order optimization techniques. In this position paper, we argue that the graph machine learning community needs to shift its attention to developing a balanced theory of graph machine learning, focusing on a more thorough understanding of the interplay of expressive power, generalization, and optimization.</description>
