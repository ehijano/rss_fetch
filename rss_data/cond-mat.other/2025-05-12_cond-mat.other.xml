      <title>Quantum Monte Carlo description of correlated electrons in two-dimensional FeSe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electronic correlation effects on the structural properties of double-layer FeSe are studied using variation and diffusion quantum Monte Carlo methods. The Slater-Jastrow many-body wavefunction with two different forms for the homogeneous two-body pair-correlation term is used. The ground-state energy of the system is obtained at the thermodynamic limit using two different trial wave functions called JDFT and JSD. Only the Jastrow factor is fully optimized in the JDFT wave function, while the Slater determinant comes from the density functional approximation. In the JSD trial wave function, the Slater determinant and the Jastrow factor are fully optimized simultaneously. We calculated the VMC and DMC energies as a function of interlayer separation for two different in-plane iron-iron bond lengths. Our QMC results indicate that the optimized interlayer separation decreases with increasing iron-iron bond length, driven by stretch. We found that a three- to two-dimensional phase transition increases the electron-electron correlation effects and shifts the system from moderately correlated to strongly correlated. The value of correlation energy implies that the Hubbard $U$ value, which is widely used in DFT+U calculations, for two-dimensional FeSe is larger than its value in bulk.</description>

      <title>How Salt Solvation Slows Water Dynamics While Blue-Shifting Its Dielectric Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Water inherently contains trace amounts of various salts, yet the microscopic processes by which salts influence some of its physical properties remain elusive. Notably, the mechanisms that reduce the dielectric constant of water upon salt addition are still debated. The primary absorption peak for electromagnetic radiation -- commonly used in microwave heating -- shifts towards higher frequencies in saline solutions, suggesting faster water molecular dynamics. This observation, however, contrasts with the simultaneous increase in viscosity and experimental reports that ionic solutes would slow down water molecular motion. In this work, we use molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with deep-neural-network models trained on high-quality quantum mechanical data to mimic interatomic forces and molecular dipoles, to compute the dielectric spectra of perchlorate water saline solution, which may be relevant to the recent discovery of liquid water beneath the thick ice crust at Mars's south pole. Our results reveal that both the reduction in the dielectric constant and the absorption peak shift can be attributed to ion-induced changes in the orientational ordering of water molecules. Additionally, we demonstrate that the self-part of the molecular dipole-dipole correlation function reveals clear signatures of the slowing dynamics within the first cationic solvation shell, consistent with the experimentally observed increase in viscosity.</description>

      <title>On the relation between fractional charge and statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15857v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit an argument, originally given by Kivelson and Ro\v{c}ek, for why the existence of fractional charge necessarily implies fractional statistics. In doing so, we resolve a contradiction in the original argument, and in the case of a $\nu = 1/m$ Laughlin holes, we also show that the standard relation between fractional charge and statistics is necessary by an argument based on a t'Hooft anomaly in a one-form global ${\mathcal Z}_m$ symmetry.</description>
