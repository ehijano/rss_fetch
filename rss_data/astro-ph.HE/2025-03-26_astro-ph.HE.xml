      <title>Discovery of Quasi-periodic Eruptions in the Tidal Disruption Event and Extreme Coronal Line Emitter AT2022upj: implications for the QPE/TDE fraction and a connection to ECLEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) are recurring soft X-ray transients emerging from the vicinity of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in nearby, low-mass galaxy nuclei; about ten QPE hosts have been identified thus far. Here we report the \textit{NICER} discovery of QPEs in the optically-selected Tidal Disruption Event (TDE) and Extreme Coronal Line Emitter (ECLE) AT2022upj, exhibiting a large spread in recurrence times from 0.5-3.5 days, durations from 0.3-1 days, peak luminosities from $10^{42.5-43.0}$ erg s$^{-1}$, and erratic flare profiles. A wealth of evidence now links at least some QPEs to the newly-formed accretion flows emerging from TDEs; AT2022upj is the third QPE reported in an optically discovered TDE. Marginalizing over the uncertain distributions of QPE peak luminosity, recurrence time, delay after TDE peak, and lifetime, we use the burgeoning sample to make a Bayesian estimate that the fraction of optical TDEs resulting in QPEs within 5 years post-disruption is $9^{+9}_{-5}$\%. Along with AT2019qiz, AT2022upj also marks the second of the three optical TDE+X-ray QPEs showing coronal line emission, suggesting ECLEs may represent a subset of TDEs particularly efficient at forming QPEs and/or that sustained QPE X-ray emission contributes to coronal line emission in some galaxy nuclei.</description>

      <title>What's kickin' in partial tidal disruption events?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stars partially destroyed by a supermassive black hole (SMBH) in a partial tidal disruption event (TDE) can be ejected from the SMBH. Previous investigations attributed this positive-energy/velocity kick to asymmetries in the mass lost by the star near pericenter. We propose that asymmetric mass loss is not predominantly responsible for "kicking" the star, and that these kicks instead arise from the combination of a) the reformation of the core following an initial phase of quasi-ballistic motion, and b) the differential shear between the unbound and marginally bound (to the SMBH) material during this phase. We predict that the kick speed $v_{\rm kick}$ is weakly dependent on the stellar properties, and for SMBH masses $M_{\bullet} \gtrsim 10^{3} M_{\odot}$, $v_{\rm kick}$ is independent of SMBH mass, is not limited to the stellar escape speed $v_{\rm esc}$, and is related to the surviving core mass $M_{\rm c}$ approximately as $v_{\rm kick} \simeq 0.45 \left(M_{\rm c}/M_{\star}\right)^{-1/3}$, where $M_{\star}$ is the original stellar mass. For $M_{\bullet} \lesssim 10^{3} M_{\odot}$, we find that the maximum-attainable kick speed depends on SMBH mass, satisfies $v_{\rm kick, max} \simeq 0.4 \, v_{\rm esc}\left(M_{\bullet}/M_{\star}\right)^{1/6}$, and is reached for core masses that satisfy $M_{\rm c}/M_{\star} \lesssim 1.7\left(M_{\bullet}/M_{\star}\right)^{-1/2}$. This model predicts that massive stars with $M_{\star}\gtrsim few\times 10 M_{\odot}$ could be ejected at speeds $\gtrsim (1-2)\times 10^3$ km s$^{-1}$ if stripped of $\gtrsim 50\%$ of their mass.</description>

      <title>Spectropolarimetry of A Nuclear Transient AT2023clx: Revealing The Geometrical Alignment between The Transient Outflow and The Nuclear Dusty Region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AT2023clx, which occurred in NGC3799 with a Low-Ionization Nuclear Emission-Line Region (LINER), is one of the most nearby nuclear transients classified as a tidal disruption event (TDE). We present three-epoch spectropolarimetric follow-up observations of AT2023clx. We detected two polarization components; one is a constant polarization of $\sim 1\%$ originated from an aspherical outflow associated with the transient, while the other is a blue-excess polarization up to $\sim 2\%$ originated from a nuclear dusty environment via light echoes. Between the two epochs, the polarization angle flipped by 90 degrees, indicating that the direction of the outflow was aligned perpendicular to the dust plane. Such polarization features -- the blue excess and the 90-degree flip -- have never been observed in previous TDE polarization samples, highlighting unique mechanisms behind AT2023clx. We propose possible scenarios to naturally explain the polarization features: the disruption of a star captured by a nuclear dusty cloud around the black hole or a star formed within the cloud. Given the LINER nature of NGC3799, the dusty region may possibly be linked to a torus or disk associated with a weak Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN). Furthermore, as a more speculative scenario, the event might have been triggered by AGN-like activity, potentially linked to changing-look AGNs or ambiguous nuclear transients.</description>

      <title>Very-high-energy gamma-ray detection and long-term multi-wavelength view of the flaring blazar B2 1811+31</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Among the blazars whose emission has been detected up to very-high-energy (VHE; 100 GeV &lt; E &lt; 100 TeV) gamma rays, intermediate synchrotron-peaked BL Lacs (IBLs) are quite rare. The IBL B2 1811+31 (z = 0.117) exhibited intense flaring activity in 2020. Detailed characterization of the source emissions from radio to gamma-ray energies was achieved with quasi-simultaneous observations, which led to the first-time detection of VHE gamma-ray emission from the source with the MAGIC telescopes. In this work, we present a comprehensive multi-wavelength view of B2 1811+31 employing data from MAGIC, Fermi-LAT, Swift-XRT, Swift-UVOT and from several optical and radio ground-based telescopes. We investigate the variability, cross-correlations and classification of the source emissions during low and high states. During the 2020 flaring state, the synchrotron peak frequency shifted to higher values and reached the limit of the IBL classification. Variability in timescales of few hours in the high-energy (HE; 100 MeV &lt; E &lt; 100 GeV) gamma-ray band poses an upper limit of 6 x 10^{14} delta_D cm to the size of the emission region responsible for the gamma-ray flare, delta_D being the relativistic Doppler factor of the region. During the 2020 high state, the average spectrum became harder in the X-ray and HE gamma-ray bands compared to the low states. Conversely, during different activity periods, we find harder-when-brighter trends in X rays and a hint of softer-when-brighter trends at HE gamma rays. Gamma-optical correlation indicates the same emission regions dominate the radiative output in both ranges, whereas the levolution at 15 GHz shows no correlation with the flux at higher frequencies. We test one-zone and two-zone synchrotron-self-Compton models for describing the broad-band spectral energy distribution during the 2020 flare and investigate the self-consistency of the proposed scenario.</description>

      <title>Stellar-wind feedback and magnetic fields around young compact star clusters: 3D MHD simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: The environments of young star clusters are shaped by the interactions of the powerful winds of massive stars, and their feedback on the cluster birth cloud. Several such clusters show diffuse gamma-ray emission on the degree scale, which hints at ongoing particle acceleration. Aims: To date, particle acceleration and transport in star-cluster environments are not well understood. A characterisation of magnetic fields and flow structures is necessary to progress toward physical models. Previous work has largely focused on 100 pc scale feedback or detailed modelling of wind interaction of just a few stars. We aim to bridge this gap. We focus in particular on compact clusters to study collective effects arising from stellar-wind interaction. Objects in this class include Westerlund 1 and R136. Methods: We perform 3D ideal-MHD simulations of compact, young, massive star clusters. Stellar winds are injected kinetically for 46 individual very massive stars (M &gt; 40 Msun), distributed in a spherical region of radius 0.6 - 1 pc. We include a sub-population of five magnetic stars with increased dipole field strengths of 0.1 - 1 kG. We study the evolving superbubble over several 100 kyrs. Results: The bulk flow and magnetic fields show an intricate, non-uniform morphology, which is critically impacted by the relative position of individual stars. The cluster wind terminates in a strong shock, which is non-spherical and, like the flow, has non-uniform properties. The magnetic field is both composed of highly tangled sections and coherent quasi-radial field-line bundles. Steep particle spectra in the TeV domain arise naturally from the variation of magnetic field magnitude over the cluster-wind termination shock. This finding is consistent with gamma-ray observations. The scenario of PeV particle acceleration at the cluster-wind termination shock is deemed unlikely.</description>

      <title>A depolarisation census of ASKAP fast radio bursts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are luminous, dispersed pulses of extra-galactic origin. The physics of the emission mechanism, the progenitor environment, and their origin are unclear. Some repeating FRBs are observed to have frequency-dependent exponential suppression in linear polarisation fraction. This has been attributed to multipath propagation in a surrounding complex magneto-ionic environment. The magnitude of depolarisation can be quantified using the parameter $\rm \sigma^{\prime}_{RM}$, which can be used to model the magneto-ionic complexity of the medium. In addition to depolarisation, some repeating sources (in particular those with active magneto-ionic environments) have been identified to have co-located persistent radio sources (PRS). Searches for depolarisation of non-repeating sources are challenging due to the limited bandwidth of most FRB detection systems used to detect one-off bursts. However, even with a limited bandwidth, such depolarisation can be identified if it lies within the $\rm \sigma^{\prime}_{RM}$ sensitivity window of the telescope. In this paper, we present a search for depolarisation in $12$ one-off FRBs detected by the Australian SKA Pathfinder. We report on the first strongly depolarised FRB detected by ASKAP (FRB$~$20230526A) and a marginal detection of depolarisation in a second. We also report constraints on the presence of a PRS coincident with FRB$~$20230526A using observations obtained with the Australia Telescope Compact Array. We use this to study the relationship between $\rm \sigma^{\prime}_{RM}$ and PRS luminosity. Our investigation supports a scenario in which repeaters and non-repeaters share a common origin and where non-repeaters represent an older population relative to repeating FRBs.</description>

      <title>Magnetosphere Evolution and Precursor-Driven Electromagnetic Signals in Merging Binary Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We detail new force-free simulations to investigate magnetosphere evolution and precursor electromagnetic (EM) signals from binary neutron stars. Our simulations fully follow a representative inspiral motion, capturing the intricate magnetospheric dynamics and their impact on EM outflows. We explore a range of stellar magnetic moment orientations and relative strengths, finding that the magnetospheres and Poynting flux evolution are strongly configuration-dependent. The Poynting flux exhibits pulsations at twice the orbital frequency, $2\Omega$, and is highly anisotropic, following a power-law dependence on orbital frequency. The index ranges from 1 to 6, shaped by the intricate dynamics of the magnetospheres. Furthermore, we present the first computation of: (1) The EM forces acting on the star surfaces, revealing the presence of torques that, for highly-magnetized stars, could influence the orbital dynamics or break the crust. (2) The high-energy emission signals from these systems by adopting the established isolated pulsar theory. Assuming curvature radiation in the radiation reaction limit, we find that photons could reach TeV--PeV energies in the last $\sim$~ms for magnetic field strengths $10^{10}-10^{15}$~G. However, our analysis of single photon magnetic pair production suggests that these photons are unlikely to escape, with the MeV band emerging as a promising observational window for precursor high-energy emission. In this framework, we construct high-energy emission skymaps and light curves, exploring observational implications. Finally, we propose potential precursor radio emission and delayed afterglow echoes from magnetized outflows, which may contribute to late-time re-brightening in short gamma-ray bursts or to orphan afterglows.</description>

      <title>Ultra-High-Energy Neutrinos from Primordial Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The KM3NeT Collaboration recently announced the detection of a neutrino with energy 220 PeV. The highest-energy neutrino ever measured, this observation is difficult to reconcile with known cosmic ray acceleration mechanisms. One possible source of ultra-high-energy particles is the rapid, violent emission of energetic Hawking radiation from a primordial black hole (PBH) near the end of its evaporation lifetime. Realistic formation mechanisms that would produce a population of PBHs very early in cosmic history yield a mass distribution with a power-law tail for small masses; members of such a population that formed with initial mass $M_* = 5.34 \times 10^{14} {\rm g}$ would be undergoing late-stage evaporation today. We find that recent high-energy neutrino events detected by the IceCube and KM3NeT Collaborations, with energies in the range ${\cal O} (1 - 10^2) \, {\rm PeV}$, are consistent with event-rate expectations if a significant fraction of the dark matter consists of PBHs that obey a well-motivated mass distribution compatible with current evaporation constraints.</description>

      <title>A comparison between best-fit eccentricity definitions and the standardized definition of eccentricity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the absence of a unique, gauge-independent definition of eccentricity in General Relativity, there have been efforts to standardize the definition for Gravitational-Wave astronomy. Recently, Shaikh et al. proposed a model-independent measurement of eccentricity $e_{\mathrm{gw}}$ from the phase evolution of the dominant mode. Many works use loss functions (LFs) to assign eccentricity to a reference waveform, for instance by fitting a Post-Newtonian expression to assign eccentricity to Numerical Relativity (NR) simulations. Therefore, we ask whether minimizing common LFs on gauge-dependent model parameters, such as the mismatch $\mathcal{M}$ or the $L_2$-norm of the dominant mode $h_{22}$ residuals, for non-precessing binaries, ensures a sufficient $e_{\mathrm{gw}}$ agreement. We use $10$ eccentric NR simulations and the eccentric waveform TEOBResumS-Dali as the parametric model to fit on eccentricity $e_0$ and reference frequency $f_0$. We first show that a minimized mismatch, the $\mathcal{M} \sim 10^{-3}- 10^{-2}$ results in better $e_{\mathrm{gw}}$ fractional differences ($\sim 1\%$) than with the minimized $h_{22}$ residuals. Nonetheless, for small eccentricity NR simulations $(e_{\mathrm{gw}} \lesssim 10^{-2}$), the mismatch can favor quasi-circular ($e_0=0$) best-fit models. Thus, with sufficiently long NR simulations, we can include $e_{\mathrm{gw}}$ in the LF. We explain why solely fitting with $e_{\mathrm{gw}}$ constitutes a degenerate problem. To circumvent these limitations, we propose to minimize a convex sum of $\mathcal{M}$ and the $e_{\mathrm{gw}}$ difference to both assign non-zero eccentric values to NR strains and to control the mismatch threshold.</description>

Abstract: Dark matter may accumulate in neutron stars given its gravitational interaction and abundance. We investigate the modification of neutron star properties and confront them with the observations in the context of strongly-interacting dark matter scenario, specifically for a QCD-like theory with G$_2$ gauge group for which a first-principles equation-of-state from lattice calculations is available. We study the impact of various observational constraints and modeling of the QCD equation of state on the combined neutron stars. The results indicate that dark matter masses of a few hundred MeV to a few GeV are consistent with the latest observed neutron star properties.</description>

      <title>ALeRCE light curve classifier: Tidal disruption event expansion pack</title>

Abstract: ALeRCE (Automatic Learning for the Rapid Classification of Events) processes the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) alert stream in preparation for the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, classifying objects using a broad taxonomy. The ALeRCE light curve classifier is a balanced random forest (BRF) algorithm with a two-level scheme that uses variability features from the ZTF alert stream and colors from AllWISE and ZTF photometry. This work presents an updated version of the ALeRCE broker light curve classifier that includes tidal disruption events (TDEs) as a new subclass. We incorporated 24 new features, including the distance to the nearest source detected in ZTF science images and a parametric model of the power-law decay for transients. The labeled set was expanded to 219792 spectroscopically classified sources, including 60 TDEs. To integrate TDEs into ALeRCE's taxonomy, we identified specific characteristics that distinguish them from other transients: their central position in a galaxy, their typical decay pattern when fully disrupted, and their lack of color variability after disruption. We developed features to separate TDEs from other transient events. The updated classifier improves performance across all classes and integrates the TDE class with 91 percent recall. It also identifies a large number of potential TDE candidates in the ZTF alert stream's unlabeled data.</description>

      <title>The cross-correlation between soft X-rays and galaxies A new benchmark for galaxy evolution models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article presents the construction and validation of complete stellar mass-selected, volume-limited galaxy samples using the Legacy Survey (data release 10) galaxy catalogs, covering $\sim16,800$ deg$^2$ of extra-galactic sky, and extending to redshift $z&lt;0.35$. We measure the correlation function of these galaxies with tiny statistical uncertainties at the percent level and systematic uncertainties up to 5\%. A 4-parameter halo occupation distribution (HOD) model is fitted to retrieve the population of host halos, yielding results on the stellar to halo mass relation consistent with the current models of galaxy formation and evolution. Using these complete galaxy samples, we measure and analyze the cross-correlation (X-corr) between galaxies and all soft X-ray photons observed by SRG/eROSITA in the 0.5-2 keV band over $\sim13,000$ deg$^2$. The cross correlation measurements have unprecedented sub-percent statistical uncertainty and ~5-10\% systematic uncertainty.
  An extension to the halo model is introduced to interpret the X-corr, decomposing contributions from X-ray point sources, hot gas (CGM), satellites, and the 2-halo term. For low stellar mass thresholds ($\log M^*/M_{\odot}&gt;$ 10, 10.25, 10.5), we find that the point source emission dominates the X-corr at small separation ($r&lt;80$kpc). Then, in the range ($80&lt;r&lt;2$Mpc), the emission from large halos hosting satellite galaxies dominates. Finally, on scales beyond that considered here ($r&gt;2$Mpc), the 2-halo term becomes dominant. Interestingly, there is no scale at which the CGM dominates. In the range ($20&lt;r&lt;200$kpc), the CGM contributes to more than 10\% of the signal. Progressively, with the minimum stellar mass increasing, the CGM emission increases. We constrain the $M_{500c}-L_X$ scaling relation slope, $1.629^{+0.091}_{-0.089}$, at the 5\% level using the samples with the lowest mass threshold.</description>

      <title>Picolensing as a Probe of Primordial Black Hole Dark Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12947v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The gravitational-lensing parallax of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) is an intriguing probe of primordial black hole (PBH) dark matter in the asteroid-mass window, $2\times 10^{-16}M_{\odot} \lesssim M_{\text{PBH}} \lesssim 5 \times 10^{-12}M_{\odot}$. Recent work in the literature has shown exciting potential reach for this "picolensing" signal if a future space mission were to fly two x-/$\gamma$-ray detectors in the Swift/BAT class, with inter-spacecraft separation baselines on the order of the Earth-Moon distance. We revisit these projections with a view to understanding their robustness to various uncertainties related to GRBs. Most importantly, we investigate the impact of uncertainties in observed GRB angular sizes on reach projections for a future mission. Overall, we confirm that picolensing shows great promise to explore the asteroid-mass window; however, we find that previous studies may have been too optimistic with regard to the baselines required. Detector baselines on the order of at least the Earth-L2 distance would make such a mission more robust to GRB size uncertainties; baselines on the order of an astronomical unit (AU) would additionally enable reach that equals or exceeds existing microlensing constraints up to $M_{\text{PBH}} \sim 2 \times 10^{-8} M_{\odot}$.</description>

      <title>A Multiwavelength Autopsy of the Interacting IIn Supernova 2020ywx: Tracing its Progenitor Mass-Loss History for 100 Years before Death</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06914v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While the subclass of interacting supernovae with narrow hydrogen emission lines (SNe IIn) consists of some of the longest-lasting and brightest SNe ever discovered, their progenitors are still not well understood. Investigating SNe IIn as they emit across the electromagnetic spectrum is the most robust way to understand the progenitor evolution before the explosion. This work presents X-Ray, optical, infrared, and radio observations of the strongly interacting Type IIn SN 2020ywx covering a period $&gt;1200$ days after discovery. Through multiwavelength modeling, we find that the progenitor of 2020ywx was losing mass at $\sim10^{-2}$--$10^{-3} \mathrm{\,M_{\odot}\,yr^{-1}}$ for at least 100 yrs pre-explosion using the circumstellar medium (CSM) speed of 120 km/s measured from our optical and NIR spectra. Despite the similar magnitude of mass loss measured in different wavelength ranges, we find discrepancies between the X-ray and optical/radio-derived mass-loss evolution, which suggest asymmetries in the CSM. Furthermore, we find evidence for dust formation due to the combination of a growing blueshift in optical emission lines and near-infrared continuum emission which we fit with blackbodies at $\sim$ 1000 K. Based on the observed elevated mass loss over more than 100 years and the configuration of the CSM inferred from the multiwavelength observations, we invoke binary interaction as the most plausible mechanism to explain the overall mass-loss evolution. SN 2020ywx is thus a case that may support the growing observational consensus that SNe IIn mass loss is explained by binary interaction.</description>

      <title>The rate of extreme coronal line emitters in the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey LOWZ sample</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14022v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extreme coronal line emitters (ECLEs) are a rare class of galaxy that exhibit strong, high-ionization iron coronal emission lines in their spectra. In some cases, these lines are transient and may be the result of tidal disruption event (TDEs). To test this connection, we calculate the rate of variable ECLEs (vECLEs) at redshift $\sim0.3$. We search for ECLEs in the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) LOWZ sample and discover two candidate ECLEs. Using follow-up spectra from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument and Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph, and mid-infrared observations from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, we determine that one of these galaxies is a vECLE. Using this galaxy, we calculate the galaxy-normalized vECLE rate at redshift $\sim0.3$ to be $R_\mathrm{G}=1.6~^{+3.8}_{-1.4}\times10^{-6}~\mathrm{galaxy}^{-1}~\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ and the mass-normalized rate to be $R_\mathrm{M}=7~^{+16}_{-6}\times10^{-18}~\mathrm{M_\odot^{-1}}~\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$. This is then converted to a volumetric rate of $R_\mathrm{V}=1.8~^{+4.5}_{-1.5}\times10^{-9}~\mathrm{Mpc}^{-3}~\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$. Formally, the LOWZ vECLE rates are $2-4$ times lower than the rates calculated from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Legacy sample at redshift $\sim0.1$. However, given the large uncertainties on both measurements, they are consistent with each other at $1\sigma$. Both the galaxy-normalized and volumetric rates are one to two orders of magnitude lower than TDE rates from the literature, consistent with vECLEs being caused by $5-20$ per cent of all TDEs.</description>

      <title>A Catalog of Local Universe Fast Radio Bursts from CHIME/FRB and the KKO Outrigger</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11217v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first catalog of fast radio burst (FRB) host galaxies from CHIME/FRB Outriggers, selected uniformly in the radio and the optical by localizing 81 new bursts to 2'' x ~60'' accuracy using CHIME and the KKO Outrigger, located 66 km from CHIME. Of the 81 localized bursts, we use the Probabilistic Association of Transients to their Hosts (PATH) algorithm to securely identify 21 new FRB host galaxies, and compile spectroscopic redshifts for 19 systems, 15 of which are newly obtained via spectroscopic observations. The most nearby source is FRB 20231229A, at a distance of 90 Mpc. One burst in our sample is from a previously reported repeating source in a galaxy merger (FRB 20190303A). Three new FRB host galaxies (FRBs 20230203A, 20230703A, and 20231206A) are found towards X-ray and optically selected galaxy clusters, potentially doubling the sample of known galaxy cluster FRBs. A search for radio counterparts reveals that FRB 20231128A is associated with a luminous persistent radio source (PRS) candidate with high significance ($P_{cc} \sim 10^{-2}$). If its compactness is confirmed, it would be the nearest known compact PRS at $z = 0.1079$. Our catalog significantly increases the statistics of the Macquart relation at low redshifts ($z &lt; 0.2$). In the near future, the completed CHIME/FRB Outriggers array will produce hundreds of FRBs localized with very long baseline interferometry (VLBI). This will significantly expand the known sample and pave the way for future telescopes relying on VLBI for FRB localization.</description>

      <title>Detection of [C I] Emission in Nebular Spectra of a Peculiar Type Ia Supernova 2022pul</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18900v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: SN 2022pul gains special attention due to its possible origin of a super-Chandarsekhar-mass white dwarf explosion (or called a 03fg-like type Ia supernova), which shows prominent [O I], [Ne II], and [Ca II] lines in its late-time spectra taken at $\sim+$300 days after the peak brightness. In this paper, we present new optical observations for this peculiar object, extending up to over 500 days after the peak brightness. In particular, in the $t\approx+515$ days spectrum, we identified for the first time the presence of narrow emission from [C I] $\lambda\lambda9824, 9850$, which appears asymmetric and quite similar to the accompanied [O I] $\lambda6300$ line in strength and profile. Based on the violent merger model that accounts well for previous observations but leaves little carbon in the center of the ejecta, this carbon line can be reproduced by increasing the degree of clumping in the ejecta and setting the carbon mass the same as that of oxygen ($\sim$0.06 $M_{\odot}$) in the innermost region ($\lesssim 2000$ km s$^{-1}$). In principle, the central carbon could come from the secondary white dwarf (WD) if it is ignited when hit by the shockwave of the explosion of the primary WD and explodes as a Ca-rich supernova, whereas pure deflagration of a super-Chandarsekhar-mass WD can account for such unburnt carbon more naturally.</description>

      <title>Discrete treatment of inverse Compton scattering: implications on parameter estimation in gamma-ray astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15052v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In gamma-ray astronomy and cosmic-ray physics, the continuous approximation of inverse Compton scattering (ICS) is widely adopted to model the evolution of electron energy. However, when the initial electron energy approaches $\sim100$ TeV, the discrete nature of ICS becomes prominent, and the energy of evolved electrons should be considered as a broad distribution rather than a deterministic value. By simulating the evolution paths of individual electrons under ICS, we capture this discrete nature and demonstrate that when the electron injection spectrum exhibits a high-energy cutoff, the correct discrete treatment yields a higher cutoff energy in the evolved spectrum compared to the continuous approximation. Applying the discrete ICS treatment to interpret the gamma-ray spectrum of the Geminga pulsar halo measured by HAWC, we find that the inferred cutoff energy of the injection spectrum is correspondingly lower than that derived using the continuous approximation at a $95\%$ confidence level. This suggests that the systematic bias introduced by the approximation has exceeded the measurement precision. We also expect the application of the discrete ICS correction in the PeV regime using the ultra-high-energy gamma-ray source 1LHAASO J1954+2836u as a case study, pointing out that adopting the continuous approximation may considerably overestimate the electron acceleration capability of the source.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17206v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dark matter heating in planets has been proposed as a potential probe for dark matter detection. Assuming near-equilibrium, we find that dark matter energy input raises planetary temperature and accelerates rotation. The energy distribution depends on planetary properties and external input, suggesting that previous studies have overestimated its heating effect. When dark matter density is high, planetary rotation stabilizes earlier and is primarily governed by dark matter. For Earth, our model predicts a 0.015 K temperature increase and a $10^{-8}$ rad/s angular velocity increase over 100 years.</description>

      <title>$\mu$-GLANCE: A Novel Technique to Detect Chromatically and Achromatically Lensed Gravitational Wave Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06995v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational microlensing in the wave-optics (WO) regime occurs when the Schwarzschild radius of a lensing object is comparable to or smaller than the wavelength of incoming gravitational waves (GWs), producing chromatic amplitude and phase modulations. In contrary, geometric optics effects happen when wavelength is much smaller than the lensing object leading to frequency independent amplifications and phase shifts. GWs can undergo both effects of lensing due to interactions with objects of different scales. To detect and characterize the wave-optics features from a lensed GW, we have developed a novel method \texttt{$\mu$-GLANCE} (Micro-Gravitational Lensing Authenticator using Non-modelled Cross-correlation Exploration). In this technique, we calculate the cross-correlation between the residuals from different detectors. We assign a false alarm rate to each potential WO microlensed candidate from a statistical viewpoint, depending on how many times the noise cross-correlation matches the strength of the residual cross-correlation of the candidate over a certain period of time. We show that for an event with a matched-filtering signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) close to thirty, a residual due to wave-optics lensing with an amplitude about $10\%$ of magnification $\mu\approx 3.2$ will start to show deviation from noise distribution at more than $68\%$ Confidence interval with the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA sensitivity for the fourth observation run. This method provides the first technique to detect geometric optics and wave-optics effects from a WO microlensed GW without assuming any specific lensing model, and its application on the current and future GW data can identify events with both chromatic and achromatic lensed scenarios.</description>

      <title>Effects of dark boson mediated feeble interaction between dark matter (DM) and quark matter on $f$-mode oscillation of DM admixed quark stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20923v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the behavior of the prominent non-radial fundamental $f$-mode oscillations of dark matter (DM) admixed strange quark stars (DMSQSs), by adopting an equation of state (EoS) developed in Ref.~\cite{Sen:2022pfr}, which considers the possible presence of feebly interacting DM in strange quark stars (SQSs) for the first time. Within the model, feeble interaction between fermionic DM $\chi$ and strange quark matter (SQM) is invoked via a vector new physics mediator $\xi$ with coupling strength $y_{\xi}$. The pure SQM is described by the vector MIT Bag model. By varying different EoS parameters, the structural properties viz. the mass, radius and tidal deformability ($\Lambda$) of the DMSQSs are studied with respect to various astrophysical constraints. We study in detail the $f$-mode spectra within the Cowling approximation by obtaining the frequencies as a function of mass, compactness and $\Lambda$ of the star. To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first analysis of non-radial $f$-mode oscillations of DMSQSs. Our investigation indicates that the presence of DM and its interaction with SQM has great impact on the $f$-modes. We show that the $f$-mode frequencies are larger for DMSQSs, which are largely populated with massive DM fermions, compared to the SQSs. Further, we obtain a linear empirical relation between the $f$-modes and the average density of the star. We also find that the mass-scaled angular frequency varies universally with compactness and $\ln{\Lambda}$ for DMSQSs. Further, our studies indicate that the inclusion of DM in compact stars reduces the deviation of $f$-mode frequency from general relativistic to Cowling approximation.</description>

      <title>Association between Recurrent Novae and Nova Super-Remnants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17652v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nova super-remnants (NSRs) are substantially extended structures (up to ~130 parsecs across) encompassing recurrent novae. NSRs grow as a result of frequent nova eruptions transporting vast quantities of the locally surrounding interstellar medium away from the binary system over many millennia into a thin high-density shell, as the central white dwarf grows towards the Chandrasekhar limit. The prototypical NSR, first identified as such in 2014, is situated in the Andromeda Galaxy and belongs to the annually erupting nova, M31N 2008-12a (or '12a'). In this short review, modelling of evolving NSRs (including the 12a NSR) will be outlined as motivation towards searching for more of these phenomena in the Galaxy and beyond. The latest developments in this upcoming subfield of nova research will then be presented including the discovery of two new Galactic nova super-remnants (and their consequent modelling) and the first survey undertaken with the sole purpose of finding NSRs in the Andromeda Galaxy and the Large Magellanic Cloud.</description>

      <title>Extended mass and spheroidal deformation effects on epicyclic frequencies and periapsis shift in quasi-circular orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13334v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of extended mass and spheroidal deformation on the periapsis shift of quasi-circular orbits inside a gravitating mass distribution in the Newtonian framework. Focusing on the internal gravitational potential of a spheroidal body with both homogeneous and inhomogeneous density profiles, we elucidate how the ratio of local density to average density governs the extended mass effect on the periapsis shift. By analyzing the orbital angular frequency, along with the radial and vertical epicyclic frequencies, we demonstrate that in the uniform density case (i.e., the Maclaurin spheroid), where the potential takes the form of a harmonic oscillator, the periapsis exhibits a constant retrograde shift of $-\pi$. In contrast, in regions where density inhomogeneity and spheroidal deformation (in both prolate and oblate forms) are significant, the periapsis shift varies with the guiding orbital radius due to local density contrast and deformation effects. The results indicate that oblate deformation suppresses the extended mass effect associated with the ratio of local density to average density, whereas prolate deformation amplifies it. Furthermore, by varying the density distribution parameters, we establish the conditions for orbital stability and identify the emergence of marginally stable orbits.</description>
