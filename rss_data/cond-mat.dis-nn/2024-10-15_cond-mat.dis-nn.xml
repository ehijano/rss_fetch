      <title>Electrical Transport in Tunably-Disordered Metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Naturally occurring materials are often disordered, with their bulk properties being challenging to predict from the structure, due to the lack of underlying crystalline axes. In this paper, we develop a digital pipeline from algorithmically-created configurations with tunable disorder to 3D printed materials, as a tool to aid in the study of such materials, using electrical resistance as a test case. The designed material begins with a random point cloud that is iteratively evolved using Lloyd's algorithm to approach uniformity, with the points being connected via a Delaunay triangulation to form a disordered network metamaterial. Utilizing laser powder bed fusion additive manufacturing with stainless steel 17-4 PH and titanium alloy Ti-6Al-4V, we are able to experimentally measure the bulk electrical resistivity of the disordered network. We found that the graph Laplacian accurately predicts the effective resistance of the structure, but is highly sensitive to anisotropy and global network topology, preventing a single network statistic or disorder characterization from predicting global resistivity.</description>

      <title>Observable Measurement-Induced Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the main postulates of quantum mechanics is that measurements destroy quantum coherence (wave function collapse). Recently it was discovered that in a many-body system dilute local measurements still preserve some coherence across the entire system. As the measurement density is increased, a phase transition occurs that is characterized by the disentanglement of different parts of the system. Unfortunately, this transition is impossible to observe experimentally for macroscopic systems because it requires an exponentially costly full tomography of the many-body wave function or a comparison with the simulation on an oracle classical computer. In this work we report the discovery of another measurement-induced phase transition that can be observed experimentally if quantum dynamics can be reversed. On one side of this phase transition the quantum information encoded in some part of the Hilbert space is fully recovered after the time inversion. On the other side, all quantum information is corrupted. This transition also manifests itself as the change in the behavior of the probability to observe the same measurement outcome in the process that consists of identical blocks repeated many times. In each block the unitary evolution is followed by the measurement. On one side of the transition the probability decreases exponentially with the number of repetitions, on the other it tends to a constant as the number of repetitions is increased. We confirm the existence of the proposed phase transition through numerical simulations of realistic quantum circuits and analytical calculations using an effective random-matrix theory model.</description>

      <title>Universal Characterization of Quantum Many-Body States through Local Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a universal framework for classifying quantum states based on their scale-resolved correlation structure. Using the recently introduced information lattice, which provides an operational definition of the total amount of correlations at each scale, we define intrinsic characteristic length scales of quantum states. We analyze ground and midspectrum eigenstates of the disordered interacting Kitaev chain, showing that our framework provides a novel unbiased approach to quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Reentrant Non-Hermitian Skin Effect Induced by Correlated Disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03777v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interplay of non-Hermiticity and disorder drastically influences the system's localization properties, giving rise to intriguing quantum phenomena. Although the intrinsic non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) is robust against weak disorder even in a one-dimensional system, it becomes Anderson localization under strong disorder. Here, we study an Anderson localization-delocalization transition by coupling a strongly disordered Hatano-Nelson (HN) chain to a disordered Hermitian chain with their disorders anti-symmetrically correlated with each other. Regardless of the disorder strength, as the inter-chain coupling strength increases, an Anderson delocalization can occur. This leads to a reentrant NHSE due to the interplay of nonreciprocal hopping and correlated disorder. Furthermore, the Anderson localization-delocalization transition is well captured by the real-space winding number. This reentrant NHSE, under anti-symmetric disorder, is a remarkably nontrivial physical phenomenon without a Hermitian counterpart. We then experimentally test this phenomenology by implementing our model in electrical circuits, and observe the reentrant NHSE by measuring the voltage response.</description>
