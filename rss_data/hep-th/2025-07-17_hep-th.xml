      <title>Coherent State Path Integral Reveals Unexpected Vacuum Structure in Thermal Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct the path integral formulation of the partition function for a free scalar thermal field theory using coherent states, first in the ladder operator basis and then in the field operator basis. In so doing, we provide for the first time a mapping in quantum field theory between the field-basis coherent states and ladder-basis coherent states. Using either basis, one finds terms missed in the usual path integral derivation, which we identify as the vacuum energy contribution to the partition function. We then extend the field-basis coherent state method to the interacting $\phi^4$ theory. In addition to the vacuum energy contribution, one finds a coupling of a vacuum expectation value to the mass term that is absent in the existing literature.</description>

      <title>Non-supersymmetric branes and discrete topological terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent work, Tachikawa and Zhang proved the existence of a discrete topological term in the unique non-supersymmetric heterotic string with no tachyons in ten dimensions. This theory features NS5-branes, whose chiral degrees of freedom are not well-understood due to the absence of dualities or supersymmetry. In this paper, we test the consistency of a tentative spectrum obtained by anomaly inflow, studying the relation between the worldvolume theory and the discrete topological term in spacetime. Furthermore, we conduct a bottom-up investigation of lower-dimensional gravitational theories with the same methods.</description>

      <title>Competing color superconductivity and color Kondo effect in quark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The competition between bulk color superconductivity and the localized screening of a heavy quark impurity, analogous to the Kondo effect, leads to a rich spectrum of phenomena in dense quark matter. We investigate this competition at the edge of a superconducting quark bulk, where both the superconducting gap and the Kondo scale are dynamically generated in a tractable toy model. Utilizing the exact Bethe Ansatz method, we elucidate the resulting boundary physics. We identify distinct regimes characterized by either multi-particle Kondo screening or an unscreened local moment. Crucially, we also uncover a novel intermediate phase featuring impurity screening through a single-particle bound state formed within the superconducting gap. The toy model presented in this work highlights the complex interplay between dynamically generated bulk properties and boundary impurities in extreme QCD environments, offering potential insights into phenomena occurring in heavy-ion collisions and compact stars.</description>

      <title>Testing the effective action approach to bubble nucleation in holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nucleation of bubbles during a first-order phase transition has recently been explored using holographic duality, which can provide an important complement to standard perturbative methods. These computations typically require finding static and spatially inhomogeneous saddle points, known as critical bubbles, which correspond in the gravitational dual to solutions of nonlinear partial differential equations. A computationally simpler alternative is to use the gravitational dual to derive the effective action of the boundary theory in a derivative expansion, and then solve the resulting lower-dimensional equations of motion. Once the effective action, typically truncated at two derivatives, is obtained, the holographic theory can be set aside, and bubble solutions can be found from ordinary differential equations. In this paper, we test this approach in a simple holographic setup: a probe scalar field in a black brane background with nonlinear multi-trace boundary conditions. We compute critical bubble solutions both from the effective action and by solving the full gravitational equations, and find good agreement between the two methods.</description>

      <title>Rotating frames from quantum deformed spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a sense of deformation quantization, noncommutative (NC) geometry introduces a quantum structure of spacetime. Using the twist-deformation formalism, we show that the dynamical effects of spacetime noncommutativity can amount to a transition to a rotating frame of reference. In particular, we study the dynamics of charged matter (scalars and spinors) on the background of Melvin's electric universe in the framework of NC gauge field theory. Melvin's electric/magnetic universe is a static, axially symmetric solution of the Einstein-Maxwell equations, representing a parallel bundle of self-gravitating electric/magnetic flux. Due to its axial symmetry, it allows for a very special kind of Killing twist that does not deform the metric itself but only the gauge field and the matter fields. Focusing on the perturbative NC equations of motion for charged scalars and Dirac spinors coupled to Melvin's electric background, we show that they have the same form as the corresponding classical (commutative) equations of motion coupled to the same geometric background but in a uniformly rotating frame whose angular velocity is determined by the NC scale and the electric charge of the matter field. In principle, this NC rotation effect can be experimentally tested by setting up the Sagnac interferometry apparatus to measure the Sagnac phase shift for charged versus electrically neutral particles, thus placing a bound on the scale of spacetime noncommutativity.</description>

      <title>Conformal Turaev-Viro Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define and study Conformal Turaev-Viro (CTV) theory, a dual formulation of Virasoro TQFT based on triangulating 3-manifolds with tetrahedra. Edges of the triangulation are labeled by continuous conformal weights, and tetrahedra are glued together weighted by the Cardy density of states. We demonstrate that the CTV partition function is equal to the modular S-transform of the Virasoro TQFT amplitude-squared, $|Z_{Vir}|^2$. This is analogous to a known result for discrete spin networks. The derivation uses a variant of the chain-mail formalism, adapted to the Virasoro context. As a CFT application, we derive formulae for the S-transforms of the squared Virasoro crossing kernels. These results lay the topological foundation to study the exact path integral of pure AdS$_3$ quantum gravity by triangulations.</description>

      <title>WZW Partition Functions from Supersymmetric Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a conjecture of Murthy and Witten which expresses modular invariant WZW partition functions as lattice sums. We show that when the sum is over the root lattice of SU(N), the result correctly reproduces the diagonal modular invariants of SU(N)_k whenever N &gt; 2 and N + k is even. Beyond these cases, the proposition is not always true and we provide a counterexample when k &gt;&gt; N &gt; 2 and k + N is odd. This proof generalizes the proof by Murthy and Witten for the SU(2) case. We then move onto nondiagonal modular invariants and show that all SU(2)_k nondiagonal invariants (the D and the E-series) can be obtained using these lattice sums.</description>

      <title>Recursive relations for the S-matrix of Liouville theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the relation between the vertex operators of the in and out fields in Liouville theory. This is used to derive equations for the S-matrix, from which a recursive relation for the normal symbol of the S-matrix for discrete center-of-mass momenta is obtained. Its solution is expressed as multiple contour-integrals of a generalized Dotsenko-Fateev type. This agrees with the functional integral representation of the scattering matrix of Liouville theory which we had proposed previously.</description>

Using these, we propose the mirror Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz equations which describe the spectrum of the model at any string tension.</description>

      <title>The asymptotically-free gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show how to classify the asymptotically-free gauge theories in four spacetime dimensions, focussing here on the case of purely fermionic matter. The classification depends on the fact (which we prove) that both the dimension and Dynkin index of irreducible representations of a simple Lie algebra are strictly increasing functions of each Dynkin label. This implies not only that the number of asymptotically-free representations of any one semisimple Lie algebra is finite, but also that they can be written down in a systematic fashion using tables for the asymptotically-free irreducible representations of simple Lie algebras, which we supply. These tables show that at most two out of a possible ten Dynkin labels can be non-zero and that no Dynkin label can exceed four. The extension to bosonic matter or supersymmetric theories is straightforward.</description>

      <title>The AdS/$\mathsf{C}$-$\mathsf{P}$-${\mathsf T}$ Correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the realization of $\mathsf{C}$, $\mathsf{P}$, $\mathsf{T}$ in ${\cal N}=4$ SYM - corresponding to charge conjugation, parity, and time-reversal - and identify the $\mathsf{C}$, $\mathsf{P}$, $\mathsf{T}$ global symmetries of ${\cal N}=4$ SYM with bulk (gauge) symmetries of string theory on $AdS_5\times S^5$. The dual bulk transformations are symmetries of Type IIB string theory on $AdS_5\times S^5$ that combine string worldsheet symmetries, with geometric transformations acting on $AdS_5\times S^5$. We show that $\mathsf P$ and $\mathsf T$ map to $\mathsf{CP}$ and $\mathsf{CT}$ under $S$-duality (combined with an $SU(4)$ R-symmetry outer automorphism), while $\mathsf C$ and $ \mathsf{CPT}$ are invariant. We also define a chiral, codimension-two surface defect in ${\cal N}=4$ SYM associated with charge conjugation, and provide its bulk $AdS_5\times S^5$ dual gravitational description. We discuss the relation between symmetries on the string worldsheet and symmetries of target space string field theory, global vs gauge symmetries in quantum gravity, among related topics. Defects in ${\cal N}=4$ SYM and in quantum gravity play a central role in this work.</description>

      <title>When CP requires $\bar\theta=0$, not $\bar\theta=\pi$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Imposing CP or P forces the QCD topological angle to be either $\bar\theta=0$ or $\bar\theta=\pi$. However, only the former is phenomenologically viable. This implies that the assumption of CP or P alone cannot provide a framework for unambiguously solving the Strong CP problem. We show that $\bar\theta=0$ is naturally selected when the assumption of CP is combined with the hypothesis that the Standard Model is embedded in a suitable gauge group.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Standard Model of particle physics is derived from first principles starting from the free Dirac Lagrangian. All known fermionic particle species plus three right handed neutrinos are obtained from ideals of a $C\ell_{8}$ algebra, with gauge symmetries arising as rotations of creation-annihilation operators and vacua. Triality originates both the strong force and three particle families with a mass hierarchy. Lorentz and gauge transformations are unified while avoiding the Coleman-Mandula theorem. Chirality stems unavoidably from rotations leaving the vacua invariant, with a predicted Weinberg angle of $\sin^2(\theta_W)=3/8$. The theory is anomaly-free and devoid of proton decay.</description>

      <title>Color field configuration between three static quarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Within Yang-Mills-Proca theory with external sources, regular, finite energy solutions are obtained. It is shown that color electric/magnetic fields have two components: the first part is a gradient/curl component, respectively, and the second part is a nonlinear component. It is shown that the color electric field has a Y-like spatial distribution. Such a Y-like behavior arises because the gradient component of the electric field is present. The nonlinear component of the electric field is a curl one, and it appears because the vector potential sourced by a solenoidal current is present. The color magnetic field is purely curl one, since its nonzero color components do not contain a nonlinear component; this results in the fact that its force lines lie on the surface of a torus. It is shown that the results obtained are in good agreement with the results obtained in lattice calculations in quantum chromodynamics. To discuss such an agreement, we consider a procedure of nonperturbative quantization and discuss possible approximations ensuring such an agreement. Also, we compare the energy profile obtained by us with that obtained in lattice calculations with a static potential.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of higher-order fermionic deformations in multiflavor Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory. Focusing specifically on the 6- and 8-fermion interactions, we show that these terms can have significant consequences on the dynamics of the system. In certain regions of parameter space, the theory continues to exhibit second-order phase transitions with mean-field critical exponents and the same critical temperature; however, the temperature dependence of the superconducting gap can deviate markedly from conventional BCS behavior. In other regions, the theory exhibits first-order phase transitions or second-order phase transitions with non-mean field exponents. We conclude by discussing potential phenomenological applications of these theories.</description>

      <title>QED-IR as Topological Quantum Theory of Dressed States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate quantum electrodynamics in the infrared regime (QED-IR) using the adiabatic approximation and the framework of the functional Berry phase. In this approach, the physical state space is exact, nonperturbatively dressed, and endowed with a topological structure. Electrons do not exist as bare particles, but as topologically protected electron-photon clouds, defining a new kind of infrared quantum. These clouds are weakly bound in energy -- with a binding scale estimated at \( \Lambda_{\text{IR}} \sim 0.2 \, \text{eV} \) -- and remain stable provided photon energies remain below this threshold. Crucially, the theory becomes exactly solvable in this regime due to the quantization of the functional Berry flux, which governs the infrared dynamics of the dressed states.
  When hard (high-energy) processes are involved, this topological protection is lifted, and the theory smoothly recovers conventional perturbative QED. In contrast, in the deep infrared, the electromagnetic interaction never fully vanishes, leading to observable effects. We argue that the energy required to dissolve the infrared electron-photon cloud in QED is approximately \( 0.2 \, \text{eV} \), well above the thermal energy of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). However, the observed temperature anisotropies correspond to fluctuations near \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \), which may lie at the threshold for perturbing, but not destroying, the topological structure of the dressed state. This suggests that CMB deviations could reflect residual topological imprints of the functional infrared dynamics. Finally, we propose that analogous cloud-like structures may manifest in other quantum systems governed by low-energy photon dynamics, such as atomic and molecular environments.</description>

      <title>\nu-QSSEP: A toy model for entanglement spreading in stochastic diffusive quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate out-of-equilibrium entanglement dynamics in a generalization of the so-called $QSSEP$ model, which is a free-fermion chain with stochastic in space and time hopping amplitudes. In our setup, the noisy amplitudes are spatially-modulated satisfying a $\nu$-site translation invariance but retaining their randomness in time. For each noise realization, the dynamics preserves Gaussianity, which allows to obtain noise-averaged entanglement-related quantities. The statistics of the steady-state correlators satisfy nontrivial relationships that are of topological nature. They reflect the Haar invariance under multiplication with structured momentum-dependent random $SU(\nu)$ matrices. We discuss in detail the case with $\nu=1$ and $\nu=2$. For $\nu=1$, i.e., spatially homogeneous noise we show that the entanglement dynamics is describable by a stochastic generalization of the quasiparticle picture. Precisely, entanglement is propagated by pairs of quasiparticles. The entanglement content of the pairs is the same as for the deterministic chain. However, the trajectories of the quasiparticles are random walks, giving rise to diffusive entanglement growth.</description>

      <title>Inflation in Myrzakulov $F(R,T)$ Gravity: A Comparative Study in Metric, Symmetric Teleparallel, and Weitzenb\"{o}ck Formalisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a unified treatment of cosmic inflation within the framework of Myrzakulov Gravity, exploring its realization in three different formalisms: metric (curvature-based), teleparallel (torsion-based), and symmetric teleparallel (non-metricity-based). For each case, we derive the corresponding field equations in a flat FLRW background, study inflationary solutions driven by a scalar field, and compute observable quantities such as the scalar spectral index \( n_s \) and the tensor-to-scalar ratio \( r \). In addition to these geometric sectors, we extend our analysis to the more general and dynamically richer Myrzakulov \( F(R,T) \) gravity, which incorporates both curvature \( R \) and torsion \( T \) in a unified action. We derive the inflationary dynamics in this hybrid model and investigate how it interpolates between pure \( f(R) \) and \( f(T) \) behaviors. The resulting framework allows for enhanced flexibility in matching Planck and BICEP/Keck observational constraints. We present analytic estimates and schematic predictions in the \( n_s \)--\( r \) plane, demonstrating that appropriately chosen parameters in \( F(R,T) \) models can produce viable and distinguishable inflationary signatures. This comparative and extended study highlights the potential of Myrzakulov Gravity and its generalizations to provide a consistent and geometrically motivated description of the early universe, with predictive power across different formulations of spacetime geometry.</description>

      <title>Instability of regular planar black holes in four dimensions arising from an infinite sum of curvature corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In four-dimensional scalar-tensor theories derived via dimensional regularization with a conformal rescaling of the metric, we study the stability of planar black holes (BHs) whose horizons are described by two-dimensional compact Einstein spaces with vanishing curvature. By taking an infinite sum of Lovelock curvature invariants, it is possible to construct BH solutions whose metric components remain nonsingular at $r=0$, with a scalar-field derivative given by $\phi'(r)=1/r$, where $r$ is the radial coordinate. We show that such BH solutions suffer from a strong coupling problem, where the kinetic term of the even-parity scalar-field perturbation associated with the timelike coordinate vanishes everywhere. Moreover, we find that these BHs are subject to both ghost and Laplacian instabilities for odd-parity perturbations near $r=0$. Consequently, the presence of these pathological features rules out regular planar BHs with the scalar-field profile $\phi'(r)=1/r$ as physically viable and stable configurations.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of BTZ-type charged black holes in Bopp Podolsky electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We tested the thermodynamic properties of charged BTZ-type black holes (BHs) in the framework of Bopp Podolsky electrodynamics, a higher derivative extension of Maxwells theory that preserves gauge invariance while introducing a massive photon mode. Using a perturbative approach, we derive first and second order corrections to the metric and electric field, revealing how the Bopp Podolsky parameter b modifies the geometry and horizon structure. Unlike in four dimensional illustrations, where such corrections can lead to wormhole solutions, the (2+1)dimensional case retains a black hole interpretation, albeit with curvature dependent deformations that vanish asymptotically. We compute the Hawking temperature via the Hamilton Jacobi tunneling method, demonstrating its dependence on both the cosmological constant and the Bopp Podolsky coupling. Our results indicate that while energy conditions are marginally violated for certain parameter regimes, the BHs thermodynamic behavior remains well-defined, with temperature corrections emerging from the interplay between higher derivative electrodynamics and the lower dimensional gravitational background.</description>

      <title>A thermofield-double model of Uhlmann anholonomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A simple parametrized family of quantum systems consisting of two entangled subsystems, dubbed left and right ones, both of them featuring N qubits is considered in the thermofield double formalism. We assume that the system evolves in a purely geometric manner based on the parallel transport condition due to Uhlmann. We explore the different interpretations of this evolution relative to observers either coupled to the left or to the right subsystems. The Uhlmann condition breaks the symmetry between left and right by regarding one of the two possible sets of local unitary operations as gauge degrees of freedom. Then gauging the right side we show that the geometric evolution on the left manifests itself via certain local operations reminiscent of non-unitary filtering measurements. On the other hand on the right the basic evolutionary steps are organized into a sequence of unitary operations of a holonomic quantum computation. We calculate the Uhlmann connection governing the transport for our model which turns out to be related to higher dimensional instantons. Then we evaluate the anholonomy of the connection for geodesic triangles with geodesic segments defined with respect to the Bures metric. By analysing the explicit form of the local filtering measurements showing up on the left side we realize that they are also optimal measurements for distinguishing two given mixed states in the statistical sense. We also point out that by conducting an interference experiment on the right side one can observe the physical effects of the anholonomic quantum computation. We demonstrate this by calculating explicit examples for phase shifts and visibility patterns arising in such interference experiments. Finally a sequence of geodesic triangles producing the iSWAP gate via anholonomy needed for computational universality is presented.</description>

      <title>Matter-Antimatter Asymmetry in a Rotating Universe I: Conceptual Foundations and the Dirac Field in Bianchi IX Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The standard $\Lambda$CDM model, based on the highly symmetric FLRW geometry, has successfully explained a wide range of cosmological observations. However, it faces unresolved issues, including CMB anomalies, the nature of dark matter, and the matter-antimatter asymmetry. These challenges highlight the limitations of the standard framework and raise questions about the validity of the assumed isotropic background geometry. A natural direction is to explore more general cosmological models that relax this assumption, potentially offering new insights into these problems. In this work, we examine a geometric approach to investigating the matter-antimatter asymmetry, grounded not in physics beyond the Standard Model, but in the structure of spacetime itself. While related questions have been raised previously in specific contexts, here we focus on the Bianchi IX cosmological model, motivated by its relevance to early-universe dynamics through the BKL conjecture and its potential role in generating angular momentum via global rotation. We study the Dirac spinor field in this background and derive the corresponding Dirac equation. Our goal is to investigate how spatial anisotropies and rotation can induce spectral asymmetries between particles and antiparticles. This paper lays the groundwork for a follow-up study analyzing specific solutions and their physical implications on matter-antimatter asymmetry.</description>

      <title>Emergent Symmetry and Phase Transitions on the Domain Wall of $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ Topological Orders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The one-dimensional (1D) domain wall of 2D $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ topological orders is studied theoretically. The Ising domain wall model is shown to have an emergent SU(2)$_{1}$ conformal symmetry because of a hidden nonsymmorphic octahedral symmetry. While a weak magnetic field is an irrelevant perturbation to the bulk topological orders, it induces a domain wall transition from the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid to a ferromagnetic order, which spontaneously breaks the anomalous $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ symmetry and the time-reversal symmetry on the domain wall. Moreover, the gapless domain wall state also realizes a 1D topological quantum critical point between a $\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{T}$-symmetry-protected topological phase and a trivial phase, thus demonstrating the holographic construction of topological transitions.</description>

      <title>Bias with a Timer: Axion Domain Wall Decay and Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the interplay of the post-inflationary QCD axion and a light scalar field for the axion domain wall decay and dark matter (DM). The scalar field possesses a nonzero vacuum expectation value (VEV) during inflation, so that its interaction with the axion effectively serves as an explicit Peccei-Quinn (PQ) violating term. At a temperature below the PQ phase transition, the effective PQ violating interaction generates the axion potential which generally contains multiple degenerate vacua leading to the formation of the axion string-domain wall networks. The following QCD phase transition provides another contribution to the axion potential making domain walls decay before they dominate the Universe. Later, the scalar field starts to relax to the minimum of its potential with a vanishing VEV, turning off the effective PQ violating interaction so that the axion potential is aligned with the QCD vacuum. We keep track of the evolution of the axion-scalar system and discuss the production of the axion DM through the domain wall decay and the (trapped) misalignment. We find that the string-wall network in some cases can decay due to its structural instability, rather than the volume pressure, and the correct axion DM abundance is realized with the decay constant larger than that of the conventional post-inflationary QCD axion without fine tuning.</description>

Abstract: Understanding the hydrodynamics of out-of-equilibrium dense viscous fluids is of key importance to accurate descriptions of physical systems such as compact stars, particularly their mergers. We consider a near-equilibrium relativistic fluid with $n$ independent and small chemical potentials restoring the system back towards equilibrium. By diagonalising the evolution equation for the out-of-equilibrium chemical potentials, we construct an explicit evolution equation for the bulk scalar of the system in second-order hydrodynamics in terms of equilibrium quantities. We find expressions for the $2n$ transport quantities and show that in the rest frame of the fluid, the system admits a Green's function corresponding to an $n$-component fluid.</description>

      <title>The BAO-CMB Tension and Implications for Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The scalar spectral index $n_s$ is a powerful test of inflationary models. The tightest constraint on $n_s$ to date derives from the combination of cosmic microwave background (CMB) data with baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data. The resulting $n_s$ constraint is shifted significantly upward relative to the constraint from CMB alone, with the consequence that previously preferred inflationary models are seemingly disfavored by $\gtrsim 2 \sigma$. Here we show that this shift in $n_s$ is the combined effect of a degeneracy between $n_s$ and BAO parameters exhibited by CMB data and the tension between CMB datasets and DESI BAO data under the assumption of the standard cosmological model. Given the crucial role of $n_s$ in discriminating between inflationary models, we urge caution in interpreting CMB+BAO constraints on $n_s$ until the BAO-CMB tension is resolved.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.11073v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study line defects in the fermionic CFTs in the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa universality class in dimensions $2&lt;d&lt;4$. These CFTs may be described as the IR fixed points of the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa (GNY) model in $d=4-\epsilon$, or as the UV fixed points of the Gross-Neveu (GN) model, which can be studied using the large $N$ expansion in $2&lt;d&lt;4$. These models admit natural line defects obtained by integrating over a line either the scalar field in the GNY description, or the fermion bilinear operator in the GN description. We compute the beta function for the defect RG flow using both the epsilon expansion and the large $N$ approach, and find IR stable fixed points for the defect coupling, thus providing evidence for a non-trivial IR DCFT. We also compute some of the DCFT observables at the fixed point, and check that the $g$-function associated with the circular defect is consistent with the $g$-theorem for the defect RG flow.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01743v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the stability of geodesic motion for both massive and massless particles using Lyapunov exponents in the non-commutative (NC) Schwarzschild black hole (BH) via the gauge theory of gravity. As a first step, we investigate the both time-like and null radial motion of particles, the mean result in NC geometry shows that the particles take infinity proper time to reach the NC singularity (infinite time affine parameter framework for photons). The proper/coordinate time of Lyapunov exponents and their ratio of time-like geodesic for the circular motion of this black hole shows a new behavior, which describes a new range of stable circular orbits between unstable ones. Then we analyze the circular motion of photons, where the result shows a new photon sphere near the event horizon which is not allowed in the commutative case, and the Lyapunov exponent is expressed in this geometry, where this confirms the instability of the outer photon sphere and the stability of the inner one. Moreover, we studied the effect of noncommutativity on the black hole shadow radius, We found a similarity between the non-commutativity and the mass of a black hole. Then we using experimental data from the event horizon telescope, we show that a noncommutativity parameter of the order of $\Theta^{\text{Phy}}\sim 10^{-32}m$.</description>

Abstract: The corner symmetry algebra organises the physical charges induced by gravity on codimension-$2$ corners of a manifold. In this letter, we initiate a study of the quantum properties of this group using as a toy model the corner symmetry group of two-dimensional gravity $\mathrm{SL}\left(2,\mathbb{R}\right)\ltimes \mathbb{R}^2$. We first describe the central extensions and how the quantum corner symmetry group arises and give the Casimirs. We then make use of one particular representation to discuss the gluing of corners, achieved by identifying the maximal commuting sub-algebra. This is a concrete implementation of the gravitational constraints at the quantum level.</description>

Abstract: We discuss anyon condensation in mixed-state topological order. The phases were recently conjectured to be classified by pre-modular fusion categories. Just like anyon condensation in pure-state topological order, a bootstrap analysis shows condensable anyons are given by connected \'etale algebras. We explain how to perform generic anyon condensation including non-invertible anyons and successive condensations. Interestingly, some condensations lead to pure-state topological orders. We clarify when this happens. We also compute topological invariants of equivalence classes.</description>

      <title>Time Evolution of the Symmetry Resolved Entanglement Entropy after a Mass Quench</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06612v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the properties of the symmetry resolved entanglement entropy after a mass quench in the Ising field theory. Since the theory is free and the post-quench state known explicitly, the one-point function of the relevant (composite) branch point twist field can be computed using form factor techniques, similar to previous work on the branch point twist field and the magnetisation, respectively. We find that the symmetry resolved entropy grows linearly in time at the same rate as the total entropy, and that there are sub-leading oscillatory corrections. This result provides the first explicit computation of the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of the symmetry resolved entropy employing twist fields in quantum field theory and is consistent with existing results based on the quasiparticle picture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06005v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the linearized perturbations of near-horizon extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes in $d$-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell-Gauss-Bonnet gravity and seven-dimensional third-order Lovelock gravity. We find the solutions for the gravitational perturbations as a function of the higher-derivative coupling coefficients, which we treat nonperturbatively. Consequently, we observe a breakdown in perturbation theory for large harmonics for the six-derivative corrections.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12278v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study classical wormhole solutions in 3D gravity with end-of-the-world (EOW) branes, conical defects, kinks, and punctures. These solutions compute statistical averages of an ensemble of boundary conformal field theories (BCFTs) related to universal asymptotics of OPE data extracted from 2D conformal bootstrap. Conical defects connect BCFT bulk operators; branes join BCFT boundary intervals with identical boundary conditions; kinks (1D defects along branes) link BCFT boundary operators; and punctures (0D defects) are endpoints where conical defects terminate on branes. We provide evidence for a correspondence between the gravity theory and the ensemble. In particular, the agreement of $g$-function dependence results from an underlying topological aspect of the on-shell EOW brane action, from which a BCFT analogue of the Schlenker-Witten theorem also follows.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05553v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lorentz invariance, unitarity, and causality enforce powerful constraints on the theory space of physical scattering amplitudes. However, virtually all efforts in this direction have centered on the very simplest case of four-point scattering. In this work, we derive an infinite web of "multipositivity bounds" that nonlinearly constrain all tree-level higher-point scattering amplitudes under similarly minimal assumptions. Our construction rules out several deformations of the string and implies mixed-multiplicity bounds on the Wilson coefficients of planar effective field theories. Curiously, an infinite class of multipositivity bounds is exactly saturated by the amplitudes of the open string.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetric localisation of $\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ theories on a spindle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03734v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider two-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ supersymmetric field theories living on a weighted projective space $\mathbb{WCP}_{[n_1,n_2]}^1$, often referred to as a spindle. Starting from the spindle solution of five-dimensional minimal gauged supergravity, we construct a theory on a spindle which preserves supersymmetry via the anti-twist mechanism and admits two Killing spinors of opposite $R$-charge. We apply the technique of supersymmetric localisation to compute the exact partition function for a theory consisting of an abelian vector multiplet and a chiral multiplet, finding that the path integral localises to a real moduli space of vector multiplet fluctuations. We compute the one-loop determinants via the equivariant index, using both the method of unpaired eigenvalues and the fixed point theorem, finding agreement between the two approaches. We conclude with the explicit partition function for an example of a charged chiral multiplet in the presence of a Fayet-Iliopoulos term and comment on its dependence on the overall length scale of the geometry. This work paves the way towards uncovering two-dimensional dualities, such as mirror symmetry, for field theories defined on orbifold backgrounds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09222v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We continue the study of 2D gravity -- ``matrix model'' duality on the example of $(2,2p+1)$ minimal string. We propose a reformulation of the duality, related to a more conventional one by ``$x-y$ swap'' in the language of topological recursion. This formulation elucidates some conceptual and technical difficulties in the dictionary of the duality and relation to other examples. In particular, it allows to circumvent the necessity to use ``resonance transformations'', that were previously introduced to match the worldsheet and ``matrix model'' correlators, and the expressions for minimal string amplitudes in this approach are reminiscent of the ones obtained recently for ``complex Liouville string'' theory. Using this new approach, we also formulate a conjecture on how one can compute amplitudes with operators other than tachyons in the dual theory.</description>

      <title>Weak Hopf tube algebra for domain walls between 2d gapped phases of Turaev-Viro TQFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01515v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate domain walls between 2d gapped phases of Turaev-Viro type topological quantum field theories (TQFTs) by constructing domain wall tube algebras. We begin by analyzing the domain wall tube algebra associated with bimodule categories, and then extend the construction to multimodule categories over $N$ base fusion categories. We prove that the resulting tube algebra is naturally equipped with a $C^*$ weak Hopf algebra structure. We show that topological excitations localized on domain walls are classified by representations of the corresponding domain wall tube algebra, in the sense that the functor category of bimodules admits a fusion-preserving embedding into the representation category of the domain wall tube algebra. We further establish the folding trick and Morita theory in this context. Then, most crucially, we provide a rigorous construction of the Drinfeld quantum double from weak Hopf boundary tube algebras using a skew-pairing, and establish an isomorphism between domain wall tube algebra and Drinfeld quantum double of boundary tube algebras. Motivated by the correspondence between the domain wall tube algebra and the quantum double of the boundary tube algebras, we introduce the notion of an $N$-tuple algebra and demonstrate how it arises in the multimodule domain wall setting. Finally, we consider defects between two domain walls, showing that such defects can be characterized by representations of a domain wall defect tube algebra. We briefly outline how these defects can be systematically treated within this representation-theoretic framework.</description>

      <title>Entanglement features from heavy particle scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03555v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The amount of information propagated by intermediate heavy particles exhibits characteristic features in inelastic scatterings with $n\geq 3$ final particles. As the total energy increases, the entanglement entropy, between its decay products and other final particles, exhibits a universal sharp dip, suppressed by its small decay rate. This indicates an entanglement suppression from a low-energy effective theory to a channel dominated by an on-shell heavy particle. As demonstrations of these entanglement features, we study concrete models of $2\to 3$ and $2\to 4$ scatterings, which shed light on the entanglement structure beyond the area law derived for $2\to 2$ scattering. In practice, these features may be probed by suitably marginalizing the phase-space distribution of final particles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06147v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It was discovered in recent months that the anti-de Sitter (AdS) backgrounds involved in all familiar top-down examples of AdS/CFT duality follow from applying a transverse nonrelativistic brane limit to string/M theory on (asymptotically) flat spacetime. In this note we show that an exactly analogous statement holds for de Sitter (dS) backgrounds relevant to particular instances of dS/CFT duality, which are obtained via a longitudinal Carrollian brane limit. This statement makes direct contact with the holographic duality inferred by Hull via temporal T-duality.</description>

Abstract: Borisov-Joyce constructed a real virtual cycle on compact moduli spaces of stable sheaves on Calabi-Yau 4-folds, using derived differential geometry.
  We construct an algebraic virtual cycle. A key step is a localisation of Edidin-Graham's square root Euler class for $SO(r,\mathbb C)$ bundles to the zero locus of an isotropic section, or to the support of an isotropic cone.
  We prove a torus localisation formula, making the invariants computable and extending them to the noncompact case when the fixed locus is compact.
  We give a $K$-theoretic refinement by defining $K$-theoretic square root Euler classes and their localised versions.
  In a sequel we prove our invariants reproduce those of Borisov-Joyce.</description>

Abstract: This study investigates possibility of placing bounds on the parameters, arising from the non-commutative Snyder space-time model and Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) approach, by utilizing seismic data. We investigate the dependence of constraints on the type of realization used for the quantum phase space. Results indicate improved bounds compared to prior studies, with the model parameter $\beta_0$ constrained to be less than $5.2\times 10^{44}$ for certain choice of realizations. This approach demonstrates the potential for using Earth's empirical data to refine constraints on GUP parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17235v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Discrete models of holographic dualities, typically modeled by tensor networks on hyperbolic tilings, produce quantum states with a characteristic quasiperiodic disorder not present in continuum holography. In this work, we study the behavior of XXZ spin chains with such symmetries, showing that lessons learned from previous non-interacting (matchgate) tensor networks generalize to more generic Hamiltonians under holographic disorder: While the disorder breaks translation invariance, site-averaged correlations and entanglement of the disorder-free critical phase are preserved at a plateau of nonzero disorder even at large system sizes. In particular, we show numerically that the entanglement entropy curves in this disordered phase follow the expected scaling of a conformal field theory (CFT) in the continuum limit. This property is shown to be non-generic for other types of quasiperiodic disorder, only appearing when our boundary disorder ansatz is described by a "dual" bulk hyperbolic tiling. Our results therefore suggest the existence of a whole class of critical phases whose symmetries are derived from models of discrete holography.</description>

We write down an ansatz for the solution and study its basic properties, for the case of both global and gauged symmetries. We demonstrate its prima-facie stability using 3D numerical simulations of a global version of the theory, observing the flow of current along the string. We discuss how generic such a phenomena might be and the possible consequences if such a model is found in nature.</description>

      <title>Fluid-membrane Descriptions of Various Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06164v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The membrane paradigm of black holes is an effective theory that replaces the event horizon with a fictitious yet tangible fluid. It has provided us with valuable insights, especially in understanding the environment of black holes. The paradigm establishes a fluid/gravity correspondence that allows the computation of the thermal properties of the black hole in terms of the transport coefficients of the fluid. Recently, we showed that this is a van der Waals-type fluid for Kerr and especially for Johannsen-Psaltis black holes. Here, we use the paradigm to study the properties of various black holes in different dimensions to test the predictive capacity of effective theory. Among these, for the BTZ black holes, the paradigm gives a physical bulk viscosity, unlike the generic examples, for which the paradigm works with a negative bulk viscosity. For Lorentz-violating black holes, we demonstrate that the parameter for Lorentz violation is seen as a hair under the paradigm, which shifts the ergoregion where the fluid pressure diverges. It might have a consequence for black hole jets. For asymptotically safe quantum-corrected black holes, the paradigm detects the final state of evaporation, i.e., a remnant with a correct value for the mass that still has an event horizon. Finally, we check the paradigm with stringy black holes that have dilatonic and axionic charges, and the fluid produces the known results.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we present a generalization of the cloud of strings model originally proposed by Letelier, by introducing a magnetic-like component, $\Sigma_{23}$, in addition to the electric-like component, $\Sigma_{01}$, considered in the original formulation. This extension leads to a new black hole solution of the form \begin{equation}
  f(r) = 1 - \frac{2M}{r} + \frac{g_s^2 \ell_s^2}{r^2} \, {}_2F_1\left(-\frac{1}{2}, -\frac{1}{4}, \frac{3}{4}, -\frac{r^4}{\ell_s^4}\right), \end{equation} where ${}_2F_1$ denotes the Gaussian hypergeometric function. The solution is characterized by the string length $\ell_s$ and the string coupling constant $g_s$ yields the condition $0 &lt; a &lt; 1$, which now emerges from the model itself, ensuring both energy positivity and the existence of horizons-rather than being imposed ad hoc. We also investigate the thermodynamic properties of the resulting black hole, and find that the entropy remains consistent with the Bekenstein-Hawking formula, $S = A/4$, in agreement with several string-theoretic derivations.</description>

      <title>Tomography of the Rho meson in the QCD Instanton Vacuum: Transverse Momentum Dependent Parton Distribution Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11959v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyse the rho meson unpolarized and polarized transverse momentum dependent parton distribution functions (TMDPDFs) in the instanton liquid model (ILM). The corresponding TMDs in ILM are approximated by a constituent quark beam function in the leading Fock state multiplied by a rapidity-dependent factor resulting from the staple-shaped Wilson lines, for fixed longitudinal momentum, transverse separation, and rapidity. At the resolution of the ILM, all of the rho meson TMDs are symmetric in parton x for fixed transverse momentum, and Gaussian-like in the transverse momentum for fixed parton x. The latter is a direct consequence of the profiling of the quark zero modes in the ILM. The evolved TMDs at higher rapidity using the Collins-Soper kernel, and higher resolution using the renormalization group (RG), show substantial skewness towards low parton x.</description>

      <title>Generalized Nonextensive Entropy Holographic Dark Energy Models Verified by Cosmological Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18230v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a general formalism for studying generalized Holographic Dark Energy (HDE) models in which we use a dimensionless form of the area-entropy of cosmological horizons. The future event horizon is applied though the formalism can also be applied to any other type of the horizon, too. Then, we use our formalism for nonextensive horizon entropies of standard HDE (i.e. Bekenstein-Hawking), and generalized such as Barrow/Tsallis-Cirto, R\'enyi, Sharma-Mittal, and Kaniadakis as dark energy models of the universe and test them by cosmological data.
  We find the bounds on the specific entropy model parameters and also apply statistical comparison tool such as the Bayesian evidence criterion in order to favour or disfavour the models against standard $\Lambda$CDM.
  The main data test results are that all the HDE models under study are statistically disfavoured with respect to $\Lambda$CDM, though at some different levels. The standard HDE seem to be on the same footing as R\'enyi, Sharma-Mittal, and Kaniadakis HDE models since the latter include only small deviations from HDE model resulting from the series expansion of their extra nonextensivity parameters. However, Barrow and Tsallis-Cirto models, though still disfavoured against $\Lambda$CDM, seem to point out observationally to fulfil an important physical property of extensivity (though still remaining nonadditive). Finally, the Tsallis-Cirto model parameter is pointing towards the $\Lambda$CDM limit which is singular also at the expense of having much larger value of the holographic dark energy dimensionless parameter $k$ value higher than other models.</description>

      <title>Einstein ring of dust shells with quantum hair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08343v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The information about the internal structure of a compact object is classically inaccessible to external observers. In this paper, we investigate how quantum corrections to gravitational fields can reveal the internal structure of compact objects composed of dust shells. Using an effective field theory approach to incorporate quantum corrections up to second order in curvature, we derive a quantum-corrected metric for $N$ uniformly spaced shells with equal surface mass density and then examine how these corrections manifest in the deflection angle for gravitational lensing. In particular, we mainly investigate quantum-corrected astrophysical observables such as the Einstein ring and image magnification. Compared to the classical scenario, the deflection angle and the corresponding Einstein angle differ by a term that depends explicitly on the number of dust shells, which play the role of quantum hair. Specifically, the quantum correction to them diminishes as $N$ increases, yet a finite deviation from the classical result remains even in the continuum limit $N\to\infty$. Consequently, our results show that the internal structures of compact objects with identical mass and radius can be distinguished by quantum hair through their lensing observables.</description>

      <title>Spin Precession in magnetized Kerr spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01367v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an exact analytical investigation of spin precession for a test gyroscope in the magnetized Kerr spacetime--an exact electrovacuum solution to the Einstein-Maxwell equations. Our approach accommodates arbitrary magnetic field strengths, enabling a unified treatment across both weak and ultra-strong field regimes. The analysis reveals distinct spin precession behaviors near rotating collapsed objects, which differ characteristically between black holes and naked singularities, offering a potential observational means to differentiate them. The external magnetic field induces a nontrivial modification of the precession frequency through its interaction with the spacetime's gravitoelectromagnetic structure. In the weak-field limit, magnetic fields generally reduce the precession rate, though the effect depends sensitively on the motion and orientation of the test gyro close to the collapsed object. As a special case, we show that in the presence of magnetic fields, the spin precession frequency due to gravitomagnetic effect acquires a long-range $1/r$ (where $r$ is the distance from the central object to the test gyro) correction in contrast to the standard $1/r^3$ falloff. In addition, we obtain the exact geodetic precession (gravitoelectric effect) frequency for a gyroscope in magnetized Schwarzschild spacetime, showing that the magnetic field enhances ($\propto r^{1/2}$) geodetic precession in contrast to the standard $1/r^{5/2}$ falloff. Our results provide observationally testable predictions relevant for black holes in strong magnetic environments, including those possibly realized near magnetars or in the early universe. In particular, the strong-field behavior of spin precession could have important implications for transmuted black holes formed via collapse or mergers of magnetized progenitors in both astrophysical and cosmological contexts.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the inert Triplet desert region with a pNGB Dark Matter and its Gravitational Wave signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16521v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we extend the scalar sector of the conventional hyperchargeless inert triplet model (ITM) to include a second dark matter (DM) candidate, which appears to be a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson (pNGB). The usual ITM with an extended scalar sector offers a DM candidate along with novel signatures at different experiments, e.g., colliders, gravitational wave detectors, etc. Nevertheless, hitherto unseen experimental detections have placed stringent constraints on the ITM parameter space. Moreover, triplet masses lighter than $1.9$ TeV, consistent with the existing or upcoming collider sensitivity reach, are already excluded from the DM observable, as they yield an underabundant relic density due to a strong $SU(2)_L$ gauge annihilation. Inclusion of a pNGB DM, via a complex $SU(2)_L$ scalar singlet and through the soft-breaking of a $U(1)$ symmetry, helps to revive the sub-TeV regime of the triplet DM. This resurgence relies on a proficient conversion between the two DM species. Using this inter-conversion, with the triplet DM as the lighter one between the two, we show that it is possible to push the triplet DM contribution to $50\% - 60\%$ of the total relic density. This offers a significant improvement over the traditional ITM with a single DM candidate, where the same can at most reach $10\% - 20\%$. Besides, the concerned bipartite DM framework also offers the possibility of a first-order phase transition along various constituent field directions. Among these, the one along the real $SU(2)_L$ singlet direction can be a strong one which subsequently yields detectable gravitational wave signals at the upcoming space-based gravitational wave detectors such as LISA, BBO, DECIGO, etc., alongside distinctive and complementary signatures at the various DM and collider quests.</description>

      <title>Parameter inference of microlensed gravitational waves using neural spline flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20996v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When gravitational waves (GWs) propagate near massive objects, they undergo gravitational lensing that imprints lens model dependent modulations on the waveform. This effect provides a powerful tool for cosmological and astrophysical studies. However, conventional Bayesian parameter inference methods for GWs are computationally expensive, especially for lensed events with additional lens parameters, necessitating more efficient approaches. In this work, we explore the use of neural spline flows (NSFs) for posterior inference of microlensed GWs, and successfully apply NSFs to the inference of 11-dimensional lens parameters. Our results demonstrate that compared with traditional methods like Bilby dynesty that rely on Bayesian inference, the NSF network we built not only achieves inference accuracy comparable to traditional methods for the main parameters, but also can reduce the inference time from approximately 3 days to 0.8 s on average. Additionally, the network exhibits strong generalization for the spin parameters of GW sources. It is anticipated to become a powerful tool for future low-latency searches for lensed GW signals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06697v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Monopoles have been a subject of much theoretical and experimental research since they were proposed to symmetrize Maxwell's equations. However, no experimental signature of their existence has been detected. Many mechanisms have been proposed to explain this lack of success. In here we generalize QED to a two photon theory where the magnetic photon and the monopole belong to dark matter. A naive mixing interaction produces duality and generates experimental consequences for indirect monopole detection via the magnetic charge of the electron.</description>
