      <title>Relationships between minimum rank problem parameters for cobipartite graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a simple graph, the minimum rank problem is to determine the smallest rank among the symmetric matrices whose off-diagonal nonzero entries occur in positions corresponding to the edges of the graph. Bounds on this minimum rank (and on an equivalent value, the maximum nullity) are given by various graph parameters, most notably the zero forcing number and its variants. For a matrix, replacing each nonzero entry with the symbol \(\ast\) gives its zero-nonzero pattern. The associated minimum rank problem is to determine, given only this pattern, the smallest possible rank of the matrix. The most fundamental lower bound on this minimum rank is the triangle number of the pattern. A cobipartite graph is the complement of a bipartite graph; its vertices can be partitioned into two cliques. Such a graph corresponds to a zero-nonzero pattern in a natural way. Over an infinite field, the minimum rank of the graph and that of the pattern obey a simple relationship. We show that this same relationship is followed by the zero forcing number of the graph and the triangle number of the pattern. This has implications for the relationship between the two minimum rank problems. We also explore how, for cobipartite graphs, variants of the zero forcing number and other parameters important to the minimum rank problem are related, as well as how, for graphs in general, these parameters can be interpreted in terms of the zero-nonzero patterns of the symmetric matrices associated with the graph.</description>

      <title>Vanishing of Schubert coefficients is in ${\sf AM}\cap {\sf coAM}$ assuming the GRH</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Schubert vanishing problem is a central decision problem in algebraic combinatorics and Schubert calculus, with applications to representation theory and enumerative algebraic geometry. The problem has been studied for over 50 years in different settings, with much progress given in the last two decades.
  We prove that the Schubert vanishing problem is in ${\sf AM}$ assuming the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis (GRH). This complements our earlier result in arXiv:2412.02064, that the problem is in ${\sf coAM}$ assuming the GRH. In particular, this implies that the Schubert vanishing problem is unlikely to be ${\sf coNP}$-hard, as we previously conjectured in arXiv:2412.02064.
  The proof is of independent interest as we formalize and expand the notion of a lifted formulation partly inspired by algebraic computations of Schubert problems, and extended formulations of linear programs. We use a result by Mahajan--Vinay to show that the determinant has a lifted formulation of polynomial size. We combine this with Purbhoo's algebraic criterion to derive the result.</description>

      <title>Counting k-ary words by number of adjacency differences of a prescribed size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the general problem of enumerating permutations $\pi=\pi_1\cdots \pi_n$ such that $\pi_{i+r}-\pi_i \neq s$ for all $1\leq i\leq n-r$, where $r$ and $s$ are fixed, was considered by Spahn and Zeilberger. In this paper, we consider an analogous problem on $k$-ary words involving the distribution of the corresponding statistic. Note that for $k$-ary words, it suffices to consider only the $r=1$ case of the aforementioned problem on permutations. Here, we compute for arbitrary $s$ an explicit formula for the ordinary generating function for $n \geq 0$ of the distribution of the statistic on $k$-ary words $\rho=\rho_1\cdots\rho_n$ recording the number of indices $i$ such that $\rho_{i+1}-\rho_i=s$. This result may then be used to find a comparable formula for finite set partitions with a fixed number of blocks, represented sequentially as restricted growth functions. Further, several sequences from the OEIS arise as enumerators of certain classes of $k$-ary words avoiding adjacencies with a prescribed difference. The comparable problem where one tracks indices $i$ such that the absolute difference $|a_{i+1}-a_i|$ is a fixed number is also considered on $k$-ary words and the corresponding generating function may be expressed in terms of Chebyshev polynomials. Finally, combinatorial proofs are found for several related recurrences and formulas for the total number of adjacencies of the form $a(a+s)$ on the various structures.</description>

      <title>The Generalized Double Pouring Problem: Analysis, Bounds and Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a logical puzzle which we call double pouring problem, which was original defined for $k=3$ vessels. We generalize this definition to $k \ge 2 $ as follows. Each of the $k$ vessels contains an integer amount of water, called its value, where the values are $a_i$ for $i=1,2,\dots,k$ and the sum of values is $n$. A pouring step means pouring water from one vessel with value $a_i$ to another vessel with value $a_j$, where $ 1 \le i \not= j \le k $ and $a_i \le a_j $. After this pouring step the first vessel has value $2a_i$ and the second one value $a_j-a_i$. Now the pouring problem is to find as few pourings steps as possible to empty at least one vessel, or to show that such an emptying is not possible (which is possible only in the case $k=2$).
  For $k=2$ each pouring step is unique. We give a necessary and sufficient condition, when for a given $ (a_1,a_2)$ with $a_1+a_2=n$ the pouring problem is solvable. For $k=3$ we improve the upper bound of the pouring problem for some special cases. For $k \ge 4 $ we extend the known lower bound for $k=3$ and improve the known upper bound $\mathcal{O}((\log n)^2)$ for $k=3$ to $\mathcal{O}(\log n\log\log n)$. Finally, for $k \ge 3$, we investigate values and bounds for some functions related to the pouring problem.</description>

      <title>Generalized Erd\H{o}s-Rogers problems for hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given $r$-uniform hypergraphs $G$ and $F$ and an integer $n$, let $f_{F,G}(n)$ be the maximum $m$ such that every $n$-vertex $G$-free $r$-graph has an $F$-free induced subgraph on $m$ vertices. We show that $f_{F,G}(n)$ is polynomial in $n$ when $G$ is a subgraph of an iterated blowup of $F$. As a partial converse, we show that if $G$ is not a subgraph of an $F$-iterated blowup and is $2$-tightly connected, then $f_{F,G}(n)$ is at most polylogarithmic in $n$. Our bounds generalize previous results of Dudek and Mubayi for the case when $F$ and $G$ are complete.</description>

      <title>A New Dominating Set Game on Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new two-player game on graphs, in which players alternate choosing vertices until the set of chosen vertices forms a dominating set. The last player to choose a vertex is the winner. The game fits into the scheme of several other known games on graphs. We characterize the paths and cycles for which the first player has the winning strategy. We also create tools for combining graphs in various ways (via graph powers, Cartesian products, graph joins, and other methods) for building a variety of graphs whose games are won by the second player, including cubes, multidimensional grids with an odd number of vertices, most multidimensional toroidal grids, various trees such as specialized caterpillars, the Petersen graph, and others. Finally, we extend the game to groups and show that the second player wins the game on abelian groups of even order with canonical generating set, among others.</description>

      <title>A Dense Neighborhood Lemma, with Applications to Domination and Chromatic Number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In its Euclidean form, the Dense Neighborhood Lemma (DNL) asserts that if $V$ is a finite set of points of $\mathbb{R}^N$ such that for each $v \in V$ the ball $B(v,1)$ intersects $V$ on at least $\delta |V|$ points, then for every $\varepsilon &gt;0$, the points of $V$ can be covered with $f(\delta,\varepsilon)$ balls $B(v,1+\varepsilon)$ with $v \in V$. DNL also applies to other metric spaces and to abstract set systems, where elements are compared pairwise with respect to (near) disjointness. In its strongest form, DNL provides an $\varepsilon$-clustering with size exponential in $\varepsilon^{-1}$, which amounts to a Regularity Lemma with 0/1 densities of some trigraph.
  Trigraphs are graphs with additional red edges. For instance, in the Euclidean case the black edges would connect points at distance at most 1, and the red edges would connect points at distance between $1$ and $1+\varepsilon$. This paper is mainly a study of the generalization of Vapnik-Cervonenkis dimension to trigraphs. The main point is to show how trigraphs can sometimes explain the success of random sampling even though the VC-dimension of the underlying graph is unbounded. All the results presented here are effective in the sense of computation: they primarily rely on uniform sampling with the same success rate as in classical VC-dimension theory.
  Among some applications of DNL, we show that $\left(\frac{3t-8}{3t-5}+\varepsilon\right)\cdot n$-regular $K_t$-free graphs have bounded chromatic number. Similarly, triangle-free graphs with minimum degree $n/3-n^{1-\varepsilon}$ have bounded chromatic number (this does not hold with $n/3-n^{1-o(1)}$). For tournaments, DNL implies that the domination number is bounded in terms of the fractional chromatic number. Also, $(1/2-\varepsilon)$-majority digraphs have bounded domination, independently of the number of voters.</description>

      <title>Trivial Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials and cubulation of the Bruhat graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For $(W,S)$ an arbitrary Coxeter system and any $y \in W$, we investigate the relationship between the condition that the Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomial $P_{x,y}$ is trivial for all $x \leq y$, and the condition that the Bruhat graph for the interval $[1,y]$ can be cubulated, meaning roughly that this graph can be spanned by a product of subintervals of $\mathbb{Z}$. In one direction, we combine results of Carrell-Peterson and Elias-Williamson to prove that if $[1,y]$ can be cubulated, then $P_{x,y} = 1$ for all $x \leq y$. We then investigate the converse of this statement. For $(W,S)$ finite and $w_0$ the longest element in $W$, so that $P_{x,w_0} = 1$ for all $x \in W$, we construct cubulations of $[1,w_0]$ in types $A$ and $B/C$. However, in some exceptional types, we determine elements $y \in W$ such that $P_{1,y} = 1$ but $[1,y]$ cannot be cubulated. We then prove that if there are infinitely many $y \in W$ such that $[1,y]$ can be cubulated, then $(W,S)$ must be of type $\tilde{A}_n$ for some $n \geq 1$. Finally, for $(W,S)$ of type $\tilde{A}_2$, we exhibit a cubulation of $[1,y]$ for each of the infinitely many $y \in W$ such that $P_{x,y} = 1$ for all $x \leq y$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct constant-sized ensembles of linear error-correcting codes over any fixed alphabet that can correct a given fraction of adversarial erasures at rates approaching the Singleton bound arbitrarily closely. We provide several applications of our results:
  1. Explicit constructions of strong linear seeded symbol-fixing extractors and lossless condensers, over any fixed alphabet, with only a constant seed length and optimal output lengths;
  2. A strongly explicit construction of erasure codes on bipartite graphs (more generally, linear codes on matrices of arbitrary dimensions) with optimal rate and erasure-correction trade-offs;
  3. A strongly explicit construction of erasure codes on non-bipartite graphs (more generally, linear codes on symmetric square matrices) achieving improved rates;
  4. A strongly explicit construction of linear nearly-MDS codes over constant-sized alphabets that can be encoded and decoded in quasi-linear time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a number of results about the structure of the standard representation of the stable limit DAHA. More precisely, we address the triangularity, spectrum, and eigenfunctions of the limit Cherednik operators, and construct several PBW-type bases for the stable limit DAHA. We establish a remarkable triangularity property concerning the contribution of certain special elements of the PBW basis of a finite rank DAHA of high enough rank to the PBW expansion of a PBW basis element of the stable limit DAHA. The triangularity property implies the faithfulness of the standard representation. This shows that the algebraic structure defined by the limit operators associated to elements of the finite rank DAHAs is precisely the stable limit DAHA.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear spectral graph theory is an extension of the traditional (linear) spectral graph theory and studies relationships between spectral properties of nonlinear operators defined on a graph and topological properties of the graph itself. Many of these relationships get tighter when going from the linear to the nonlinear case. In this manuscript, we discuss the spectral theory of the graph $p$-Laplacian operator. In particular we report links between the $p$-Laplacian spectrum and higher-order Cheeger (or isoperimetric) constants, sphere packing constants, independence and matching numbers of the graph. The main aim of this paper is to present a complete and self-contained introduction to the problem accompanied by a discussion of the main results and the proof of new results that fill some gaps in the theory. The majority of the new results are devoted to the study of the graph infinity Laplacian spectrum and the information that it yields about the packing radii, the independence numbers and the matching number of the graph. This is accompanied by a novel discussion about the nodal domains induced by the infinity eigenfunctions. There are also new results about the variational spectrum of the $p$-Laplacian, the regularity of the $p$-Laplacian spectrum varying $p$, and the relations between the $1$-Laplacian spectrum and new Cheeger constants.</description>

      <title>Constant Rate Isometric Embeddings of Hamming Metric into Edit Metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A function $\varphi: \{0,1\}^n \to \{0,1\}^N$ is called an isometric embedding of the $n$-dimensional Hamming metric space to the $N$-dimensional edit metric space if, for all $x, y \in \{0,1\}^n$, the Hamming distance between $x$ and $y$ is equal to the edit distance between $\varphi(x)$ and $\varphi(y)$. The rate of such an embedding is defined as the ratio $n/N$. It is well known in the literature how to construct isometric embeddings with a rate of $\Omega(\frac{1}{\log n})$. However, achieving even near-isometric embeddings with a positive constant rate has remained elusive until now.
  In this paper, we present an isometric embedding with a rate of 1/8 by discovering connections to synchronization strings, which were studied in the context of insertion-deletion codes (Haeupler-Shahrasbi [JACM'21]). At a technical level, we introduce a framework for obtaining high-rate isometric embeddings using a novel object called misaligners. As an immediate consequence of our constant rate isometric embedding, we improve known conditional lower bounds for various optimization problems in the edit metric, but now with optimal dependency on the dimension.
  We complement our results by showing that no isometric embedding $\varphi:\{0, 1\}^n \to \{0, 1\}^N$ can have rate greater than 15/32 for all positive integers $n$. En route to proving this upper bound, we uncover fundamental structural properties necessary for every Hamming-to-edit isometric embedding. We also prove similar upper and lower bounds for embeddings over larger alphabets.
  Finally, we consider embeddings $\varphi:\Sigma_{\text{in}}^n\to \Sigma_{\text{out}}^N$ between different input and output alphabets, where the rate is given by $\frac{n\log|\Sigma_{\text{in}}|}{N\log|\Sigma_{\text{out}}|}$. In this setting, we show that the rate can be made arbitrarily close to 1.</description>

      <title>Odd coloring of 2-boundary planar graphs and beyond</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.09317v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the notion of 2-boundary planar graphs. A graph is 2-boundary planar if it has an embedding in the plane so that all vertices lie on the boundary of at most two faces and no edges are crossed. A proper coloring of a graph is odd if every non-isolated vertex has some color that appears an odd number of times on its neighborhood. Petru\v{s}evski and \v{S}krekovski conjectured in 2022 that every planar graph admits an odd 5-coloring. We confirm this conjecture for 2-boundary planar graphs. Moreover, we present several questions regarding 2-boundary planar graphs that are of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.05340v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study two-step flag positroids $(P_1, P_2)$, where $P_1$ is a quotient of $P_{2}$. We provide a complete characterization of all two-step flag positroids that contain a uniform matroid, extending and completing a partial result by Benedetti, Ch\'avez, and Jim\'enez. To contrast general positroids with the special case of lattice path matroids, we show that the containment relations of Grassmann necklaces and conecklaces fully characterize flag lattice path matroids, but are insufficient for general flag positroids. Additionally, we prove that the decorated permutations of any elementary quotient pair are related by a cyclic shift, resolving a conjecture of Benedetti, Ch\'avez and Jim\'enez.</description>

      <title>Quickly excluding an apex-forest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17306v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a short proof that for every apex-forest $X$ on at least two vertices, graphs excluding $X$ as a minor have layered pathwidth at most $2|V(X)|-3$. This improves upon a result by Dujmovi\'c, Eppstein, Joret, Morin, and Wood (SIDMA, 2020). Our main tool is a structural result about graphs excluding a forest as a rooted minor, which is of independent interest. We develop similar tools for treedepth and treewidth. We discuss implications for Erd\H{o}s-P\'osa properties of rooted models of minors in graphs.</description>

      <title>Flips in colorful triangulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03783v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The associahedron is the graph $\mathcal{G}_N$ that has as nodes all triangulations of a convex $N$-gon, and an edge between any two triangulations that differ in a flip operation. A flip removes an edge shared by two triangles and replaces it by the other diagonal of the resulting 4-gon. In this paper, we consider a large collection of induced subgraphs of $\mathcal{G}_N$ obtained by Ramsey-type colorability properties. Specifically, coloring the points of the $N$-gon red and blue alternatingly, we consider only colorful triangulations, namely triangulations in which every triangle has points in both colors, i.e., monochromatic triangles are forbidden. The resulting induced subgraph of $\mathcal{G}_N$ on colorful triangulations is denoted by $\mathcal{F}_N$. We prove that $\mathcal{F}_N$ has a Hamilton cycle for all $N\geq 8$, resolving a problem raised by Sagan, i.e., all colorful triangulations on $N$ points can be listed so that any two cyclically consecutive triangulations differ in a flip. In fact, we prove that for an arbitrary fixed coloring pattern of the $N$ points with at least 10 changes of color, the resulting subgraph of $\mathcal{G}_N$ on colorful triangulations (for that coloring pattern) admits a Hamilton cycle. We also provide an efficient algorithm for computing a Hamilton path in $\mathcal{F}_N$ that runs in time $\mathcal{O}(1)$ on average per generated node. This algorithm is based on a new and algorithmic construction of a tree rotation Gray code for listing all $n$-vertex $k$-ary trees that runs in time $\mathcal{O}(k)$ on average per generated tree.</description>

      <title>Weak coloring numbers of minor-closed graph classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04588v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the growth rate of weak coloring numbers of graphs excluding a fixed graph as a minor. Van den Heuvel et al. (European J. of Combinatorics, 2017) showed that for a fixed graph $X$, the maximum $r$-th weak coloring number of $X$-minor-free graphs is polynomial in $r$. We determine this polynomial up to a factor of $\mathcal{O}(r \log r)$. Moreover, we tie the exponent of the polynomial to a structural property of $X$, namely, $2$-treedepth. As a result, for a fixed graph $X$ and an $X$-minor-free graph $G$, we show that $\mathrm{wcol}_r(G)= \mathcal{O}(r^{\mathrm{td}(X)-1}\mathrm{log}\ r)$, which improves on the bound $\mathrm{wcol}_r(G) = \mathcal{O}(r^{g(\mathrm{td}(X))})$ given by Dujmovi\'c et al. (SODA, 2024), where $g$ is an exponential function. In the case of planar graphs of bounded treewidth, we show that the maximum $r$-th weak coloring number is in $\mathcal{O}(r^2\mathrm{log}\ r$), which is best possible.</description>

      <title>Rook matroids and log-concavity of $P$-Eulerian polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00127v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define and study rook matroids, the bases of which correspond to non-nesting rook placements on a skew Ferrers board. We show that rook matroids are closed under taking duals and direct sums but not minors. Rook matroids are also a subclass of transversal matroids, positroids, and bear a subtle relationship to lattice path matroids that centers around not having the quaternary matroid $Q_{6}$ as a minor. The enumerative and distributional properties of non-nesting rook placements stand in contrast to that of usual rook placements: the non-nesting rook polynomial is not real-rooted in general, and is instead ultra-log-concave. We leverage this property together with a correspondence between rook placements and linear extensions of a poset to show that if $P$ is a naturally labeled width two poset, then the $P$-Eulerian polynomial $W_{P}$ is ultra-log-concave. This takes an important step towards resolving a log-concavity conjecture of Brenti (1989) and completes the story of the Neggers--Stanley conjecture for naturally labeled width two posets.</description>

      <title>Bounds on the realizations of zero-nonzero patterns and sign conditions of polynomials restricted to varieties and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11729v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove upper bounds which are independent of the dimension of the ambient space, on the number of realizable zero-nonzero patterns as well as sign conditions (when the field of coefficients is ordered) of a finite set of polynomials $\mathcal{P}$ restricted to some algebraic subset $V$ of an affine or projective space. Our bounds depend on the number and the degrees of the polynomials in $\mathcal{P}$, as well as the degree of $V$ and the dimension of $V$, but are independent of the dimension of the space in which $V$ is embedded. This last feature of our bounds is useful in situations where the ambient dimension is much larger than $\mathrm{dim} V$. We give several applications of our results. We generalize existing results on bounding the speeds of algebraically defined classes of graphs, bounding the $\varepsilon$-entropy of real varieties, as well as lower bounds in terms of the number of connected components for testing membership in semi-algebraic sets using algebraic computation trees. Motivated by quantum complexity theory we introduce a notion of relative rank (additive as well as multiplicative) in finite dimensional vector spaces and algebras relative to a fixed algebraic subset in the vector space or algebra -- which generalizes the classical definition of ranks of tensors. We prove a very general lower bound on the maximum relative rank of finite subsets relative to algebraic subsets of bounded degree and dimension which is independent of the dimension of the vector space or algebra.</description>

Abstract: Shi, Walsh and Yu demonstrated that any dense circuit graph contains a large near-triangulation. We extend the result to $2$-connected plane graphs, thereby addressing a question posed by them. Using the result, we prove that the planar Tu\'{a}n number of $2C_k$ is $\left[3-\Theta(k^{\log_23})^{-1}\right]n$ when $k\geq 5$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17883v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spectral radius of a graph is the largest modulus of an eigenvalue of its adjacency matrix. Let $\mathcal{C}_{n, e}$ be the set of all the connected simple graphs with $n$ vertices and $n - 1 + e$ edges. Here, we solve the spectral radius maximization problem on $\mathcal{C}_{n, e}$ when $e \le 130$ or $n \ge e + 2 + 13\sqrt{e}$.</description>

      <title>Steiner triple systems with high discrepancy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23252v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we initiate the study of discrepancy questions for combinatorial designs. Specifically, we show that, for every fixed $r\ge 3$ and $n\equiv 1,3 \pmod{6}$, any $r$-colouring of the triples on $[n]$ admits a Steiner triple system of order $n$ with discrepancy $\Omega(n^2)$. This is not true for $r=2$, but we are able to asymptotically characterise all $2$-colourings which do not contain a Steiner triple system with high discrepancy. The key step in our proofs is a characterization of 3-uniform hypergraphs avoiding a certain natural type of induced subgraphs, contributing to the structural theory of hypergraphs.</description>

      <title>Bounds on Unique-Neighbor Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.10330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.10330v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recall that a binary linear code of length $n$ is a linear subspace $\mathcal{C} = \{x\in\mathbb{F}_2^n\mid Ax=0\}$. Here the parity check matrix $A$ is a binary $m\times n$ matrix of rank $m$. We say that $\mathcal{C}$ has rate $R=1-\frac mn$. Its distance, denoted $\delta n$ is the smallest Hamming weight of a non-zero vector in $\mathcal{C}$. The rate vs.\ distance problem for binary linear codes is a fundamental open problem in coding theory, and a fascinating question in discrete mathematics. It concerns the function $R_L(\delta)$, the largest possible rate $R$ for given $0\le\delta\le1$ and arbitrarily large length $n$. Here we investigate a variation of this fundamental question that we describe next.
  Clearly, $\mathcal{C}$ has distance $\delta n$, if and only if for every $0&lt;n'&lt;\delta n$, every $m\times n'$ submatrix of $A$ has a row of odd weight. Motivated by several problems from coding theory, we say that $A$ has the unique-neighbor property with parameter $\delta n$, if every such submatrix has a row of weight $1$. Let $R_U(\delta)$ be the largest possible asymptotic rate of linear codes with a parity check matrix that has this stronger property. Clearly, $R_U(\cdot),R_L(\cdot)$ are non-increasing functions, and $R_U(\delta)\le R_L(\delta)$ for all $\delta$. Also, $R_U(0)=R_L(0)=1$, and $R_U(1)=R_L(1)=0$, so let $0\le\delta_U \le\delta_L\le1$ be the smallest values of $\delta$ at which $R_U$ resp.\ $R_L$ vanish. It is well known that $\delta_L=\frac12$ and we conjecture that $\delta_U$ is strictly smaller than $\frac12$, i.e., the rate of linear codes with the unique-neighbor property is more strictly bounded. While the conjecture remains open, we prove here several results supporting it.
  The reader is not assumed to have any specific background in coding theory, but we occasionally point out some relevant facts from that area.</description>
