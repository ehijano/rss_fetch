      <title>Joint Detection, Channel Estimation and Interference Nulling for Terrestrial-Satellite Downlink Co-Existence in the Upper Mid-Band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The upper mid-band FR3 spectrum (7-24 GHz) has garnered significant interest for future cellular services. However, utilizing a large portion of this band requires careful interference coordination with incumbent satellite systems. This paper investigates interference from high-power terrestrial base stations (TN-BSs) to satellite downlink receivers. A central challenge is that the victim receivers, i.e., ground-based non-terrestrial user equipment (NTN-UEs) such as satellite customer premises equipment, must first be detected and their channels estimated before the TN-BS can effectively place nulls in their directions. We explore a potential solution where NTN-UEs periodically transmit preambles or beacon signals that TN-BSs can use for detection and channel estimation. The performance of this nulling approach is analyzed in a simplified scenario with a single victim, revealing the interplay between path loss and estimation quality in determining nulling performance. To further validate the method, we conduct a detailed multi-user site-specific ray-tracing (RT) simulation in a rural environment. The results show that the proposed nulling approach is effective under realistic parameters, even with high densities of victim units, although TN-BS may require a substantial number of antennas.</description>

      <title>Cognitive Radio for Asymmetric Cellular Downlink with Multi-User MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cognitive radio (CR) is an important technique for improving spectral efficiency, letting a secondary system operate in a wireless spectrum when the primary system does not make use of it. While it has been widely explored over the past 25 years, many common assumptions are not aligned with the realities of 5G networks. In this paper, we consider the CR problem for the following setup: (i) infrastructure-based systems, where downlink transmissions might occur to receivers whose positions are not, or not exactly, known; (ii) multi-beam antennas at both primary and secondary base stations. We formulate a detailed protocol to determine when secondary transmissions into different beam directions can interfere with primary users at potential locations and create probability-based interference rules. We then analyze the "catastrophic interference" probability and the "missed transmission opportunity" probability, as well as the achievable throughput, as a function of the transmit powers of the primary and secondary base stations and the sensing window of the secondary base station. Results can serve to more realistically assess the spectral efficiency gains in 5G infrastructure-based cognitive systems.</description>

      <title>Traffic-Aware Eco-Driving Control in CAVs via Learning-based Terminal Cost Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) offer significant potential for improving energy efficiency and lowering vehicle emissions through eco-driving technologies. Control algorithms in CAVs leverage look-ahead route information and Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication to optimize vehicle performance. However, existing eco-driving strategies often neglect macroscopic traffic effects, such as upstream traffic jams, that occur outside the optimization horizon but significantly impact vehicle energy efficiency. This work presents a novel Neural Network (NN)-based methodology to approximate the terminal cost within a model predictive control (MPC) problem framework, explicitly incorporating upstream traffic dynamics. By incorporating traffic jams into the optimization process, the proposed traffic-aware approach yields more energy-efficient speed trajectories compared to traffic-agnostic methods, with minimal impact on travel time. The framework is scalable for real-time implementation while effectively addressing uncertainties from dynamic traffic conditions and macroscopic traffic events.</description>

      <title>MAKO: Meta-Adaptive Koopman Operators for Learning-based Model Predictive Control of Parametrically Uncertain Nonlinear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a meta-learning-based Koopman modeling and predictive control approach for nonlinear systems with parametric uncertainties. An adaptive deep meta-learning-based modeling approach, called Meta Adaptive Koopman Operator (MAKO), is proposed. Without knowledge of the parametric uncertainty, the proposed MAKO approach can learn a meta-model from a multi-modal dataset and efficiently adapt to new systems with previously unseen parameter settings by using online data. Based on the learned meta Koopman model, a predictive control scheme is developed, and the stability of the closed-loop system is ensured even in the presence of previously unseen parameter settings. Through extensive simulations, our proposed approach demonstrates superior performance in both modeling accuracy and control efficacy as compared to competitive baselines.</description>

      <title>Sensing, Detection and Localization for Low Altitude UAV: A RF-Based Framework via Multiple BSs Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid growth of the low-altitude economy has resulted in a significant increase in the number of Low, slow, and small (LLS) unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), raising critical challenges for secure airspace management and reliable trajectory planning. To address this, this paper proposes a cooperative radio-frequency (RF) detection and localization framework that leverages existing cellular base stations. The proposed approach features a robust scheme for LSS target identification, integrating a cell averaging-constant false alarm rate (CA-CFAR) detector with a micro-Doppler signature (MDS) based recognition method. Multi-station measurements are fused through a grid-based probabilistic algorithm combined with clustering techniques, effectively mitigating ghost targets and improving localization accuracy in multi-UAV scenarios. Furthermore, the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) is derived as a performance benchmark and reinforcement learning (RL)-based optimization is employed to balance localization accuracy against station resource usage. Simulations demonstrate that increasing from one to multiple BSs reduces the positioning error to near the CRLB, while practical experiments further verify the framework's effectiveness. Furthermore, our RL-based optimization can find solutions that maintain high accuracy while minimizing resource usage, highlighting its potential as a scalable solution for ensuring airspace safety in the emerging low-altitude economy.</description>

      <title>Antenna's Performance in Microwave Imaging of Stratified Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerous types of antennas have been employed for microwave imaging of stratified media for ground penetrating radar (GPR), through-the-wall-radar imaging (TWRI), etc. This letter aims to investigate the impact of the different antennas with their characteristics on the image reconstruction of those media. Hence, three types of antennas, including horn antennas, open waveguide and Vivaldi antennas, are chosen as almost directional antennas, operating at X-band 8-12 GHz. The antenna's far-field and near-field characteristics are analyzed. A diffraction tomography (DT)-based algorithm is used to reconstruct the target location within the stratified media using monostatic and multistatic data. It is observed that the more directional antennas provide a better-reconstructed image with less shadowing image of the stratified media.</description>

      <title>Robust Adaptive Boundary Control of a Thermal Process with Thermoelectric Actuators: Theory and Experimental Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A sliding-mode-based adaptive boundary control law is proposed for a class of uncertain thermal reaction-diffusion processes subject to matched disturbances. The disturbances are assumed to be bounded, but the corresponding bounds are unknown, thus motivating the use of adaptive control strategies. A boundary control law comprising a proportional and discontinuous term is proposed, wherein the magnitude of the discontinuous relay term is adjusted via a gradient-based adaptation algorithm. Depending on how the adaptation algorithm is parameterized, the adaptive gain can be either a nondecreasing function of time (monodirectional adaptation) or it can both increase and decrease (bidirectional adaptation). The convergence and stability properties of these two solutions are investigated by Lyapunov analyses, and two distinct stability results are derived, namely, asymptotic stability for the monodirectional adaptation and globally uniformly ultimately bounded solutions for the bidirectional adaptation. The proposed algorithms are then specified to address the control problem of stabilizing a desired temperature profile in a metal beam equipped with thermoelectric boundary actuators. Experiments are conducted to investigate the real-world performance of the proposed sliding-mode-based adaptive control, with a particular focus on comparing the monodirectional and bidirectional adaptation laws.</description>

      <title>Single vs Multi Vector Predictive Control of Five-phase Drives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The field of Finite State Model Predictive Control for multiphase drives has produced many contributions. Many variants of FSMPC exist, each aiming at some aspect such as complexity of the cost function, switching frequency, etc. Despite past efforts to compare different techniques, the field is still out of consensus regarding the relative merits of each one. This paper presents a new method to compare FSMPC variants. The method is based on analyzing the modulation, implicit or explicit, used by each variant. In the paper the method is used to compare single-vector state-of-the-art FSMPC with a multi-vector variant designed to cancel xy currents and simplify the cost function. The results show the strengths and weaknesses of each technique. Also, it is found that the trade-offs between figures, previously thought to concern just individual regimes, extend to the whole operating space and also can be pinpoint to each FSMPC variant. Finally, it is shown that the flexibility of the single-vector approach and its better DC-link usage makes it, arguably, superior over the multi-vector variant.</description>

      <title>Safety Analysis of eVTOL Operations based on STPA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electric Vertical Take-Off and Landing (eVTOL) aircraft are expected to be quieter and more cost-effective than helicopters, offering major economic and social benefits through improved connectivity. Their adoption will require new ground infrastructure and airspace redesign, introducing risks involving multiple stakeholders (Regulators, eVTOL operators, Air navigation service providers, Vertiport operators, OEMs, Pilots, etc.). To assess these risks for the UK airspace, systems-thinking based System Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA) was conducted. To manage the large number of Unsafe Control Actions (UCAs) and requirements generated due to the complexity of the analysis, a novel extension to STPA for the prioritization of results was applied. 317 UCAs were identified in total out of which 110 high-priority UCAs were analyzed (Step-4), resulting in 377 causal factors and 432 requirements. These were prioritized to produce a targeted list of 124 distinct high-priority requirements, 56 of which were identified as gaps in existing aviation regulations, policies, or procedures.. These highlight opportunities for regulatory updates in areas such as organizational performance, certification processes, training, collision avoidance, energy management, and automation. The findings provide regulators with safety considerations that could shape new or updated regulations, compliance methods, and guidance materials for the safe deployment of eVTOLs.</description>

      <title>Weighting Factors Tuning by Direct Feedback in Predictive Control of Multiphase Motors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predictive Stator Current Control (PSCC) has been proposed for control of multi-phase drives. The flexibility offered by the use of a Cost Function has been used to deal with the increased number of phases. However, tuning of the Weighting Factors constitutes a problem. Intensive trial and error tests are usual in this context. Existing on-line selection methods, on the other hand, require large amounts of data and/or complex optimization procedures. The proposal of this paper is a closed-loop scheme that links Weighting Factors to performance indicators. In this way, optimal Weighting Factors are determined for each operating point. Also, changes in reference values for performance indicators are easily tackled. Unlike previous methods, the proposal carries very little computational burden. A case study is developed for a five-phase induction motor and assessed with real experimentation on a laboratory set-up.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Control Of Power Converters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fundamental role of power converters is to efficiently manage and control the flow of electrical energy, ensuring compatibility between power sources and loads. All these applications of power converters need the design of an appropriate control law. Control of power converters is a challenging problem due to the presence of switching devices which are difficult to handle using traditional control approaches. The objective of this paper is to investigate the use of data-driven techniques, in particular the Virtual References Feedback Tuning (VRFT) method, in the context of power converters feedback control. This study considers a buck \pauline{mode} power converter circuit provided by the OwnTech foundation.</description>

      <title>MPA-DNN: Projection-Aware Unsupervised Learning for Multi-period DC-OPF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring both feasibility and efficiency in optimal power flow (OPF) operations has become increasingly important in modern power systems with high penetrations of renewable energy and energy storage. While deep neural networks (DNNs) have emerged as promising fast surrogates for OPF solvers, they often fail to satisfy critical operational constraints, especially those involving inter-temporal coupling, such as generator ramping limits and energy storage operations. To deal with these issues, we propose a Multi-Period Projection-Aware Deep Neural Network (MPA-DNN) that incorporates a projection layer for multi-period dispatch into the network. By doing so, our model enforces physical feasibility through the projection, enabling end-to-end learning of constraint-compliant dispatch trajectories without relying on labeled data. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves near-optimal performance while strictly satisfying all constraints in varying load conditions.</description>

      <title>3C Resources Joint Allocation for Time-Deterministic Remote Sensing Image Backhaul in the Space-Ground Integrated Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-Earth-orbit (LEO) satellites assist observation satellites (OSs) to compress and backhaul more time-determined images (TDI) has become a new paradigm, which is used to enhance the timeout caused by the limited computing resources of OSs. However, how to capture the time-varying and dynamic characteristics of multi-dimensional resources is challenging for efficient collaborative scheduling. Motivated by this factor, we design a highly succinct multi-dimensional resource time-expanded graph (MDR-TEG) modell. Specifically, by employing a slots division mechanism and introducing an external virtual node, the time-varying communication, caching, and computing (3C) resources are depicted in low complexity by the link weights within, between, and outside the slots. Based on the MDR-TEG, the maximizing successful transmission ratio of TDI (MSTR-TDI) is modeled as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem. Which further relaxed decomposed into two tractable sub-problems: maximizing the successful transmission rate of images (MSTRI) and ensuring the timeliness problem (ETP). Subsequently, an efficient subgradient of relaxation computing constraint (SRCC) algorithm is proposed. The upper and lower bounds of MSTR-TDI are obtained by solving the two subproblems and the dual problem (DP), and the direction of the next iteration is obtained by feedback. Furthermore, arranging the sending sequences of images to improve the quality of the solution. The approximate optimal solution of MSTR-TDI is eventually obtained through repeated iterations. The simulation results verify the superiority of the proposed MDR-TEG model and the effectiveness of the SRCC.</description>

      <title>Grid-forming Control of Converter Infinite Bus System: Modeling by Data-driven Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores data-driven modeling techniques to capture the dynamics of a grid-forming converter-based infinite bus system, critical for renewable-integrated power grids. Using sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics and deep symbolic regression, models were generated from synthetic data simulating key disturbances in active power, reactive power, and voltage references. Deep symbolic regression demonstrated more accuracy in capturing complex system dynamics, though it required substantially more computational time than sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics. These findings suggest that while deep symbolic regression offers high fidelity, sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics provides a more computationally efficient approach, balancing accuracy and runtime for real-time grid applications.</description>

      <title>Critical States Identiffcation in Power System via Lattice Partition and Its Application in Reliability Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the increasing complexity of power systems,accurately identifying critical states (the states corresponding to minimal cut sets) and assessing system reliability have become crucial tasks. In this paper, a mathematical lattice structure is employed to represent and partition the state space of power system. Based on this structure, a novel recursive method is proposed to efffciently identify critical states by leveraging lattice partitioning and Optimal Power Flow(OPF) calculations. This method not only enables the extension of failure system states,but also calculates the upper and lower bounds of the Loss of Load Probability (LOLP) in a progressively converging manner. Compared to traditional reliability assessment methods such as State Enumeration (SE) and Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS), this approach offers greater accuracy and efffciency. Experiments conducted on the RBTS and RTS79 systems demonstrate that the proposed method accurately identiffes all critical states up to a preset order, which are high-risk states. The contribution of these critical states to LOLP highlights their signiffcance in the system. Moreover, the proposed method achieves the analytical value with signiffcantly fewer OPF calculations in RBTS system, reaching acceptable precision of LOLP up to 100 times faster than SE in both the RBTS and RTS systems.</description>

      <title>Robust reset control design for piezo-actuated nano-positioner in presence of hysteresis nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a robust nonlinear control scheme is designed for the motion control of a class of piezo-actuated nano-positioning systems using frequency-domain analysis. The hysteresis, the nonlinearity in the piezoelectric material, degrades the precision in tracking references with high frequency contents and different travel ranges. The hysteresis compensation by the inverse model, as the state-of-the-art solution, is not reliable alone. Therefore, a control framework with robustness against the remaining nonlinearity is needed. It is shown that there is an unavoidable limitation in robust linear control design to improve the performance. A robust control methodology based on a complex-order element is established to relax the limitation. Then, a constant-in-gain-lead-in-phase (CgLp) reset controller is utilized to realize the complex-order control. The control design is based on the sinusoidal input describing function (SIDF) and the higher-order SIDF (HOSIDF) tools. A constrained optimization problem is provided to tune the control parameters. The achieved improvements by the CgLp control is validated by the simulation.</description>

      <title>When to Reason: Semantic Router for vLLM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate substantial accuracy gains when augmented with reasoning modes such as chain-of-thought and inference-time scaling. However, reasoning also incurs significant costs in inference latency and token usage, with environmental and financial impacts, which are unnecessary for many simple prompts. We present a semantic router that classifies queries based on their reasoning requirements and selectively applies reasoning only when beneficial. Our approach achieves a 10.2 percentage point improvement in accuracy on the MMLU-Pro benchmark while reducing response latency by 47.1% and token consumption by 48.5% compared to direct inference with vLLM. These results demonstrate that semantic routing offers an effective mechanism for striking a balance between accuracy and efficiency in open-source LLM serving systems</description>

      <title>Whole Body Model Predictive Control for Spin-Aware Quadrupedal Table Tennis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Developing table tennis robots that mirror human speed, accuracy, and ability to predict and respond to the full range of ball spins remains a significant challenge for legged robots. To demonstrate these capabilities we present a system to play dynamic table tennis for quadrupedal robots that integrates high speed perception, trajectory prediction, and agile control. Our system uses external cameras for high-speed ball localization, physical models with learned residuals to infer spin and predict trajectories, and a novel model predictive control (MPC) formulation for agile full-body control. Notably, a continuous set of stroke strategies emerge automatically from different ball return objectives using this control paradigm. We demonstrate our system in the real world on a Spot quadruped, evaluate accuracy of each system component, and exhibit coordination through the system's ability to aim and return balls with varying spin types. As a further demonstration, the system is able to rally with human players.</description>

      <title>Optimal Control with Lyapunov Stability Guarantees for Space Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the infinite horizon optimal control problem (OCP) for space applications characterized by nonlinear dynamics. The proposed approach divides the problem into a finite horizon OCP with a regularized terminal cost, guiding the system towards a terminal set, and an infinite horizon linear regulation phase within this set. This strategy guarantees global asymptotic stability under specific assumptions. Our method maintains the system's fully nonlinear dynamics until it reaches the terminal set, where the system dynamics is linearized. As the terminal set converges to the origin, the difference in optimal cost incurred reduces to zero, guaranteeing an efficient and stable solution. The approach is tested through simulations on three problems: spacecraft attitude control, rendezvous maneuver, and soft landing. In spacecraft attitude control, we focus on achieving precise orientation and stabilization. For rendezvous maneuvers, we address the navigation of a chaser to meet a target spacecraft. For the soft landing problem, we ensure a controlled descent and touchdown on a planetary surface. We provide numerical results confirming the effectiveness of the proposed method in managing these nonlinear dynamics problems, offering robust solutions essential for successful space missions.</description>

      <title>Observation Matrix Design for Densifying MIMO Channel Estimation via 2D Ice Filling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, densifying multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) has attracted much attention from the communication community. Thanks to the subwavelength antenna spacing, the strong correlations among densifying antennas provide sufficient prior knowledge about channel state information (CSI). This inspires the careful design of observation matrices (e.g., transmit precoders and receive combiners), that exploits the CSI prior knowledge, to boost channel estimation performance. Aligned with this vision, this work proposes to jointly design the combiners and precoders by maximizing the mutual information between the received pilots and densifying MIMO channels. A two-dimensional ice-filling (2DIF) algorithm is proposed to efficiently accomplish this objective. The algorithm is motivated by the fact that the eigenspace of MIMO channel covariance can be decoupled into two sub-eigenspaces, which are associated with the correlations of transmitter antennas and receiver antennas, respectively. By properly setting the precoder and the combiner as the eigenvectors from these two sub-eigenspaces, the 2DIF promises to generate near-optimal observation matrices. Moreover, we further extend the 2DIF method to the popular hybrid combining systems, where a two-stage 2DIF (TS-2DIF) algorithm is developed to handle the analog combining circuits realized by phase shifters. Simulation results demonstrate that, compared to the state-of-the-art schemes, the proposed 2DIF and TS-2DIF methods can achieve superior channel estimation accuracy.</description>

      <title>A pilot cohort study of a microfluidic-based point-of-care bilirubin measurement system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Objective The concentration of bilirubin in blood or serum is useful for assessing liver function as well as monitoring treatment. This study evaluates the clinical performance of a novel point-of-care (PoC) device for the detection of bilirubin in serum. The PoC device incorporates an integrated miniature optoelectronic sensing module and a microfluidic test cartridge.
  Methods Patients' serum total bilirubin concentrations, ranging from 2 {\mu}mol/L to 480 {\mu}mol/L, were measured using the PoC device and the standard laboratory method (n=20). Bland-Altman analysis and regression analysis using Passing-Bablok method were used to benchmark the PoC device against the standard laboratory measurements. The diagnostic capability of the PoC device in categorising the serum samples within clinically relevant bilirubin concentration thresholds of 200, 300, and 450 {\mu}mol/L was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis.
  Results The mean difference between the PoC device and the standard laboratory method was -5.6 {\mu}mol/L, with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of -45.1 {\mu}mol/L to 33.9 {\mu}mol/L. The coefficient of determination (R2) was 0.986. The PoC device achieved a detection sensitivity of 90% and specificity of 97% in categorising bilirubin concentrations within bands used in clinical decision-making.
  Conclusions This study demonstrates that the proposed PoC device is capable of measuring bilirubin levels in patient samples with clinically acceptable accuracy.</description>

      <title>Direct Data-Driven Predictive Control for a Three-dimensional Cable-Driven Soft Robotic Arm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Soft robots offer significant advantages in safety and adaptability, yet achieving precise and dynamic control remains a major challenge due to their inherently complex and nonlinear dynamics. Recently, Data-enabled Predictive Control (DeePC) has emerged as a promising model-free approach that bypasses explicit system identification by directly leveraging input-output data. While DeePC has shown success in other domains, its application to soft robots remains underexplored, particularly for three-dimensional (3D) soft robotic systems. This paper addresses this gap by developing and experimentally validating an effective DeePC framework on a 3D, cable-driven soft arm. Specifically, we design and fabricate a soft robotic arm with a thick tubing backbone for stability, a dense silicone body with large cavities for strength and flexibility, and rigid endcaps for secure termination. Using this platform, we implement DeePC with singular value decomposition (SVD)-based dimension reduction for two key control tasks: fixed-point regulation and trajectory tracking in 3D space. Comparative experiments with a baseline model-based controller demonstrate DeePC's superior accuracy, robustness, and adaptability, highlighting its potential as a practical solution for dynamic control of soft robots.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.09013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advances in the control of autonomous systems have accompanied an expansion in the potential applications for autonomous robotic systems. The success of applications involving humans depends on the quality of interaction between the autonomous system and the human supervisor, which is particularly affected by the degree of trust that the supervisor places in the autonomous system. Absent from the literature are models of supervisor trust dynamics that can accommodate asymmetric responses to autonomous system performance and the intermittent nature of supervisor-autonomous system communication. This paper focuses on formulating an estimated model of supervisor trust that incorporates both of these features by employing a switched linear system structure with event-triggered sampling of the model input and output. Trust response data collected in a user study with 51 participants were then used identify parameters for a switched linear model-based observer of supervisor trust.</description>

      <title>Task-Level Insights from Eigenvalues across Sequence Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.09379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although softmax attention drives state-of-the-art performance for sequence models, its quadratic complexity limits scalability, motivating linear alternatives such as state space models (SSMs). While these alternatives improve efficiency, their fundamental differences in information processing remain poorly understood. In this work, we leverage the recently proposed dynamical systems framework to represent softmax, norm and linear attention as dynamical systems, enabling a structured comparison with SSMs by analyzing their respective eigenvalue spectra. Since eigenvalues capture essential aspects of dynamical system behavior, we conduct an extensive empirical analysis across diverse sequence models and benchmarks. We first show that eigenvalues influence essential aspects of memory and long-range dependency modeling, revealing spectral signatures that align with task requirements. Building on these insights, we then investigate how architectural modifications in sequence models impact both eigenvalue spectra and task performance. This correspondence further strengthens the position of eigenvalue analysis as a principled metric for interpreting, understanding, and ultimately improving the capabilities of sequence models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.09439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming power electronics, with AI-related publications in IEEE Power Electronics Society selected journals increasing more than fourfold from 2020 to 2025. However, the ethical dimensions of this transformation have received limited attention. This article underscores the urgent need for an ethical framework to guide responsible AI integration in power electronics, not only to prevent AI-related incidents but also to comply with legal and regulatory responsibilities. In this context, this article identifies four core pillars of AI ethics in power electronics: Security &amp; Safety, Explainability &amp; Transparency, Energy Sustainability, and Evolving Roles of Engineers. Each pillar is supported by practical and actionable insights to ensure that ethical principles are embedded in algorithm design, system deployment, and workforce development. The authors advocate for power electronics engineers to lead the ethical discourse, given their deep technical understanding of both AI systems and power conversion technologies. The paper concludes by calling on the IEEE Power Electronics Society to spearhead the establishment of ethical standards and best practices that ensure AI innovations are not only technically advanced but also trustworthy, safe, and sustainable.</description>

      <title>Observability for Nonlinear Systems: Connecting Variational Dynamics, Lyapunov Exponents, and Empirical Gramians</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14711v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Observability quantification is a key problem in dynamic network sciences. While it has been thoroughly studied for linear systems, observability quantification for nonlinear networks is less intuitive and more cumbersome. One common approach to quantify observability for nonlinear systems is via the Empirical Gramian (Empr-Gram) -- a generalized form of the Gramian of linear systems. In this paper, we produce three new results. First, we establish that a variational form of discrete-time autonomous nonlinear systems yields a so-called Variational Gramian (Var-Gram) that is equivalent to the classic Empr-Gram; the former being easier to compute than the latter. Via Lyapunov exponents derived from Lyapunov's direct method, the paper's second result derives connections between existing observability measures and Var-Gram. The third result demonstrates the applicability of these new notions for sensor selection/placement in nonlinear systems. Numerical case studies demonstrate these three developments and their merits.</description>

      <title>Coordinated Control of Deformation and Flight for Morphing Aircraft via Meta-Learning and Coupled State-Dependent Riccati Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05102v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, the coordinated control problem of deformation and flight for morphing aircraft (MA) is studied by using meta-learning (ML) and coupled state-dependent Riccati equations (CSDREs). Our method is built on two principal observations that dynamic models of MA under varying morphing conditions share a morphing condition independent representation function and that the specific morphing condition part lies in a set of linear coefficients. To that end, the domain adversarially invariant meta-learning (DAIML) is employed to learn the shared representation with offline flight data. Based on the learned representation function, the coordinated control of the deformation and flight for MA is formulated as a non-cooperative differential game. The state-dependent feedback control solutions can be derived by addressing a pair of CSDREs. For this purpose, Lyapunov iterations are extended to obtain the positive semidefinite (definite) stabilizing solutions of the CSDREs, and the convergence proof of the proposed algorithm is provided. Finally, a simulation study is carried out to validate the efficacy of the developed coordinated game control strategies.</description>

      <title>A view on learning robust goal-conditioned value functions: Interplay between RL and MPC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06996v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) and model predictive control (MPC) offer a wealth of distinct approaches for automatic decision-making under uncertainty. Given the impact both fields have had independently across numerous domains, there is growing interest in combining the general-purpose learning capability of RL with the safety and robustness features of MPC. To this end, this paper presents a tutorial-style treatment of RL and MPC, treating them as alternative approaches to solving Markov decision processes. In our formulation, RL aims to learn a global value function through offline exploration in an uncertain environment, whereas MPC constructs a local value function through online optimization. This local-global perspective suggests new ways to design policies that combine robustness and goal-conditioned learning. Robustness is incorporated into the RL and MPC pipelines through a scenario-based approach. Goal-conditioned learning aims to alleviate the burden of engineering a reward function for RL. Combining the two leads to a single policy that unites a robust, high-level RL terminal value function with short-term, scenario-based MPC planning for reliable constraint satisfaction. This approach leverages the benefits of both RL and MPC, the effectiveness of which is demonstrated on classical control benchmarks.</description>

Abstract: Vehicle suspension is important for passengers to travel comfortably and to be less exposed to effects such as vibration and shock. A good suspension system increases the road holding of vehicles, allows them to take turns safely, and reduces the risk of traffic accidents. A passive suspension system is the most widely used suspension system in vehicles due to its simple structure and low cost. Passive suspension systems do not have an actuator and therefore do not have a controller. Active suspension systems have an actuator and a controller. Although their structures are more complex and costly, they are safer. PID controller is widely used in active suspension systems due to its simple structure, reasonable cost, and easy adjustment of coefficients. In this study, a more robust LQR-controlled active suspension was designed than a passive suspension and a PID-controlled active suspension. Robustness analyses were performed for passive suspension, PID-controlled active suspension, and LQR-controlled active suspension. Suspension travel, sprung mass acceleration, and sprung mass motion simulations were performed for all three suspensions under road disturbance, under simultaneous road disturbance and parameter uncertainty and under road disturbance with white noise. A comparative analysis was performed by obtaining the rise time, overshoot, and settling time data of the suspensions under different conditions. It was observed that the LQR-controlled active suspension showed the fastest rise time, the least overshoot and had the shortest settling time. In this case, it was proven that the LQR controlled active suspension provided a more comfortable and safe ride compared to the other two suspension systems.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Analysis and Control of Epidemic Spreading over Networks using Dissipativity and Mesh Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24665v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Analyzing and controlling spreading processes are challenging problems due to the involved non-linear node (subsystem) dynamics, unknown disturbances, complex interconnections, and the large-scale and multi-level nature of the problems. The dissipativity concept provides a practical framework for addressing such concerns, thanks to the energy-based representation it offers for subsystems and the compositional properties it provides for the analysis and control of interconnected (networked) systems comprised of such subsystems. Therefore, in this paper, we utilize the dissipativity concept to analyze and control a spreading process that occurs over a hierarchy of nodes, groups, and a network (i.e., a spreading network). We start by generalizing several existing results on dissipativity-based topology design for networked systems. Next, we model the considered spreading network as a networked system and establish the dissipativity properties of its nodes. The generalized topology design method is then applied at multiple levels of the considered spreading network to formulate its analysis and control problems as Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) problems. We identify and enforce localized necessary conditions to support the feasibility of the LMI problem solved at each subsequent hierarchical level of the spreading network. Consequently, the proposed method does not involve iterative multi-level optimization stages that are computationally inefficient. The proposed control solution ensures that the spreading network is not only stable but also dissipative and mesh-stable. Compared to conventional methods, such as threshold pruning and high-degree edge removal, our approach offers superior performance in terms of infection containment, control efficiency, and disturbance robustness. Extensive numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique.</description>

      <title>Learning a Shape-adaptive Assist-as-needed Rehabilitation Policy from Therapist-informed Input</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04666v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Therapist-in-the-loop robotic rehabilitation has shown great promise in enhancing rehabilitation outcomes by integrating the strengths of therapists and robotic systems. However, its broader adoption remains limited due to insufficient safe interaction and limited adaptation capability. This article proposes a novel telerobotics-mediated framework that enables therapists to intuitively and safely deliver assist-as-needed~(AAN) therapy based on two primary contributions. First, our framework encodes the therapist-informed corrective force into via-points in a latent space, allowing the therapist to provide only minimal assistance while encouraging patient maintaining own motion preferences. Second, a shape-adaptive ANN rehabilitation policy is learned to partially and progressively deform the reference trajectory for movement therapy based on encoded patient motion preferences and therapist-informed via-points. The effectiveness of the proposed shape-adaptive AAN strategy was validated on a telerobotic rehabilitation system using two representative tasks. The results demonstrate its practicality for remote AAN therapy and its superiority over two state-of-the-art methods in reducing corrective force and improving movement smoothness.</description>

      <title>Resilient Multi-Dimensional Consensus and Distributed Optimization against Agent-Based and Denial-of-Service Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06835v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the resilient multi-dimensional consensus and distributed optimization problems of multi-agent systems (MASs) in the presence of both agent-based and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. The considered agent-based attacks can cover malicious, Byzantine, and stubborn agents. The links between agents in the network can be blocked by DoS attacks, which may lead the digraph to be time-varying and even disconnected. The objective is to ensure that the remaining benign agents achieve consensus. To this end, an "auxiliary point"-based resilient control algorithm is proposed for MASs. Under the proposed algorithm, each healthy agent constructs a "safe kernel" utilizing the states of its in-neighbors and updates its state toward a specific point within this kernel at each iteration. If an agent cannot receive its neighbors' states owing to DoS attacks, it will use the states received immediately before the DoS period. Moreover, a resilient multi-dimensional distributed optimization (RMDO) algorithm is also proposed. Theoretical proofs and numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.</description>

      <title>Decentralized CBF-based Safety Filters for Collision Avoidance of Cooperative Missile Systems with Input Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06846v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a decentralized safety filter for collision avoidance in multi-agent aerospace interception scenarios. The approach leverages robust control barrier functions (RCBFs) to guarantee forward invariance of safety sets under bounded inputs and high-relative-degree dynamics. Each effector executes its nominal cooperative guidance command, while a local quadratic program (QP) modifies the input only when necessary. Event-triggered activation based on range and zero-effort miss (ZEM) criteria ensures scalability by restricting active constraints to relevant neighbors. To resolve feasibility issues from simultaneous constraints, a slack-variable relaxation scheme is introduced that prioritizes critical agents in a Pareto-optimal manner. Simulation results in many-on-many interception scenarios demonstrate that the proposed framework maintains collision-free operation with minimal deviation from nominal guidance, providing a computationally efficient and scalable solution for safety-critical multi-agent aerospace systems.</description>

      <title>Techno-economic analysis of self-sustainable thermophotovoltaic systems for grid-scale energy generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07338v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To facilitate the widespread adoption of renewable energy, dispatchable, zero-emission power sources are essential for grid stability. This work performs a comprehensive techno-economic analysis of a self-sustainable thermophotovoltaic (TPV) system, an architecture that integrates solar charging to function as a standalone power generation asset. Using theory-based models for conventional air-bridge InGaAs and Si diode cells, our analysis reveals that while the system is not currently competitive from a pure levelized of storage cost (LCOS) perspective due to the high capital expenditure for thermal battery materials, its primary value lies in its competitive levelized cost of electricity (LCOE), which is comparable to that of conventional dispatchable generators such as gas turbines. Furthermore, we show that a full Si-based TPV system, utilizing a 50-{\mu}m-thick air-bridge cell for enhanced photon utilization, can also achieve an LCOE that is competitive with such conventional power sources at scales exceeding the gigawatt-hour level, despite its lower conversion efficiency relative to its InGaAs counterpart. This highlights a practical engineering pathway for leveraging the immense manufacturing scalability of Si, offering a lower-risk route to deployment compared to III-V materials. Ultimately, this work establishes the self-sustainable TPV architecture as a compelling pathway toward providing grid-scale, on-demand, zero-emission power.</description>

      <title>A Control Allocation Algorithm for Hypersonic Glide Vehicles with Input Limitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08275v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hypersonic glide vehicles (HGVs) operate in challenging flight regimes characterized by strong nonlinearities in actuation and stringent physical constraints. These include state-dependent actuator limitations, asymmetric control bounds, and thermal loads that vary with maneuvering conditions. This paper introduces an iterative control allocation method to address these challenges in real time. The proposed algorithm searches for control inputs that achieve the desired moment commands while respecting constraints on input magnitude and rate. For slender HGV configurations, thermal loads and drag generation are strongly correlated-lower drag typically results in reduced surface heating. By embedding drag-sensitive soft constraints, the method improves energy efficiency and implicitly reduces surface temperatures, lowering the vehicle's infrared signature. These features are particularly advantageous for long-range military operations that require low observability. The approach is demonstrated using the DLR's Generic Hypersonic Glide Vehicle 2 (GHGV-2) simulation model. The results confirm the method's effectiveness in maintaining control authority under realistic, constrained flight conditions.</description>

      <title>SwarmGPT: Combining Large Language Models with Safe Motion Planning for Drone Swarm Choreography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08428v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Drone swarm performances -- synchronized, expressive aerial displays set to music -- have emerged as a captivating application of modern robotics. Yet designing smooth, safe choreographies remains a complex task requiring expert knowledge. We present SwarmGPT, a language-based choreographer that leverages the reasoning power of large language models (LLMs) to streamline drone performance design. The LLM is augmented by a safety filter that ensures deployability by making minimal corrections when safety or feasibility constraints are violated. By decoupling high-level choreographic design from low-level motion planning, our system enables non-experts to iteratively refine choreographies using natural language without worrying about collisions or actuator limits. We validate our approach through simulations with swarms up to 200 drones and real-world experiments with up to 20 drones performing choreographies to diverse types of songs, demonstrating scalable, synchronized, and safe performances. Beyond entertainment, this work offers a blueprint for integrating foundation models into safety-critical swarm robotics applications.</description>

      <title>A Real-Time System for Scheduling and Managing UAV Delivery in Urban Areas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11590v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As urban logistics demand continues to grow, UAV delivery has become a key solution to improve delivery efficiency, reduce traffic congestion, and lower logistics costs. However, to fully leverage the potential of UAV delivery networks, efficient swarm scheduling and management are crucial. In this paper, we propose a real-time scheduling and management system based on the ``Airport-Unloading Station" model, aiming to bridge the gap between high-level scheduling algorithms and low-level execution systems. This system, acting as middleware, accurately translates the requirements from the scheduling layer into specific execution instructions, ensuring that the scheduling algorithms perform effectively in real-world environments. Additionally, we implement three collaborative scheduling schemes involving autonomous ground vehicles (AGVs), unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and ground staff to further optimize overall delivery efficiency. Through extensive experiments, this study demonstrates the rationality and feasibility of the proposed management system, providing practical solution for the commercial application of UAVs delivery in urban.

      <title>A Digital Twin for Diesel Engines: Operator-infused Physics-Informed Neural Networks with Transfer Learning for Engine Health Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11967v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Improving diesel engine efficiency, reducing emissions, and enabling robust health monitoring have been critical research topics in engine modelling. While recent advancements in the use of neural networks for system monitoring have shown promising results, such methods often focus on component-level analysis, lack generalizability, and physical interpretability. In this study, we propose a novel hybrid framework that combines physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) with deep operator networks (DeepONet) to enable accurate and computationally efficient parameter identification in mean-value diesel engine models. Our method leverages physics-based system knowledge in combination with data-driven training of neural networks to enhance model applicability. Incorporating offline-trained DeepONets to predict actuator dynamics significantly lowers the online computation cost when compared to the existing PINN framework. To address the re-training burden typical of PINNs under varying input conditions, we propose two transfer learning (TL) strategies: (i) a multi-stage TL scheme offering better runtime efficiency than full online training of the PINN model and (ii) a few-shot TL scheme that freezes a shared multi-head network body and computes physics-based derivatives required for model training outside the training loop. The second strategy offers a computationally inexpensive and physics-based approach for predicting engine dynamics and parameter identification, offering computational efficiency over the existing PINN framework. Compared to existing health monitoring methods, our framework combines the interpretability of physics-based models with the flexibility of deep learning, offering substantial gains in generalization, accuracy, and deployment efficiency for diesel engine diagnostics.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Feedback Control for Global Navigation with Locally Optimal Obstacle Avoidance in n-Dimensional Spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20320v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a hybrid feedback control framework for autonomous robot navigation in n-dimensional Euclidean spaces cluttered with spherical obstacles. The proposed approach ensures safe and global navigation towards a target location by dynamically switching between two operational modes: motion-to-destination and locally optimal obstacle-avoidance. It produces continuous velocity inputs, ensures collision-free trajectories and generates locally optimal obstacle avoidance maneuvers. Unlike existing methods, the proposed framework is compatible with range sensors, enabling navigation in both a priori known and unknown environments. Extensive simulations in 2D and 3D settings, complemented by experimental validation on a TurtleBot 4 platform, confirm the efficacy and robustness of the approach. Our results demonstrate shorter paths and smoother trajectories compared to state-of-the-art methods, while maintaining computational efficiency and real-world feasibility.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17589v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper extends first-order motion planners to robots governed by second-order dynamics. Two control schemes are proposed based on the knowledge of a scalar function whose negative gradient aligns with a given first-order motion planner. When such a function is known, the first-order motion planner is combined with a damping velocity vector with a dynamic gain to extend the safety and convergence guarantees of the first-order motion planner to second-order systems. If no such function is available, we propose an alternative control scheme ensuring that the error between the robot's velocity and the first-order motion planner converges to zero. The theoretical developments are supported by simulation results demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.</description>

      <title>Safe Autonomous Environmental Contact for Soft Robots using Control Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14755v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Robots built from soft materials will inherently apply lower environmental forces than their rigid counterparts, and therefore may be more suitable in sensitive settings with unintended contact. However, these robots' applied forces result from both their design and their control system in closed-loop, and therefore, ensuring bounds on these forces requires controller synthesis for safety as well. This article introduces the first feedback controller for a soft manipulator that formally meets a safety specification with respect to environmental contact. In our proof-of-concept setting, the robot's environment has known geometry and is deformable with a known elastic modulus. Our approach maps a bound on applied forces to a safe set of positions of the robot's tip via predicted deformations of the environment. Then, a quadratic program with Control Barrier Functions in its constraints is used to supervise a nominal feedback signal, verifiably maintaining the robot's tip within this safe set. Hardware experiments on a multi-segment soft pneumatic robot demonstrate that the proposed framework successfully maintains a positive safety margin. This framework represents a fundamental shift in perspective on control and safety for soft robots, implementing a formally verifiable logic specification on their pose and contact forces.</description>

      <title>Safe and Optimal N-Spacecraft Swarm Reconfiguration in Non-Keplerian Cislunar Orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20386v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel fuel-optimal guidance and control methodology for spacecraft swarm reconfiguration in Restricted Multi-Body Problems (RMBPs) with a guarantee of passive safety, maintaining miss distance even under abrupt loss of control authority. A new set of constraints exploits a quasi-periodic structure of RMBPs to guarantee passive safety. Particularly, the condition for passive safety is expressed as simple geometric constraints by solving optimal control in Local Toroidal Coordinates, which is based on a local eigenspace of a quasi-periodic motion around the corresponding periodic orbit. The proposed formulation enables a significant simplification of problem structure, which is applicable to large-scale swarm reconfiguration in cislunar orbits. The method is demonstrated in the Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem, the Elliptic Restricted Three-Body Problem, and the Bi-Circular Restricted Four-Body Problem. Furthermore, the optimized control profiles are validated in the full-ephemeris dynamics model. By extending and generalizing well-known concepts of relative orbital elements within the restricted two-body problem to the three- and four-body problems, this paper lays the foundation for practical control schemes of relative motion in cislunar space.</description>

Abstract: Differential sensitivity techniques originally developed to study the robustness of energy landscape controllers are generalized to the important case of closed quantum systems subject to continuously varying controls. Vanishing sensitivity to parameter variation is shown to coincide with perfect fidelity, as was the case for time-invariant controls. Upper bounds on the magnitude of the differential sensitivity to any parameter variation are derived based simply on knowledge of the system Hamiltonian and the maximum size of the control inputs.</description>

      <title>Direction Estimation of Sound Sources Using Microphone Arrays and Signal Strength</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03466</link>

Abstract: Sound-tracking refers to the process of determining the direction from which a sound originates, making it a fundamental component of sound source localization. This capability is essential in a variety of applications, including security systems, acoustic monitoring, and speaker tracking, where accurately identifying the direction of a sound source enables real-time responses, efficient resource allocation, and improved situational awareness. While sound-tracking is closely related to localization, it specifically focuses on identifying the direction of the sound source rather than estimating its exact position in space. Despite its utility, sound-tracking systems face several challenges, such as maintaining directional accuracy and precision, along with the need for sophisticated hardware configurations and complex signal processing algorithms. This paper presents a sound-tracking method using three electret microphones. We estimate the direction of a sound source using a lightweight method that analyzes signals from three strategically placed microphones. By comparing the average power of the received signals, the system infers the most probable direction of the sound. The results indicate that the power level from each microphone effectively determines the sound source direction. Our system employs a straightforward and cost-effective hardware design, ensuring simplicity and affordability in implementation. It achieves a localization error of less than 6 degrees and a precision of 98%. Additionally, its effortless integration with various systems makes it versatile and adaptable. Consequently, this technique presents a robust and reliable solution for sound-tracking and localization, with potential applications spanning diverse domains such as security systems, smart homes, and acoustic monitoring.</description>

      <title>Transferable Parasitic Estimation via Graph Contrastive Learning and Label Rebalancing in AMS Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06535v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph representation learning on Analog-Mixed Signal (AMS) circuits is crucial for various downstream tasks, e.g., parasitic estimation. However, the scarcity of design data, the unbalanced distribution of labels, and the inherent diversity of circuit implementations pose significant challenges to learning robust and transferable circuit representations. To address these limitations, we propose CircuitGCL, a novel graph contrastive learning framework that integrates representation scattering and label rebalancing to enhance transferability across heterogeneous circuit graphs. CircuitGCL employs a self-supervised strategy to learn topology-invariant node embeddings through hyperspherical representation scattering, eliminating dependency on large-scale data. Simultaneously, balanced mean squared error (BMSE) and balanced softmax cross-entropy (BSCE) losses are introduced to mitigate label distribution disparities between circuits, enabling robust and transferable parasitic estimation. Evaluated on parasitic capacitance estimation (edge-level task) and ground capacitance classification (node-level task) across TSMC 28nm AMS designs, CircuitGCL outperforms all state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, with the $R^2$ improvement of $33.64\% \sim 44.20\%$ for edge regression and F1-score gain of $0.9\times \sim 2.1\times$ for node classification. Our code is available at https://github.com/ShenShan123/CircuitGCL.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Detection of Lithium Plating in Lithium-ion Cells: A Gaussian Process Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26234v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lithium plating during fast charging is a critical degradation mechanism that accelerates capacity fade and can trigger catastrophic safety failures. Recent work has identified a distinctive dQ/dV peak above 4.0 V as a reliable signature of plating onset; however, conventional methods for computing dQ/dV rely on finite differencing with filtering, which amplifies sensor noise and introduces bias in peak location. In this paper, we propose a Gaussian Process (GP) framework for lithium plating detection by directly modeling the charge-voltage relationship Q(V) as a stochastic process with calibrated uncertainty. Leveraging the property that derivatives of GPs remain GPs, we infer dQ/dV analytically and probabilistically from the posterior, enabling robust detection without ad hoc smoothing. The framework provides three key benefits: (i) noise-aware inference with hyperparameters learned from data, (ii) closed-form derivatives with credible intervals for uncertainty quantification, and (iii) scalability to online variants suitable for embedded BMS. Experimental validation on Li-ion coin cells across a range of C-rates (0.2C-1C) and temperatures (0-40\deg C) demonstrates that the GP-based method reliably detects plating peaks under low-temperature, high-rate charging, while correctly reporting no peaks in baseline cases. The concurrence of GP-identified differential peaks, reduced charge throughput, and capacity fade measured via reference performance tests confirms the method's accuracy and robustness, establishing a practical pathway for real-time lithium plating detection.</description>

      <title>Geometry of Distance Protection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04379v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Distance relays detect faults on transmission lines. They face uncertainty from the fault's location and resistance, as well as the current from the line's remote terminal. In this paper, we aggregate this uncertainty with the Minkowski sum. This allows us to explicitly model the power grid surrounding the relay's line, and in turn accommodate any mix of synchronous machines and inverter-based resources. To make the relay's task easier, inverters can inject perturbations, or auxiliary signals, such as negative-sequence current. We use Farkas' lemma to construct an optimization for designing inverter auxiliary signals.</description>

      <title>Optimization via a Control-Centric Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05455v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optimization plays a central role in intelligent systems and cyber-physical technologies, where speed and reliability of convergence directly impact performance. In control theory, optimization-centric methods are standard: controllers are designed by repeatedly solving optimization problems, as in linear quadratic regulation, $H_\infty$ control, and model predictive control. In contrast, this paper develops a control-centric framework for optimization itself, where algorithms are constructed directly from Lyapunov stability principles rather than being proposed first and analyzed afterward. A key element is the stationarity vector, which encodes first-order optimality conditions and enables Lyapunov-based convergence analysis. By pairing a Lyapunov function with a selectable decay law, we obtain continuous-time dynamics with guaranteed exponential, finite-time, fixed-time, or prescribed-time convergence. Within this framework, we introduce three feedback realizations of increasing restrictiveness: the Hessian-gradient, Newton, and gradient dynamics. Each realization shapes the decay of the stationarity vector to achieve the desired rate. These constructions unify unconstrained optimization, extend naturally to constrained problems via Lyapunov-consistent primal-dual dynamics, and broaden the results for minimax and generalized Nash equilibrium seeking problems beyond exponential stability. The framework provides systematic design tools for optimization algorithms in control and game-theoretic problems.</description>
